comm today is February 5th with yet
another video tutorial and we're going
to focus on designing a front and back
of a business card in Adobe Illustrator
CC so if you're a designer and you
haven't yet had the request to design a
business card you're going to I
personally don't carry them around but
they seem to be popular okay so if
you've never designed one it's not a big
deal it's actually pretty simple I when
it comes to setting up the document you
don't always have to do that depending
on you know what printers you're going
to go through usually they can offer
template files for Adobe Illustrator or
Photoshop but we're going to set it up
from scratch just so you can understand
you know what bleed and trim are and all
that stuff and then we'll do actually
just design a pretty simple one for a
front and back and then tomorrow we will
focus on taking that business card in
Photoshop CC and presenting it in sort
of a cool kind of 3d view and this is of
course kind of a good idea if you're
going to be showcasing your work on a
portfolio site or on your own website or
whatever alright so we're going to go
ahead and get started as always check
out design course comm and subscribe
here on YouTube if you haven't yet all
right let's get started alright so let's
get started here in Adobe Illustrator
we're go to file new
now also before I even do that I we want
to you know if you're using a site like
Vista Print to get your business card
printers or you know who you're going to
get them printed through whether it be a
business card or anything that's print
related check and see if they have a
template file usually they'll have you
know like Photoshop and Adobe
Illustrator or EPS template files for
the business cards or any other type of
print and that way they'll already have
the document that you know they know
they prefer or use or whatever in that
way you don't have to set things up
manually like we're about to do so we're
going to assume you don't
so we'll rename this to business cards
oh my god come on out alright so number
of artboards one that's default 3.5
inches so make sure
you change two inches by two inches
pretty much a standard business card
size and then the bleed by default to
bleed to zero just click up once and
they're all changed to an eighth of an
inch which is 0.125 all right so CMYK
make sure that's there that is by
default usually so we'll hit OK and I'm
just going to go ahead and hit control
one that's a hundred percent view and
I'm going to go up to about three
hundred percent now we need to define I
define some safe zones through either
with our help of some guide so hit
control R to get out a ruler and an
eighth of an inch is see right here is
one inch from zero to one so an eighth
of an inch would be right here same
thing with this portion right here so to
get our guides out so to create a
horizontal we go up top left click drag
put it right there take this leg drag to
the right do it again over here and then
down here so let me do I just kind of
explain what's going on here first you
have the bleed which is all the way out
here it's this red line and what that
means is you know if you have any type
of background that's applied whether it
be a solid color or a pattern you want
it to extend just beyond this bleed area
right here so then you have your kind of
your safe area which is inside of this
line right here does that means if you
have text or whatever and you don't want
to be real close well you put it in here
like you so you have some margins just
so you have a good idea so basically
what's being cut is right around here
the actual the the 3.5 by 2 inches so it
the I I guess you could say the the
rectangle that we're about to create it
doesn't have to go beyond this just
right around it so we'll take the
rectangle tool left click and drag it
right to around that size
alright so we just want white we don't
want to stroke zero and let's get our
layers over here and I'm going to take
this just put it the bottom of the
guides and lock that so we can't really
move it now I'm going to create another
rectangle so it's going to be roughly
around this size kind of half and I'm
going to use just this color over here
alright alright so far so good now what
I want to do is I you need to download
the project files if you kind of want to
follow along with this part I'm going to
use the design course comm symbol so I
pause the video I opened it up this is
what you're presented with and I don't
know why I haven't I let me go ahead and
get that Pathfinder out and merge this
although it's not necessary alright just
copy that and click out of there paste
that in hold shift alt and scale this
thing down alright so when it comes to
business card design generally speaking
you know simple is better so some people
try to stuff so much information you
know it just looks ridiculous
alright so now I'm going to go ahead and
take the type tool and I'm going to type
in design course com
Gary Simon CEO because I'm an important
guy or not and then I we're going to
take this make it white and we are going
to where's a line yeah take this take
all the text and just kind of right
align it up there and I'm going to use a
font called latter or lato I'm not sure
that oh I I'll link that too hopefully I
remember to do that after the video in
the description and change this just to
light I'm going to scale this down a
little bit I will take the design course
comm make that bold alright
and I'm just kind of trying to get a
view this if you hold alt and then use
your scroll wheel you know you can just
zoom up and down and hitting your
spacebar you can move it around okay so
I let's see yeah I think we'll move this
up here and if you want to pull down
another guy just just make sure those
are kind of even with each other yeah
that looks pretty close all right
and I now let's go ahead and put that's
rotating so touchy okay now let's go
ahead and put some text down here I'm
just going to put two bits of
information one will just be like a fake
number
all right and move that over here Lotto
light are lado
I honestly have no clue how to pronounce
that thing all right and then just copy
that and I'm just going to put contact
ooh no contact at design course calm all
right and I'm going to call that it
alright so let's see here now what I
want to do is get these guides out here
where's that last guide hide that now we
want to do is save this so I went ahead
and pause this and saved it as front dot
ai Illustrator and then I'm going to
save this again as back so now we're
going to create a back side to this so
very simple I am going to delete all the
text
we're going to take this thing well
first we're going to just get rid of the
white one take this go all the way now
this will be our background color and
did I delete I deleted that thing the
logo I wanted to keep the logo go back
at the front just copy this paste it in
there and then I kind of just wanted to
do something a little bit abstract in a
sense maybe turn this thing a little bit
okay and then I then what do what do I
want to do okay yeah we'll go ahead
we'll take both of these layers and
we'll go to window Pathfinder
and we'll click on minus front okay so
basically that just makes this center
portion transparent and I should have
left that other layer there no big deal
bring this create another one we'll put
it at the bottom or behind of it behind
it
and then what we want to do is let's see
here come here to gradient we'll double
click on the color and just make it a
little bit darker kind of like that it's
kind of like a watermark basically and
that will serve as the back of our card
okay so let me save that alright so now
we want to do I let's see here let's get
both these things open see if there's
anything else that we kind of want to
change now generally when it comes to
you know say for example this is it this
is what we want to use what you'd want
to do is kind of save two copies of the
front and if you have any text on your
back save two copies watching the same
way but right now there's no text on our
backs everything's kind of converted to
outlines we'll call one copy front and
then one copy front - outline and the
illustrator options are showing up off
screen
okay and then you want to take
everything and go to object path offset
wait what am i doing now control shift -
no sorry about that
slow moment that converts everything to
outlines so that text you can no longer
edit it but that's why we saved no the
front I I that we still have where we
can still make adjustments but the
reason we change this of course to
outlines is because when you send it to
somebody to get printed if they don't
have that font then it's going to it's
going to get all messed up so you have
to convert everything to outlines all
right so I that is the design or these
are the designs of course for our front
in back so tomorrow we're going to use
Adobe Photoshop and I to basically take
the front and back and kind of present
it the front and back design in a cool
kind of perspective 3d sort of
environment so why would you do that I
mean I you know a lot of sites like
Behance net and dribble comm I when
you're trying to showcase your work you
know maybe you're you want to become a
business car desire or some type of like
an identity designer for example I it's
nice to kind of showcase things on your
portfolio and it also helps sell your
your concepts to the clients so we will
do that tomorrow all right so as always
check out design course comm and if you
haven't yet subscribe here on YouTube
and I will see you tomorrow good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
