the project we're going to do here in
this animation stagger for angular so if
i refresh this we'll see what happens
and how this staggering animation takes
place you come in and there we go so we
have two different things taking place
this here is just a hard-coded an array
a list of integrals essentially and
we're applying staggered animation onto
it and by the way this is also using
keyframe animations and then also down
here refresh again you'll see these also
stagger in as well and this is all made
very easy now in angular 4.2 plus to add
staggering animation with the new
stagger method oh but real quick before
we begin make sure you check out my
psych course cetera comm where you're
going to find a bunch of courses on
modern design and development a lot are
free and others you can access for the
cost of buying me like expect each month
that's it
now also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on all right let's get back to it so
whether it's a list you're displaying or
you have certain elements within your
user interface sometimes you want that
ability to animate these elements
through a sequential fashion and so this
is where staggering animations come in
handy so ads of angular 4.2 plus we have
the new animation specific staggered
method that we can use okay so the basic
way it works it allows you to specify a
duration in milliseconds that designates
when each element will begin to animate
so in this tutorial I'm going to walk
you through two of those most common use
cases for applying these Dacor
animations here in angular alright so
first off I'm going to assume that you
already have the prerequisites such as
nodejs and NPM stalled you know you can
always do node - V in your console and
NPM the - V and it should give you
version numbers but the most important
thing after that to have is to angular
command-line interface or the CLI
installed so to check whether or not you
have that it's ng and - V
all right you know where you can just
hit ng and it'll give you a bunch of
information but if it goes unrecognized
or if the version number here is earlier
than what I have what do you want to
make sure is to run npm install at
angular at latest wait sorry
CLI at latest and the global supply to
install at once and so what that will do
is get it installed and up and running
mine's already the latest so I don't
have to run that alright so once you
have the CLI installed as well then
we're going to create a new project so
it's ng new I'm going to call mine
staggering and then we're going to set
the style for the CSS to SAS so s CSS
just because we're going to do very
light some very quick CSS work and I
just prefer to use sass instead of the
regular CSS so I'm just going to pause
here while this goes alright once
finished we're going to CD into it and
then we're going to run npm install
animations at latest you should not have
to do this in angular 2 but since
angular 4 they've moved the animations
library into its own package outside of
core so that's something we also have to
run after that we're going to run ng
serve all right so momentarily this will
start up a listening server on localhost
4200 and we can go there on our browser
real quick and here it is ok so let's go
to our code editor now and I have it
open let's go to our source app and app
module dot ES file we're going to import
their browser animations module up top
right here like that and then also take
our browser animations module name and
add it as an import right there so we'll
save that and next what we want to do
we're going to head on over to our app
component es so we'll assume that this
is the component file that we want to
add
animation - so the very first step is
down here in our export class we're
going to define an array real quick so
it'll be named items type array and in a
constructor and anything inside of here
will get ran once the uploads we're
going to set vista items to an array of
basic items and you're just going to be
strings so off screen I'm just going to
paste in these values there's going to
be three of them hey this is an item
here's another one and this is awesome
you know whatever and then put anything
into these by the way there is a follow
along written tutorial that I'm pretty
much using as a framework for this video
and so I'll link that in the YouTube
description if you're watching on
YouTube so you can just copy and paste
some of this stuff rather than hand
typing it alright after that we're going
to create two classes or methods rather
so push item and we're going to use this
to add to the list of items when a
button is clicked so this two items stop
push and of course the whole purpose of
doing this is so that we can see the
animations that are applied when we add
to our list as well and then also remove
item and we're just going to use this
tight um's dot pop that will simply
remove one of the items based on
whatever is currently there all right so
we'll save that now we're going to go
into our app component HTML file any
control B just get rid of sidebar we're
going to get rid of all this stuff and
inside of here we're going to make a div
ID of container by the way I'm not using
any type of CSS framework so
everything's gonna be custom here just
because this is real simple we're going
to add a on animation trigger called
list animation of course it doesn't
exist yet because we haven't defined
that but we're going to set it to items
dot length so of course items we already
define that and length will get how many
array items are in there inside of here
we're going to put two buttons on click
event we're going to call our push item
class that we just made add item yeah
there we go and then we'll also copy
this real quick paste here we'll call
this one remove item and we'll say
remove item all right
so now this is where we're going to add
our iterable here so we'll just make it
a repeating div ID of list and a
reference that later in CSS I'm going to
use ng for directive and say let item of
items alright so inside of here this is
going to put through interpolation the
item which will give us whatever I
specified or hard-coded in that array
okay so that's it for this part so I of
course if we go back to our browser we
should have a very ugly result right
here so there they are and of course
nothing's animating just yet but before
we get to that part
I wanted to real quickly just give
ourselves some basic styling so it looks
a little bit better so we can better
appreciate the animation when it comes
up so I I'm going to need to refer to
the written part of this tutorial here
and just paste in some stuff so as we
can see again we're using a sass so we
can embed these things inside of
container we're giving the container
just two EMS of padding we have a list
this has padding background color of
this value habla really there's nothing
too crazy going on call we haven't add
that added that yet in here we're going
to add that a little bit later after we
demonstrate the initial stager tutorial
here so let's just save that and one
final thing we're going to style is that
CSS I'm going to reference the body tag
right here and just set the background
colors as like gray padding 4 a.m. and
font-family:arial so now if you save
both of those files and go back real
quickly let's see it looks a lot better
ok so if we add item it all works
remove item doesn't yet work
I will deal with that just in a little
bit okay so let's go ahead back to our
app component TS and what we want to do
is coming down here we need to work on
at the top rather we need to import all
of the animation specific functions that
we want to use from the angular
animations library that we installed so
I'm going to paste that in you see we're
importing the trigger style transition
animate keyframes query and stagger
these two dudes are new right there and
of course from at angular animations so
next is to define our animations which
of course are always defined within the
component decorator so after our style
is URLs property right here we're going
to add one called animations and open it
up in an array like that all right so
the first trigger that we are the first
animation rather that we're going to
define starts off with a trigger and
this is all typical stuff going to give
it a name of list animation which we
already referenced in the template and
then we're going to open this up and in
the second argument now right here is
where we're going to specify a
transition and this is going to go from
any to any state so this is why we
really don't have to specify a state
method and then inside of here in the
second argument we're going to open this
up and this is where our queries go
okay so query is a new method
essentially an angular 4.2 plus so what
this is going to allow us to do is we're
going to type in first query everybody
we're going to define enter so that's
going to say on enter then we're going
to set the style opacity to zero and
then we're also going to pass in in the
third argument of the query method one
called optional we're going to set this
to true as it's false by default
all right so what this does is the fact
that currently trigger list animation is
added to we'll see right here the list
animation is items length so any of
these div IDs of lists that show up
they're going to have a style of opacity
0 set to them that's the purpose of this
guy right here so then we're going to
create another one so query same thing
enter we're going to add stager this
time with a separation between each
element animating of 300 milliseconds
all right real quickly that a pop-up is
starting to become real annoying so I'm
going to go to my settings and just to
uncomment this stuff right here have
that there all right so now hopefully
those little pop-ups gonna show up
alright so inside of here we're going to
add an animate function and this is
going to be for 1 seconds
ease in and then this time we're going
to add a keyframes animation sequence
and then a style opacity will start at 0
transform will start at translate Y
negative 75 pixels and then the offset
is 0 so that means at the very beginning
of this animation sequence we'll add two
more of these this is going to go from
0.5 or from 0 to 0.5 to 1 down here
we'll make this at 0.3 and then this one
and then finally here it's because so
translate why this is saying push it up
75 pixels from its original position
we're going to make it go down 35 pixels
in the second step
and then back to zero so it's going to
come up it's going to come from up like
this and then like that so if you watch
my mouth like that so the go back goes
back up just a bit alright so let's go
ahead and then we have one more query
and this is well you know what let's go
ahead and save it real quickly and we'll
take a look at the actual result in the
browser so refresh this and there you go
so just take a look at that again
awesome
so now let's get remove item working so
to do that we're going to put a comma
here and I just realized just one second
before we want to do that we need to add
our optional true write down in this
query as well and so that is going to go
right here as this is the third argument
of our query right there alright so next
what we want to do is just to save
ourselves some time copy this we're
gonna paste one right here and we're
going to change this to leave right so
this will be applied to when any of
these div list ID elements leave the Dom
alright so for this we're going to leave
the same right here for this this is all
the same as well and we'll just reverse
the order so it's going to go from an
opacity of 1 because that's what state
will be currently in and then this one
down here will be 0 and this up here is
going to be 0 this right here will be 35
pixels just the same and then we'll put
negative 75 pixels right here alright so
let's save that and let's go
back to our project alright let's add an
item let's remove an item and there we
go very very cool
okay so I let's go ahead and focus on
the second portion of the store tutorial
where we're going to add staggering
animations just to UI elements not
necessarily the iterables here that we
just did so of course this could be
anything from headings and subheadings
to graphics or panels of content that
you simply just want to animate in so in
our case we're going to add staggering
animation to three different paragraph
elements so let's go ahead and do that
real quick in our editor so let's go
back here to our HTML file we're going
to create a div we're going to add at
explainer Anam and that's simply
attaching a future trigger name
animation trigger that we're going to
define and then just a div class of call
and then inside of here we're just going
to put a paragraph tag and so I'm going
to simply paste in a blip of content and
then copy/paste this in two more times
alright great so let's save that now
we're going to go back here to our
component file and we're going to create
another trigger after this one alright
so that would be after this last closing
parenthesis and inside of here we define
the trigger of explainer annum for
animation we're going to put in a
transition again of any-to-any
and inside of here with a array this is
where our queries go once again
so it's very we're going to have one
that's very similar to the top one up
here except we're going to make some
slight adjustments so for this one the
opacity will be zero but also we're
going to add transform translate X on a
horizontal negative 40 pixels all right
and this time we don't have to add this
optional true part all right because
they're not going to be removing or
adding any elements there so then query
again now this time it's not going to be
by the way enter I forgot to change that
as well we're just referencing the call
classes the co l classes that are
attached or inner child elements inside
of this div right here so we have the
ability to reference any of these inner
elements without having to attach
animations on to them so of course you
can also reference IDs not just classes
or also tags here and you can even add
an asterisk or a wild-card to say all
elements okay so we're just referencing
anything with the class of call on them
so inside of here we're going to add
stagger 500 milliseconds inside of here
we're going to have animate we'll make
it 800 milliseconds a 1.2 second delay
and this will allow the initial list to
enemy in and then we'll see these
animate and after and then we'll add
some easing so he's out and in style
we'll set the opacity from 0 to 1 and
then transform translate X to the
original position which will be at 0 I
keep on hitting 9 ok and then we add
right here nothing I did have a comma we
don't need that and that is good let's
go ahead and save we'll check it out in
the browser I'll refresh real quick
perfect
exactly as we want it to be I'll refresh
again just so we can see add some items
remove some items awesome stuff alright
so just to show you what happens for
instance if we take this away you'll see
that it won't work at all so we need
that initial query and then we add a
second query with stagger in order to do
what we want
essentially alright so let me get that
back that is it so hopefully you're able
to learn a lot here and you're going to
be able to add a lot of awesome and
hopefully relevant and effective stager
based animations to your angular 4.2
plus projects so make sure you check out
corset row comm of course at corset row
we have a lot of ton of free angular
related tutorials as well as ionic and
free courses and also paid courses and
all my paid courses by the way or their
full project-based courses where you're
going to learn how to build something
tangible like an actual app or a website
that people are going to want to use and
like I said I this like to access these
courses like it's just like buying me a
6-pack or whatever every month alright
so I'll talk to you guys later and look
out for more tutorials especially
animation tutorials based on I these new
animation features because there's a lot
of them now now in 4.2 plus I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
