completed design contests where we try
to figure out something very important
what the hell were they thinking hello
Gary Simon here of design course calm
and welcome to losing winter where we'll
delve into the solace practice of design
crowdsourcing alright so let's go ahead
and get started first just to preface
this I'm a little bit under the weather
so I'm going to try to get through this
without coughing up a lung I have a
cough a bit but anyhow so for our first
contest here we have this winning logo
design for attorney finder pro and this
guy won two hundred and ninety nine
dollars so of course when it comes to
these lovely design contests one of the
most overused bonds I would say is this
and I believe it's called trajan or
trajan pro I and so a lot of these
entries stuck with this especially when
it comes to fields like attorneys or
whatever try to avoid that as much as
possible when you're designing the major
issue here isn't so much the type though
it's this symbol up here and that's
because we have the AFP which is a
letter mark and it's just kind of shoved
up there in attitude to the side and
there's not much I white space between
the elements here we have this glossy
effect here which hits and connects with
this little arch going across here and
you have a lot of different colors going
on so there's a lot of clutter so let's
take a look at the other entries just
take a look at this it's not the
greatest I but it's definitely a big
improvement we still there still
sticking with the same font but I in
terms of the execution of the symbol and
I would say the type itself definitely
better this one even though it's one of
the typical familiar art going through
the letters I still think it's better
just in terms of simplicity especially
looking at the letter mark so if we look
at these three we have the winner over
here and we have to just randomly
selected losers that submitted entries
has the same of the part part of the
same contest and these guys completely
lost when one of them should have
definitely won over this one so again
just pointing out the I the risks of
entering logo design contest because you
do not always win the best design does
not always win so let's check out the
second one this here by the designer one
455 dollars I'm not exactly sure what
this little arm swoop thing is or was
supposed to be but it's really cluttered
we have a lot of different colors going
on here and it's just bad execution in
terms of the symbol here not so much the
type but the symbol is a big issue
especially when we look at some of the
other losers so this one much more
simple is going to use a little bit of
work the padlock and the key but I
definitely better than the original this
one is well part of my favorite I we
look at all three of these side by side
this is the winner and these two were
submitted and they lost so they
completely wasted their time yep let's
check out the third and final one the
major issue with this is the type
although the symbol definitely needs
work because it's not very original we
see so many of these different types of
human I action shot portrayals I guess
you could call them I in this fashion so
it's not very unique i but but yeah the
type the to it issues with the type r
you have this font up here and this bond
down here they're too tightly different
fonts and the issue is the height of the
font so you have this regular font here
in terms of height it's not too squished
or it's not too tall but then you have
this really elongated in terms of height
pond down here and that creates an issue
of clutter so let's take a look at a
couple losers I wish they didn't add
this gradient because it really adds to
the clutter but if you ignore that the
type is definitely better and the symbol
isn't too bad either especially when you
compare it with the winner and then
here's another entry and of course a
another trajan pro font but in terms of
the font and type face execution I and
even the logo logo here even though
there's a kind of overdone definitely
better when we compare these two losers
the winner here this guy won 450 dollars
and that is it once again so yeah I
check out design course com make sure
you subscribe here I'm going to be doing
a few more episodes of these just to I
maybe get to six or seven episodes I
don't want to overdo this too much
because I it's becoming obvious you know
what the intent of the show is and I
just want to get enough content up there
so that people can really realize and
aspiring designers that you really are
just wasting your time when you're
working and submitting to design course
so you know you could do it for fine
maybe but even then you can find other
ways to design and give back to people
because the chances are winning are very
very slim alright so that is it I look
out for the next episode next week and
also either today or tomorrow I will be
announcing I the I believe it's the 18th
design course calm design challenge to
look out for that video all right
