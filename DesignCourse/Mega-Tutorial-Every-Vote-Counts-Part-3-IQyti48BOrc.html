today we're going to do what's called UV
unwrapping of the ballot box portion and
then step it into Adobe Photoshop to
apply a wood texture to it and so check
out design course calm if you haven't
yet and subscribe here on YouTube all
rights get started alright so this is
where we left off from yesterday what we
want to do now is focus on the ballot
box right here so this is going to be a
wooden box and there's an important
distinction to understand if you've if
you need a blender or relatively new and
you never done what's called UV
unwrapping so these objects right here
the toilet they're all comprised of
opposite objects which don't need to be
UV unwrapped because they're all a solid
color or a solid shader and so they
don't need to be no custom design needs
to be applied them so they don't
necessarily have to be what's called UV
unwrapped so when it comes to the box
though because there's going to be a
texture on it a wood texture and a decal
as well we need to do what's called UV
unwrapping and for me when I was
learning it was such a pain and yes I
was so confusing I didn't understand
what the hell is going on so I'm going
to do my best to teach it from a
perspective that you will under a
beginner will understand alright so
basically when it comes to UV unwrapping
all that saying is is it's saying okay
let's deconstruct whatever type of
element or object or 3d object it is
into a flat 2d surface that we can then
take into another application like a
graphic to D application like Adobe
Photoshop or GIMP or whatever and apply
the material or whatever design it is of
the texture the wood or whatever on to
it in the easiest manner in the most
logical manner possible and also so it
will look as natural and real as
possible okay
so there's several different ways to UV
unwrap something and so i'll just show
you a couple of them and there's no
right or wrong way usually whatever the
right or wrong way is is whatever
produces the most logical easy-to-use
result basically so i'm going to go over
here and click on solid and we're going
to right click to select our object now
right now we have two different objects
but i want to join those so we've been
separating objects but now we're going
to join an object's very simple so in
object mode will take both of our
objects holding shift and right click
and then we will hit ctrl J sorry or
command J imac and then it automatically
connect some very very simple okay so
now what we want to do is go to edit
mode so you can only UV unwrap when
you're in edit mode with an object and
if we were to well what right now let's
go ahead and split our view so left
click drag and then we're going to
switch to the uv/image editor this is
what you do every time you try to UV
unwrap something unless of course it's
very simple like a plane you don't
really have to worry about it I which we
are going to do with the plane to make a
floor later but anyhow what we want to
do now is all right so by default this
square right here is usually 1024 x 1024
pixels alright so you always want to
make sure that your UV image size is a
square so if you hit new you'll see that
it's 1024 x 1024 you can name it if you
wish i am not just because i'm lazy and
you can change this to 2048 and that's
going to give you a higher resolution so
it's kind of important you can also go
beyond that even if you wish alright so
i'm just going to do it to 2048 or you
can do multiplication times two times
two very simple leave everything else
the way i currently is and hit ok and
everything changed the black and that's
because you're zoomed up so just use
your scroll wheel to zoom out and now we
can see everything so now if we hit a
for example and then we hit you so you
is the key
that where you access this all the
unwrapping options you see we have
several different options here we have
unwrapped smart UV project cube
projection cylinder you know whatever I
let's just try unwrap see what happens
okay so it unwrapped it but what is this
crap down here I know it's probably a
bunch of stuff up here and usually if
you go into let me drag this over here
if you go into face select mode and
you'll see these don't look like squares
like they're all messed up so let's hit
a and again to select all you can you
can also just re unwrap things as well
so that's what unwrapped produced us
doesn't look good what's smart you be
project was sure I hit okay this looks a
little bit better but still you're not
sure what is where or whatever so if you
were to take this export it and save it
as like a PNG with these UVs intact and
bring into Photoshop you don't know
where what's going on here really so
let's try you again let's try cube
projection not much better cylinder
projection that's terrible spherical
obviously sphere projection is it going
to work and then we have project from
view which exactly is exactly what it
says I whatever our current view is it's
projecting it from that angle and what
we're looking at so if we use our key
board I on the number pad and hit seven
for example we'll see that we're only
see the top and so if we were to hit you
and then project from view we're only
going to get the top view but the
problem with this is is because we
selected all of you know we hit a and we
have everything selected whatever is
designed within this area in Photoshop
will get applied to the right the bottom
you know so it's going to be duplicated
it won't look too natural so what we'll
do here is just select everything on the
tops in the side view on the right left
the front and back and the up and down
all right so very simple what we'll do
now is go ahead and we'll hit we'll
start with the front so
get one zoom up and also when we're
doing this it's important that wherever
you're zoomed up currently that you stay
there and you don't change it I and
you'll see why so what we want to do is
only select everything that we could see
I on the front for this portion so we'll
see that I currently it's unwrapped so
that's on the side it doesn't mean look
right i I'm going to zoom out roughly
right around here and I think it will
also select these faces just like that
and i'm not going to add this portion
simply because it's we're not looking at
it kind of straight up and down or from
the top so I'm just going to select
those four faces in this and then hit
you and project from view then I'm going
to hit G and then just move it over
right around here all right now I'm
going to hit control one to go to the
back view all right so if I turn on this
we're going to be able to see the back
we want to make sure we select that face
hold and then turn it back off all right
and then also hit shift right click to
select these faces so now we have the
back and the top part of this selected
I'm going to hit you oops make sure you
hover over the side you and project from
view G and then just move it over here
then we're going to hit three and this
will give us the right side so just to
remember this is top back and then now
we have the right side select these
faces holding shift and right-clicking
you project from view hit G move it over
here now I hit control 33 to get to left
do the same thing gloating shift you and
project from view
gee put it over here all right so we
have the front and the sides now we have
to worry about the top and the bottom so
hit seven right click and hold shift now
we have these all selected and just
temporarily I'm going to leave it like
this I actually going to I'm going to
hit you a project from view and I'm
going to scale it down a little bit
right around there in the center alright
and then hit control seven to go to the
bottom and let me come over here the
bottom should just be one face just like
that you project from view scale it down
gee kind of put it in the center alright
so now we should have all of the
necessary faces selected so if we hit a
and a again we'll see it looks much more
manageable so what I'll do we can come
over here now we can select and play
where I'm with these and mess around
with these I so this is the front and it
looks smaller just because we only
selected this face and this is the back
looks back and it looks bigger because
we have we rage to that edge up and so
you can select these by hitting a and
then be you can select them just like
you do like in the 3d view hit G let's
move these over a B G a B to select this
portion if we can G now this is the top
view a B and
this is the right I believe and now if
you have things like this that are
overlapping you can I believe that's a
key ctrl L yeah that I think that's it
yeah all right so what I just did there
is if you select a vertex that's a
connected to a general shape or whatever
and this is also applies to 3d I you
select it by right clicking it and then
hit ctrl or command on Mac el sol
control L it'll select off everything
else that's connected to it all right so
G now this what this is right here is
the inside remember we like extruded
this this is the inside we're not going
to really see it but we'll still give it
a texture I so I'm going to right-click
this well I'll go right right click this
first and control l.g you know what I'm
just going to add these on top of each
other because we're not going to see
them really so ctrl L right click
control algae but then at center and
then this I'm not sure yeah this is the
bottom isn't it ok so control l.g price
scale it up it s G and then hit a B
select all these this is the left I
believe Angie now you take everything if
you want G and z or not yeah that's fine
yeah it's just x and y sorry about that
would have been why alright so now it's
ready to go so what we do is go to you
v's export UV layout and then what we
want to do is I'm going to just choose
whatever my current working folder is
and i'm going to name this I ballot dash
UV we're going to come down here choose
all you've ease and everything else can
remain the same fill opacity 25% them
change the opacity of the layer that you
v's are going to be exported on is just
twenty-five percent that'll work export
it and now it is ready to have some
textures put on to it in Photoshop make
sure you save what you have by the way
ctrl s save it and I'm going to switch
to photoshop and I'm going to open up
that file that we just made if i'll open
recent places 127 and ballot UV alright
so let's give a background color here
real quick control shift n for a new
layer it ok drag it beneath this layer 0
and we'll just rename this by double
clicking it name it UV and i'll give it
a general wood color maybe around there
hit okay and this fill that in alright
so whatever is placed within these
portions of the UV is what's going to be
you know on this is the front this is
the back left now right and then left
and this is the top and then this is the
bottom and this is some crap inside of
it so what we want to do is get a wood
texture to use so I'm going to get up my
browser here and go to cg textures com
this is a great site I will require
registration we want to download any
decent size resolutions but it's free
there's also a paid version if you want
like access to really massive textures
but I what we're going to do is just
come down here to wood and I'm going to
choose plywood new and we have all these
different sets that we can choose from
so there's no right or wrong really I
trying to remember which one that I used
in the original ever before I started it
wasn't this one but it shows you the
sizes that are available here um this is
premium I want to try to I'm going to
pause just so I can try to find the
exact correct one
okay so I've scrolled down here I
they're going to choose this one right
here and there's a lot of different
options that we can use so just really
not one that's one hundred percent right
or wrong um we just want one that's
definitely big enough so i think i'm
going to use this one right here and i'm
going to go ahead and use that see here
on the large one so it will let you know
what's for premium members are not so we
select that it's going to download it
and i'm going to open up in i'm going to
show in folder real quick i'm going to
right click it I'm off screen so you
can't see this but I'm going to right
click it and just open with photoshop
and you can see it's big we're only at
twenty-five percent ctrl a ctrl C to
copy and now what we want to do is to
replace this layer right here the
background is just ctrl-v to paste that
so we're going to leave this here in
that way when we go to add individually
dis texture right here I if there's any
edges that are missed we'll have this as
a background I so it won't be like white
or this color or whatever alright so
what we want to do is I'm going to go
ahead we can delete that layer and
actually you know what i'll leave it
just because it fills it up up there
alright so now what I want to do is I'm
going to ctrl V to paste once again and
ctrl T will allow me to scale it down so
shift + alt + left click and drag and so
I'm going to I'm going to make it a size
that is basically as big as our biggest
portion so that would be right here the
back is like the biggest in terms of
height I than any of these so as long as
it can fit this I can go ahead and add
it to this portion alright so I'm going
to leave it right there select move tool
and hit apply all right so this is what
our texture looks like so far not too
impressive
alright so I'm going to leave that one
right there i'm going to call it front
i'm going to duplicate it again and i'm
going to put it over here and you don't
want all the sides to look the same so
there's several different things you can
do so edit one thing is you go to edit
transform like flip horizontal and you
can also flip vertical if you want and
you can also i'm going to come in here
gonna hold alt and then just use my
mouse scroll wheel to zoom in here and
what i want to do is take this clone
stamp tool and what we can do is if you
hold alt left click and now we move us
around we can really manipulate the
texture so that it looks unique on each
side and you can also get rid of these
knots if you want just holding alt left
click and i'll click up here and that
way you just create some variety and not
everything looks the same alright so now
what I'll do is I'll take this front
copy rename this to back I can duplicate
it ctrl shift D I have I think that's a
custom keyboard shortcut that is set up
for duplicating layer or just
right-click hit duplicate layer hit OK
and we'll move this one over here and
also i'll delete take the rectangular
marquee tool and then just delete that
that way there's no edges showing up on
any of these and real quick i'll take
the clone stamp tool just to make sure
that nothing looks like it's duplicating
on these sides all right right there and
then finally we will take this rename it
to right and duplicate it
edit transform flip vertical I think
that'll be fine and I want to make sure
that my selection here is completely on
or visible in there so you could take
this real quick the magic wand tool and
then select outside of it you can see
the selection and it is all inside of
there so that's good all right that's
good I for that portion now I i'm going
to call this left now i want to select
this one right here so to select the
layer automatically over here he's just
ctrl or command on mac and left-click
and this is overlapping i believe so
delete okay now what I want to do I'm
going to take the front duplicate it
move it over here just so it's on the
top because remember this is the top
view right here
alright I'm going to real quickly
duplicate that move it down oh no this
there is also some top portion of that
so let me see what we have here ok so I
delete that portion and then we have the
bottom I'm going to go back to front or
no front coffee this is actually top
this is inner I think and then we'll go
ahead and take top duplicate that pull
that down to the bottom you can also see
some stuff we have to get rid of the top
there alright that's fine alright so now
we have a completely wooden texture okay
so what I want to do at this point
before I proceed with any type of decals
or whatever is just export it without
the UV layer shown otherwise you'll see
these movies and it won't look good so
everything looks kind of like a mess
right now but that's expected but it
will look actually pretty cool when we
come into and get this imported into
blender so we're already at 22 minutes
so let's go ahead and save this as a
different file so we'll go ahead and I'm
just going to put save for web and
that's going to make mine a JPEG it's
92% 1.5 Meg's recent places 127 will
call this ballot dash diffuse and that's
a JPEG so now let's switch back to
blender and let's go to the node editor
now there's no again there's no I what
do you call a texture applied to this
yet so we're going to hit tab to go into
object mode and then we're going to hit
new and zoom up here and so we're going
to leave this out of diffuse because
there's no like shininess or anything
when it comes to would so diffuse will
work shift a texture image texture
connect these 2 i'm going to hit open
and ballot diffuse
alright with any luck this will have
worked let's go to rendered all right
pretty decent we have a lot of light so
it's kind of hard to tell the difference
between the different objects but this
actually does look pretty decent and
realistic which is what we want yeah
cool we got our wooden box man it's
coming along okay so yeah we're already
at 23 minutes or 24 so I'm going to stop
this here just for now you already
learned a lot about UV you don't know
anything about UV and so let that sink
in and then tomorrow we're going to go
ahead and add some decals to this and do
some other stuff all right I'll see you
then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
