etro yeah I'm kind of sick right now but
I'm gonna try I get through this
tutorial as best I can
you know my wife she complains about me
being a baby when I'm sick and I think
she's more like Kathy Bates in that
movie where she that dude unnecessarily
anyhow we're gonna cover just a real
quick sort of topic here although it can
be a very big topic I in fact I created
a course out of parasite calm and this
is called post CSS and it's been around
for a while
you may have heard about it but if not
it's worth taking a look so post ESS
allows you to transform CSS with a large
variety of posts CSS plugins and I by
the way have a written version of this
tutorial you can see it in the
description here on YouTube and this
link here it's gonna show you all of
these plugins that are created by third
parties and these are all CSS specific
plugins and they can handle a variety of
tasks as you can see here they're
grouped into different categories like
future CSS and tax fallbacks language
extensions colors images fonts great
grids optimist and I mean just a ton
there's hundreds of plug-ins here that
you can use so I'm gonna show you how to
get up and running and how to integrate
just a few plugins and then you can go
from there I'm obviously not gonna cover
all of these okay so I to get started
here let's go to our console here and
we're gonna keep things simple and we're
gonna stay away from using any type of
framework whether that be through CSS or
JavaScript we're just gonna need nodejs
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a
six-pack
each month that's it
now also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on alright let's get back to it to
install post CSS and our task runner
gulp so you know I do this every video
it seems like but just to check if you
have it it's node - V and then if you
don't if this goes unrecognized just go
to node J s tie to work download it for
your operating system reload your
console and then you can run this
command and you'll be good to go
at that point let's create a new folder
I'm just going to call P CSS for post
CSS and we're going to jump into it
after it creates it and then we're going
to create a package JSON file for
storing our project dependencies so NPM
in it why because I don't want to answer
all these questions and then we're going
to install gulp and post CSS with the
node package manager
so NPM install or you could just use I
gulp and then gulp host CSS save dev and
then that's going to go ahead and
install that real quickly in our project
folder and also of note post CSS can
also be used with a bunch of other task
runners not just gulp so check out their
github page for more details and in the
written version of this tutorial you can
find that so let's go ahead and set up
the actual task runner so I'm using
Visual Studio code for my code editors
and so that means I can hit code or type
code in in a period and then my editor
will load up
unfortunately it's off-screen get it
situated here alright cool
and then let's go ahead and create a
gulp file dot J s like that ok so we're
gonna get started here with real simple
stuff I'm just gonna paste in some of
this so a control B by the way gets rid
of that sidebar so the first thing we're
creating two variables for post CSS and
this is one of the two packages that we
just installed and then also gulp itself
which is the task runner now we're gonna
create a I first I'm going to kind of
work backwards by the way all this code
is in the written version so the default
task right here that's going to allow us
just a type gulp in the command line
and then it's telling it it it'll run
the task of serve so let's create serve
alright so what's happening here we're
naming this gulp task
the first argument here is serve and
that's what this is in relation to so
it's gonna run this it's gonna pass in
another task that's not yet defined that
we will shortly called CSS all right and
then it's gonna watch our gulp they're
just gonna gulp watch our any CSS file
in that the CSS folder all right so
let's create the CSS task right there
and again we're naming it CSS this is
what this here is in reference to and
then we have an array right here and
this is where we're going to reference
our post CSS plugins that we want to use
based on the needs of our project all
right and then I what we do is we return
gulp source of any CSS file and we use
the pipe method to pass in post CSS is
where post CSS is actually used in our
task runner and then we're going to put
in an array here this plug-in array and
then after post CSS has ran all those
plugins and you could use just one or a
bunch of them it's going to after it
transforms them it's going to put them
in a folder with the same name I in a
destination folder so let's create that
CSS folder real quickly and we'll create
a file inside of it called main dot CSS
again you can name it whatever you want
alright so now at this point nothing is
going to actually happen so what you
need to do is figure out you know based
on your needs of your project what is it
that you want and so this is where you
revert back to that plugins list and
right here there's some I these packs
contain a lot of different really useful
things the first one I want to use is
called autoprefixer there it is and it's
under fallbacks and this adds vendor
prefixes for you using data from can I
use com
all right so how will we actually use
this all right well first you know and
by the way that the process process of
integrating these plugins is pretty much
the same across all of them we're gonna
do it twice just so you get some muscle
memory so to install and by the way if
you click on like you know in this case
we want to use it we click on a link
it's gonna take you to you know the
information page about this so the first
step here we're going to install it with
NPM so NPM install and autoprefixer and
save it as a dev dependency alright so
momentarily it's going to install this
we can just go ahead and we know I mean
have to wait for this just go back here
trilby and next we need to declare it as
a variable here so we're gonna save our
autoprefixer let me just copy that right
here equals require the same thing okay
then we simply reference that video that
variable I was about to say vehicle what
am I talking about right here and that's
it it is that simple
so let's see I if it actually works
and so if we go back to the autoprefixer
page there we are
and it'll show you um you could write
your CSS rules without vendor prefixes
so makes your life a little bit simpler
I'm going to copy this example and it
should transform it to this and if it
does then we know post CSS and all this
stuff is set up correctly so let's go to
let's see your control B we'll go in our
main CSS file we're going to save it and
then we go back to our console I'm gonna
simply type gulp alright so now we go
back to our I let's go back to our code
editor now we see this new destination
folder and we see main dot CSS and there
we go awesome so like I mentioned let's
do another one so what does it take to
use multiple post CSS plug-ins
simultaneously so if we go back to that
list real quickly assuming I still
it up and of course I don't yeah there
it is let's use a plug-in pack so these
are under packs and I CSS Nano is a pack
that contains plugins that optimize your
CSS size for use in production so it's
going to you know minimize the size of
your I your CSS which is obviously very
very important especially for Google so
do get started again same exact thing so
let's go back to our hit ctrl C to get
out of there
we're gonna type in NPM I for shorthand
install CSS Nano save dev we're gonna
assume it will install is just perfectly
fine we're gonna go back here to our
gulp file
I hate could shift alt in the down arrow
key CSS Nano CSS Nano here oops there we
go
and then simply separate it with comma
CSS Nano and we're done
awesome so now if we go back to by the
way let me I'm split this real quick
I'll take this like control B get this
over here we'll go back to our
destination yeah and then bring this guy
over here okay
and then if I type gulp you're going to
see that this destination file will
automatically change because it's going
to minify it using that CSS Nano
so now gulp I was using the up arrow key
by the way and there we go so now has
just made our CSS files smaller and ran
that and that my friends is all it takes
so obviously very simple to use you can
even create your own post CSS plugins if
you have like an ultra specific use case
that isn't already covered in the
existing plugins list that would be hard
to imagine but you know that's how
essentially other developers have been
able to create their own all these post
CSS plugins but unfortunately I'm not
going to be covering that here as that
would be better suited for its own
tutorial like
mentioned I have created a course in the
past at Pluralsight comm that actually
does cover that topic if you want to
check it out but yeah so and by the way
I'll just show you real quickly that
that a page where you can find this at
and this is again this is that the
official github post CSS page you can
find this this URL right here tells you
all about how to write your own post CSS
plugin there's a tutorial plug-in
boilerplate and there's a very very
extensive API that allows you to
traverse over your CSS alright guys I
look out for more content soon hopefully
I get better this is horrible and I'll
talk to you later
good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
