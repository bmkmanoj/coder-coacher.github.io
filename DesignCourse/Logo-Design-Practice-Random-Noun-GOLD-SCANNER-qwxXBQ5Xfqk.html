today I'm going to do another random
nouns low design practice tutorial and
so the nouns this time around our gold
scanner so we'll see what I can come up
with and I'm going to use adobe
illustrator for this and this is just a
fun technique that you can use to really
force yourself to come up with something
creative in terms of an illustration or
icon or logo all right so check out
these on course com if you haven't and
subscribe here on youtube and also real
quickly this it ended up being like 30
minutes long and so I was just rambling
a lot and you would be bored as hell
watching this so what I did was I sped
it up and I adds background music in
that way it just kind of looks a little
bit more interesting and you won't fall
asleep alright so yeah here we go
alright so here we are I want to random
now it's going to hit generate all right
so gold scanner oh man gold scanner hmm
alright let's go with it file new i'm
going to use age 60 x 600 points RGB
screen 72 hit okay control one to get us
to a hundred percent alright so
generally for thinking about a piece of
gold I alright i think i'm going to do a
traditional gold bar and try to i
emulate the idea of scanning for
something so i'm just going to try to
eyeball a 3d gold bar you know in part
would make help or make sense to real
quickly I mean we know what it looks
like by memory but let's just get this
out here yeah I mean
usually the top portion is just inside a
little bit the base is wider and that's
that all right so I what I'll do is just
to eyeball this
alright and that is it so yeah I the
idea really changed up a lot as I
designed but i like it and that's it so
yeah check out design course calm if you
haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
