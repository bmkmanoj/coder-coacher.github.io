to be announcing the design challenge
number 12 and that is based around
designing a GUI or graphical user
interface toggle switch design and both
the on and off state all right so toggle
switches are popular among both iphone
and android apps as a way to control
different options and just dive if you
scroll down here you can see some of the
disguise sources of inspiration for
toggle switches and so basically i
recently i put out a tutorial on
designing and implementing a toggle
design i talked with switch design for
an android app so i thought would be
appropriate here of course to make this
week's design challenge be focused
around that so to access to this
tutorial just check out my design
channel or go here and you'll see all my
latest videos so it happens to be this
one also before I begin I and go over
the rules a little bit check out design
course calm / premium where I teach you
one on one I had to design all things
awesome so one of the web design logo
design identity design etc I help you
become a better designer there's I and
that's through call that's true mentor
so this is the one on one design
training module and you can find all
this information out in gtown course a
calm / I premium so first I let's go
back here to the forms here no that's
not the right one you know right there
so yeah must feature a single toggle
button toggle switch design with an on
and off state so what I mean by on and
off well this would be off this is on
this would be on this would be off this
would be on off you you get it right I
must be large enough for me to see it so
make sure your document size is at least
500 x 500 pixels alright so it seems
like I shouldn't have to say that but
sometimes people submit things are just
too small for me to see so provide for a
good amount of margin and white space
between the document edge in the toggle
switch design so this is something again
and people get wrong a lot of times when
they're submitting design entries for
these challenges like if it's a logo
design they'll make this large logo and
it will extend like the whole width of
their document and it's just not good
design you want a lot of space for your
design to be showcased on you don't want
everything just smashed up against the
edge like this is good this is pretty
good this is good we can really see what
you're doing it's not you know really
scaled up to the size the full document
size so design it in any style you
prefer so if you want it to be a flat
design you want it to be really 3d
realistic you want to do something
realistic like this that's fine you want
to do something like this or even
something interesting like that go right
ahead and then finally most importantly
try to apply good design principles so
that means a good color in contrast
relevance white space if you're going to
use type a good topography so yeah make
sure you do that that's what really this
is what it's all about these design
challenges trying to get good with
making your designs better so do you the
deadline here is a week from today so
that's Monday August 25th at 12pm
eastern standard time so that's when
you're able to submit all the way up
until then and please don't open up a
new thread just hit post reply some
people do that sometimes and then when
it comes to time for me to review them I
just skip over because I stick to this
thread all right so that's it i'll stop
rambling rambling so if you haven't yet
subscribe here on youtube there would be
a subscribe button or down here in
YouTube just click on it damn it and
then also check out design course calm /
premium there will be a annotation here
in this video alright I look forward to
