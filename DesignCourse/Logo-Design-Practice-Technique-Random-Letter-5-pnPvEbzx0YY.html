assignment of design course comm and
today doing another random letter load
design practice technique video and so
the idea behind this is I'm going to
generate a random letter by clicking
this link and then immediately after it
shows up I'm going to verbally announce
the first noun that begins with that
letter that comes to mind and the idea
is to then open up Adobe Illustrator and
try to combine both of the ideas in our
the the noun into that actual letter in
some unique way so this is just an
interesting way to try to get some
practice with a logo design and letter
mark design specifically so yep let's go
ahead and do this so H hair hair ok well
we got to do it so I yeah let's open up
illustrator here all right agent hair
I'm just gonna make this H and something
that fits this resolution is 850 by 600
I only know that through trial and error
I'm just going to leave that RGB raster
effects 72 and hit OK alright so hair
and I'm gonna do a capital H and a
lowercase H and kind of just go through
some of the fonts that I have so I take
this up here is use my down arrow key
and go through some of these I can try
to come up with a way or a font that
seems like it might be suiting for a
specific idea that I may have which I
don't kind of quite yet so you know when
we think about hair and and how it flows
obviously it's gonna have to be longer
hair I don't think of a way to really
get both of the ideas in there I showing
that it's an actual H of some short sort
and also have hair that's visible or
some type of hair form so you know one
of these script fonts would obviously
probably be most ideal but I think I may
want to make it a little bit more
simplistic than something that's crazy
as shown here so
um let's see here I think I want to make
this that use a font that's probably
more whimsical but not too crazy like
this so you know when we think of hair
get out the pen tool here I'm just gonna
I'm just thinking out loud and just
drawing without any without too much
sense or purpose right now and also by
the way I could instead of doing this I
this is just a tip that I should have
used holding shift left click drag come
out and then if you want to achieve this
effect instead of having to manually you
know go back through here you can select
direct selection tool oops
select it rather and then get rid of the
fill give it a stroke keep it at black
and we'll give it some thickness but
we'll change the variable width profile
by using one of these profiles here just
like this one so you can see that it at
the beginning of it and at the end it
fades off and so increase this size kind
of just like that and see like mine was
not perfect up here it's different
so yeah just a quick tip there I see ya
getting back to this just trying to
think about you know how to best
illustrate this idea of hair into an H
you know if it was something like a tee
or an eye it would be much more easy but
we got this I you know the other portion
of the H that needs to be shown through
here in some way and so I don't want to
try to do it in a way that just looks
good and flows well because that's what
usually hair does you know its gravity
takes effect makes it uniform right so
but then we get this thing we have to
push up here man
okay so mm let me get rid of this real
quick
by the way I want to show you another
tip just because I did that when you
take these and you scale them up when
you have a stroke you scale them all the
way up you can see it didn't scale the
actual stroke as well the way you could
fix that is by going to window transform
to bring up the transform panel and then
go to select both your objects and
you'll see it says scale strokes and
effects so if you turn it on and then
scale it it scales the stroke as it
needs to based on how your size that you
need so that's just a quick tip right
there all right so I'm going to close
that out okay so hair okay so let's see
if we can do something similar here I'm
just going to duplicate that I might try
adding uh-hmm
temporarily real quickly I'm just going
to go to object path and outline stroke
I'm gonna make the foreground color
white 45-degree angle I'm just gonna
hold shift + left click up here where
that D for the angle
and then take actually take both of
these go to window Pathfinder alright
and then take this and these and
subtract front ah dang it
let me do this real quick I'm just going
to duplicate that
okay now it's transparent here all right
let me see here let me close this out I
just kind of wanted to see what this
idea looked like this is obviously in
the lowercase H not too sure if I like
it
honest to be just you know 100% honest
with ya yeah
all right so I'm not I'm not I'm not too
satisfied with this I just want to take
this one over here and maybe just work
with a possibly a different idea so try
a different approach maybe try to
approach it from the idea of it being
capitalized so so this certainly looks a
little bit more like hair being that
there's a lot more important well
there's two more strands not a lot more
I could say so how would we get an idea
of an H in here no just for the fun of
it I'm going to I get this for it just
make that foreground white get the
ellipse tool I'll shift and alt here in
the center no ah real quickly I want to
see what this looks like
actually I delete that
no that looks like crap okay so let me
try this real quickly I'm going to
alright here's what I'll do I'll take
the add Anchor Point tool we'll end it
right here and here and then delete this
top one oops wrong one damn it
there we go take down this size a little
bit and delete this one and then do the
same thing over here getting rid of
those
all right work with me I am um I have an
idea damaged so I just I just think I'm
gonna have to work with these a little
bit more so you know what these two thin
was at three and four
I'm getting somewhere slowly hopefully
this isn't too painfully boring for you
I mean let's see here
alright I think what I want to do
instead is I I'm gonna delete this one
take this and just pull it up and you'll
get it back down to four and we want to
maintain the same profile except we're
gonna use the add Anchor Point at a
different height right here in here so I
added two I'm going to delete the top
and bottom alright and I think I need to
do the same thing with this one over
here make it four and add Anchor Point
tool maybe higher slightly delete the
end points with the direct selection
tool
and do that again maybe even lower just
changing up the heights on these yeah I
don't really like that one kind of looks
funky and it doesn't maybe you see with
no it's not yeah I think what we'll do
is just back up several times and I will
just slightly change this one just so
it's not the same as the one on the
right we'll make this one longer than
the one to the left of it yeah I know it
still do not like this yeah I think it's
making that small adjustment right there
kind of helped
I think that's better that small one was
just being thrown off because it kind of
looked like a straight line because it
was so small so moving just sticking
with the longer ones in the center here
seems to make a little bit more sense
yeah there we go that's much better now
this kind of kind of looks like an A and
s possibly but yeah if you put some text
next to it in a font that's similar or a
script font of some sort like hair a IR
you can definitely tell it's an H from
that standpoint so let me I think I want
to work with this just a tad bit more
and so I think what I want to do is I in
the middle I'm gonna connect everything
using the pen tool so what we'll do is I
with the pen tool I'll just left click
left click again hold down and drag out
just a tad bit and then come back up
here left again on this right side of
the hair and do the same thing over here
and if you mess up use always just ctrl
Z that
and then come down here
and do the same thing
mm I did a little bit too much on that
one there we go by the way this is like
a pure black and it's not matching up
with these colors so if I drag this
right here and then select these four
get that and get those matched up at the
same black color alright so that's a
little bit better kind of making it look
like they're the hair is all connected
but there's like highlights I think
another thing I could do is take both of
these hit ctrl C ctrl F and that
duplicates them and then take the copies
that are currently selected and make
them white strokes but take down the
stroke width now right around there
looks pretty good and then what I can do
is take the add Anchor Point tool and
you know we can see that there's like a
dark spot right here going through so
maybe there's a highlight going through
here on this portion so what I mean by
that is I can add an anchor point now we
can leave it right here the one in the
middle and then one just break down
there delete the top one right there all
right and then do the same thing for
this one as well so I add an anchor
point and delete to the other two with
the direct selection tool and then of
course we can do the same thing and
create ones for the top versions and I
just I drop it so we can get that same
width in color and then take the add
Anchor Point tool and right there and
there delete that and then delete this
and then finally the same thing for this
union
yeah might make it end sooner and delete
delete and delete actually you know why
I want to make those shorter real
quickly so I'm just adding an anchor
point right there so that the stroke
will end a little bit higher actually
you're not kind of like the fact that
these are these two are different
slightly so I'm gonna leave it like that
I you know what I'm gonna do I'm also
gonna do the same thing to this one down
here look at that
there we go alright so now to give it
some texture or color we can first let
me get this situated here get like a
faint yellow for the foreground okay
maybe this is symbolizing a blonde or
something I don't know
layers
and then go ahead also and I must get us
up and then we'll get this to or drag
this guy over here take these four and
change change them to that that'll work
better there there is our stylized hair
with the letter H designed in hair okay
so hopefully you guys thought that was
entertaining probably didn't a party
maybe two people may be listening to
this still because they fell asleep but
anyhow yeah so yep that is it as always
