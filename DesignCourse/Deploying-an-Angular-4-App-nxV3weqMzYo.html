little bit confused on how you take your
app from your development environment to
a live environment on a different
servers that users can actually use so
the process is fairly straightforward so
let's get started now being that this
particular course is a part of our free
angular 4 course I'll assume that you
already have a project creating using
the angular command-line interface if
not then we'll use it to create a new
one real quickly and I'll just call this
my cool proj suite now because this
takes a while I will pause and I'll come
right back alright so it just finished
installing an icy deed into the project
name and so one of the tremendous
benefits of using the angular
command-line interface is the ability to
create a production build of your app
and this includes äôt which is
ahead-of-time compilation which we'll
talk about a little bit later but in the
end to ultimate goal is to create an app
that is as small as possible in file
size so to demonstrate this let's run
the following command in a console
within our angular project that is set
up to work with the CLI or command line
interface simply ng and build so high
it's not done yet
but I wanted to show you just now it
created a new folder and so let's hop in
here and so here are the files that are
associated with the build that we just
made and you'll see these following
files right here we're going to take a
look at their file size so we can see
the biggest one here is this vendor
bundle jes and that's two point one
makes obviously that's really big I we
also have a 65 KB one here polyfills is
170 one seven and six so just note that
I'm a screenshot this so we can compare
them what we want to do now is run ng
build we
is a - - prod or production flag and
then we're going to compare the end
result we can also see them it outputs
the results up here as well so hit the
up arrow key this time we add prod and
when it does this it's going to remove
that folder as you see and went bye-bye
and it will recreate it alright just
finished we can see our new dist folder
and where we go before the vendor file
was something like 2.1 Meg's now it is
313 kilobytes this is a massive
difference obviously the others also
went down in file size as well so
sometimes depending on the specifics of
your app you can can cut out essentially
about 90% of the file size when you're
adding the production flag so how does
it do this
well there's number of things that are
occurring when you add that flag it
removes unwanted white space by
minifying the files aqua Phi's files by
renaming functions and variable names
and then also is baked in a ot or ahead
of time compilation which removes the
compilation process at runtime and
instead performs compilation during the
build process now if you're unfamiliar
with any of kind of what that means
especially with the AAT at the end I
suggest just googling it and learning a
little bit more about it so all of these
things though they drastically reduce
the file size of your app thus
decreasing load times which is important
so also about äôt you know as of March
1st when you specify the - - prod flag
as we did above it will automatically
include äôt so previously you had to
run ng build prod peyote you no longer
have to add the AO t it's automatically
baked within the production flag okay so
once you have your build or in other
words you have this dist for its
distribution folder right here now how
do you actually get it on to a server
well you have several options so if your
app does not include or contain a
back-end of any sort you can simply take
contents of this folder right here and
you can upload them to your site via FTP
if you wish the app will work
you're uploading it to the root public
folder such as you know like my site
calm but if it's within a subfolder such
as my site calm slash whatever then you
could specify the - - bass - HR flag
during the build process and we add then
pipe in - beach bass I have an href and
then a space and then the actual base
URL depending on the folder structure so
by default it's that so then if you have
a subfolder over it's on the sub domain
or whatever like that so if you don't do
that and it is on a subfolder then
you'll run into issues I and the app
will not load because it's looking for
these files right here I in the wrong
directory so it won't load at all ok now
outside of uploading the files via FTP
you can quickly deploy your app to get
hub pages using a package called angular
CLI gh-pages or github pages now the
ability to deploy to github pages was
previously a part of the regular angular
command-line interface but it has been
recently recently removed from it and
now it's in its own package so let's go
ahead and install that real quickly and
angular - CLI - gh-pages alright so
after its installed go ahead and log in
to your github account create a new
repository and we'll just name this one
my cool garage no description public and
create repository now the next step will
fall this stuff right here in the
project folder and that's to create this
folder or turn it into a git repository
so following those steps get in it get
add readme MD get commit first commit
and then I'm going to copy and paste
our remote add and then also copy and
paste this command right here all right
great
so when you deploy to github pages you
have to run your ng build command with
the base nature of flag so what that
looks like
is simply ng build add a production flag
and then base href and then we run HTTP
colon slash slash your github username
- design course dot github dot and then
the repository name with a slash at the
end so the name is my cool garage
make sure you add this slash right here
otherwise it will not work all right
once it's done then you can run NGH
which is how you invoke the command line
interface tool that we just installed
for deploying to github pages alright
and if it says successfully published as
it does here go ahead and visit that URL
that we specified there in the base h4f
flag and there we go your app should
load and work as expected now if it's
blank or it says app loading then hit
ctrl shift I go to console see what's
happening chances are if it was working
locally but it's not working here then
you screwed up the URL of the base HR
flag up here so you just have to rerun
it and then run NGH again and push
alright so that is the end of the free
angular 4 from scratch course assuming
you we're following along with it and of
course there's a lot more to angular in
terms of in-depth topics but by now you
should have a really strong foundation
from which you can build upon in the
future so please check out my other
courses i'm gary simon and i will see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
