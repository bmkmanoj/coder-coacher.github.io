comm today I'm gonna talk about design
competition contest websites so the
biggest one the most well-known one is
called 99designs comm it's a place where
people who are looking for design work
whether it be logo designs or website
designs can launch a contest specify the
prize amount and then also the project
brief and then web designers the logo
designers or whatever can come on into
that project and then try to compete
with other designers so that the contest
holder can pick a winner
all right so it sounds fun I but there
are some designers who spend basically
their life or I think they probably make
their living by submitting concepts to
these design contests all right so you
know live and let live obviously but I'm
going to go over some of the numbers
here I'm gonna switch off to the desktop
and just go over some of the numbers
here I when it comes to what seems to be
the average designer that is on these
design websites and how many how many
projects tanner how many to actually win
and what that all comes out roughly if
you can approximate you know how much
they're making in the end I guess I want
I would say try to stay away from these
sites if you're a designer or even if
you're somebody who is looking for
design work so yeah I'm gonna go ahead
and switch real quick okay so here we
are at the main page and to be able to
get to where you want to go to see where
I'm looking at you just go to look
identity logo design for example and I
come down here and then you click on
browse more logo contests and it shows
you the finished contest and then the
open contests I'm going to come down
here to the right and it shows you
recent winning designers okay so these
are just their avatars basically I'm
going to just right click on open up in
a new tab a few of these just randomly
at the top and you see like the latest
runners so if I click on this I it'll
show you some stats based on you know
how many this person has won and have
been shortlisted so shortlisted means
they were chosen like on the final round
so this guy was shortlisted six times he
won five of those in that final round
and he totaled his winnings total about
a thousand dollars all right so you look
at this and you say okay not bad I mean
he entered possibly six contests and he
won five right okay well let's checking
out another one this guy 122 shortlisted
66 so he won you know you may think to
yourself and you see this maybe
one-third of the time I let's do this
again 112 shortlisted 17 one about half
of these a little bit over and this guy
he entered 47 you think maybe and 10
okay so I sing through this guy not bad
right well here's the thing I found
interesting when I'm before I was going
to record this video research us a
little bit I
they 99 designs they removed an
essential piece of data that they used
to include and they used to show how
many total contests that person has
entered and sometimes they would show
the shortlist and then how many they won
now obviously the reason they did this
and I took a screenshot of this last
year and I put together a random sample
like I did up here
I took a screenshot of each of these
their pages and then I just cut out this
portion and I put him in one image and I
was making a post on a different form
just to to do some math you know based
on you know how much these guys the your
average 99 designer is working in
winning and making so fortunately the
image is still up it's hosted on image
URL you are calm and that's I a site
where you can post images basically for
free it's real quick and easy and as you
can see it shows you how many they
entered but they don't do that anymore
and why would they take that away
it's kind of embarrassing actually this
was just a random sample taken from that
recent winning designers list and just
like these I mean these guys okay he won
I 5 shortlist is 6 but maybe he entered
30 this person shortlisted 66 times
maybe though he entered I don't know
maybe 400 but only 122 so that's why
they took that awake so that's kind of
discouraging if you you're a designer
you're aspiring designer and you see
that number I so I did a little bit math
back when I made this post I mean to
enter 1,200 contests only when what one
tenth of them that is that is
discouraging I mean to enter 200 for
contests only win 7 to enter 51
different contests doing design work for
each one of these and only winning 4 I
mean this is kind of the average entered
695 contests and only one - I mean who
does this unless of course they're using
like stock image and they're just brute
forcing submissions to all these things
which you know they boast on their their
their cell page I that you'll get so
many like hundreds of concepts which if
you're somebody who's looking for a logo
design or website design that sounds
great but the vast majority of these
they're just absolute garbage so I went
through and did some math of this and
I'm basically out of these numbers right
here the average winning percentage
between these six is 5.6 percent so you
enter let's say for example I and
contests and let's say for example the
average designer spends maybe one hour
on the contest which you know for an
actual design it's a little bit no
that's not hardly anything but so let's
just say it's just one hour which
includes the design the revisions
requested from the contest or the
multiple concepts logo design contest
whatever you entered a thousand and
we'll say has a thousand hours of work I
likely it may be more you win fifty six
of them because that's 5.6 percent
and then let's assume the average
payouts like $300 which is what probably
the average payout is if you look at the
open contests well I'm not back at that
page but yeah it's around 300 bucks and
I so that's sixteen thousand eight
hundred dollars for a thousand hours of
work or 1680 per hour so assuming the
average guys working on this eight hours
a day six days a week to fulfill that
thousand hours of work it'd take
basically five months which is comes out
to a monthly income of about thirty
three hundred dollars so the important
thing to recognize here is though if
you're if you use 99designs to get
design work I while three thousand three
hundred a month is an entirely bad
income for some designers it's based on
a necessity to enter tons upon tons of
contest and focus on very quick work
which I imagine a good portion of which
is reused from other contests that they
didn't win and so that's kind of the bad
thing if you're somebody who's starting
a contest maybe you're starting a
business you need a logo design or
something you'll see they you may not
know that a lot of the designs are just
recycled regarded or recycled garbage
basically I I mean let me go over here
and find one of the latest design
winning designs here let me find it
because I was just amazed I click on
logo design here and right here so this
this person paid what they call the gold
price 719 800 bucks basically for a logo
design got 600 entries okay now take a
look at the winning design though I mean
come on I mean I mean I hope they at
least provided them in a black and white
version and one without all these crazy
gradients and strokes everywhere because
they could have got much much better
from an experienced designer had they
just done a little bit of research on
finding a good designer maybe on behan
sore dribble or just using Google but I
mean if I go through some of these
click on see all designs I mean there's
yeah they got six hundred concepts in
your average person you know who wants a
design done they're thinking that's
awesome you know that these I mean very
few are worth maybe even 50 bucks if
that I'm trying to find just a couple
like like this I mean you find these
designs all over the place that pretty
much submitted to every single low
design contest on 99 songs that I've
seen either these it's the arc through
the middle of the tech stuff you get so
many of these it's really sad but anyhow
so when it comes to this over here if
you think to yourself well 3,300 dollars
a month you know maybe I'm starting out
that's that's not bad
you're gonna be working your ass off
completely practically 24/7 just to make
that amount and so it completely
devalues your work you can't focus on
good design because it would take too
long so you're forced to just sit
basically what I should what this really
is is basically McDonald's McDonald's
verse I guess you could say a decent
restaurant this is none of the logo
design
unfortunately so I don't want to hate
too much you know I if people are happy
designing for this for these contests so
be it live and let live but and also if
you want to enter them just for fun
go ahead and do that but I'm telling you
if you just take the time that you would
spend air even just I don't know 20% of
the time that you would spend if you're
some of these people on really trying to
develop a solid design business on your
own and you'll be able to make so much
more money you'll be able to work less I
and you'll have more dignity as well
alright so I also I don't want to hate
too much either because you know what
the guy behind this site is just making
an absolute killing this is a huge site
it's the guy behind site point
dot-com which is a real old established
site and I believe they also own I think
they own flippa.com as well but anyhow
yeah so I have a lot of aspiring
designers this is why I put this video
together
don't try to rely on contest - maybe
just to get your feet wet you know
whatever that's fine although there are
also better approaches to that you know
you can hit up local businesses who
don't have logos and you can just do
them for free I mean the likeliness of
winning any of these contests
I mean 5.6 percent that seems to be
pretty much the average and yeah that's
just kind of demoralizing but anyhow
yeah
so check out design course comm if you
haven't subscribe here on YouTube I'm
doing a video every day of the year of
2014 and uh yeah subscribe to check
these out all right goodbye
