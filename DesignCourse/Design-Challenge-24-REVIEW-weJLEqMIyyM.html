course calm today we have another design
challenge review number 24 and this was
for designing the beer bottle logo /
label so we had a lot of good entries i
think we had like 28 or 29 something
like that and we even have one
submission that featured barack obama
what can you say I just before I get to
read the view i wanted to mention real
quickly that I've restructured design
course calm so that now instead of
having a subscription service called
design course premium I've got rid of
that completely and now I'm just
offering individual premium courses for
a very low price flat one-time price per
course so please head on over to design
course calm click on annotation wherever
it's at in this video and check those
out there going to be a lot more on the
way plus the one that is up is called
this ID that's from design course
premium and that's about three hours of
video that showed you exactly how to
design awesome logos like you're trying
to do now alright so let's head on over
to the desktop ok here is the challenge
thread and I'm just going to scroll past
this you just instructed to use a beer
bottle template and pretty much everyone
did with exceptional in person who had
an earlier version and we'll get to them
right now here's the first submission ok
so from pup Mike and by the way you can
update your avatar that now works so
it's not a broken image ok so looking at
this I there's several issues I would
say just at first glance one issue is i
would say the color theme I'd really
don't think this red and this yellow
really work well together along with the
black another issue I would say is this
band going around I i would say nine
times out of ten or 19 out of 20 times
you don't want to do this sort of thing
I would try to use something that's more
like a flat straight line and not a
gradient so whenever it comes to logos
you want to stay away from the gradients
I also really just don't see too much of
what I would call a logo in this I me
need to lay out with some tight but I
don't see any type of identifiable sim
that really says hey I I should remember
this it's going to be easy to remember
because it's not not enough going on to
make it unique so that's one of the
things that I talk about in the visual
identity design course I'm going to spam
you guys real quick as mentioned in the
introduction video I'm again someone
like you would hugely benefit from this
and it's only fifteen dollars all right
so check it out by clicking on video
courses alright else I will not spam you
again alright so I broken Lord alright
so I can't use on the Mac alright so
unfortunately we don't see a preview of
this one I i would say when it comes to
any major issues i would just say it
would be the the tiny type down here and
also even if you scale this up to a more
readable size it looks like you used a
different font I mean let me try to
screw up there so yeah this kind of
seems almost a little bit of a scene or
a serif font and this is a very
straightforward kind of like a helvetica
sans-serif font and generally speaking
you want to try to stick with just one
type of font or definitely don't mix
serif and sans serif I would try to you
know stick with either or having said
that let me reset this to default I
fallen angel I like it too unique
concept I so I really don't have too
many too many problems with this this is
you know everything simple I the colors
work I probably would have used on this
I orange color right here for the text
instead of this because it just stands
out more it's a little bit easier to
read better than that good submission so
thanks for that ok so Dan designs
alright so more on the type rather than
just an image baseload logo you know
what I actually like this because it
really feels like something you would
see um at a convenience store or a beer
section I the type of the the layout of
the type I right here let me focus on
this one um
just is really fitting for a label in my
opinion now you probably could have
added just a couple more things to fill
it out a little bit but in terms of the
layout i really like it the type very
good work here I like you know the all
capitalized type here with the letter
spacing adjusted I all in all very good
if there were one issue I would say I'm
coming down here used branch to
symbolize the beer broth i would say i
would use maybe a little bit less
branches because it looks almost like
beer like some type of strange because
there's so many of them in there i would
simplify it a little bit but having said
that it's a good concept and good design
thanks for that submission ok so
Fernando okay so we have several issues
here so the first thing I noticed are
these vertical I type layers and it's
kind of just throwing things off I'm not
exactly sure what exactly they're saying
it sounds like maybe just iterations of
beer and different languages I'm not
really sure um so I would probably stay
away from doing this in this type of
manner just because it's it's just a
little bit confusing secondly I would
say for the logo the we have the wheat
here which is common on beer logos which
is fine I would have preferred to have
this maybe wrap around the globe a
little bit better just looking here kind
of tilting my head sideways right now it
kind of seems just a little bit to
separate you know we have this big globe
up here I so that's an issue with
proportionality I would have scaled down
the globe a little bit maybe wrap the
Leafs around the globe and I would say
that's pretty much my only gripes with
it in terms of the concept itself having
a in earth is a little bit clutch so I
would probably say there's an issue with
being unique here as well alright so
again that's one of the things that talk
about in my identity design course is
trying to come up with solid but simple
and unique concepts okay so Jonathan
Gray all right so this is definitely
falls in the category of you know trying
to illustrate
concept of being simple but I would say
it's almost let's see here the company's
called Brujeria and the beer is called
blue ice so this would be kind of not
relevant just because what is what is
the relevance of having the the circle
here a big issue with it aside from that
is the placement of it I whenever you
have type and then you have something
added to the background even if it's
simple like just you know a very simple
circle here with one color when you
begin to take that circle and start to
intersect all these individual letters
and in the type it becomes complex and
it comes hard to read and there's
unnecessary clutter that's created from
that so I would stay away from trying to
do this sort of thing I think the next
concept has that issue as well having
said that you definitely had the ideas
of simplicity down and try not to go too
crazy I would just say layout would
probably be what you would benefit the
most in terms of reorganizing this so
thanks for the submission all right so I
don't even know how to DJ solve or
something ok so again we have the issue
with the type being overlaid on top of
in intersecting a separate symbol you
know there are some logos that can do
this effectively but this wouldn't be
how you would do in my opinion so I
would definitely try to create some
separation in some way there's a lot of
ways to tackle it you can move these
left and move this over or remove green
blossom over here maybe down Center it
and then Center the symbol up above now
the relevance of the symbol are not
exactly sure what is happening here
Italy seems like a like a vase with
water and so I'm not sure without you
tell me what your intentions were I
can't really critique it too much so I
would just say I'm not exactly sure
what's happening here having said that
though I you definitely have things that
are going right for you and this I like
the the font I like the type there's
just a couple things with the layout and
adjusting you know things that would
take not very long to address that would
make it definitely better all right so
thanks for that all right Bobby all
right so do you remember me I don't know
Dobby photoshop CS
they don't have smart object layers so
this is basically do they see we can
there's obviously an issue with the
perspective but I won't really critique
that the problem with this logo is
there's there's nothing that's really
making it unique so I'd say one of the
most important core tenants of an
effective logo is it being unique and
unfortunately it is relevant to have the
the eighth the Canadian Leafs you know
line here because it's good the great
canadian but there's nothing really
unique about that so people aren't going
to REM remember it and that's the goal
of an effective logo design so i would
just try to come up with some way shape
or form you can still use a maple leaf
but do it in a very unique way instead
of just slapping one on there multiple
times alright so thanks for that
submission all right so Brock adoro
presidential lager okay very funny but
you know what actually I like the layout
this definitely feels more like a tip
the type of logo you would expect to
find on a label of a beer bottle so
definitely good in that regard the types
good I don't really have anything to
critique other than you chose a crappy
president now I'm just kidding I don't
like any precedents I'm an artist but
anyhow I having said that yeah this is I
really I really like this in a
real-world scenario you probably
obviously have a more unique symbol and
then that would really complete it
anyhow thanks for that submission the
first entry here one problem right off
the bat if i look at this is I there's
not enough contrast so color is an issue
cut contrast is an issue I would either
brighten this up near the actual design
or do something different with the label
right here maybe get rid of entirely and
breaking us up but looking at this
there's some issues design wise I when
it comes to these individual designs and
needs a little banner right these
banners right here we have the the tiny
little kind of slash is going through
that's generally if you're going to do
that you want to space them out a lot
more or a good
decent amount maybe by four hundred
percent more than what they currently
are because when you scale it down they
get fuzzy and they get lost so you want
to space things out a little bit more
this is also applicable sorry to the the
red right here in the skull there's not
enough space there's not enough white
space in between these elements all
right so I haven't looked at that
address that issue I would say there's
also some issues with the type itself we
have amber up here it's kind of smaller
we have read right here it's slightly
bigger el down here it's pretty the same
size as up here also this type over here
you can barely even see it I just
because there's a contrast issue when it
comes to a logo design you kind of want
to have what's called a visual hierarchy
again something I talk about in this
identity design course and you're not
really sure where to focus on I mean
yeah perhaps the skull in the middle but
you're not sure you know you wouldn't be
able to say oh this is called amber red
L or red amber L so you need to focus on
trying to I structure it such a way that
makes it a little bit easier to read and
to identify what the company name is all
right thanks for that submission though
all right this is kind of a joke so
don't take it too seriously so just zoom
up here look I went down too far a hell
is it oh there we go it looks like there
is some type of photoshopped maybe this
was in Photoshop I'm not sure some sad
looking child on a beer bottle a child
on a beer alcohol pratha sad sailor all
right so of course I'm not going to take
it too seriously and I'm not going to
really try to sit here and critique it
but that is funny and thanks for taking
your time to do that that is funny
alright so I seek all right I actually
like this one dude the simplicity
factors there the type is good i like
how everything's kind of centered
following this nice general shape looks
like you got rid of the label which is
fine I I kind of like this right here as
well so I don't really have too much to
TKE about this the only thing
very minor we're like to see maybe this
stroke thickened up a little bit more so
just so it's a little bit more of an
emphasis kind of seems a little bit weak
in that regard other than that I like it
good job alright so veitch media alright
so this isn't bad you had definitely
have the simplicity factor there I
there's nothing you know like bevels or
shatter or shadows or gradients so you
definitely have that working in your
favor i would say in regards to the the
icon here are the symbol rather it seems
a little bit just a little bit unfilled
out or it seems like a little bit could
be added in terms of maybe a little bit
more detail in this area right here it
just kind of seems a little bit blank
and we probably could added just at a
bit more to kind of fill it out and give
it a little bit more character having
said that the will stir up here not sure
if that's really relevant since we
already have the name right here the
wheel steer beer so it's a little bit
redundant I but having said that you
know this isn't a bad attempt so you're
yeah pretty good entry thanks for that
especially you're 17 alright so here's
my beer finesse means perfection in
French okay so one issue I see off the
bat is there's a drop shadow looks like
it was added to this text here kind of
falling this way and it's white
unnecessary kind of makes it hard to
read so I would get rid of that shadow
and that would definitely improve on the
simplicity factor looking at the if you
actually did this by hand that's really
good I would say you definitely want to
thicken the strokes up a bit I because
it's almost gets lost you your eyes are
immediately drawn to this up here when
they probably should be a little bit
more balance towards this as well and a
way to do that would just be strokin
strokin to thicken up the strokes right
here throughout the whole design the
final issue right here at the bottom is
if you can have wraparound text kind of
warped on an arc I try to stick with
capital like making everything
all capital because you're already
warping it this way I then adding
different title cases verse lower cases
makes it hard to read and it just looks
better when it's all capitalized like
this so just a minor issue there but
thanks for the submission alright so
this is probably one of my favorite
concepts yes it's very simple but I the
symbol here is a combination of a
snowflake which is probably the most
obvious and then the wheat right here so
very clever I like it I just probably
not too much I could say about this if
the label itself would be a little bit
more filled out if you added stuff like
you know the required crap that the the
state requires in terms of alcohol
content and all that but yeah there's
not too much I can say that's negative
about this so really good submission
thanks for that all right I think this
is just a repost by accident okay and
then lay out somehow got broken oh well
so lu lu 444 okay so looking at this we
have an issue again with visual
hierarchy you're not exactly sure where
to look first because kind of
everything's arranged in the same sort
of fashion I prevalence isn't really
given a priority isn't really given to
any one element so that would be the
biggest issue I would say so I would try
to work on getting this you know working
on the the hierarchy aspect making
something pop out and there's so many
different ways to do that again I talked
about in my course here I size color
layout these are all things that could
definitely improve on giving things in
visual hierarchy here having said that
again I'm not not too sure why the are
here would be a different color that
kind of throws things off you kind of CB
and then you see they are so that's kind
of a no-no and in and i would say 99.99
percent of the cases when it comes to
logo design and then it doesn't really
look like there's any type of single
identifiable symbol here you just have a
bunch of buckets
or whatever those are crates or barrels
and so you're not sure where the logo
even is so we try to work on some
simplifying things and giving things a
visual hierarchy thanks for the
submission though okay so let's see here
when did you so much more than okay
let's get with crown of that to the
hardest part was drawing the mouse time
to buy tablet okay all right so looking
at this I would say the biggest issue is
probably too many strokes there's a lot
of strokes occurring here and it's
already kind of a complex layout because
you have this this be character and then
you're you have an outer stroke on it
that's black and then another stroke
behind it that's white I would try I
mean there are some logos I can do this
effectively um but I don't think this is
done in that manner unfortunately I
think maybe if you if you were going to
use strokes I would take this either the
outer stroke and really make it thicker
or use this out this this white stroke
and made a little a lot thicker
otherwise you have all these little
lines together and that just adds for
clutter ignoring the strokes well
actually not ignoring another issue with
the search the the type here you have
liquid be that's stroke and then this
one's not stroked and it just kind of
throws everything off so it creates an
issue of inconsistency you want
everything kind of to feel consistent
now I really don't have too much of a
problem though mixing this type of font
the sans-serif font with this script
font I think they're they're different
enough and they're also you know this is
the primary logo name this is the
tagline and that works fine so you did a
pretty good job there I think if you
just kind of simplified the design
through working on these strokes or get
ridding or getting rid of them I think
the logo would definitely be good one is
you two is maybe the coloring this
almost gets lost in the background even
though there is a white stroke around it
but yeah I think if you just made a
couple of those updates it would be a
pretty effective logo so thanks for that
skull crushed beer
okay the symbolism is simple so that's
good nothing too crazy was done with it
so that's that's good I would say I kind
of almost want these over here the wheat
kind of be maybe even worked into this
somehow so it makes it feel like it's
more of a single symbol having said that
I yeah I kind of like the colors
everything else you have going here i
would probably maybe try to work the
skull a little bit closer to crusher um
in terms of everything else you have
going on like I said it's simple so it's
good this feels more of just a
generalized label though than it is a
new logo i but then again we are working
with a label so i can't really could
take you too much on that portion but
yeah having said that that the type is
simple it works i really don't have
anything else to say like i said i would
like to see maybe these we just work
into this a little bit more and things
kind of move together and that would
bring everything together just a little
bit more but yeah thanks for that entry
alright so just add all the process
sketching okay let's see here all right
okay so it's kind of hard to see this
just because everything got enlarged big
time all right so looking at this one
issue right away is you know we have a
lot of simple colors here we have the
flat green black the this yellow here
and then we have this texturized area in
the center this creates an issue of
inconsistency in terms of how you're
applying in color so i would definitely
you if you're going to do one stick with
it but don't mix them you know these
this texturized feel here versus the
flat feel here having said that looking
at this pilsner beer label right here
there's not enough white space between
you know the green portion right here at
the bottom and the block so i would
definitely probably thicken up this
green stroke here and center it a little
little bit better so it has room to
breathe same thing down here of course
as well now there's also an issue with
visual hierarchy as well in terms of the
size of the type and the name like this
lorex Empire right here this is almost
lost it seems secondary to you know the
type of beer in the freshly brewed I
just even though it's in the center it
just seems lost unfortunately also since
1999 I would definitely scale that down
and bring more emphasis on the actual
logo itself maybe even bring the crown
up and extend out you know each side
over here so I'd say just a few of those
I'm those adjustments would definitely
improve tenfold on this this concept
that you have going here so thanks for
that all right first post here this is
from viz wish all right so froth beer so
that's kind of hard to see f there's
like a space ro t in the space H that's
hard to read unfortunately i'm going to
assume that's what it is it's not rot
beer it's brought beer so i would
definitely try to move these closer and
then you know the symbolism here that
you have you know it's just a beer mug
probably not obviously it's relevant but
the issue is is it unique is there
something that's really going to make
you know make a person remember this and
unfortunately i would say no so i really
focus on trying to come up with a unique
approach now in terms of the simplicity
yeah i like the little the circles here
I like the use of color which is you
know you just want the black and white
or silver rather I think it looks you
know you did a good job in that regard
so thanks for that submission column 101
alright simple beer barrel to the bottle
branding and logo design okay so I
actually like this this is kind of cool
you could clearly see the the barrel
right here which is a unique take since
is a bottle and the type is good barrel
to the bottle since 2015 preemie L yeah
there's really not too much I could
really say that's negative about this I
would possibly maybe try to work with a
colorized version but having said that
that's you know you didn't so I think it
would be cool to see this in colored and
maybe even make these things this
portion stand out maybe through the use
of color like a like a wheat or kind of
bright orange or something like that
either way though good submission like
it all right so call here's another one
oh my design was supposed to look like
this forgot to remove the black
background okay yeah and you know what
actually kind of like this better it's
kind of cool how that kind of fades off
all right so al boo boo all right so
beer plus and we have a design here
issue here is the late that the actual
name doesn't stand out enough definitely
want to increase that and also kind of
seems to well I'm not really sure what
this is this portion right here I could
be some sort form of wheat I'm not sure
though but it's very hard defined edges
and then combined with the lowercase B
EE R which you see a lot of smooth
curves and such there's an issue of
consistency there so if you're going to
use this type of design i would use kind
of like a bold thick type of typeface
for the beer and probably make it all
capitalized as well alright so thanks
for that submission okay so George X so
this one is pretty cool i mean if you
actually designed this I you know and it
didn't take it from somewhere which I'm
going to assume you didn't I've I really
liked the line here it gives it
especially this work as well really
really nice i like that the only
possible issue I'm not sure I majestic
lion the king of beers that's not bad i
think maybe things are a little bit too
cluttered down here maybe just work
things up a little bit more give this a
little bit more room to
read on its own I'd be a little bit
easier to read but again that's a minor
great that I have I so yeah this is one
of the better entries so you know thanks
for that submission and taking the time
to do that all right just a couple more
all right so when it out a lot more
detail um bonus custom the Faunus couch
smells good all made from scratch okay
so that's a really cool that this is
definitely if this is custom very very
cool I would say though you can kind of
see how it just kind of gets lost though
on this label I would probably fill it
with color I'm that way it sticks out
much more than it is now and so
obviously you want to add more details
to like the label and that would you
know that could definitely potentially
bring it to the next level but as this
stands that's really good so thanks for
that submission all right Peter all
right try to keep it as simple as
possible which I think you did I make it
almost miss a mystery beer brand because
there's okay so yeah the cool wavy
pattern yeah that's a pretty interesting
take on it that's a cold sort of texture
even though that's not a part of the
logo the premium typeface here I would
just say there's not enough in and of
itself to make it its own logo I
assuming this isn't a custom typeface
you know if it is you can kind of get
away with that usually but assuming this
is not custom which it probably isn't
you have you run into the issue of you
know if you get your gun only have type
or a word mark as it's called be your
logo then it better be a unique type
face so in that respect I would
definitely add some type of symbolism to
it or make it different somehow but I do
like the label design how this I the
yellow kind of in cases the edges of the
label here so yeah thanks for that and
that is it all right everyone I again
thanks for the entries look out for a
new challenge it's going to be posted
tomorrow and remember the new
or matt is every week every Sunday night
you have to get your submission in
Monday such as today is a review day and
then Tuesday look for a new video for a
new design challenge now remember if you
guys are really wanting to get better at
logo design please consider supporting
the site in a channel by checking out
the premium design course this is I
believe it's nearly three hours long or
I take you through a bunch of different
or not a bunch by three full identity
design projects so check out that by
going to design course calm and you'll
see them right here I also released a
responsive web design course as well
these are dirt cheap for what you get at
least that's my opinion all right talk
to you later goodbye
