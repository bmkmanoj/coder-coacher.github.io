comm today we're going to be covering a
new piece of software relatively new
called pixate and it is 100% free for
both Mac in Windows what it does is
helps basically bridge the gap between
app designers and app developers so
traditionally in the past basically you
were forced to if you're a designer
present a series of app activity and
screen mock-ups to the developer and you
would describe what they would do or if
you had enough time you would step into
something like Adobe After Effects and
kind of do the animations I do yourself
which takes a lot of time so what this
allows you to do as a designer is take
your app mock up and piece it together
in this app called pixate and basically
add interactions and animations
basically allowing you to use the app
right on your phone and see exactly how
it animates how you intend for it to
animate okay so basically in this video
we're just going to do the mock-up in
Adobe Photoshop you can follow along in
other apps if you're more familiar like
illustrator or sketch and then the next
video we'll wrap up by working solely in
pixate all right subscribe here if you
haven't yet and let's get started okay
so here in Photoshop let's go to file
new and right now before we can specify
the width and height and all that we
need to first step into pixate and I'm
going to do that and you just want to
make sure you go to file new to start a
new project right here
and you'll be presented with this so you
can specify the name here and then this
is the important part
I select its target device so if you're
currently working with you know an
iPhone 6 or 6 plus or any of these
listed here you can specify that and it
will automatically specify you know or
instead of the project with the new
dimensions that are consistent with that
phone for me I have a Samsung Note 5
which is just purchased and it's not
listed here as an option so if that's
the case for you you have you know
something that's not listed here you go
to Google just find out what the
resolution is mine happens to be 1440
width by 2560 height and you can see we
have at 2 X at 3 X on some of these
basically these are in
so all I did was I took mine I divided
it by three and I came up with down here
for 80 by 853 with the factor the
density here of three so ad prototype
and you'll be ready to go here although
we're not going to be doing anything and
pixate just yet we want to design
everything first so what I can do in
here is like to specify the dimension in
pixels which is 1440 width by 2050 2560
height resolution 72 Yeti everything
else is good here so hit OK and showing
up off screen for a second and there we
go
so for the very first screen of course
is for a fictional project now I just
really wanted to experiment with you
know this app itself as opposed to
coming up with some sort of elaborate
project so this is simple it's just
gonna be allowing people to sort through
pieces of food or whatever they can
click it and it will bring up a sort of
UI with more options also a menu will
show how the menu interacts or works
when you click on it so it's got to get
started so for the first thing we worry
about is just a background what I'll do
here is just use the rectangle tool just
make something larger than the canvas
size slightly and I'm gonna double click
on it to bring up the gradient overlay
and by default it already has what I'm
going to use in the gradient just
because I remembered it but if you want
the specific color codes to match up
it's 76 for 8a and a second one over
here is 7 8 a 2 C 2 although you can use
whatever you want no big deal and we'll
hit OK alright so now we'll go ahead and
just get a type based word mark for the
logo I'm gonna ctrl H to get rid of the
outlines there and just left click with
the type tool and I'm just going to call
this food z ze e ctrl T hold shift scale
that up and somewhere right around there
it's pretty good which happens to be
right around 75 points I make that even
and get this lined up a little bit
better and then we'll get a menu as well
we'll try to get it to match the height
here of the type so we'll use once again
the rectangle tool and I'll simply
left-click and drag right around here
change it to white as well and duplicate
that right-click duplicate layer
bring it down a bit right click
duplicate layer I have a shortcut set up
for that automatically so I suggest you
guys do that too and get that even now
as much as possible I think that's even
right there take these three holding
shift by selecting all hit ctrl e to
merge alright and we'll just call this
menu real quick and the control wine
zoom out a little bit more and we'll
move this over here by holding shift
right around there's pretty good alright
so this is what it looks like so far if
yours looks something similar
good now underneath this the food Z in
this menu right here we're gonna take
the rectangle tool left click drag out
and let's see here that's something like
right around there is good double-click
on the thumbnail here to change the
color
well color drop or get the color picker
right around here and then just make it
slightly darker which is 7 1 or 6 1 7 f
9b
alright ok so now we're going to go
ahead and put our whatever piece of food
that we're featuring and so I have
images.google.com here I typed in
lettuce and we're on the search tools
usage rights label for use with my
modification and we want a size that's I
fairly large and I'm gonna put in white
background
that's really strange I you found
something before one second there we go
I had to change this to large instead of
real large and the one I want to right
here is right here so I'm just gonna
take this right click copy image and
paste this and then what we'll do is use
the magic eraser tool just left-click
once gets rid of that pick ctrl T scale
this down a bit maybe roughly right
around here and select move tool it
apply all right we'll take the tight
tool here let me get rid of that and I'm
gonna left click from the very left edge
to the very right and we'll make sure
it's centered and I'm gonna type in
lettuce all caps locked and I'm using a
color here for the foreground which is I
I don't want that to be black one second
will make this I kind of just kind of
pick that blue color up there and we'll
come around one D alright not 1 B 1 D 1
F and again you don't have to use these
exact color codes and we'll move this
down right around here would be good
then I hit control shift and for a new
layer and then we're gonna take the
brush tool make sure it's a large around
460 for a feathered hardness is 0 brush
and then left click with black selected
with your foreground just once
hit ctrl T hold alt and scale it down or
in and hit apply and we'll take the
opacity down right around 32% all right
and we'll just call this shadow real
quick and then create a new layer great
beneath everything on top of this
background layer and we'll take the
rectangular marquee tool select an area
roughly writing around there we'll take
the gradient tool with the foreground to
transparent preset selected and we'll
stay up black all right right around
there ctrl D to deselect and we're
bringing down the opacity we're gonna
round 14% and then right click and
duplicate the layer hit ctrl T
and move down right around there it's
like moved till it apply and let's make
sure this is they are perfect take these
both layers hit ctrl e to merge them and
then what we want to do is take it and
move it up maybe right around there kind
of just creates a sort of I as if
there's a wall back here and this is the
floor or whatever you don't have to do
that it's just something I'm choosing to
do and I there we go that is it for that
this is basically going to be the
initial activity or the screen that you
see once the ds9 loads up in pixate
alright so let's go ahead and we want to
save this so I'm just gonna call it
mock-ups and what's a switch let by left
click over here and choose the artboard
tool and just a note if you don't have
Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 you won't have
access to this artboard tool because
it's new if that's the case just go to
file new and just repeat what we're
about to do or just go to file save as
and save this again as a new file that
way you have the whole design here to
work with so we're just gonna use the
artboard tool 1440 by 2560 right here
we'll go ahead and click on this and
then we'll left-click right here alright
and what I'll do real quickly is I I'm
going to create well yeah I'm just gonna
leave that right there
alright so what we want to do is take a
few of these got shoved into this
artboard right here and some of them
let's see here yeah there we go
let's I I'm going to take this and just
put at the very bottom we have this
layer 0 that's on automatically there
what we want to do is take all this
stuff and just put it into there and
then we'll move it over with all them
selected all right so the
food see you I'm gonna move this over I
should have initially when I started
made this a art board by default when we
created the document but that's no big
deal
alright so everything now is inside of
this artboard now we just want to
replicate this I'm going to name this
here just I will just call this screen
one and we'll go ahead and click this
over here actually instead of doing that
what we'll go ahead right click and hit
duplicate artboard hit OK alright switch
to move tool so now we can create the
screen that's going to show up and
exactly what this will look like when
this is clicked right here this image so
now what we want to do is I'll go ahead
and take this guy and this as well so
I'm holding ctrl and then holding shift
as well to select both of them and we're
gonna also another thing I should do is
take the shadow as well we'll move them
up you know right around there
now I'm also going to be scaling it and
ctrl T roughly right around there by 20%
and we'll do that in pixate and then
what I want to do is take the rectangle
tool right here and it's gonna lift
click left click and drag just a
container beneath it
alright now I want to give this a
specific color here so I'm going to
paste in 2 4 to 5 to be alright and then
I basically yeah this is going to slide
up and we're going to put some
information in there specific to you
know whatever's up here so I'm gonna
left click and drag out make sure that's
centered I'm gonna put in just 10
calories
we're going to give this a color I think
they're just gonna use this up here hit
OK I'm gonna use railway light for this
and I'm going to put in one cup for the
serving size you know whatever
and then make this slightly less
contrast all right hit okay and then
we'll go ahead and duplicate that layer
drag it down and you can put just some
lorem ipsum text if you wish I already
have some text off screen I'm just going
to paste into there and I don't want
this to go all the way out actually want
some white space in there all right move
right around there okay um yeah let's
see here no I don't want that there we
go okay that's good and then I what I
want to do is put kind of just like a
little bar graph sort of thing that
indicates how many macronutrients like
carbs proteins are fat that this thing
is made up of this piece of lettuce or
whatever so to do that real quick I'll
take the round rectangle tool make sure
we have a large radius up here so the
corners are completely rounded and I'll
just left-click and drag out right
around there and for initial color we'll
go ahead and just choose like our lime
green something real bright and then I'm
gonna hit control shift in for a new
layer one second showing up off of
another monitor there we go make sure
clipping mask is selected right here hit
OK and we'll go ahead and take just a
rectangle tool and we'll click right
around here let's see here and this one
will change to kind of um yeah blue all
right around there hit okay and then
we'll go ahead and just not duplicate
sorry right click and duplicate layer
and I hate when it does that right-click
great click mask there we go
this one's color is gonna be just like
something like um yeah right there is
fine right around there alright and then
we're was put real quickly or don't
worry we're just about done with this
I'm gonna putting carbs here and this
will be the same color as this will make
this bold alright
we will duplicate that layer just over
here we'll put in fats or no protein and
then finally duplicate okay put this
over here and this will be fat again
this color here and protein will match
this as well and then real quickly just
to make it kind of stand out even more
so I'm gonna go ahead and take the
rounded rectangle tool again I'm gonna
left click right around here up to
around there make it white and then
change the layer blend mode to overlay
cool alright so I'm gonna take all that
right here group that up let's go ahead
and move it down get these things a
little bit more situated evenly yeah
something like that that'll work alright
that's good so real quickly let's go
ahead and take your artboard tool one
more time
let's go ahead and we'll just call this
one info and then we'll right click hit
duplicate artboard almost call this menu
all right now for men
you just basically take everything and
hit ctrl e just to merge it all down and
then we'll take this color here
maybe something slightly darker hit okay
take the rectangle tool and this over
here of course is going to be for the
menu when somebody clicks on the
hamburger icon so one second alright so
for the menu we'll just have some I
control H there twice just a text right
here it says menu make that white make
it black I think there we go
make it a little bit larger control T
will duplicate this dragged it down
this one will be light and this will say
my account
make it bigger
right around there as it will work and
this will be database I'm just gonna
make some fake links here support and
community alright and then we want to
get out our character or go to window
character and let's try to experiment
with pushing these down yeah let's try
like 120 nope more than that
so we'll try one woody all right area
stop being a pansy 200 there we go
take this menu and make that a little
bit smaller just standing out I don't
know I think that's yeah
heard around there's good hit okay and
that is it so real quickly before we
consider consider this completely done
what we'll do is I I'm going to get
another piece of food just so we can
show two different things switching back
and forth and so I found this strawberry
will hit copy image real quick and what
we'll do is take this in this will go
ahead and just duplicate that hide the
ones beneath it this right here we can
delete I'm go ahead paste and magic
eraser for the background tool there we
go take this scale down just a little
bit right around there and if you want
to make some image adjustments you can
do so I think I'm gonna take down the
brightness slightly maybe increase the
contrast and whoo okay all right and so
this one will be called I'll one
second where's that lettuce showing up
okay and then we'll just name this a
strawberry okay alright so that's good
so now this is I let me zoom out a
little bit this is basically our mock-up
right here our mock-up flow so we have
the initial one right here this one
shows what happens when somebody clicks
on the food and then this what happens
when somebody clicks on this hamburger
icon menu right there okay so in the
next lesson we'll go ahead and probably
wrap it all up by you know exporting
these nasty necessary assets and then
we'll hop into pixate to make all this a
reality and we'll preview on the phone
alright see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
