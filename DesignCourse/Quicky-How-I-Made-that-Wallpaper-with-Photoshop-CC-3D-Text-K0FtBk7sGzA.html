Seto and I almost didn't do a video
today but I've been on a roll I wanted
to get one done and I only have like I
have to leave in 30 minutes so this is
gonna be just a real quick tutorial
something I wanted to cover because last
few days I've been focusing on doing
this font design stuff it's probably
last I'm going to be covering for a
while but in the time-lapse video from
yesterday I did this I showed this
basically this this graphic right here
with that I did and I'm sure some of
your wondering you know how did you do
that there in Photoshop so I'm gonna
show exactly how I did this it's
actually extremely simple um you can use
this font that I created this is the
font that I used as the basis for this
but you can use any font really for this
okay so let's go ahead and minimize that
I'm in Photoshop right here
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on all right
let's get back to it and I if you want
to fork a res something like this 3840
by 2160 that's my desktop resolution you
can go with that if you wish all right
so I'm gonna hit create and I already
got my 3d panels and up and all that
crap so just the very first thing to
focus on I let me just color in the
background maybe just a mid gray the
reason I'm doing that is just so I can
see easily sorry my dogs barking in the
background just so I can see easily I
the text that's on front especially when
we get into 3d I just had the pause
because I put the dog in the basement
okay so we want to take the type tool
and again if you wanted to be absolute
Center then so I just collapse this tab
space over here then what we want to do
is take the type tool well left click
and drag all the way from the left to
the right and this is just one way to
Center up some text then we'll just go
ahead and make sure this is centered up
here and type whatever it is that
whether it's a logo or some type of
title for something I'm just gonna do
the same one I did before slasher oh
right and of course it's not caps there
we go
and then we'll get our size up correctly
whatever we want I I don't know what's
400 yeah maybe a little bit larger at
600 yeah I'll go 550 all right cool
and then we'll choose the fine of course
I'm gonna use these slasher X font as I
named it slash your X bold and of course
if you want to know how to create a font
just look through the previous two video
so try to remember to put it in the
description although I probably will
forget so you just have to look at this
channel so now we have it all oh by the
way you can use these alignment features
here to line them up Center and
horizontal whatever so once you have the
type exactly as you want it then what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna go
ahead and just go to filter and nope
we're go to 3d rather I'm always go to
filters new 3d extrusion from selected
layer make sure that your your slasher
here is selected I'm gonna choose no for
would you like to switch to the 3d
desktop alright then all this crazy
stuffs gonna come up don't worry don't
be scared too much gonna move this stuff
over here and what is basically
happening is that we have now transform
this essentially into a 3d I layer and
there's a lot of options that we can get
into here when we're messing around with
this but just to keep it simple I
we have extrusion depth that's probably
one of the first things you're going to
want to adjust and that basically
adjusts how far or how thick the letters
are or wide or whatever you want to call
it so if we bring this down a notch you
can see how it adjusts right here I
think that's pretty good right there
around 30.1 inches and then the next
thing to worry about is a 3d panel right
here and this again if you've never seen
the 3d panel stuff from Photoshop it's
gonna be
little bit complex complex looking but I
understand if ur entreaty riyals so we
have the front material and it will kind
of isolate it here so you can see it's
selecting the front it has the front
bevel material which we don't have a
bevel right now so if we go back to
slasher in here in the properties when
we see the shape preset then you have
all these different shape presets and
you notice when we click it it will
adjust or change the appearance of the
bevel so you can see there's a slight
bevel here based on that initial preset
we also have this one right here and
this is the one not a used for the the
basis of that eye that wallpaper eye
design but you can just scroll through
these and experiment these ones get
really crazy though but they have
specific will specifically you kidding
me they have specific use cases I'm
trying to talk fast because I need to go
soon but we're going to choose this one
and then when we choose the front bevel
material right here it's gonna isolate
it how's it kind of like in this black
outline and you can adjust based on
which ever ones you're choosing I you
could choose the diffuse the specular
the illumination all these different
colors and then there's a bunch of
different values like shine I there's
reflection and it kind of gives you a
preview and there's also presets that
you can use before all this as you can
see if you want to make it gold you know
what let's make it gold for the hell of
it I don't even care I wasn't planning
on it but we'll see how it turns out so
that's what it looks like now that's
actually pretty freakin sweet I like
that
we'll leave it like that so then we go
to environment you also have a lot of
other settings that you can you know in
your free time you can experiment with
but I don't want any shadows so we're
just gonna turn the shadow off we don't
want it to cast a shadow at all so
ground plane opacity just zero we don't
we won't want to ground we just want the
text to be 3d and that's that scene
there's anything else I in here nope
nothing I will really want to adjust we
have our single infinite life source so
if we move this off here if we adjust
this and rotate it around
we can see how it quite dramatically
affects the appearance of the
composition so coming back here to the
3d if I want to choose the extrusion
material which is the part that's
extruded right here and we can make
adjustments I've all these panels all
over the place um and I kind of want to
I think I might want to make it a little
bit lighter or maybe I'll just
experiment with one of these presets
over here just for the fun of it like
what happens if you choose this one yeah
it's a little bit lighter I kind of like
that so we'll stick with that alright so
that's all we're going to do in terms of
messing with a 3d of course there's a
lot of other things you can do but again
just experiment and you'll slowly learn
just by repetition so I'm going to close
this out and then I'm going to in our
layers panel once we're ready you may
want to right-click and just duplicate
this and then hide it in case you want
to come back to it
I right click and then just choose
render 3d layer now this is gonna take a
little bit of time also depending on the
complexity of the type and or whatever
object you've turned into 3d but down
here it will give you a progress bar
sometimes it could take like 30 minutes
or more you don't have to wait all the
way but what it's doing is redefining it
is trying to get the grain out I if
you're fine with a little bit of grain
not in it not being perfect then you can
always just hit escape and it will leave
out it'll basically just show you what
exactly it has or up to that point so
you could see the love of quality that
it's already at so I'm just gonna pause
and wait for this to go a little bit
more just so it's a little bit more
refined alright so I don't want to wait
around too long I have to leave soon so
I'm just going to it's at 12% I'm fine
with this and just for the purpose of
this tutorial it looks fine to me so I'm
going to go ahead and just hit escape
and then we'll just right click and
choose rasterize 3d all right so now we
have our two separate layers our
background and our 3d this is what it
looks like pretty awesome just for a
couple minutes of work really so now
let's work on the background and trying
to maybe give this shadows eye or do
something to make it really look unique
basically
you know consistent with what I did in
the wallpaper so of course at this point
you can go so many directions in terms
of being creative so the way I'm going
to go is I wanted kind of like a rock
background some type of just rock
texture background so one great place to
go if you just want to search for images
that are a hundred percent free for you
to use and modify it's just go to images
at Google there's a lot of other sites
you could that are specifically
dedicated to this purpose but this will
just kind of aggregate a lot of them in
you know obviously one location so go to
image of stock Google type in something
like rock texture and then you can go to
this parts real important because you
don't want to use something that's
copyrighted you want to go to tools
usage rights and labeled for use with
modification you know all these are
basically going to be free for you to
use you may want to check out the
specific link just to make sure you're
able to but the one that I found that
I'm going to use and I forget the exact
search term that I used for it's
basically on pixels com I think it's
called is this photograph right here
it's like a rock texture so what I'm
gonna do is just drag this here in to
the composition scale it up I'm holding
shift and alt right around there looks
good we'll choose the select tool just
apply that and now let's make some
further adjustments to it because it
doesn't look that good so we'll go over
here to our layers and right click and
just we're going to what are we gonna do
we're gonna rasterize it and then we're
going to make some adjustments here just
to the the appearance so we could let's
put this over here
real quick and let me close this tab
group right here alright so with this
selected a good way of doing a
non-destructive way we'd be go to
Windows and then we can go to will do ya
adjustments and then we'll choose let's
try brightness and contrast first make
sure it only applies down to this layer
so we choose this icon right here and
then take the brightness so just at the
background
and just take it down quite a bit
alright so I kind of like that maybe a
little bit more kind of like that
alright so then what we can do is close
this tab group now let's make it look
like it has a shadow so there's
different ways you can approach this I'm
going to right click I'm just gonna
duplicate this oops I messed up the name
there and I'm gonna put it - yeah we'll
leave it at the top and I'm gonna go to
now I'm gonna double click this first to
get up the layer styles we'll go to drop
shadow alright so we can see the shadow
we wanted to give a greater distance and
the size to be larger something like
that now that works out but we can make
it a little bit better looking so I'll
show you how so I'm gonna hit OK and I'm
going to right click and we're going to
rasterize the layer styles and now it's
baked into the actual pixels there and
then I'm going to double click once
again to get up the layer styles I'm
going to choose color color overlay
right here leave it up black a hundred
percent at normal blend mode we'll hit
OK alright so now it's this weird
looking thing I'm gonna drop it beneath
the original eye layer right here and
we're gonna go to filter blur motion
blur and we have it up at like a nearly
a 45 degree angle almost putting it at
45
just so we're specific and really push
this up this distance up right around
I'm just experimenting right now
yeah round 351 pixels sorry my voice is
messing up and then we're gonna move it
up to the left a little bit so it looks
like there's light coming from down
because if you recall we did have the
light source coming from up and that way
alright so that looks good
yeah I kind of like that actually
alright great so now at this point we
can you know you can do other things
anything
might be relevant for instance let's see
I did have like kind of blood spatter
before like this so you may be wondering
how how do you do that so let's go ahead
and we want to isolate this front
material face as it was referred to when
it was in 3d and I so with that layer
selected I'm just gonna take the magic
wand tool and it looks to be pretty much
the same shade of dark gray across so if
we select this it'll only select one
layer but if we take off contiguous or
uncheck it and select it again it's
gonna select everything here in that
layer of the same color basically with a
tolerance of four that's important it's
going to select pretty much that just
that face only so when we do that then
we can I'm going to I think we'll use a
new layer for this so control-shift-n
got a new layer there we'll use the
paintbrush tool and notice we have like
a bomb blood spatter thing already ready
so to get custom blood spatter brushes
again just Google is your friend type in
Photoshop blood spatter brush there's
tons of them you can see I clicked on
this one from brush easy and I think
this is the one that I used yeah this
one right here I think it was are these
high-resolution well you want it one
that's gonna be a high resolution if
you're working with a document that's
like 4k res so just look around yeah
these this is actually the exact one
it's their 2500 pixel brushes so with
this selection here and if you don't
want to see the selection when it select
and hit control H and that goes away you
can toggle back on with a control H
again and let's choose like a red color
obviously I'm just gonna go straight up
red and how's that okay that looks kind
of not cool actually what we'll do is
something different instead of having a
selection what we'll do is control if we
control H will do ctrl D to deselect
we're going to delete this layer ctrl
shift n
use previous layer to create a clipping
mask now it's just going to go over the
whole logo but and that may not look
good because it's covering up the bevels
but the real cool part is blend modes
are your friends so with this selected
we're going to choose a blend mode just
click it again it's currently
highlighted once you see that little
blue thing around it we can use the
keyboard down arrow key to start going
down and seeing if there's any type of
blend mode that catches our eye that
gives us a look that we want to
essentially this might be a little bit
more difficult
simply because I wasn't working with
this gold before alright so this is us
up close here let's see here alright so
that's the normal
it's just covering up everything this
might actually not be bad sometimes if
we right-click and duplicate them you'll
get a different effect but not in the
case of multiply you can see there's my
new differences between some of these I
like color burn the most so far this is
kind of bright this is pretty cool here
if I right click and duplicate that it
comes in a little stronger so we can
just kind of dial it back a little bit
more and then of course if you wanted to
you could always take for instance the
the eraser tool and maybe set it at an
opacity of like 50% and kind of just
tear away from this a little bit and by
the way we can just I hide that initial
one
so just along the edges that are kind of
beveled or the extrusion section we can
kind of erase that a little bit and
again this is entirely up to you it
would be fine just to leave it how it
was almost
all right and so then I'll delete this
one and just replicate this one so
duplicate the bottom was a hundred
percent alright so coming out yep there
we go
that's basically what I did to create
that effect now there's another thing I
did I wanted to show you real quick or
it kind of has like this red that's kind
of it's like a gradient almost it's just
coming up over everything there's
multiple ways you could achieve this we
could for instance let's see here can I
merge this I think I don't just merge
this for now I'll be destructive about
it I'm gonna right-click and well yeah
we could just do this we could do a
layer style I think just to achieve the
same thing we could do a gradient
overlay alright so click on gradient
we'll just - we'll do this second preset
or it has a red to transparent it's at
90 degree angle and then the blend mode
same thing select it down arrow right
here that looks pretty cool multiply so
there's a lot of really cool things that
you can do with the yeah there's like
there's like there's been like five or
six that I think that look really cool
and it give you a lot of different
effects for this I'm just gonna choose
one and not be too picky here
yeah I'll choose that one and then of
course if you think it's too much you
can dial it back a little bit with the
the opacity oops not not that da yeah
the gradient overlay opacity rather over
here there we go
there we go and there you go and then
finally if you want to make some other
adjustments to the the the composition
as a whole you can use your adjustments
and it brings up this massive window
over here and then you could change you
know the brightness or if you want to
add a photo filter which is kind of a
common technique to the whole thing to
warm it up like this color this is a
warming filter we can take the density
up and you see how it's kind of just
giving everything an overall tint which
is pretty cool you could do that and you
can keep on adding these adjustments as
you wish and there we go guys so
hopefully I you learned a lot this is
obviously a powerful technique that can
really create a dramatic appearance very
easily with photo shops 3d tools alright
I have to head out now so I will talk to
you guys later as always make sure you
subscribe give a comment and check out
