course where you're going to go from
design to code from start to finish
while creating a fully hybrid app hi I'm
Gary Simon and I've been a full-stack
developer for nearly two decades and
I've produced courses for LinkedIn
thorough site and Envato network now my
passion is teaching others how to build
full projects by example and that's what
this course is all about you're going to
build an ionic app which is based on an
extremely powerful hybrid framework for
building Android iOS and Windows apps
our app is called upcoming games this
app will allow users to sort through the
latest upcoming games in any genre users
can search games favorite games and even
watch trailers and learn more about each
game
so what will you learn in this course
logo design designing user interface
mock-ups creating interactive prototypes
and on the development side installing
ionic connecting to an API templating
and material design launching your app
on your phone and so so much more now if
you're only interested in design or
coding that's perfectly fine my project
files are set up in such a way that you
can jump in at any point during the
course now while this course is based on
just one project I'm a firm believer in
quality over quantity so if you're ready
to begin learning how to build a real
app that people are actually going to
want to use let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
