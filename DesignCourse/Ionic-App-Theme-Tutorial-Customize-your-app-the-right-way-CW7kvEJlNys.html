today we're going to talk about how to
properly theme your ionic app and this
involves using SAS variables and also
understanding how to use the official
documentation so we're going to run
through a quick project from scratch so
I can show you and then you can gain
confidence going forward with really any
type of layout dreaming options or
component issues in terms of coloring
and positioning and all of that all
right so I'm gonna switch to my desktop
and the first thing we're gonna do is
bring up for consul here yeah
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on all right
let's get back to it we're just gonna
start a new project now I'm going to
assume that you already have the
prerequisites installed nodejs NPM and
the ionic command line interface tool so
we're just going to put I on ik will do
start you name the project ionic theming
and we'll create the side menu template
just real quickly and I'm going to hit Y
for yes to target iOS and Android and so
the reason I'm putting the the side menu
template is simply because I wanted to
set up the top navigation bar with a
little menu there just to give us
something interesting unique to look at
all right so I was just waiting for this
to load alright so now let's hop into it
with CD ionic theming and then we'll put
in ionic serve - L now before I hit
enter I just wanted to let you know that
there's this really cool new app from
the ionic scheme called dev app search
for it in the Play Store apps were for
Android or iOS and it allow you to live
reload and show exactly you know as you
may
changes as you're developing your app on
your phone which is really cool it's
just really like I think within the past
month here all right so it's gonna load
alright so let me drag us over here okay
so I think it's CIF by both iOS and
Android here in the lab view and you can
see under platforms I have both of these
toggled on alright so the first thing
that we'll consider is how do we change
the theme from light to dark right now
we have the light theme so to do that
very very simple of course let's open up
here Visual Studio code I'm gonna open
up the project here I'm off screen for a
second alright okay so to do that we're
first going to go to source and then
theme and then variables dot sass right
here so we're gonna be working within
this file quite a bit and if we scroll
to the bottom to change to the dark
theme you can see where here we have
import ionic theme default change
default to dark and then save and as you
can see we now have our dark theme very
very very very simple stuff okay so when
it comes to theming one of the I would
say the most important aspect to
understand is right here the colors SAS
map so this is called a SAS map you see
that it's just normal variable called
colors then it's opened up into this
parentheses which upon with a bunch of
colors with their property in value
specified here okay so for instance I
let's change our primary color and by
the way let me split this up real
quickly so that we can see on the left
and write our code editor along with our
project here okay so this right here
primary is what this buttons using this
is that blue and essentially this is
what most components will use as the
primary color so let's say for instance
we want to change this to a pink
type of color so I'm gonna put EC 1 for
B e will save it and there you go as you
can see very very very simple but what
if we wanted to change our navbar
background color up here as well as we
can see it's pretty much just dark gray
or black color well to do that let's hop
over here to our pages home and home
HTML and we can see that this is the
HTML that structures this section right
here we have the menu icon and we have
the home title right here so what we
want to do is add a color attribute
equals oops primary alright so we'll
save that and voila
berry there you go nice something thing
to note is that not every single
component and this is a component here I
on - and the name of the component
allows you to specify the color
attribute so just know that going
forward and you can really check that
out in the documentation and we'll be
checking that out momentarily so let's
also talk about how to add custom colors
to the colors sass map that we were
looking at so to do that go back to our
variables and we simply put in a comma
and let's create one called light-dark
which will kind of be an in-between
value and we'll put a color value of
three six three six three six alright
we'll save that and now this has been
added as a new color in the color sass
map but one thing to be aware of is you
every time you add a new color to it it
will increase pretty significantly the
file size of the CSS because it will
generate a rule set for each one of
those components with that color alright
so let's also talk about customizing
components based on the actual device
right here we have iOS versus Android
and we could see that there are slight
differences but you will notice even
more diff
if we were to start integrating some
different components so to do that let's
go to our home HTML I'm gonna hit ctrl B
by the way to get rid of the sidebar
you're in Visual Studio code and we're
gonna add a toolbar with a search bar
inside of it so to come right here paste
this in and we'll see it just has an ion
tool bar ion search bar and by the way
make sure that you know if I'm sitting
here pasting in code pretty much with
all my video tutorials here on YouTube
I have a written version so in the
description you can click on that
written version you can see all the code
that I'm copying and pasting that way
you know it's not so unfair that I'm
just that you're pasting you have to
pause or whatever so even though this
isn't much HTML but um so we have this
here to save that okay so now we can see
that significant difference right off
the bat iOS can't see anything when it
comes our Android yeah this actually
looks okay so how do we solve for some
of these discrepancies well the first
thing that we can try is if we can add
the color attribute here to our toolbar
we'll say color dark let's go ahead and
save that and now that has fixed this we
can actually see what's happening here
now however the Android version didn't
update at all so why is that well what
we want to do in this case is we want to
check out the search bar documentation
because that's what this is we're trying
to change the search bar what if I want
this search bar to look like this one
over here well let's look at the
documentation real quick for search bar
and here's the URL again this is linked
in a written tutorial if we go all the
way down
we'll see sass variables so let me back
up real quick right now we're in the API
section so if I go to back to main Doc's
for instance and I click on API that's
going to take this where we were
and then we just scroll down and click
on search bar as you can see there's
very there's a lot of different
components and they're all pretty much
structured the same they have SAS virial
variables section right here with a few
different tabs of iOS material design
and Windows platform that shows the
appropriate SAS variables and so the one
that we would want to find is because
the thing that we want to change going
back to our example is this search bar
input so if we scroll down if we click
on material design for instance that's
the one we want to change material
design is applicable to android we'll
see that we have or if we hit ctrl F and
hit on a background there it is we can
see right here by default it's colored
that way so all we have to do is copy
this and we'll go back to our variables
and under app material design variables
this is where we would paste that and
redefine it all right so what if we
wanted to make our light dark our custom
color in the colors SAS map I'm very
simple we simply put color and then
inside of it it accepts two parameters
it's going to be the name of the color
SAS map colors and then also the actual
color that's defined within light dark
so let's save it and now you'll see
perfect now they're much more consistent
all right
so let's practice a little bit more with
this so you can get more muscle memory
trying to figure out how to change
different aspects and it's not just
colors you can also change padding
margin sizing all that stuff so what
we'll do is I'm going to and by the way
this is one of the points where you're
going to want to refer to the written
tutorial because there's a lot of HTML
am about to paste in so do that real
quick and I'll show you which part we're
gonna be pasting in we're gonna go to
our home HTML and I'm going to copy and
then replace all of this stuff right
here in ion content so
paste this so what I just pasted was
this ion content class equals card
background page so we're gonna have
several cards from the components and
then we're also going to have our ion
fab a fab button which is a floating
action button alright so by default if I
just save this we're going to see that
we have some broken images so we have
this assets images there's four
different images and again all this HTML
is coming from that documentation so
what you want to do in order to get
these images to work is refer to the
documentation
all right background cards with images
we can just take this we can go and save
image as first I'm going to refer back
here
hit ctrl B go to assets right click and
reveal an explorer because II just
showing up right here and then the
section that we want to go in is and
assets IMG s we're going to simply save
them right in this folder so I'm going
to copy this location and then
right-click on each one of these save
image as and as you can see I was
working on the same thing previously so
we're gonna save that there save image
as there save image as there and then
one more time save image as okay all
right great so now going back we refresh
this we now have our images now of
course it still looks like garbage
because we have a little bit of CSS to
paste in as well so that's the SS once
again it comes from the official
documentation for cards and we're gonna
go to home a CSS and just paste this in
and save okay now it's looking pretty
decent let me drag this up so we can
actually see the whole layout
okay so now at this point let's say for
instance we want to give ourselves more
margin for where this floating action
button is like we think it's maybe a
little bit a little bit too close to the
top and right well referring back to the
documentation if we go to floating API
floating action button API right here
scroll down we can see under sass
variables this time we have an all which
means there pretty much global sass
variables that will apply to all three
of the platforms we can see right here
fab content margin alright by default
it's at ten pixels so let's say we want
to double that to 20 all right we'll go
back let's close this out and we'll go
back to our variable sass and we'll just
put this right here and we'll say 20
pixels so we'll save it and watch it and
there it goes it moves in on both of
them all right so let's also notice I
once we click this let's say for
instance we want to change the
background color of each of these sub
buttons right here that come from this
fab button well let's go back to that
same page that we were at and we'll see
fab list button background color so by
default it's at that real light white or
gray color let's copy that
we'll go underneath it put in a new
color let's just say color colors dark
this time save it and there you go
all right so hopefully you learned quite
a bit throughout this and really
understanding how to work with those SAS
variables is that that's the most
important part and also understanding
that you use the the official
documentation for the components in the
API section and that's what's going to
tell you exactly what you can change
alright so I'm Gary Simon of course
Tetro has always make sure you subscribe
here and like later coming very shortly
we're going to be started focusing on
creating desktop apps with electron
which is basically doing that with
JavaScript and it's really cool I'm
excited about that all right so I'll
talk to you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
