are going to be designing and developing
an Android app as seen here called quote
field when you launch this app a
three-second splash page will show up
and then forward to a simple layout the
purpose of this fictional app is to
simply allow users to click a button
which will pull and display a random
motivational quote from a MySQL database
while this is a very simple app you're
going to learn a lot if you're new to
Android app development first we're
going to step inside Adobe Illustrator
to design the logo in app launcher icon
then we're going to design splash screen
in the main user interface in Adobe
Photoshop then we'll structure our
layout in Android studio create our
MySQL database write the necessary PHP
script to pull the quote and then
finally step back inside Android studio
to connect the app with the PHP script
which will ultimately allow us to
display the random motivational quote
you're going to need access to both
Adobe Photoshop and illustrator you will
also need a web hosting account in a
domain name you can purchase very cheap
web hosting accounts and domain names
from sites like GoDaddy so don't let
that deter you from proceeding forward
with the course before we begin you
could check out the Google Play Store
and you can actually download the app if
you have an Android phone to use it it's
free so don't worry about that and then

awesome designer whether that be through
