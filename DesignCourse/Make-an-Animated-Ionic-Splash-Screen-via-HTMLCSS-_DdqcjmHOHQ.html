Gary Simon of course tetro let's take a
real quick look at a video I made of me
holding my phone showing off this
plastering that are going to create an
ionic alright so that was an HTML and
CSS based splash screen and it gives you
the added benefit of being able to work
in animations with the aid of CSS so
this is something that you couldn't
currently do with the Cordova splash
screen plug-in so before we begin check
out course cetera comm for more ionic
and also angular 2 and very shortly
angular for content and also subscribe
here on the YouTube channel alright
let's get started alright so I'm going
to make the assumption that you know if
you're interested in creating a splash
page then you probably have already
worked with ionic or maybe not so if you
don't have the aunt and the ionic
command line interface installed already
then you need to head on over to course
set your calm and watch our free ionic 2
course and that will get you up and
running or just Google somewhere else
and find out how to install the ionic
command-line interface so once it's
already installed in your in your
console or your command line we're going
to go ahead and run ionic start we'll
just name it
ionic splasher or at least that's why
I'm going to need mine we'll use the
tabs template and then v2 for ionic
version 2 so I'm just going to pause
this while I wait alright once that is
done we're going to CD into our new
folder flasher and then also run ionic
serve - L for lab and momentarily this
will launch a browser point it at
localhost I believe it is 80 100
we'll find out yep it is and it'll show
us our project here and because I use
the tabs starter template we'll see we
have our tabs down here we can go back
and forth
and we'll see that the default page that
loads is the home page this is going to
be the area where we want to put our
HTML and CSS for the splash page
basically on top of the HTML that's
designated for this stuff right here
like the title and also the header it's
going to have the splash page HTML it's
going to overlay on top of it with the
help of CSS ok so enough talking let me
go to my code editor which is Visual
Studio code I have our ionic splasher
project open and the first thing that we
need to do is find our home HTML so it's
going to be a source pages home and home
HTML ok so on the other monitor that I
have I'm referencing here on the side we
have I the HTML and in this written
tutorial that I'm just kind of going
along as I record this video instead of
just sitting here and typing out all
this HTML which would be kind of boring
to watch I'm just going to copy and
paste it in so just right above I on
header we're going to put that right
there so where did I get this from well
if you're watching this and YouTube just
click on the written tutorial link and
you'll see right here I just grabbed
that from this section right here ok so
just to give you a brief you know
explanation of what's happening here the
only section that's required we're here
or the only give really is just this
right here it's the div ID custom
overlay also right here we have property
binding on style and onto the CSS
display property and what we're saying
is if this right here if the splash
property exists or if it defaults to
true then we're going to set display to
flex as in a flexbox based layout or if
not then we're going to set it to none
we're going to hide it all this stuff in
here is just optional it's just what I
chose to you know structure formulate
the splash page based on this fictional
project
okay so after that's done that's the
only see a our HTML rather that we need
now we can move on to the CSS so right
here home SCSS for a sass and get rid of
this right there and once again I'm
simply going to copy and paste in some
CSS alright so we have our custom
overlay this stuff here is improvements
required the background color obviously
you can change that but it's just a
position fixed with the width 100 and I
really high Z and X great I'll need that
high and then also all the other stuff
for this stuff so like right here this
flb I have an animation applied to this
and all this animation will do which
I'll paste in momentarily is just kind
of fade this in and I this is also
displayed as flex and then we have this
aligned item and then top and bottom all
that's there for is just to take the
logo SVG file and make sure that it's
centered vertically all right and then
we have the image reference here and
this also has an animation applied to it
okay so sticking with the animation I
I'm going to paste in another bit of
animation here or CSS rather so this is
just a very simple pause for fate we're
fading from the zero opacity to one very
simple and then also as mentioned in the
written tutorial if you want like a real
complex animation but you don't want to
sit there writing out all that animation
you can check out this site right here
this is bounce j/s right here calm and
which is cool so I can just show you a
preset of some sort so I forget which
one I used yeah it was roadrunner right
here and just gives you a brief like a
preview of it so this could be the logo
for instance so if you want to use this
export CSS and then you just grab you
don't really need this I you just grab
real quickly all of this you can see
there's a ton of it and again this is
completely optional you don't have to
use it
but I decided to and we'll go back and
I'll paste it in down here see it's like
insanely long that's okay we'll go ahead
save it and now that we're done with the
HTML CSS go to our home ts file and
we're just going to work solely within
the class of homepage here and the first
thing we need to do is create a property
of splash equals true so by default when
the app loads up splash will be true
which means if we go back to our HTML
then it's going to set this custom
overlay div right here to display flex
because flash will be true all right and
the next part if you're using the tabs
layout like we are in this tutorial
although sometimes you may not be using
a tab base layout if you are then we
want to reference tab bar element and
we're going to set it's a type of any
again if you're using tabs inside of our
constructor here now if you're not using
tabs don't worry about this don't even
do it just fast forward we're going to
reference this dot tab bar element
equals document query selector and set
it to a class of tab bar all right so
basically it's looking for the tab bar
class and it's binding that class in the
Dom to this tab bar element all right
then for this next part this is for
everybody who's falling along I on view
did load lifecycle alright so same thing
gets to view loaded then execute
whatever is inside of here
so real quickly this is for everyone as
well we're going to call a set timeout
function alright and inside of here
we're going to open up and specify this
dot splash
equals false all right and after that
we're going to put a comma and we'll set
it to 4,000 milliseconds which is four
seconds all right this right here this
is all you have to do if you're not
using tabs now if you are again then
we'll also put in this tab bar element
and style that display equals none so by
default when the app loads we want to
hide that tab bar so the whole reason
we're doing this whole tab bar stuff if
you're using a tab bar base layout is
because the tab bar overrides or shows
on top of the splash screen at the
bottom so you probably don't want that
if that's the case this is what this is
the workaround to try to get rid of it
when the splash screen is in view and
then what we do inside of here inside of
the timeout after four seconds we set to
just the display here of the tab bar to
flex all right so again just a real
quick real quick recap if you are not
using the tab layout then you don't need
this this this or this line so there's
basically four lines that you don't need
all right so I'm going to bring them
back because our project is using this
and we'll go ahead and save it now we're
not just done quite yet we also need to
remove the default Cordova splash screen
that shows up because when you use the I
on a command line interface to start a
on a project then by default it has that
splash screen enabled so we just have to
head on over to our config.xml let's put
this right around here pasting these two
preferences in and that is fresh splash
screen delay zero show splash screen
false we'll save that and then one final
thing when they make sure that we have
some sort of graphic in here in HTML
we're referencing
I assets /lo go SVG so I have one of
those here and open this up and Explorer
alright we're go to assets I'm going to
paste in this logo SVG I'll try to make
that available for you guys just for the
purpose of testing or you could use any
other graphic that you want doesn't have
to be SVG alright and so now should be
able to go back to our lab here refresh
no toolbar see your animation and there
we go so we can also click around go
back and it's not going to load it again
because we used it on the appropriate
life cycle alright alright so hopefully
that was helpful make sure you subscribe
here at YouTube if you haven't yet just
click the little subscribe button down
there and also check out for stretch
accom alright I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
