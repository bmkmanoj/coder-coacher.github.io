comm today is January 28th with again
our 28th video of the year and we are
going to take our iPhone breathalyzer
and create a homepage design mock-up and
Photoshop CC so it's gonna be based on a
12 grid system and if you have no idea
what that means basically we have the
intention of making this responsive in a
grid system helps organize the HTML and
CSS and basically we're going to try to
stick within using two grids to format
and structure our layout so again if
this is confusing don't worry you'll
understand as we progress into the HTML
and CSS in the next couple days so as
always check out design course calm the
project files are available for free and
you will need them I for the grid and
all that stuff so anyhow let's go ahead
and get started alright so the first
thing you want to do is go ahead and
download the project files
I either on design course comm or
YouTube here in the description and once
you download that zip file and extract
it and these will be the files you see
we want to open up grid and so this is
going to be the document where we design
the actual site so unfortunately I'm not
on a bigger resolution for this tutorial
so I'm at 66.7% basically I want to see
the whole thing and right here we see
these these guides they're basically the
grid system that we're gonna use for
HTML and CSS to make it responsive and
also try to basically just line
everything up here so if you don't
understand what this is you'll see how
it all comes together at the end of the
tutorial when we get to the HTML and CSS
part all right so to get rid of the
guides I'm going to be hitting ctrl H
and basically what that does is view
extras it'll show and hide that so
that's just a for your reference so the
web the website background we're gonna
we're going to leave white so
or just leave it at that now the next
thing we want to do is in the credits
when the description of this five video
and YouTube here you can go ahead and
bring up where the hell is at one second
this right here okay so this is I found
this image first bike let me hit this by
this site this is a handy site if you
need to try to find images that are
under the Creative Commons license so I
just typed in bar I think and that image
came up and so what we want to do is
download this and come over here hit
download and then we want the one that's
original so it's click on that wait for
it to load right click and copy image
here in chrome and we'll come back or
you could save it to your desktop do
whatever and then we want to open that
up or paste it in rather ctrl-v alright
so as you can see i we're not gonna be
leaving we're gonna be pretty heavily
blurring this thing out so what I want
to do is go to filter blur and then
Gaussian blur and we're gonna want
something that's around twenty seven
point eight pixels you have to be exact
but just something around here and then
I'm also going to apply an adjustment
layer so if you click on this for
adjustments and we go to a hue and
saturation and then click this little
icon this means it will only apply to
this layer not all the layers will take
down this hue just or the saturation
rather just around there all right so
now what I want to do is open up the
phone top alright so as you can see I
cut it out from my top render and also
this is not the the version of the phone
that I created during in the tutorial in
the previous lessons the
the one I created first before I record
everything I think that one worked out
kind of better but no big deal
if you want to use this one you know
it's in the project files you can use it
or you can use your own that you did for
your renders I and all you have to do to
cut yours out I mean it's very simple
here's all I did you know you zoom up
pretty close
you take that pen tool make sure path is
selected and then you just go around the
entire outline with the pen tool you
know in using you know shift to make a
perfect vertical and horizontal lines
and then just go around the whole thing
once you have it all cut out for example
let's just assume R so as just go to
right click make selection make sure
anti-alias is selected hit OK and if it
inverts your selection like that go to
select inverse and then ctrl C to copy
and that cuts it out of the background
all right so what we want to do is
control a and then control C and control
V to paste that thing in all right so
let's see here now I'm gonna work on the
actual navigation so I'm gonna call this
phone top first and I'm going to take
the rectangle tool and black is selected
that's what we'll use and hold alt and
come down
you know maybe right around here ctrl H
to get rid of that view twice and we're
going to give it an opacity around 62%
I'll call this navbar and I'm just going
to I'm not going to really focus on
creating a logo it's just gonna be a
type of logo and make sure white is
selected and I'm just going to bring up
a grid I'm gonna click right here in
this first one and I'm going to type in
BAC STR and right now left align that
and let me go ahead and get rid of the
grid view I'm gonna go 100% and we want
this to be smooth
and control t hold shift and scale it up
right around there and I'm going to use
a font called sort a coarser T or
whatever and that's right here okay and
then I'm going to also duplicate that
control shift D or right click and hit
duplicate layer and if you don't if
yours hockey isn't set up for that you
can just go to edit keyboard shortcuts
and find your way through there to
create your shortcuts I'm just gonna
scale it up ctrl T shift alt and second
move tool hit apply all right
get rid of this let's zoom out here
alright so far so good now let's take a
look at this grid here basically the
position of this let me find the Baxter
copy and phone top will just take both
of those and hit ctrl G all right and
I'll just type the phone top now if we
take auto select group can move this
oops
I'm gonna lock that we can move this
around and so you know this will span
the width of one two three four five and
we'll Center this image when we get to
the HTML CSS so it right around there
and then we're going to have some text
over here but first I want to get the
nav up there going so we'll go ahead and
take the type tool and we're going to
use source sans Pro that's kind of the
free font that I use in most of my
videos it works well and before I change
that we're going to I think roughly
you're right around here starting at the
sixth lord it wait one two three four
five six yeah right here just drag out
all the way the width of those six
columns and I'm just going to type in
some navigation menu links so I'm typing
shop for my first and we'll be adjusting
the size of all this
and I'm just going to space out some
arbitrary you know amount and then take
all that and copy it and then just paste
it in five to four more times so one two
three four all right I'm going to get
rid of the gridview for a second here we
want to put this up top I'm gonna go to
100% just so I can see what's going on
I'm going to quickly adjust these
details back add some frequently asked
questions help and contact you know
whatever and I'm going to go to source
and SPRO and we'll leave it at white I
believe and then we'll change the font
size I'm gonna try 16 zoom out here
get up our grid and let me do you like
that and just push this over here to the
beginning one right there all right so
that's the nav and now down here we want
to get started with our main headline
and so what we'll do is move zoom back
out so I can't because I can't see
everything it's a pain recording this
tutorials with this smaller resolution
and used I'm used to a lot bigger but
anyhow no big deal
let's get a grid out here and with a
type tool and I'm going to select I
think right around here and just drag
out left click all the way to the right
I think right here would be good and I'm
going to type in the first oh wait I my
caps set
the first iPhone breathalyzer alright
take this we're gonna make this pretty
big maybe not 36 48 I think that'll work
well yeah I'm gonna take that down to
like 40 I think no 44 alright and then
I'm going to just duplicate that ctrl
shift d pull this down take the font
size to just try like 18 maybe it's got
a small yeah it does try like 21 and I'm
just going to type in real quick never
again take a chance on the streets
without knowing your blood alcohol
content BAC let's say 99 I'm making us
all up obviously 0.5 percent accuracy
Baxter as you were back okay
exciting alright so make sure we change
this to sharp and that changes it you
know more realistic to what it would how
the text would render in a browser
alright and so come down oops ctrl +
left click will kind of do the same
thing if auto select were selected so
that lets you select the layer let me
just zoom out a bit
use your up and down arrow keys a spaces
out and then I'm going to have a call to
action button which is simply you know
something the user can interact with and
a button is certainly that so take the
grit up here and with a 3% or 3 pixel
radius will alt and drag out to the
width of 4 I believe yeah we'll see if
that works well hide that get this out
of the way and we want to make the color
something that will stick out pretty
well hit okay and then hit ctrl H to get
rid of that or hit it twice rather and
then we want to go ahead and just put
the text here order your Baxter
now ctrl T shift scale that down select
the move tool it apply and if you want
to make that regular so it's six out
just a little bit more that would
probably work ctrl T scale it back down
again hit apply
alright so I think I want to move some
things around vertically so auto select
group right here will take these layers
holding shift and selecting them all and
just kind of moving them up a little bit
alright so you know this view this
design that we're doing is kind of the
design the appearance that will be
presented in the viewport the browser on
a larger screen and so when it comes to
responsive web design we will also be
with the HTML CSS we have to kind of
imagine you know how this is going to
look when the browser or the viewport is
smaller so going from like a desktop
size maximized window and then going to
like a tablet size you know how are
these things going to be adjusted well
this will get smaller a little bit on a
on a tablet type of viewport and so will
this and they'll space between these
these two elements basically will also
shorten and then on a phone when you get
to that type of width things will kind
of get stacked on top of each other so
we'll see what you know how that works
when we get to that point
all right so real quick I'm gonna click
on the background layer and I'm going to
create take a rectangle rectangle
rectangle tool and just click at the
very top left outside of the document
hold alt and I'm going to go right
around
here I kind of want there to be an even
space between the top of this and the
bottom of this and then we're going to
right-click on this and select create
clipping mask so the only thing that
gets shown in here is you know based on
the height and width right here so
that's what a clipping mask does alright
so now we have this top portion
basically done now we want to come down
here and add some more content so let's
go to file open from the project files
and we want the phone perspective now
this was you know again the one that I
did before I recorded this tutorial but
it's basically but very close to
whatever you know we did when we when we
went through the tutorial so just ctrl a
ctrl C copy that control V to paste ctrl
T scale down hold shift so we want to go
pretty small but before I do that I
should have got the grid up let's get
that grid ok ctrl T scale this down and
I want this to be the width of two of
the grids or columns rather so I think
right here hit apply and now I want to
take the type tool and I'm going to drag
out to four right there okay and I'll
just type in if you're but first let me
switch back and just so we can see this
text get black so it's pretty large so
let me hide that we'll go to light
change this to let's think here maybe
like 16 and why is it doing that so
messed up let me see 20
leave it there for now if you're under
your limit you're good to know and your
and your Baxter will be lit green I'm
just thinking of this stuff off the top
of my head okay I wanted three lines and
into what else to put that's it
all right all right so yeah you know
what I think I'm gonna get this down a
bit more to 18 and actually I'm going to
move this again makes more sense to get
that line fill it up over there a little
bit more so I'm gonna move a here nor
two vertically in the center here and
I'm going to zoom out um now we're going
to duplicate these two so I'm going to
select with auto-select layer on here
the text and hold shift and take that
layer duplicate it or them rather and
we'll take the grid up and make sure
this is aligned properly so let's just
use my left arrow keys and get rid of
the grid view take this and now
ordinarily if this is a serious product
I would get a screenshot of the video
when we had the red thing going and use
a different number but just for the
purposes of this we can just go ahead
image adjustment hue/saturation take
this down to a reddish or a red color
rather right around there and then well
let me zoom up so we can see this
if you're over your limit you'll know
certain with this is so stupid this add
coffee I but that's okay
are this copy rather you'll know it for
certain with behind a card okay or
behind a car who's the idiot
alright wheel you're an idiot okay let
me move this over it's a little bit
purple in there it's what happens
sometimes these weren't the same exact
colors but that's fine alright so let me
zoom out here just kind of get an idea
what things look like right away I think
these are too big so I'm gonna scale
this down a control T select both of
them right around there so I'm holding
shift and all
scaling goes down hit apply get her grid
out just so we can make sure this is all
aligned properly now basically even
though this isn't the exact width to
grid columns we could still Center it
like that and we'll do that in the HTML
and CSS CSS rather and now things you
know this is a little bit too big it was
squished up a little bit so now we fixed
that now I just want to take these four
layers I want to shift and just move
them up a little bit you do I do want a
lot of wave space but too much and it
doesn't make sense
alright so around there and then we want
to go ahead and take the rectangle tool
and we're going to work on our final
section and we'll make it right around
there we could adjust aside the size if
we need to in a bit and ctrl H to get
rid of that twice and we want to take
the color and just I'm going to use ePHI
v5e five for the hex
code and then we're going to open up
phone side so it's relay and then
control C to copy that and then control
V to paste that in now here's what I did
basically I did what I did with the
other one and I just cut it out with a
pen tool but I also added a shadow
underneath it and just real quickly show
you if you you know if you really did
want to use your own phone and you want
the same kind of effect all I did was
take the brush tool and you would create
a new layer underneath your phone that
was cut out like this control-shift-n
and then you would take black color and
then with a large feathered brush like
600 you just click once there hit ctrl T
and then drag it down holding alt you
know something I write around there and
then you could just a size like this
holding alt and then you move it kind of
underneath hit apply and then you could
adjust the opacity as needed and then
you take both of those layers hit ctrl e
to merge them that's all I did
alright so now let's move this down and
we are going to want this to be a little
bit bigger ctrl T right around there put
this near the bottom ok so just what
everything looks like so far and up here
I'm gonna have like three sort of
testimonial type things so what I'm
gonna do is go to file open and I'm
gonna open up my image ctrl a ctrl C to
copy that close it out and then go ahead
and get our grid up and I want my head
to be basically I try to think about
this here are three yeah these are going
to be four columns each because we're
gonna have three of them and so in this
in air all going to be centered so I
right in between these
for we can hold shift and take out this
ellipse maybe right around here
let me just hide that temporarily and
then I'm going to hit ctrl shift and for
a new layer select create clipping mask
hit okay
and then I'm going to ctrl V to paste in
my image usually it just paces right in
the center if you take this lasso tool
you'll see it's right there the reason
we can't see it though is because this
is a clipping mask it will only showing
there so we could take the move tool
just unselect that ctrl T scale is down
shift and alt you know whatever right
there alright and then if we wanted to
you don't have to do this I'm going to
though stroke will take it up to like
five I think make it white hit okay and
hit okay okay so now let's get our grid
back and we're gonna have some text and
it's gonna need to be centered and we're
gonna drag out to the width of four of
these columns so we'll Center it and
then we'll put Gary's story now we don't
see it because it is accidentally a
clipping mask so if you just drag it to
the top it'll drag it back down that'll
work and then zoom up here to a hundred
percent and get rid of the grid and then
down here I'm just gonna hit enter and
type in it's literally saved my life
I could have died alright in quotation
there and then let's take this when I
move over here and go ahead take this
and we're going to make it just a
slightly lighter color here and yeah let
me see if we're using eighteen I think
that would be fine it's kind of hard to
visualize the scale things when you're
working in such a small resolution you
can
see the whole thing at a hundred percent
but I think that'll work
so I'm gonna take auto-select layer here
take these layers and move them a little
bit holding shift vertically and then
I'm going to get the grid deselect
auto-select layer control shift D to
copy those and then just do the same
thing right here and then duplicate it
again and put this over over here
alright and then this is not centered
this image which oops just controlling
left click to select that and I think
right around there it's fine
alright so what's going to happen with
these you know when you take the
viewport window and you pull it in or
you're looking at on a like a some type
of mobile device and by the way I'm
looking at this I'm gonna fix this real
quick take this and that'll allow us to
use auto select layer and then just take
all of these layers and you want to not
select that that bar scene so just hit
ctrl left-click now it selected all
these layers I could move them up
because this was not even and let's see
here
you want to even distance between the
bottom of this at the top of that and it
looks pretty good alright and me just
this again I think that it's look looks
pretty good and so what I was saying you
know if you're looking at this through
like a tablet this would kind of gets
it's gonna get a little bit smaller and
then a phone these will get stacked on
top of each other same thing with this
and this will just kind of automatically
scale down so I'm gonna end the design
there obviously we could create a footer
and stuff but just for the purpose of
getting your feet wet with
responsive web design this is more than
enough to get started all right so of
course I tomorrow I will be releasing
the first part of the HTML and you know
that might be a 2-person step process
because before we even get to the HTML
we have to say about our images and get
those kind of extracted from this
document in a sense and then probably
just get the HTML document set up and
ready to go all right so of course check
out design course comm if you haven't
yet subscribe here on YouTube and I will
see you tomorrow
all right good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
