comm and today we're going to be
digitally painting and I'm gonna aim to
try to make this a beginners tutorial
and I wanna cover every single step so
if your beginner with digital painting
you know of course all you need is
pressure-sensitive tablet you'll be able
to do this but first before I begin I
wanted to show you guys a page here and
this is a site called Gumroad comm a lot
of digital artists and probably other
creatives are you know they put out
tutorials here on here and they sell
them very cheaply and the reason I have
this particular individual up here which
is DN Louvre EC I'm not sure how to
pronounce the last name is because I've
been following a lot of his tutorials
because I've only had my Wacom Cintiq
and essentially my first tablet for
about a month now and I've been watching
a lot of his tutorials this one this one
this one and this one down here and
they're dirt cheap
and a lot of what I'm going to be
teaching today is very similar to how he
paints and also even the subject matter
the body armor essentially so I'm just
going to be diverging a slightly
different I'm gonna do a couple
different things in my own way just
because I'm more comfortable comfortable
but again I wanted to I you know kind of
pay respect here and you know have all
you guys I give him the exposure because
I'm gonna be teaching
similar to how he does so definitely
check this out they're gonna take $2.00
per tutorial all right so I here in
Photoshop if you want to be looking at
the same exact interface that I'm
looking at here so you can follow along
exactly as I do you can go to window and
workspace and just click on painting and
then window workspace and then I reset
well actually if you already had
painting just hit reset painting that
way you're gonna look exactly one I'm
looking up so you don't want to do that
though Thea already have your custom
workspace arranged arranged already so
let's go to file new and we're gonna
stick with these dimensions 3000 by 2500
it doesn't really matter you know the
aspect for our
an image it's gonna be you know just
like a shoulder armor piece I but you do
want it to be higher resolution like
this probably at a minimum all right so
resolution 72 is fine as well you can
give it a custom name if you wish
I'm not going to though and that loaded
up off-screen all right so what we want
to do is I now that we've you know we
have this this workspace to arrange I'm
gonna make some adjustments to it so I'm
gonna left click and drag and pull this
off and I'm also going to expand it that
way kind of condenses everything and
then I'm also going to pull off the
layers panel and I'm also going to go to
window color and drag that off and
expand it roughly right around there and
then I'm also going to collapse this
area over here so that we see a large
portion of this alright so I the
background as well I have it set to
black so if you just right-click it you
can change you know to anything you want
really I kind of do like black so what
Dan used alright so for me when I went
to file new by default I've had it set
at background contents transparent that
so if your by default it is white I
believe I so I just want to make this a
gray color so we're gonna switch over
here to the paint bucket tool and change
the foreground color just to a medium
gray somewhere eight nine eight nine
eight nine is the color code if you wish
to be specific and then just left click
alright so we're going to take this area
right here and click get to create a new
layer layer two you can name them
probably a good idea but I'm not going
to my keyboards kind of off to a
different desk to the side alright so
basically the first step is to get out
our basic shape and the part where I'm
gonna diverge and be completely
different than what I've seen any other
digital painter do is probably this
first step most I are pretty much all I
would say that I've seen so far I've
been watching a ton of
last month digital painters they they
will use the paint paintbrush tool and
they use a black color and will change
this now I'm on my stylus I just I
clicked a button to get this to show up
or of course you can always just go up
here and choose your brush settings here
and the ID would use a size roughly you
know written around here give or take
some pixels with the hardness
up to a hundred percent so it's a hard
brush and with a new layer selected just
begin drawing out the basic shape of
whatever it is that they want to do I
and there's obviously nothing wrong with
this because almost everybody does it
but I find that if I use the pen tool
instead right here because I have a lot
of experience with the pen tool I find
it much much easier so if I just
left-click once we'll see this initial
point here and then I come down and hold
roughly run around here to create a
slight Bezier curve and then come down
around here and maybe back up a little
quick now I'm using on my Cintiq the
Express keys for undo and several others
which I will explain as I go along
right around there looks pretty good so
that's the general shape I and you know
I just realized I screwed up because
this is in path mode and not shape mode
I don't think there's any way to let me
just back up real quick well you get to
see me do it again
so make sure you have shape mode and not
path mode selected alright so I'll do
that again you get to see this again so
left click sorry about that
paint any ass see as you can see it
fills it in with color immediately which
I kind of find is desirable because
otherwise what I've seen other digital
painters do is
the second step will be coloring it in
see right around there all right so
we'll take the move tool and I'm gonna
hit ctrl T on the keyboard
oops and then hold shift it all and just
drag this up so it's a little bit bigger
it apply alright so looking at this
again we can always take the direct
selection tool and adjust the anchor
points if we want to you know make
adjust adjust Mint's to the overall
shape so amy pull this in a little bit
so that kind of comes in like this pull
that in so just imagine you know a
shoulder you know how this might wrap
around pull that up and maybe make an
adjustment here
pull this in a little bit right around
there so if you have a shape that's like
that that's that's perfectly fine you
know it doesn't have to be specific you
know perfect to mind i if so yeah once
you get your shape out and once you know
any other digital painter I found you
know once they would get this part done
with the line I with a paintbrush they
would then take the paintbrush and fill
it in manually and that could be just a
little bit difficult to stay in the
lines and have a perfect eye whereas
using the pen tool will automatically
create a nice perfect outline okay so
now what we want to do is I'm gonna give
this a base color and so we're going to
use if I double-click on this I'll bring
up the color picker I somewhere in the
blue something too saturated nothing too
bright nothing too dark either maybe
right around here it says 2 5 2 2 5 2 8
2 a for the hex code and ok so this is
the very outside contour of the shape so
what we want to do now is add
other shapes within it that go around it
so once again I'm gonna use the pen tool
and I will create a new layer and right
click and choose clipping mask so
anything that anything outside of this
shape here will not get seen all right
so we're gonna create some just a couple
of others so I'm gonna start right
around up here and come in like this now
I'm a backup from time to time if I
don't like where this is going yeah
maybe something like that and up and
around all right and I'm going to create
an area roughly right around here and
come up and around now that again this
way is not a culling mask but we'll make
that adjustment after
let's see
now I don't necessarily exactly like how
that played out so we can just make some
small adjustments real quickly right
click and make it a clipping mask ctrl H
we'll get rid of those outlines always
bring them back by hitting ctrl H again
drop this down just a bit
alright like that I'm gonna hit ctrl T
make it a little bit bigger it's like
move tool and at the spacebar alright
and then we're gonna hit I ctrl shift
and D that will duplicate it ctrl T hold
shift and alt bring it in and let's make
this one the same color as this so we
can just color pick that right there
move this up roughly right around there
this one's not going to be completely
black so we'll just get this color but
we'll make a little bit darker get okay
alright and there will be just one more
shape that we create here and so I'm
gonna click right here will
automatically create a new layer which
is gonna be clipping mask if you had it
beneath one that was already a clipping
mask and again I'm still using my stylus
here coming down
yeah maybe writing around here and then
around oops there we go all right so now
this one will be black
this initial one right here is gonna be
more like this color
I'll hit okay all right so that
completes this section I love you know
blocking out the major parts so now
we're gonna actually get into the
painting aspect of it but first let's go
ahead and take these layers here I'm
gonna hold shift to select all them and
hit ctrl G to group them and then ctrl
shift D to duplicate and if you don't
have that I'm not sure if that is a
shortcut that's by on Photoshop by
default or you just gonna right click
and duplicate group or layer whatever
but I i duplicate so many times I
definitely use a shortcut for that so
that's just a tip for you guys and so
this group won't appear we're just on
creating this so that we can have the
same exact shape layers I because what
I'm gonna do now is take all these and
hit ctrl E which I know that is a
default shortcut and that merges
everything onto a single group so we can
hide this and this will come in handy
layer later layer later and I so you'll
see why once we get to that part all
right so now is the actual digital
painting part so so now what we want to
do is take the brush tool right here and
if we right click or use your stylus to
click will bring up the brushes here
that we have now depending on whether or
not you've added brushes in the future
you know yours may look completely
different if you don't mind about
possibly losing those and you want to
see what I see
you can just go I click on this menu and
hit reset brushes and okay alright so
these are the default brushes that ship
with Photoshop
alright so these down here charcoal
brushes and so if we just click on one
that's this says 63 it doesn't really
matter which there's some different
settings that go along with each one of
these even though they looked
same and those settings can be found I
have this set on a Express key on my
Cintiq you can set this as well if you
wish
I believe the shortcut here under window
is brush presets possibly or maybe just
know it's brush yeah this is what we
want and from now on I won't use that
and I'll just use my Express key to
bring this up I said tutorials and
courses probably could be you know
created just for you know learning how
to use this because it gives you a ton
of control over your brushes I
specifically you know if you're using a
tablet so I to create the brush that we
want to use to paint you know most of
this and to give it to this sort of you
know sci-fi metal feel or whatever I
we're gonna have to create some very
specific settings in here and so I'm
using a brush that settings that are
gonna be very similar to what Dan used I
the person I discussed at the beginning
of this this video so the first thing we
want to do is i under brush tips shape
you want to make sure if spacing on at
five percent the size you know it's just
that's just the size of the brush i by
default that doesn't really matter too
much we're going to come down here turn
on shape dynamics and make sure pen
pressure is specified and we want to
make sure that for this the minimum
diameter is set to eighty percent or
around there and come down here to
eighty or actually maybe around sixty I
think it was around sixty three actually
and then we want to turn off dual brush
but we want to turn on texture and for
scale we're going to leave at 58 percent
i we want to change this mode to
subtract and then we also want to change
the depth here to eighty percent and
then one final area is transfer and we
want to make sure a pen pressure and pen
pressure is both on alright so now that
that is out of the way I
you can save that brush preach that if
you wish by clicking over here new brush
preset I'll go here and just call it eye
painter or whatever all right all right
so now I'm gonna go ahead and just close
that out and we want to make sure that
we have this color here selected in our
foreground so switch back to our brush
and we're gonna make it just a little
bit lighter up around here now you don't
have to be specific just somewhere in
this general vicinity will definitely
work all right so we're gonna be started
here I'm going to increase the size of
my brush a little bit and we're gonna
assume that the light source is coming
from you know the primary light source
will be coming from this way this
direction and so naturally this side of
it will be a little bit lighter so I'm
going to go ahead and just start
painting
and you know what I think I'm gonna go
ahead and undo all that because I made a
big mistake I did not lock that layer
what you want to do before you begin
that is actually click this little
button it kind of acts like a layer mask
except it's on the same layer itself so
anywhere you paint will be I you know
constricted with being inside of the the
shape that's defined already in the
layer so sorry about that like that and
obviously since we do have in the brush
presets I the pen pressure specifying
the transfer I the harder you press the
lighter it will be I so as you get out
further this way with is less light you
can and I have this set up through an
express key on my tablet or my Cintiq
you want to color drop or color pick the
the colors that you're already working
with and very slowly work with fading
these in and out of each other so it's a
good idea to definitely get in the habit
of doing that so if this is like one of
your first videos you're watching
definitely take the time to set this up
correctly and get used to using your
keys and your shortcuts and it will be
like I found you know everything is
still fresh in my memory in terms of I
you know just learning how to do this
all this did this digital painting I and
I found that when watching tutorials
it's a little bit difficult to follow
along when you're not familiar with you
know all these shortcut keys and you can
your your tablet and all that stuff but
it just takes time you have to stick
with it
otherwise you'll definitely get
discouraged and so I'm just kind of
trying to get rid of some of them the
areas that maybe you know you can see
clearly defined lines that separate some
of these it's not entirely
100% perfect you don't have to get it
perfect right away but as you can see
they're kind of slowly going away as I
do this I and again it doesn't have to
be perfect it's so I'm gonna go and get
maybe a little bit quite a bit brighter
of a color here and I'm gonna stay just
along the edges here oops
so undo that and again the control Z I
have that set up on the Express keys
all right so now what I want to do is
start to define some of these inner
contours around here you know the way
you do that of course is through eye
highlights and shadows so basically
we'll go ahead and get started
eye with this one right around here
all right so it's kind of important to
get the this portion right in terms of
you know correctly defining you know
where the highlights going to be versus
the shadow for the light source so I'm
going to just color drop and color pick
this color right around here
and make it slightly lighter and I'm
gonna scale down the size a little bit
and just come down down through it would
be too messy about this
just like this coming around
and if you screw up you can always fix
it you know you can always color drop
this part and maybe you know bring this
in a little bit and really it's just a
matter of just trying to well
essentially muscle memory you really
just want to try to I keep on practicing
with getting these shortcuts correct
sometimes I will screw up a little bit
and press the wrong thing alright that
is decent for now and so we're going to
go ahead and we're gonna make this a
little bit darker inside here so if I
take this color right here now maybe not
that dark that hard I was pressing a
little bit hard here
all right and take that color here back
up I'm gonna make this eye a little bit
bigger
and then I want this material to kind of
peer very reflective almost maybe like a
sort of leather or something like that
so the way we'll do that is first let's
go ahead and just color pick this
absolutely it's almost black right there
and let's get rid of some of the paint
strokes that we had on there all right
and for this we're going to use I still
won't stick around into blue and but I'm
not a hundred percent white but almost
very what light ligh blue like that and
so to do this we're gonna want to zoom
up and this is as well I have this I set
as a hotkey oops on my or Express key
and so let me see what's just this looks
like at this size and one thing I think
it would make sense if we bring up our
brush presets again or the brush panel
we could probably turn off texture for
this because there's not necessarily
texture on something that's very
reflective so it'll respond quite a bit
more and I think when you press down and
so we'll just do this a few times and
you can be random about it now if you
make little adjustments like this it's
going to make it appear kind of rough
and you know that's entirely up to you
if that's the direction you want to take
it and this is just a lot of different
reflects and reflections essentially
they're occurring on this thing all
right and then why not tip that I
learned from Dan as well is we can use
the lasso tool and come on down around
here maybe
all right and then right click and
choose feather and we're going to change
so just hit my mic hopefully and mess it
up we're gonna change the feather radius
I'd say two maybe five it okay what that
will do is it will feather you know from
the edge I based on what we're about to
paint in here so if we right-click this
and we choose a feather brush you go
pretty large
maybe maybe right around here and we
want to get a color first we'll go ahead
and color pick I am maybe right around
here we'll see what this looks like when
we add this depressing very lightly just
like that and then we've hit ctrl D to
deselect we'll see that that looks like
I think maybe the feather and was a
little bit too much so I'm gonna back up
go back here to lasso tool feather and
try three instead all right and we're
gonna do the same thing real quickly
maybe like that I'm pressing very
lightly control D ha kind of having the
same effect I wonder if I when I
feathered it before I'm gonna redo this
really quickly I'm sorry
right click feather three and then we'll
go back okay
all right that's a little bit better and
so it kind of creates a very soft
reflection maybe we can do that just one
more time again I'm still using my
stylists and then what we'll do is I
right-click feather hit okay
and come around right around there all
right so it looks pretty cool so far
okay so now what we want to do is we're
gonna head and focus on these two edges
right here all right so we'll go ahead
and switch to our other brush which is
right there the one that we created
that's custom and we're going to scale
this down quite a bit
all right I don't know why my computer
is making that and always want to do
that and so we'll start with this outer
edge right here and I'm gonna go ahead
and just color pick out this color maybe
make it a little bit lighter and we'll
zoom up now my mic is kind of in my way
so let's make it hard for me to access
this Express Express key but I'm gonna
use it and this allows me to rotate the
canvas I so I think control R might be
it but again I have it set up on my
Cintiq so I'm gonna switch back to my
brush and it allows you to kind of
easily go around areas that you need to
so it's a good to get experience
essentially you know with I using this
so still this isn't a great angle so
what I'm going to do is also flip the
canvas and because I've have this
rotated kind of funky one secondly flick
this back
there we go it's gonna make it easier
for me to go along this edge alright so
let's see or we'll start on the inner
portion of the edge
and it's just a very thin edge as we can
see
and I'm gonna switch back here
so if you need a moment to pause because
I you know I'm flipping and stuff and
you don't got it right you know yet
that's completely fine let me zoom out
now we're also going to want to add kind
of like on the outside a darker color
that will help define this edge and this
rim a little bit so I what I'm gonna do
is we're gonna flip yep
no we're going to take this back and
flip it up like this drag it down
alright so we're going to take my color
pick it right here or we just make a
darker
okay so I know this is rather boring
nothing I can really talk about let's
see here flip it drag it up
all right almost Dino with this area
kind of like that all right so I one
thing we definitely want to do as well
if we come down here kind of add this so
that it goes over this highlight
highlighted part and we'll make some
other adjustments I to make it you know
this part recessed a little bit right
there a little bit but I so let's go
ahead and zoom out all right we have
this all lipped differently I think this
is it let's see here
there we go
all right so I now we're gonna do
essentially the same thing here for this
inner port portion let me close this out
and don't worry I we're about to get to
the pretty now the fun stuff very
shortly so yeah the same process the
same method that you know we did over
here we're gonna do for this area as
well alright so I what we'll do is color
pic here lighter color
and this time I'm just gonna really try
to test my hand-eye coordination and
because I'm trying to battle this
microphone that's sitting around right
next to me and I'm sure I probably
bumped it and I didn't probably have
some weird audio issues that are kind of
occurred
hopefully not though damn it this is a
hard angle alright that's fine and then
I take this a little bit darker let's
see here come on the inside may not end
up seeing this portion though so but
we'll see
all right so now I want to create some
kind of just destructive elements to
create the idea of wear and tear on this
thing so I what we'll do is get a
lighter color and we'll make it pretty
thin a small brush like that and we'll
do just do this in a couple different
areas like that maybe and then what we
want to do is get a different a darker
color here you get a little bit larger
brush and then slowly make it smaller as
we get towards the edge kind of like
that and do the same thing down here
kind of pressing a little bit lighter
further we get away from the crack
itself all right so that's kind of a
quick way to create cracks I go ahead
and get the same sort of color around
here and get a real thin small brush and
you can create just some random areas of
I just scrapes and scratches and such
alright alright so now what I want to do
this is gonna be the part where we
utilize these these shapes right here so
what we're gonna do is add a honeycomb
pattern over this inner circle portion
right there so what we'll do is I did a
search just on Google for free honeycomb
patterns basically and this is one of
the results I downloaded it you can
download it right down here
this download button is kind of hidden I
and then once you download just open up
the ethic it's a Cobra or zip file
that's a zip file and then double click
on the p80 file and what it will do
essentially it'll switch to photoshop
but nothing will seem to happen but I
what we want to do is go to file new and
I'll just make a sighs that's a pretty
large two thousand by two thousand and
what I'm gonna do is just fill this in
with I a color here you know maybe we'll
go like a brighter blue right around
there and double-click on it and that's
gonna bring up the layer styles and
we're gonna go to pattern overlay for
the actual pattern we're gonna choose
one of these this is what we downloaded
that's what actually got added so
there's a lot of different options here
it seems as though there's some thicker
ones and some thinner ones it gives you
a lot of options based on whatever look
you're trying to achieve I think this
one in and of itself apart be pretty
good
we're so yeah we'll go ahead and hit OK
and then what we want to do is hit ctrl
a to select all and then edit copy
merged then what we'll do is we're gonna
open up our group here and with this
layer selected right there we're going
to hold the ctrl key and left-click
right there that's going to create give
us an outline or selection of that exact
shape and then what we'll do is hit edit
paste special and paste into alright so
that's not
how we want it because uh it extends a
little bit because that's how the shape
was based on the layer mask but we'll
fix that don't worry about it so we'll
hit I control T I'm going to scale it
down just a little bit holding shift
we're gonna rotate it a little bit like
this and then right click and hit warp
so we want this to look like it's you
know along the contours of our armor
essentially so we got to move these and
play around with them a little bit in
order to get it to look like it's you
know actually kind of 3d in a sense
alright and just moving these around and
this doesn't look too bad just pulling
this down along the edge thick right
there is okay select move tool and hit
apply all right so what we can do now is
take this initial layer and ctrl + left
click and then go to select inverse go
back up here and hit delete that way it
gets rid of that edge up there okay so
I'm gonna pull this out on top of that
group layer and hide this so it looks
okay now well not really i but that's
where all the magic comes in and with
blend modes layer blend modes which is
right here so if you select it and you
can see it's a very fairly high delayed
to blue you can use your down arrow key
to filter through the different layer
blend modes to see I you know different
appearances and different looks
essentially I and there's a lot of
different cool ways that this kind of
shows up and presents itself so I just
got to the bottom I think I liked you
know one of the ones that I liked pretty
decent is a color dodge and I think
that's kind of it so color dodge will
work for now right around there
alright and so we can also adjust make
adjustments
we can go to image adjustments and in
play with the adjustments here in terms
of the color and saturation or you can
play with I let's see I adjustment
layers themselves so if we go to windows
adjustments this gives us kind of a
dynamic non-destructive way of
experimenting with I different values
here all right so yeah you know why I
think I'm just gonna stick with the
destructive way just because I know one
thing's getting sticky later on so
curves you can see we can make it
brighter or not we don't want to stick
out too much although we're kind of
going for a glassy material so I think
right around here will work yeah that's
fine for now
alright and I do want to kind of make it
look like it's been shattered so we'll
take the lasso tool and come in right
around here you know do whatever you
want hit delete and let's see here yeah
I don't want to yet get rid of the
selection just because I want to make
this a different color down here so
color pick this area and make it kind of
darker or color pick this area and make
it maybe somewhere around here and then
go back onto our group here our group
layer which the rest of the painting is
on and kind of start painting inside of
here just for now I'm gonna stay inside
just this Ridge
and so remember when you're trying to
blend things remember to color pick a
lot
and then I want to come in a little
quite a bit darker on just underneath
that area maybe not that dark
all right and I do want to we're gonna
make this a little bit thicker this
darkness and then inside of it I do want
to make it look like there's a thickness
to the glass so what we're gonna do is
color pick let's see oops oh I just I
instead of hitting the color pick I
accidentally hit undo so let me do that
real quick again all right and there we
go if make sure I'm hitting the right
express key now if we hit control H
actually it won't do anything I thought
it would yeah that will allow us to
paint without seeing those marching ants
essentially come up a little bit
brighter I'm gonna get rid of the
texture as well I make this smaller
actually I think this needs to be a
little bit brighter
actually let me see what white looks
like and the reason it was showing up
kind of like that because transfer was
on let's see just in a very very edge
all right something like that I'd say is
okay
I it almost kind of looks like it's a
little bit too white I shouldn't have
done that
so let me just go over this very lightly
all right that's good for now I think
all right
and all right so looking at this I let's
go ahead and I'm going to take this here
these two layers hold control take
control
e that's now going to merge everything
and I'm going to work with the
reflective area of this to make it stand
out a little bit better so why we don't
want texture on still so let me go ahead
and increase the size of this brush and
see now let me see here okay office
because that's control D yeah we have to
make sure we D selected that area cuz we
had this only selected for that time see
here somebody's calling me of course and
all right so sorry is my wife I had to
answer that
all right okay so I'm come down over
here
yeah yeah that's fine just like that I
think we want to make sure that this
layer is still locked
you don't want to go that way though
alright and I you can also come around
the edge and we don't to look i crap you
like that
there we go up there as well all right
so I also want to give it our own custom
pattern in this area right here I'm just
gonna really help kind of bring this out
a little bit more so the way we're going
to do that is we're gonna come back to
this document or just create a new one
if you closed it by accident and we are
going to actually nevermind we're gonna
create a new one anyways um we're gonna
make it just a relatively small 40 by 40
all right so we're gonna fill us in with
a darker blue right around there and I'm
going to zoom up a bunch and we're gonna
take the ellipse tool come out in the
center and drag out a size roughly right
around there and make it black and then
we're gonna go to edit and then define
pattern almost call it pattern 20 or
whatever the preset is for you alright
so then we're gonna bring back our group
here and let's see where is it's this
shape right here alright so what we'll
do is I think that will that should work
like that I think that'll work what we
can do is I double click on this we can
actually just deselect it and bring up
pattern overlay um actually no we don't
want to do that I'm sorry I'm how am i
doing we're gonna go back over here
change the pattern overlay to the very
bottom new one that we created like that
select all copy merged and what we'll do
here is do what we did before and I'm
just going to yeah we'll just control
left-click and we will create a new
layer and then put it outside of the
group hide the group ctrl V to paste
oops go edit paste into rather make sure
you select a layer all right so this is
real large I hit ctrl T yeah we can I
think that'll be fine right around there
and then right click warp and just move
these around
kind of like this remember we're not
going to see this portion but we're
gonna see the outside so as long as
these are a little bit larger than and
they get smaller coming in we should be
fine let me drag this yeah that's fine
right there okay all right so we'll
select move tool hit apply and just go
ahead and change the layer blend mode
just to see what this ends up looking
like I let's go back to our group though
we're in real quickly control left click
on this layer and then come out over
here and hit delete one second there we
go we had to click on it for that to
actually work I'm also going to select
this one ctrl left click go to select
inverse select back up here and hit
delete all right so let's go ahead and
keep on experimenting with the different
blend modes now that we have this in
place now that doesn't look too bad all
there's not a lot of contrast so let's
keep on going on this one there's kind
of not enough
so you know going through these you can
always add or make adjustments to how
it's you know you're not constricted to
just disappearance alone because you do
have the option of you know let's try
soft light and experiment with adjusting
the curves and such alright so we'll go
to image adjustments curves a lot of
guys have that setup as expressed keys
as well I don't yet maybe pull it up
over here hit OK image adjustments hue
and saturation see if that does anything
and it does let's see right around here
looks pretty good and hit OK alright
let's see
yeah that's not too bad looking at it
from this angle all right on second time
I don't really like it having this much
color so I'm just gonna go image
adjustments hue/saturation and turn that
down the saturation that is and hit OK
all right so I let's go ahead and just
make just do a couple of the things
we're just about almost finished I go
ahead and take this color here and yeah
let's go ahead and merge up some of
these layers there we go
and it's creating an area that kind of
makes it look just kind of like I gonna
make that smaller one second like this
whole portion is just kind of broke
maybe like that and then we'll get a
darker color maybe even just almost
black
right around there and on second thought
this may be a little bit quite a bit too
bright
roughly something like that there I
think that makes a little bit more sense
so sticking out was way too bright over
here it's a different material so
perhaps a little bit different but yeah
as you can see you know you can really
experiment with this quite a bit I I
think it's looking a little bit too
bright over here in this section so if I
just take this color over here let me
make sure of something make sure the
layers lock there we go make sure we
stay inside of the lines all right
something like that
and something like that maybe well we'll
see yeah that looks okay yes all right
and that is it this is already kind of a
longer tutorial than what I wanted it to
be so yeah that is pretty much my first
tutorial on digital painting I kind of
suck but I yeah hopefully you guys liked
it and learned quite a bit I tried to
cover every step imaginable so you know
somebody who's really experienced not
teaching private yellow knock this out a
lot quicker but yeah hopefully you
learned a lot and yeah make sure to are
be sure to check out design course comm
and subscribe here and YouTube if you
haven't yet all right talk to you later
good bye
