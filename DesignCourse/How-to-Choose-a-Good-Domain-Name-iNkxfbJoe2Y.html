today we're not going to do any design
work I'm just going to talk about
something that's very important if
you're a freelance designer or a coder
or anybody who's creative you always
should have a website so before you have
a website of course you have to have the
domain name so most people are most
beginners rather you know their method
of choosing a domain name might be just
to go to a site like GoDaddy calm try to
do the search there and find something
ultimately that is available and that's
it well that's the wrong approach
there's a lot of different ways methods
tactics techniques that you can use to
try to find a good domain name so that's
what I'm going to do in this video a
little bit is just talk about just a few
ways on strategies that you can use to
try to find a domain name all right so
basically if you haven't yet check out
design course calm and subscribe here on
YouTube alright so basically the way I
approach finding a domain name I will
usually start off at instant domain
search calm and I've used this for quite
a while and basically what's cool about
it is if you just start typing any type
of characters it will show you what is
immediately available down here I we can
see the design course without an e is
available and it also shows you the
other extensions although sometimes
they're not 100% accurate I've seen it
sometimes say that something's available
when it's actually not unfortunately
I but yeah so I'll usually do this and
if I do find a name that is available
that works in it I for the company name
I I'll also go ahead and check Google to
see if that company name has been
established or already used even though
the dot-com or the.net or whatever
extension are going to go with is
available I
a funny story one of the the last mega
this tutorial I did I I read I found a
domain that was available freely
available and I I did a search for that
domain on and Google and that name was
barter full calm so I just typed in
barter full and I saw that someone had
put up a video already about introducing
barter for calm and I actually happened
to be just like a fake type of company
for a class like a college project I
guess but someone had already owned it
so it's kind of nice to know I where if
there's ever any type of history
associated with the dot-com or if
there's already a company name that's
associated already being used as you're
calm and you obviously kind of want to
avoid that so I I'm going to close that
out real quick so basically when it
comes to choosing a domain extension com
is most preferable now of course there
are very successful nets
I even dot Kozan orgs you don't always
have to but most people the average
person when they think of a domain they
think of the.com first so there's
definitely higher value in that so I if
we also come over here say for example
you didn't really find anything
everything's taken you can also come
over here to this site busted name comm
and they're just a great way to help you
come up with different ideas and they
have also have different tools here
there's a domain search and then a
domain maker and that's really cool
because you can make domains that start
or end with a certain word so if we type
in design make the domain looks natural
limit domains to ten characters so you
can kind of control how long they are I
in hit go it immediately comes up with a
really fast group of results that the in
which these are all free and so this is
a hugely help this is actually what I
use to make barter fall calm so yeah
this is a great site to check out if
you're kind of stomped and you want to
come up with a domain name I second if
you actually you know maybe you don't
you don't want to go this route maybe
you really do want a certain calm that's
already available well you have a couple
options when it comes to design course
comm I really wanted that name but a
domain name squatting company they were
using it so they owned it and so what
will happen you'll see some of the times
is let me bring up another window here
design course net this is what kind of
showed up that you'll see these type of
landing pages all over for a lot of
domains they're already registered but
they're owned by a different company and
their sole purpose is trying to make
profit by selling it so if you're
interested in buying this website name
click here to inquire and you can really
go back and forth with it with these
people to try to get the price down
because also maybe they do want to sell
I so when it back when I bought design
course calm it was I think it was like
fifteen hundred bucks but to me it was
worth it it was a good domain name on
and obviously being a keyword domain so
I that's one thing to keep in mind a
another to keep in mind is to check out
snap names calm and this is an
interesting tool because it allows you
to browse a list of domains that will be
expiring soon so obviously most of you
already know that when you register a
domain name you don't just permanently
own it it's a thing that has to be
renewed annually so every 12 months you
have to renew it unless of course you
buy bulk years and what happens is
sometimes people for whatever reason
they'll let it expire me most people
probably gave up on the idea I some
people maybe got a new email address
forget to check the notifications that
come in from the registrar alerting them
down you know the domain is about to
expire and that has happened in the past
because some really awesome domains have
actually gone into in expiration and
you're able to bid on this because these
companies like snap names they're able
to I really register them quick and
you're able to go into potentially
bidding wars with other people who also
want the name so I've used this in the
past I've actually quite a long time ago
I haven't used it recently but you can
click over here in categories for
example let's just say technology and it
gives you all these different types of
searches so you can specify the
extension over here you can specify the
different types of listings and and all
this stuff and it allows you to sort
these columns I so if we sort by bidders
we'll see there's 39 bidders who want
click site comm and you'll see some
really good domains in here basically
and if you just browsers so many that
expire every single day you can also
order order by the order by column to
see which ones you can get are about to
basically I expire real soon and this is
a great idea so ultimately we have the
domain name you know that you know which
one you want to buy a step that you
should take for every single one of them
even if it's one that's you know it's
not an expire name I let's say it's a
brand new name I like in my case I
thought barter for calm probably no one
has ever registered that before you know
whatever well
always check irq org and they have
something called the wayback machine and
if you type in a domain even if it's
currently available it will go through
an entire kind of like a calendar it'll
show you all throughout the years I you
know give you a snapshot of what that
site looked like roughly it's not like a
functioning site so in the case of that
barter file calm if I go there hit
browse history
and we'll see in 2013 you'll see it kind
of pops out and we click here on the
first we can see it doesn't always load
the CSS so it's just showing the HTML of
this eye you can see on any given date
and you can kind of filter through them
what the site kind of looked like in the
history of it so that's always kind of
helpful as well and also another tool to
use is majestic SEO and when you go just
to there.com and you type in a domain
name it'll give you some information
about the website so this is
particularly useful when it comes to the
the snap names like the act the expired
domain names and anyone that you're
going to purchase as well you can see
how many backlinks and backlink
basically is another link another
website that links to one of the pages
or just the domain of the site so design
course comm is 1700 backlinks with 273
different referring domains I and they
give you a lot of information here and
one of the things that you kind of want
to be wary up to is that you don't
register a domain name that has been
penalized in the search engines like
Google I if you go over some of the
backlinks and you kind of do a good
thorough history of it you could see if
I potentially had spammy backlinks
because some webmasters they'll try to
game the the search engines and if
they'll spam the backlinks and then
their site will be penalized and you
just don't want to buy a site that's
penalized obviously I and then secondly
or not secondly I think we've gone
through a bunch of these I when it comes
to like I mentioned before I mean if
there's a domain name that you
absolutely want hit that I would check
the Whois of the site so I always just
go to who is SC / design course comm so
you just type in who is SC for slash and
then whatever the domain is it could be
nent or whatever
I and there's there's a lot of other who
is tools they all you have to do is just
go to google and type them in but I've
always used hue is dicey and then it
forwards to this name right here and I
it'll give you if they don't have a
privacy lock on it it'll give you the
person's information and you can hit
them up
I maybe if they want to sell it or you
want to put an offer on it I
so another information a very important
tip I would say is if you can try to
register the other domain extensions I
dotnet endured I think around by the
same company and I know they're going to
charge all the out so I just haven't
done it yet but I especially when it
comes to your own name like your
personal name try to register that as
well I otherwise you open yourself up if
you get some somebody mad you're some
ass or something register your name
you're your own name comma put crap on
there I so basically that is it that's
basically my approach towards it in
obviously if when it comes to
registering a domain name you're trying
to build a solid company try to make the
domain name reflect the actual name of
the company sometimes people will try to
get a different domain name I like blog
combat they're their company name is you
know something completely different
I'd say always try to make the domain
names your company name I there are
certain exceptions obviously if you can
really score a very maybe got one word a
single word domain like cars.com or in
my case I use design course comm then
you can actually structure your company
around that I those are of course
keyword domains and those are very
valuable of course I but yeah so those
are just some tidbits I about different
ways that you can acquire domains and
just because one is not available
doesn't mean that you can't you know
Posse obviously you're going to pay more
than a free one but I are not a free one
but the one that's currently available
but it's definitely worth it
getting up an email sending an email or
if they're hosted on one of these sites
all you have to do is give them a quick
call and see if it's available all right
so that was just a quick video for today
I've been busy as hell so I yeah
tomorrow look forward to a new video and
if you haven't yet check out design
course comm and subscribe here on
YouTube alright good bye
