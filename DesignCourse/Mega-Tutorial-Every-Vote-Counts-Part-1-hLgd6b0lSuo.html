today we're going to go ahead and model
the toilet as a part of our every vote
counts 3d poster design in blender all
right so check out design course calm if
you haven't yet subscribe here on
YouTube all rights get started alright
so if you've never used blender before
in you're going to attempt to do this
tutorial I'm going to try to go as slow
as I can although try not to be tedious
and display describing every tiny little
detail but I do have the screencast keys
on so you can see what i'm typing and
clicking but basically to select objects
you right click them to move around in
to view port sorry i was looking at this
is the first time i use the screencast
key so it's looking at that yet to move
them around you just hold your middle or
third mouse button to zoom up you use
your scroll wheel and to pan you hold
shift and you use that middle or mouse
third mouse button which doesn't show up
on here alright so i'm going to go to
file new reload startup file so we're
looking at the same thing that's the
only only introduction i need to give to
the interface I probably a better idea
to follow a more simple tutorial before
beginning this anyhow now that i think
about it but I so the first thing we're
gonna create of course is the toilet so
we have to ask yourself you know what is
the first part of the toilet we're going
to start with and what is that basic
shape so I want to start with a seat and
that's obviously more of like an oval so
I'm going to delete the cube hitting
delete in the netter so not what I want
to do is add an object so to add you can
get good to add over here or just what
I'm going to do is hit shift a and hit
that again there we go my screencast
keys went away what the hell is that
shift a and we want to add circle
alright so I'm just going to drag it up
here a little bit and let's imagine that
this is the toilet seat
normal toilet seat usually is not like a
perfect circle it's more like a I oval
so what we want to do is kind of just
scale this in so what we can do is hit s
now allow us to scale it and we want to
scale it on x axis on that red line
right here so we hit X and so it's not
like this of course unless you have a
weird ass and you can make a custom
toilet seat it's more something like
this right around here you just eyeball
it and that'd be fine I i also want to
scale down just a little bit right on
there alright and so now what I want to
do is go into edit mode so we're an
object mode object mode allows you to
scale things rotate and move them around
I object mode you can access down here
by going to edit or we can just hit tab
and will toggle between object in edit
mode edit mode I has three different
ways to interact with the mesh object
that is through vertex mode which is
what we're at by default we have side or
edge you can right click in to click on
any of these and then also face and
there's not currently a face on here
anyhow so I let's go back to vertex mode
what we want to do is extrude all this
down alright so to select all yeah a-and
to deselect all hit a again so toggles
before between both of those so hit a
and then hit to extrude and now you can
see we can move around however you want
but we want us to go to straight up and
down so we're going to hit the Z Z key
and I'd say be right around there looks
pretty decent alright so now i'm going
to select this top edge right around
here the one that we extruded from and
so instead of just selecting all these
Mullenix shift which would take for
freakin ever there's a shortcut you just
right-click hit alt and right click and
that will select the edge loop right
there so now what we want to do i'm
going to hit 7 on the number pad and
that gives us to the top orthographic
view
and what we want to do is extrude this
hit e and we want to do is just hit
enter oops e and then enter and then hit
s and we're going to scale this down
roughly to the size of a toilet seat
right around there and just left click
to set it and then hit again and then
hit Z because we want to go straight
down right around there is fine and I'm
just going to leave it right there for
now alright so now what I'm going to do
I'm going to select the bottom row so
you just right click hold all right
click and it selects it and what we want
to do is separate this or duplicate it
so hit shift in D and then hit Z to make
sure it only moves on the z axis and
we're going to create the actual part
that the seat sits on and we're just
going to put it pretty close to it right
around there will work and then hit p
and that will allow you to separate the
selection by left clicking and selecting
it and so now this is no longer this
ring right here is no longer a part of
this seat so there are two separate
objects so we have to go back into
object mode hit tab and then right click
this and now we can go and hit tab and
now we can just edit this portion and no
longer the seat all right so now what we
want to do is hit a to select all
because it's just these edge this edge
loop right here and we want to create
the base from which your matter falls
into so II and z and let me hit I'm
gonna back up real quick just because I
this is a good point to go ahead and
kind of just maybe go to Google Images
and quickly just get an idea of what a
toilet looks like so we don't have to be
perfect of course I but let me just I'm
off screen right now I'm going to get
this up real quick and so
toilet seat let me drag us into view not
to let see but toilet rather hopefully
we're getting nasty images I so yeah I
the general look I'm going for this is
obviously a 3d models party I'm going to
be going for something that's more along
the lines of this this shape I mean it's
just a general recognizable shape i
right here as well you have like this
bull portion and then a portion that
comes down and it connects up to hear
the square rectangular piece and that's
that so people pretty much it'll look
pretty realistic but it's not going to
be one hundred percent in terms of
having all this stuff in here I like
this tube I don't want to spend all the
time doing that but I yeah pretty simple
so what we're going to do is hit e and
then hold hit Z and I'm going to bring
this down roughly yeah right around
there all right actually I maybe want to
bring this up just right around there
and then hit again to extrude and then Z
and this time will come down roughly
right around here all right now this
portion I right here we want this to
start coming in but only on the front so
if we go to the side view with three on
the number pad to get there this is I
looking at it from the right view and so
this portion needs to basically come
down this way and actually I may drop
this down just a little bit further
alright so what we want to do on the a
to deselect all and we want to turn on
this button right here because let me
show you what happens if I leave it just
as is by default it's not on if we just
hit for example B will allow you to it's
kind of like a selection to like the
lasso tool most in Photoshop and you've
left click a drag and you select some of
these it's only going to select the
visible vertex vertexes so let's go back
two three hey again to deselect all with
this turned on be now it selects
everything behind the visible portion
alright so I was going to go to a
certain direction with just trying to
move these around pushing these in but I
decided that I'm going to select all
them at the bottom so just hit be so you
have them all selected and what we want
to do is go back to three you hit scale
oh it's kind of funky to work with a
little bit here just go to top view if
you hit scale and seven on the number
pad is top and you scale this in roughly
right around there alright that's pretty
decent and then let's go to the side
view 3 on the number pad and then bring
this right over so this is basically
straight up and down on the left portion
alright and that may be a little bit too
much in terms of where it's going so if
you want to make an adjustment you go
back to seven hit s a little bit go back
to three on the number pad and then just
drag this over that's a little bit
better okay and then what we want to do
is extrude it again so let's go back two
three hit e and hit Z make sure it's
going to stay on the Zetas axis I'm just
going to come down right around here
we're going to assume this is the floor
and then we're going to hit again and
I'm just going to hit enter to make it
set there and it hit seven on the top
view hit s to scale it just a little bit
and then see how this looks hit three
and then
hit e to extrude and then Z so it stays
on that z axis all right okay so now
what I want to do in terms of the shape
usually I there's kind of like a portion
where this right here goes inwards on
the back so let me just I bring back the
toilet Google Images thing let's see
toilet all right so what I'm talking
about is you know this portion right
here kind of how it there's like an
indent it's even right here it's much
more simplistic this is likely more of
what we're going to go after I so the
way we'll do that is let's go ahead and
hit three on the side hit a to deselect
all and we just want to select the faces
so let's go over here all right so
remember we have this turned on so if we
hit be for existence and then just left
click and select will get the one that's
over here as well so we want to select
let's go back two three probably these
one two three four five so let's do is
hit B select all those hits seven for
the top view and then hit s to scale in
a little bit like that just like that
and i think that's fine just ray right
there all right so now we have the seat
and we have the base portion done i
don't know what the technical
terminology of that is but now we're
going to work on the rest of it and
basically I this portion right here of
the toilet usually has a part that just
kind of it connects to an outer portions
let me hit seven so they'll come out
I'd say prior a one two three four five
six phases out this way and then the
base or the the top portion will sit up
here so what we want to do is if you hit
one that gives you the front view as
showing up here but if you hit control 1
i'll give you the back view so now we're
looking at the back of this thing and
this is the center so I think we're
going to choose yeah three on each side
so just going to right click to select
this and sometimes if you right click it
may not select it like that right there
it ended up selecting one from the front
so that's something just to be wary of
when you're doing this oops control one
and so way you cannot you can
temporarily just turn this off that way
you'll select these holding shift there
we go we have three on each side so now
we can hit seven for the top view and we
can hit E and then just drag out and by
default it's already set at the y axis
for making sure it stays there all right
and yeah we could probably take these
edges right here and adjust those so
it's not a sharp angle so what we can do
is move here to edge mode right click
those make sure you have six of them and
then we can go to side view and just
drag this down or over to the right and
then down a little bit all right so far
so good is this top part out enough I
don't think so so it's at seven and
let's go to turn this on as well just so
we can see what's behind it we only just
want to select these six so hit a and
then be and it's going to select
unfortunately a few of those down there
so I'm just holding shift and
right-clicking to deselect those all
right so now let's go back to seven on
the number pad and drag this out and
this probably it's a minor detail so I'm
not going to worry about you could just
take each of these and make this a
straight line each of these but I'm not
going to worry about it that looks
decent for now alright so I may actually
drive it drag it out a little bit more
damn it all right there you go all right
so what we want to do now is the base
and so that's going to be a separate
object so whenever you go to the say for
example if we added an object right now
and hit shift a I that would end up
adding the object to this current object
right here because we're in edit mode so
tabbing into object mode and then adding
a new object will add a new object and
won't be connected to any other objects
just a tip there so I wherever you add a
new object is dependent upon where the
origin point is right here this little
thing the circle crosshair thing and I
never in the way you said is just by
left clicking I never moved it from the
original point from the tutorial but I
where every that's clicked on is where
the next object is going to get added
it's not a huge deal because you can
always move the object if it's not where
you want it but just a quick tip you hit
three I and we want to have it sitting
rake right around here left click right
here then hit one and it's still in the
current I y position so we don't really
have to move it because sometimes if you
hit three over here it looks like it's
in line but then you hit one and it's
like hanging off over here or something
alright so now we can go ahead and hit
shift a and we're going to add a cube
we're going to s to scale this down
roughly right around there and then
we're going to hit seven on the number
pad and we're going to hit s and then X
and we want this to come out roughly to
the same width as the seat
which it looks like it is all right so
now let's hit say one obviously needs to
be much taller than this so I'm going to
move it up here and then hit s and Z and
move it down now let's go and hit three
move it down alright that looks pretty
accurate yeah and then what I want to do
there's usually a portion that sits up
on top you know the thing that you can
take off and then try to fix your your
toilet so if we go into tab mode I'm not
tab mode the edit mode hitting tab we
can select this top face right here real
quick and shift D and hit Z then hit p
by selection we're going to separate it
hit tab to go to object mode right click
it and then hit tab to go back and then
hit a to select all and then hit e to
move it up and it's not very thick
usually it's about this tall and there
we go alright we are almost done with
this portion right now I want to add
real quickly a handle and so a flusher
thing or whatever a hell it's called so
if we want to get this into a correct
position we can hit seven or no one on
the number pad left click hit three and
that looks like it's pretty much where
we're going to want it hit shift a up
make sure you're not in edit mode
because it will add it to this object so
hit tab to go to object mode first shift
a and we're going to make it a what's it
called a cylinder s to scale that thing
down and then usually if your work if
it's a big object you're trying to scale
down you can only get it down to a
certain point otherwise it makes it hard
so just left-click once you get it down
to the smaller size and then
it makes it easier to get down all right
and then our x 90 so r is rotate x will
mean it's only going to rotate on the x
axis and then 90 is 90 degrees and that
makes it facing the butt portion us all
right so I'm gonna also hit three now
when you hit three gives you the right
but if what if you want the left okay
well hit control three and that's the
same thing for front and back so I get
one that's front control one is back
seven is top control one is bottom just
a quick tip so I'm going to back to
coach rule 3 and we have to see how
thick this thing is so if you move it
over that's a little I let's see what
this thing looks like yeah it's a little
bit too thick so I what we'll do is hit
s in Y right around there is pretty
decent hit control three move it just
against that portion right there and
then we have to get in here real close
hit one and then we'll switch into edit
mode any tab and I'm going to hit a make
sure this is turned on by the way hit B
and then select just the left half of it
move it over usually they hang off the
side a little bit and then hit s to
scale this thing in so I'm going to see
what that looks like pretty good alright
okay alright so that's it for the actual
toilet I for the modeling portion at
least this is going to have to be closer
I think I'm so what we want to do is now
add a subdivision surface to these
various objects so we have we have one
two three and then four different I
objects here so what we want to do I'm
going to select right just right-click
and select the seat and I'm going to
come out here all
the way this property is showing up just
hit n for knows if you want that to
collapse you probably didn't have it I
did because for that I thing down here
so what we want to do is click on
modifiers and you can add all these
crazy things subdivision surface is what
we want because right now it looks like
a big blocky weird-looking thing right
so subdivision surface basically takes
the geometry and just multiplies it
however you specify and makes it smooth
so for the view I'm going to hit three
render three as well you can see it kind
of just smooth out and we want shading
to be smooth as well alright so you'll
see when we do this one it's going to
really make it look crazy all right so
what we'll do add modifier to this one
as well subdivision alright so kind of
just makes things that look a little bit
strange gooey and we can fix this of
course right click do the same thing and
this one is going to really make you
look crazy and then the same thing up
here subdivision surface turn out up
three on each side there we go alright
so let's fix this a little bit this seat
actually doesn't look too bad I don't
think we have to make any fixes because
this is usually a seats aren't like
straight edges otherwise your legs and
your ass if y'all killing the stuff bit
marks on but I this one we can probably
make some adjustments to so with it
selected hit tab and we can see our
geometry is still intact it hasn't been
manipulated yet if you were to hit apply
then this would go away and you wouldn't
be able to work with it really so what
we have to do is add in some extra edge
loops as they're called so ctrl R or
command our mac will give you that
ability and wherever you're hovering at
is wherever it's going to add these
things so it gets a little confusing but
we won't want it we want to add one up
here so just hover on one of these
vertical edges right here left click and
then pull it up do it again control our
left click and pull it down ctrl R
left click and pull it up control are
again right around there pull this down
control are right here pull this up and
control are down here pull this up
control are over here let down alright
so now if we switch back out it's a
little bit more defined in terms of the
shape alright so let's I click on this
mess right here will go to tab to go to
edit mode now we just have to add some
over here so control our bring this up
all the way control our bring this down
all the way control are right here to
bring this forward control our bring
that back there we go much better
looking hit tab get out of their control
our I mean now right click it to select
it hit tab and do the same thing right
here real quick control our control our
control are up here control are down
here alright so it's a tab right click
this one and hit tab again to go to edit
control our bring this up usually these
are kind of rounded they're not like I
know up here these are straight flat
edges so you can bring that all the way
bring that up pretty much let me
actually how to edit undo that control
are just pull all the way up make sure
it's there alright so now if we go into
object mode you can see what this looks
like alright I'm going to say that's
pretty good for now so what we want to
do is I'm going to add a floor and so
I'm going to put the origin point just
somewhere underneath it
so if you hit one you can click just
beneath this three well does it really
matter on three shift a we're in object
mode hit plane hit s like I don't know
40 make it like really large all right
and then I'm going to make some
adjustments here just the scene just to
get this working here i'm going to
change the blender Cycles render up here
and the color of the world first let me
switch to the render mode all rice its
default is GP is CPU I'm going to change
GPU compute if you don't have that
option you can go to file and you can go
to user preferences you can go to system
and then down here if you have a
graphics card you'll see it by default
compute device set none of belief if you
want to click on CUDA you can see your
graphics cards down here I have two
geforce gtx 580 so- what mindset at once
you have that set then you'll see this
option down here for GPU compute if I
it's much faster than cpu when it comes
to rendering alright so I'm going to
come down here to samples by default we
have 10 this is what this looks like at
10 samples I and also with this default
dark gray color you come over here we're
on solid view currently change to
rendered all right so everything's dark
and it looks grainy right so let's
lighten things up and let's go back to
render and let's change the sample c10
is very minimal that's why it looks
grainy so you have two options to
settings rather renders when we actually
go up here to click on render what we're
not going to do for a while and then
preview is what we're previewing right
here so I set that to 100 it's working
up here all the way to a hundred and now
it looks a lot better and less grainy ok
all right was that I don't think this is
filled in this edge right here let me go
fix that so you see like usually there's
a part that comes here for that the seat
sets
so let's go back to solid and i'm going
to right click this to select it go into
edit mode by hitting tab and i'm going
to make sure i select this outer ring
right here so we're on let's go to
vertex mode alt left click hit 74 on the
number pad for the top of you hit e to
extrude actually once i can hit eat it
extrude left click or enter to set it
hit s to scale in well three going to
stay right around there alright and then
hit three on the side hit enter and then
we'll have it come down and maybe come
down like this a little bit like that
alright so now if we switch back to
rendered view we don't have that issue
alright we're already at 30 minutes so
i'm going to consider this complete we
don't have a material so it's not glossy
or anything but i think that's a good
place to end it just for now i well
because i am like a little bit OCD i
want to bring up this let me give it to
object mode take their airplane right
click on it hit 3 and move this thing up
so that's sitting on it there you go
back to rendered and much better all
right that is our toilet awesome stuff
okay so on the next lesson we're gonna
go ahead and get focused on doing the
voting Bock's part that's going to sit
on top of it which will be tomorrow all
right check out design course calm if
you haven't yet and subscribe here on
youtube all right goodbye
