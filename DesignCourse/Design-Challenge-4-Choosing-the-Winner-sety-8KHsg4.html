course etro and your task last week was
to design a business card for a
fictional freelance designer or for
yourself or whatever so we had a fair
number of entries around 41 or so I
across 32 different users not too bad it
ended three days ago so now I have them
all rated and you all should have
receipt of the email about that and now
i'm going to go ahead and pick the
winner so i'm going to go ahead and
switch over to the screen and this is
the page where everything went down i'm
not going to recap the information you
guys already know it kind of pointless
and so I have this rated or sorted
rather by the highest rating first okay
so once again as in the other entries or
the other competitions when I go to
judge and pick the winner the person
that's rated the highest will not always
win I don't think it's happened yet so
it's just kind of get a general gage but
it's not concrete in terms of who won so
I'm looking at this real quickly yeah
the top I i would say about the top 7 or
8 i'll go ahead and look at and i'll
just give my thoughts about these a
little bit more specifically this one
very solid I the colors all match up
very well I the type is pretty easy to
read i think maybe just time maybe just
as specializing in you i print design
etc my phone's going off that's why you
probably hear this weird noise um is a
little bit a little bit small but that's
okay Jesus Christ be quiet okay I but
yeah in terms of layout everything has
very good amount of white space
everything is laid out and it has a
really good alignment and consistency of
alignment across all the elements so if
you just take a look at the icons I'm
they're spread out all very evenly
they're all the same size they're all
the same color the distance between this
can
Tanner here as well as the icons himself
all is very even the distance between
themselves and a distance between over
here to the right of the text these are
small details but they can make or break
a design if you throw one of these
elements off or push them over just
write a few few pixels you'll see that
it it makes it look horrible so I yeah
in terms of layout everything's
excellent here now the one downside to
this is they did use an illustration
that came from free pic so this isn't a
hundred percent unique design however
for a person who has almost no
experience in design it's still laid it
out very well so thanks for that entry
look it over here this is a kind of a
similar sort of lay out all the colors
and everything quite different I but I
like a lot the there's a lot of white
space here between the the logo design
which is this this person's name and and
this containing element right here I you
know it kind of goes against the trend
however to have this the soft shadow
right here but you know what I'm not
going to be nitpicky about that not
everything has to be flat design and
then you know all the same comments
really about the layout here
everything's laid out pretty well thanks
for that entry this one you know they
took a unique I take on this one with a
front and back as well as it being a
vertical design and they also obviously
updated the the mock-up template that's
okay looking at it obviously very
minimalistic monochromatic I liked it
though I it it really seems high class
upscale the silver here not everything
is necessarily white the type is good
and I like a lot of the separation here
so this is a good design thanks for that
over here I like this as well this is
still sort of the same type of layout as
the first two up top however you know we
just have a slight different sort of
artistic expression in terms of this
containing element over here I'm which
definitely fits for a freelance designer
so this speaks to
saying that this person's artistic or
whatever now the one negative about this
is the size of the type right here I I
know it's not really large on my screen
I carry larger over here just so we
could see in a little bit better on but
it's still too small also it's a little
bit far too separated from the actual
icons over here I but that's the that
would probably be the only downside to
this design I like the colors and
everything else in the layout right over
here this is a more unique approach
which is kind of what I was looking for
I for something you know a business card
based on a designer I very simple we
have the little window and the X right
here window title so it's emulating you
know like a graphic design application
and just very simple there's not too
much to judge it on because it's so
simplistic I but it's still unique in
this this element right here so it is
effective I like this one as well a lot
as well and then I looking at this one i
again pretty monochromatic and I'm not
really too certain about the choice in
picture here kiss it it looks like who
but I yeah everything I like this a lot
in terms of the layout layout is perfect
the type is a perfect easy-to-read sighs
I the icons are all great as well so
good entry here here I like to design
for what it is perfectly but this person
didn't you know use my template which
you know I guess why would I really care
i wanted them to look you know on the
one of them to be presented on the same
type of document but not a big deal
otherwise looking at it for the design
itself though I excellent I you know we
have a lot of color in the backyard
design and this is more of a muted sort
of monochromatic approach I we have a
picture of the person's face cut in half
you know I have no problem with that
that's kind of unique to design a unique
design element rather I and yeah
everything is laid out here you can see
the type isn't too small it's not too
large I so yeah I like this one a lot
but you can't win because you you
disobeyed one of the requirements and
then right here this is a good entry as
well very simple but you know the color
really works well kind of makes it feel
like material design in assets in terms
of how the the same colors are are
complementing each other but yeah very
good entries and that's all I'm going to
review I so with that said I probably
would have picked this if this looks
like a custom element but it's not so
then automatically will disqualify you
perhaps I should put that in the future
in the GI the contest description but
having said that I'm going to choose
this image here seems to be a hundred
percent unique everything you know they
use the template everything's solid in
terms of design and good design
principles so you are the winner alright
so I look out fairly shortly for a new
design challenge I haven't really
decided yet what that's going to be I
but of course i'll upload a video on the
youtube channel you'll be able to find
out you know exactly where that is going
to take place and what URL but um yeah
we've been a aside from that vis and I I
this has been very busy you know from
slider in a case you don't know who he
is that's my partner at corset recom
been very busy on a couple other
projects however in the works I with
Viv's very shortly we're going to have a
new course that's going to be based on
creating an android-based our firebase
chat app I so look out for that I'm also
working with his partner as well for a
very similar course except that's going
to be for iOS and then myself I've been
really brushing up on the front-end
development stuff and also getting into
backend stuff as well and so I'm
focusing on angular node and I'm going
to be I creating tutorials probably a
ton of them based on these technology
is in really kind of bringing the
channel into in by the way I may create
a new channel I'm not sure yet but
really focusing on full-stack
development which includes graphic
design of course which we've done a ton
here on the site as well as front-end
and back-end development so yeah
exciting things are to come but yeah
we're going to keep on doing these
design challenges so look after that all
right guys I'll see you in a few days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
