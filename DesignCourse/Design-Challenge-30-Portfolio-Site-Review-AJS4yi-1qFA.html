calm welcome to design challenge number
30 the big 30 now we're going to be
doing something entirely different
you're not actually going to be
designing anything what I want you to do
is head on over to the forum thread for
this challenge and instead of submitting
a design i want you to submit your
portfolio or your personal site all
right so this is hugely important as a
designer even if you're a hundred
percent new and you're a beginner you
need to have a website or a presence of
some sort established at least just for
initial purposes all right so what I'm
going to do with your submission I'm
going to take a look at what you have on
your site in your portfolio and i'm
going to give you suggestions on how you
can improve the entire process so i'm
going to take a look at your portfolio
if you have one and i'll tell you areas
it looks like you could probably
improved design wise and i'm also going
to take a look at your website as a
whole and see if there's any areas that
could be improved in terms of getting
clients or marketing yourself all right
so hopefully you guys do this if you
don't have a portfolio website take this
time to get it up all right just it's
hugely important take this next five
days the submission is that next Sunday
I go ahead get cheap hosting get
yourself a domain and get something up
initially even if it's just the word
plush template please do it for yourself
all right so looking forward to all of
the entries please subscribe here on
youtube if you haven't yet check out
design course calm all right goodbye all
right and here's the submission thread
which again is linked in the YouTube
description and for this one very simple
obviously so just for a change basis we
challenge simply submit your portfolio a
personal website for a quick review I'll
take a glance your portfolio and mention
anything that I think can be improved
and of course if you don't have wine
then go register a domain and get one
set up so there's a lot of registrar's
who are also web hosts you can use
godaddy you can use namecheap.com
they're very cheap alright so the
requirements simply are submit the URL
as a reply to this thread and the
submission deadline is sunday july
fourteenth at 12
eastern standard time so when you hit
you know post reply let me get this
logged in real quick simply specify the
URL perhaps it's something like HTV but
whatever calm / blah and that's it and
automatically links and that's pretty
much all you have to say you can you
know include any other additional
details if you wish and then hit post
thread although should this should be
post replying to go ahead and fix that
soon anyhow that is it so I'm looking
forward to see all your submissions
