today I'm going to design a logo for a
product I that's a part of the
subscription service and that is going
to be called design course comment or
and that's going to be for the
one-on-one training that I'm going to be
offering alright so you don't really
have to follow along this is a quick
video I'll just be stepping in Adobe
Illustrator and we'll be trying to use
the design course DC letter mark as a
framework to create this new icon all
right so check out design course calm if
you haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube alright so this is the design
course d see a letter mark logo and
previously i did a video tutorial where
i showed how I took the general idea
this logo and transferred it to a forum
icon for the design course com forums
and the logo is right here and it can
also be seen here on the forums as well
and so the idea is to try to stick with
the same type of I guess you could say
paths lines and the way they cut into
each other I and try to make it
universalized I in the different areas
and future products and services of the
site so as I mentioned I the upcoming
subscription service half of it is going
to be called design course calm mentor
and so I wanted to come up with a logo
for that specifically and I wanted to
come up with something that still
utilize the same type of design however
is obviously relevant also to the idea
of a mentoring service so the one that I
came up just right off the bat when
looking at this is to take the DC and
rotate it and the idea is to take this
right here this top portion i guess you
could call it you at this point and
create a stethoscope out of it alright
so i'll just show you real quick that
process
so I'm going to go to view show grid
view and snap to grid okay so put this
right around there and probably worth
increasing that to make sure they're
even all right so basically what i want
to do real quick is just take the pen
tool I'm going to come out here in the
middle and I'm going to real quickly
just outline this because I want a path
that's to stroked that it stroked I
basically recreating that top you shape
so if i go here i'm going to get rid of
this stroke here and then I'll temporary
make it a different color just so i can
get the stroke with correct alright so
i'm going to make a couple adjustments
just so it lines up a little bit better
so i'll take the transparency around 50
i'll zoom up here real quick and just
move these around a little bit pull this
one down if i click on these i could see
how far these anchors are going so it's
one line beneath this main grid line all
right and i'm going to take this
and it looks I pretty accurate just for
this video so what I'm going to do is
take this i'm going to move it over and
i'm going to create choose the right
color and then also a lie go ahead and
make this transparency one hundred
percent alright so now what I want to do
is create the actual tube area that
comes down here so I'll choose the
ellipse tool and I'm just going to hit
shift and alt and drag it out right
around here of course we want this to be
centered so it'll be on the center line
right here between both of these and
also in the center right here as well
and I don't want to be too big I don't
want the actual I don't want to go
beyond this portion so it's a matter of
kind of scaling this and playing around
with it a little bit I think may be
right around there will be okay and then
what i can do is take this use a direct
selection tool remove these two lines
and this extends too far but i can
adjust that later I'll take the ellipse
tool again and come around the center of
that area and then also ctrl c ctrl f
and get rid of the stroke and make the
fill light all right and i also want
make sure these are lined up as well so
if i take these two I want the right
side of this to line up to the right
side of this portion so we'll do is also
move it in line with the bottom of this
all right and then I'll take the add
Anchor Point tool just click right
around the center
oops we have an issue up here okay
actually I need to come down here and
click it just like that and then it
delete all right and that way this side
this to portion is an exact you know
it's based on a perfect circle which is
always nice to have and that is it so
obviously very simple what i would do
here is take this and group it up that
that way i have the actual stroke saved
so in the future if i create another one
I won't have to recreate it and then
also duplicate it again and go to object
path outline stroke and then I could
take this middle portion control shift +
D and that will divide the objects below
that way I can get rid of everything in
the center and that way it is now
transparent alright so now we can take
it scale it down to see how it looks and
it works even have very small sizes
which is always a benefit and that is it
alright obviously a quick video but I
yeah so if you haven't yet check out
design course calm also look out for the
launch of this design course commenter
subscription service and yeah subscribe
here on youtube as well if you haven't
yet all right i'll see you tomorrow
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
