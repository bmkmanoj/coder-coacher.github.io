just yesterday we passed the hundred
thousand subscriber marks on my youtube
channel so that's kind of exciting and
also I'm releasing a brand new series
100% free series all on angular 2 and so
in this initial video here we're going
to discuss and I'm going to walk you
through step by step how to get it up
and running on your system in the manual
format so there's several different ways
to get angular 2 ready to go and I'm
going to be covering all those but it's
just in this video alone it's going to
be the manual way because it's very
important to learn how things kind of
work at their fundamental level I and
you'll see in the next video
some quicker methods of getting it
installed so what we want to do I'm
going to switch over here to my desktop
and I'm at the angular do official
website and this is a framework
developed and maintained by Google and
as you can see it's one framework for
mobile and desktop apps now if you want
to learn more about it specifically you
can visit this page and the area that
we're really going to focus on here is
get started so this is the QuickStart
and notice this says typescript down
here which is a superset of JavaScript
now if you wish if you come down over
here to this left column at the very
bottom it will say angular for
typescript now by default it's on
typescript but if you want to learn how
to use angular with just regular
JavaScript you can click here and this
page will change to reflect that but
we're going to stick with typescript
okay so the first things first up as you
can see the QuickStart I'm just going to
run you through this but again you may
get caught up if you're brand new to
this sort of thing so that's why I
really want to run through it here and
just to also give a little bit more
explanation on some of the aspects that
it may not really delve into so first as
you notice the prerequisite is to
installed nodejs and npm so first you
may be one
what is no js' well simply put it's a
very fast server-side platform and NPM
of course stands for node package
manager so these two things are related
to each other and that NPM is used to
install node packages now you could do
this via command line and there's a
variety of node programs that you can
use in the course of developing your
apps and websites alright so what we
want to do that in here
if you don't already have it just simply
install them so we open up this link
here and it's going to show you how to
install NPM and by default when you
install nodejs NPM is already included
so you'll want to download this here and
get it installed
alright so assuming you do that and all
go smooth and it may not sometimes you
may run into certain errors on your
machine via the command line and by the
way when I say command line if you're on
Windows it's just the Windows command
line that you can use of course it's the
terminal on Mac OS I also you can use
something called the git bash which is
real quickly I'll show you that as well
you can download this right here let me
go back here for any of the operating
systems and once you install nodejs come
over here real quickly it will let you
know that you can do this command right
here for Maccabee sudo npm install NPM
dash G and for Windows just so you can
knock off that sudo and you should be
good to go all right so once we have
that installed what we want to do is
create and configure the project so we
want to create the project folder now
you could do that in the windows I file
browser or to do it through the command
line so real quickly I'm going to go
ahead and bring up my command line I'm
going to drag it over here real quick
from my other monitor alright I'm going
to go into CD code CD examples and this
is just going to be my folder
and you can put this anywhere you want
into a projects folder or whatever and
ACC just to get it started
make derp or make directory angular
quick start and then you CD into it
alright so I'm going to type in make
derp angular - quick start and then CD
angular - quick start alright so now
what we want to do scroll down here and
we'll see that we have four different
files three of which are JSON files
alright so Jason real quickly if you're
unfamiliar with what that is is short
for JavaScript object notation so what
is that
well basically in short it's a way to
store information in an easy easily
accessible manner and this is done
through a bunch of property and value
pairs so this is actually what it looks
like so you can see we have our property
here and our value here and if you're
new to this of course you're going to be
completely confused but all we have to
really understand at this point is to
understand right here under dependencies
when we run an NPM install command which
is going to be coming up shortly it's
going to grab all of these node packages
and install them alright so what we want
to do is we're going to hit copy code
and you can see the name of this is
called package jason and what we want to
do is get out our code editor and i'm
going to be using visual studio code and
this is something that's developed and
maintained by Microsoft and the great
thing about it is it's free of course
and open source alright so I if you want
to use that you can use that if you have
something else that you use that's
perfectly fine as well so after that
we're going to go ahead and open that up
and I'm already ready to open up in my
angular QuickStart
select the folder and here we go alright
so we're in an empty project we're going
to create a new file and we're going to
call it package Jason and then simply
paste in everything that we need here go
ahead and save that and then over here
go ahead get back to our QuickStart TS
config Jason will copy the code and then
create the new file real quickly you
want to make sure I'm naming this right
PS config paste that in and save it
typing so Jason copy it and then finally
system Jas config Jas will copy that
oops system JSF ajs alright and say that
so now we have our four files so let's
expand this once again get rid of these
and come down here and now we want to
install the packages with this command
here so we'll get up our command prompt
and I'm going to type in MPM install
okay so it's going to stay here for a
while and you'll see it'll start
scrolling some information here based on
what it's doing but really it's just
taking look primarily at that package
dot JSON file and it's going to install
all of those packages into a folder and
we could possibly see this if we open up
our editor and the folder would be
created in here I in one of the main
ones will be node modules so for now I'm
just going to go ahead and pause or
fast-forward this just so that we don't
have to wait here for a while just take
just a little bit of time
alright ok so you can see it created
that folder along with a typing's folder
and it's important to a note that
whether or not you have that and you
should but you can see it installed a
lot of different dependencies here and
of course it installed much more than
what's just shown here in our package
Jason if I can get that real quick right
here and that's because a lot of these
have other dependencies that aren't
listed that are also installed ok so
let's go ahead and minimize that and
coming back here also it will note down
here if the Taipings folder doesn't show
up after running npm install of course
then you can run this here alright so
step two is just to create the
application which means we have to
create an app folder alright so let's go
back to our editor and right here off of
our route we're going to create the new
folder called app alright you minimize
this or shrink that down just a bit
inside this app folder we want to create
an app module TS TS is short for
typescript so let's copy this and in our
app folder we'll create that new file
and paste this in now if this looks
unfamiliar to you don't worry we're
going to cover more depth what these
things mean and what these different
lines of code have to say alright so
coming down here we're going to go ahead
and says create a component and add it
to your application alright so let's go
ahead and create an app component TS in
the same folder here
go ahead and copy that code as shown
we'll save that notice on the template
it says my first angular app we'll come
back to that in a second and now under
app dot module dot es which we already
created we have to import that app
component so I'm just going to copy this
or act rather you could just copy the
whole thing and come back to it
and you'll see if I select all and then
control V it only added just this import
statement and also added under
declarations and bootstrap the app
component as well now we want to start
up the application so first before we do
that we need to create the file under
app called main TS so one more file oops
main dot TS rather and we want to copy
this and save it and then we need to
create an index.html and the root of the
project and we'll copy this real quickly
and this is just standard HTML here
although the one thing that differs here
is this custom tag called my dash app
and if we save this and we go to app
component tes will see a selector called
my app but of course I will get into
this more in depth beyond just this
installation video here and then we can
create real quickly as styles.css in the
root project folder we'll copy that code
real quick and paste it in and save it
and then build and run the application
so let's go back to our terminal or
command prompt and type in npm start now
with any luck we'll get the window that
loads up here from localhost 3000 and
there we go that is in short the very
kind of lengthy process in terms of
manually getting and I want to really
say it's that quick although it's a
little bit quick once you get the hang
of it process of getting angular2 up and
running and just a really quick note of
course if you make any changes if we go
back to app component tes and we changes
to hey what's up
we'll see that it automatically
refreshed and reloads the browser for us
also you'll note that you'll notice
never several other files were created
and that's because it takes this type
script code here and it converts it into
raw JavaScript which is what is
essentially used and then we also have a
dot map file here all right
so that is the manual way and then again
not too quick way of getting angular 2
ready to go and installed I in the next
video I'm going to cover a couple more
quick ways to get up and running with
angular 2 all right so if you enjoyed
this video please subscribe on my
youtube channel at WWE 2k15 course and I
mention in just because if you're
watching this on course cetera comm you
may not know that address all the rise
some of you probably will be watching
from YouTube all right so I'll see you
very shortly with that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
