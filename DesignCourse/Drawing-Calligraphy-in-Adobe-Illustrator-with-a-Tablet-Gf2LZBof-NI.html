and today I'm going to be using the
Cintiq here to experiment with sasame
calligraphy here in Adobe Illustrator
alright so basically you could do the
same thing you don't need this intake of
course you can just any type of printer
pressure-sensitive tablet will work like
an into OSA or even be in blue I think
alright so I'm just gonna go up here to
file new and that's showing up
off-screen one second I have four
monitors up here alright and I I'm just
going to choose a thousand by 750 RGB
for the color mode and okay alright so I
initially I plan to just do this on a
white background I think I'm gonna
change it up and just make it black here
so I'm gonna drag out a rectangle and
we'll go ahead and change the fill color
here to get this out of here black and I
will go ahead and lock that layer
alright so I next we have to set up the
brushes so if you take the brush tool
here and we go over to brushes just
double click on the first one or you can
just go create a new one i we want to
change this here we're gonna make this
based on pressure for the size so the
harder we push the larger the size will
be of course and let me move my keyboard
over here to the left and I change this
to around 40 and the variation we could
just put the 40 as well so we'll hit OK
alright so there we go now what we want
to do is I make this white here for our
color so we'll make this white or the
stroke rather white we don't need a fill
color and we're ready to go alright so
this is a basic tip it's a round brush
and the way you make it and adjust it
for calligraphy if we go back to brushes
we can go ahead and double click on it
and we can take this down by dragging it
and then we could also change the angle
here nobody choose 45 even am i says 46
let's leave it there and that should be
pretty good
all right so now when we do this you
could see how that works much like a
calligraphy pen all right I one second
yeah I'm recording oh that's great
all right bye okay so to continue on my
wife just called me I have to answer
that one of course and let me back up
here so I'm just going to use the letter
s to start off with here so when it
comes to calligraphy there's a lot of
different styles you know you also have
to ask yourself if you want it the
uppercase lowercase and you can really
just have fun experimenting with it all
right so I'm going to start by just
drawing out a shape roughly like this
just like that I'm gonna make another
one above it and it trying to follow the
contour as much as possible and that was
no good
so it looked a little bit sloppy I so
need to try to get this to line up as
much as humanly possible and that's okay
so you know regularly if I didn't have
the camera in my face and the microphone
I would try to get a little bit closer
to try to make this a little bit more
smooth but I think just for the purpose
of this tutorial you should be good to
go I don't like that I started a little
bit too early here okay I think that's
pretty good and then we'll do another
one up here just like that
all right and now we can see we have the
basic S shape it's not too bad I and you
could do a lot of other things with this
of course so what we can do now say for
example when it come like this maybe
come back up like that doesn't look too
bad and then we can take another tip
here I'm just going to take double click
on the second preset we'll make this
come down maybe round five
we want this pressure variation make
that five and make this fixed in hit
okay all right so we can have maybe even
a thinner line that kind of just
coincides with this like that yeah
something like that not too bad and then
we can give it some I black or white
space or in the case we're using black
space so what we can do is let me see
here let see the thickness of this yeah
we're gonna need a third brush real
quick so it's going to double-click on
this we're gonna change this to I maybe
twelve
this needs fixed as well I this is going
to be pressure so twelve points on the
pressure and variation alright and I and
then for the swatches here we're going
to change this back to black and then we
could do some other stuff like come up
here in the middle and then as we get to
the bottom trying to make it a little
bit less pressure do one over here
I don't like that one because it kind of
goes up a little bit too high here just
not really conforming to the shape yeah
something like that's okay not too bad I
and now I'm gonna take the pen tool and
we're gonna make this feel black and
maybe put like a diamond thing here in
the middle oh crap I hate when that
happens accidentally click or it'll add
to one of the other paths I'll take this
and just copy it ctrl c ctrl f move that
over that's something like that and
that's how you can really quickly
obviously create a kind of a more
intricate sort of calligraphy style for
a type here for our letter s alright so
you can of course if you wanted to add
more letters to this you can move
everything over here hit ctrl R on your
keyboard to get the rulers left click
and drag a ruler there left-click and
drag another ruler here to define the
top and the bottom of the type and then
that way you have some guides in terms
of creating more letters and then of
course say for example you want to just
a capital S and you have a word here
maybe like sweet or sex or whatever you
could drag a third one to create the
height for the lowercase letters if you
wish alright so that is just a very
quick basic tutorial on how you would
use a tablet to set up a calligraphy
brush and start doing some pretty cool
calligraphy and of course if you've
never messed with calligraphy before you
can always do a search on Google there's
books at local stores you can buy that
have tons of different types of
calligraphy
and it even shows you how to start
designing your own calligraphy letters
in terms of step-by-step something I did
when I was a lot younger like when I was
in I was like 10 I really got into it
for some reason but I really haven't
touched it too much but yeah as you can
see the effects or the appearance of the
type is actually really cool
so hopefully you learn something and I
make sure you subscribe here I on the
channel here on YouTube and check out
design course calm alright talk to you
later good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
