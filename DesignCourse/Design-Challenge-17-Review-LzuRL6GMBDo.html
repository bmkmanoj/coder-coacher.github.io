course calm and this is the review of
design challenge number 17 design a
custom letter D in calligraphy alright
so it is the new year january first 2015
and last year i set out a goal to record
a video every day of 2014 didn't quite
stick to that i think i got up to june
seventeenth but anyhow i think i did
about around 210 video so that's pretty
good still continue our planning on
basically just recording a video or two
every week and some other new things are
in the pipeline as well alright so i
just real quickly again design a letter
D in calligraphy must be uppercase I
know the letters you guys pretty much
follow this I although a couple of you
didn't do the whole white space thing
but no big deal in some quick examples
and let's get started alright so Dylan
12 I would say for the purposes of this
challenge I you know this is a very
simplistic version of you know what
we're asking for so there's nothing
wrong with that and per se i but there's
not really too much here for me to
critique and just saying that you know
it's very simplistic and it's not
entirely bad but it's so simplistic
there's not much I could say so I thanks
for that and here we have another one
this one is very interesting i like the
execution completely but when you think
of calligraphy and handwritten
calligraphy this kind of veers away from
that kind of organic style everything's
a little bit more rigid I but
nonetheless I really like the execution
of it and come it down here let's see so
this one the first hand drawn and then
converted here I overall I like this it
has a lot of potential i would say that
us the things that stuck out at me at
first are you know this little one pixel
white space or border or stroke between
this portion in this little ribbon that
kind of looks bad at this resolution at
least because I
you can see some pixilation in there so
i would add a little bit more space and
or whiteness so it doesn't look like
that I over here it's not so bad I but
over here you can definitely notice that
but other than that I think this is
something that's definitely something
that you can work with it's always a
good idea to to do everything in black
and white and not try to do different
variations it simply because there's a
font tie you can't do that obviously so
other than that thanks for the
submission I here's another one I so the
issue with this that I saw immediately
was I it could be it could look like
kind of like a bee simply because this
telecon them up here the proportion are
so off so i would really address that
because this does look like a big be in
a sense or a lowercase B and I I would
just bring this down a lot more try to
you know work the same concept but try
to keep the proportions a little bit
better thanks for the entry galaxy x 85
I would say get rid of the gradient
right away and also you have some color
in here and the gradients as well that's
just died you know extra stuff date
because you just don't need when we're
trying to focus purely on blood letter
form with that said though looking at
the letter form itself i would say this
kind of tell it doesn't seem to be very
organic in terms of this Bezier curve I
can just a little bit rigid and I know
that's hard to achieve sometimes I but
something have to work on and up here
this back portion of the D the little
lines going across you know everything
else feels kind of organic but then you
have these rigid lines going straight
through and it kind of just adds for
inconsistency and the design but thanks
for the entry now over here looking at
this this one's not too bad I would say
I there's some i would like to probably
are possibly thicken it up a tad bit i
like over here and here because if that
scaled down you don't want to look you
would almost lose that detail and i also
say the other thing would be you know
with this line flowing this way it seems
like it flows it it's
goes up a little bit too high I think to
create consistency we would take this
line and kind of just started right
around here so it flows a little bit
better I mean you don't have this big
gap up here but again I overall
execution I liked it and good job I over
here this is several issues you know
again we're talking I'm talking about
things like adding the inner shadow and
the drop shadow you know try to avoid
doing that I'm in almost every case I'm
especially when it comes to logo design
or you know type like this I challenge
here with that said in just looking at
the letter form itself I'm not sure what
the the intent of these bars are like
what exactly they mean to me I kind of
get this idea of like a cityscape so it
kind of just doesn't flow right or it
doesn't feel right to me I've for this
letter form but thanks for the
submission anyhow and then over here
mass we have this is one of the reasons
I wanted people to you use a 500 x 500
document and also scale the letter down
a lot more than the 500 x 500 otherwise
we can barely see it I with that said
though I can do this let me see here so
I could see a little bit better with
that said you know it's kind of like the
first entry you know there's not too
much for me hypocrite tree really could
take about it because it's so simple you
know it works I in and now and that's
that so again thanks for the submission
this one I this one's a little bit hard
to tell if I didn't know this is D it
would be hard for me to tell that this
is adi this could be an O or this could
be not even a letter for maybe like a
nut or something I so it would help
maybe to see it alongside other letters
but again that wasn't the requirement I
so I would try to maybe work this in so
that it's a little bit more rigid this
edge otherwise it kind of looks like an
O other than that I would probably see
the stroke thickened up a little bit in
certain areas but thanks for the
submission and then over here I this I
kind of like a funner style i could see
for the D in terms of the letter form
but I would say all of these little
circles are kind of throwing things off
and then you also have kind of an issue
of like the consistency between you know
the white space between the D and this
line it gets real close here you have
edges just barely touching which isn't a
good thing and then over here it's a
little bit lighter so you know these are
all tiny little details that really kind
of make a difference in the big picture
so i would probably get rid of the these
little lines and circles and work on
simplifying and trying to create
consistency between the spacing between
the various lines and the edges that you
have going here I so yeah thanks for the
entry and in participants going on here
and kind of class sure there's a little
bit dark kind of like the background but
just focusing on this one I would say I
it's a little bit it doesn't flow right
to me just because we have this edge
right here and it seems real rigid but
then the rest of the the type is fluid
up until this point and in other points
so I was just trying to work on creating
consistency so yeah thanks for that
entry this one I really wanted to see
this I can a vector format because I
could tell a lot of work went into it my
child downstairs like making weird
animal noises hopefully that's not
coming over the microphone but yeah you
can tell a lot of very intricate work
went into this I but yeah I wish I could
have seen a an effective format other
other than that I really liked it and
very unique I but yeah thnkx for this
omission over here ibram this one I it
only seems kind of unfinished you know
just because we have like this little
stroke here and all these little line I
text your effects it seems like I in the
back of the D kind of comes in my
opinion up a little bit too close to the
to this portion I'm but yeah it almost
feels on incomplete essentially like I
can't talk but thanks for this mission
designer over here now again we want to
scale this down so we have white space
between you know the document and edge
but I'll just try to zoom out here so
this seems a little bit amateur you know
like you said this is my first post and
I know my D is not looking good but ok
so one of the reasons is because you
need trying to create something that
looks organic and flows well but this
curve you can tell is I it doesn't flow
well at certain points for example we
come around here I and you come down
here and it stops and then it kind of
comes up over here and then it hits an
edge and then it comes up over here and
kind of hits an edge right here and
another big issue is you used two
singles path it looks like on this and a
single stroke and it is stroke width
which is you know uniform so it doesn't
matter what type of letter form you're
ever trying to design but when you you
have the same exact stroke width on it
it's going to make it's going to be very
hard to make it look good so I would
just look at you know some examples of
established calligraphy fonts just to
get an idea of kind of what I'm talking
about there all right I so let me get
back up to one hundred percent here this
one's really cool I the D in and of
itself if we were just to take out all
the detail inside of it it's a pretty
good form to begin with and then all the
detail inside of it I like as well so I
really can't say anything to negative
about this so thanks for the submission
and then we have another one here I I
would say yeah in terms of trying to
structure the D and make it readable
having this back edge here so close to
this this curve makes a tad bit hard to
read I would maybe want to try to bring
this up here just a tad bit more you can
still have this nice flowing arc but it
almost looks a little bit hard to read
and I can also see that it's italicize
so you know with with you know a full
font it would probably look pretty good
I just think that's the thing I've mind
a little I comment that I made there and
then the final one is right here I
and I think this is actually pretty good
and has a lot of potential I think the
stroke is just a little bit too thin in
some areas and also almost overall I
like that you thickened it right here in
this portion but over here everything's
kind of really lacking in terms of
stroke width so I think if we just took
everything and increase the stroke width
using a variable with profile perhaps in
Illustrator this would actually be a lot
better than it is but the basic form and
shape that you have I really like it so
it's a good entry alright so that is it
so look out for more videos here in 2015
I make sure you subscribe here aight a
youtube and check out design course calm
all right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
