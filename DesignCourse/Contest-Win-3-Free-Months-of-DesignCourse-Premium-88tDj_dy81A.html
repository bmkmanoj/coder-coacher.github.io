today we're not going to be doing any
actual design work because it's a really
busy day for me so instead where I'm
going to announce a contest and there
will be one winner of the upcoming
design course calm premium subscription
service and I'm thinking about choosing
around fifty dollars a month for that
until you cancel also along with a 30
day money-back guarantee if you're not
happy with it and I'm thinking I'm going
to be launching here within the next
month in our next 30 days at least and
basically it is to services primarily
it's spit out split up into so the first
one is going to be based around actual
video courses that are released in the
first one I'm launching with is vis ID
which is all about visual identity
design and basically that deals with
designing logos but also so much more
basically the visual identity of a
company and so that's something where I
take you through three different
projects and where I designed full
visual identity for fictional companies
just so you can see how it's done and
then the second part of the service is
what's called mentor so the mentor
service is where you can either a choose
existing projects or fictional projects
and that are associated with our
different courses right now like I said
it's only just vis ID so there will be
several different projects that you can
go ahead and tackle these fictional
brief project briefs and your goal is to
design a mock-up I or a visual identity
for these fictional companies and then
you submit them and then what happens is
I will personally come along take a look
at what you're designing and just really
address where it looks like you need to
be improving on in your design so we go
back and forth until we're both
satisfied that you really came up with
something good so to be a bunch of
projects that you can optionally choose
from and then that's one way you can use
mentor another way is you can submit
your own projects so state let's say for
example you're interested in learning
banner design for example or designing
good banners well you can submit that as
well and I will
all khatik what you've done in order to
help you become a good designer alright
so the way win is to visit this link
right here and that's going to link to a
forum thread and sew visit and join up
real quick it's free to register on the
forums and all you have to do is just
post a thread or a comment in that
thread and that's it and so in a few
days from now I will randomly and I'll
do it through a video I'll use a service
online that will randomly choose the
winner and that's all you have to do
alright so Gary Simon a design course
