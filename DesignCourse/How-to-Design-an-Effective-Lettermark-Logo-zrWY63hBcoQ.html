and today fourteen ready to go and today
we're going to look at designing a
letter mark and it's going to be for a
fictional company called paperclip now
basically a letter mark is a unique
treatment on either a single letter or
multiple letters which are usually just
initials of a business name and they're
designed in some type of unique I in
relevant way so you'll see what I mean
when we get started so again this is an
adobe illustrator CC and as always visit
design course comm put in your email and
also the project files are available for
free as always in the description below
this video alright let's get started
let's go to file new and my width is 800
by 600 I'm gonna hit OK
hit ctrl one to get to a hundred percent
and let's go to view show grid and then
view snap to grid okay so basically the
idea here is to take a company that's
called paperclip which will just say is
a web-based file management storage
system whatever I and make a letter mark
out of the P so we'll say for example
you know the clients requested you know
they want a paperclip as part of it so
it's quite literal so the letter mark
will need to take AP and combine it into
a paperclip so the idea I came up with
was to take you know the right portion
of the paperclip that would be the
portion that is a P I so let's go ahead
and just get started you'll see how this
will all come together I'm gonna zoom up
here so around the middle somewhere
right around there and I'm gonna use the
ellipse tool so I'm just gonna hold
right down here in the center
the middle of one of these square grids
I hold shift and then alt and actually I
may make this I'm gonna go right here in
the center and we'll make it that big
all right so I want to get rid of the
foreground color and then I want to make
the stroke right around there we'll say
seven points then I'm going to use the
direct selection tool to select just
this left point and hit delete okay so
this will serve as kind of like the
pport in and also the right side of the
paper clip now what I want to do is take
our move tool
and with this selected we will duplicate
that ctrl C and ctrl F right click
transform reflect and then just hit OK
so now we'll hold shift and just drag
over and I'll say it's right around here
so we have three in the middle here
three squares and now what I want to do
is just take this and I'm gonna scale it
up by three points right there and then
we'll take this and scale this in by one
all right and then I want to hit control
C control F will right click transform
reflect vertical again and we're gonna
going to just drag that over by holding
shift and I'll say right around there
and then I'm gonna take this and drag it
in three times or drag it down rather
three times as well so one two three and
drag this in once alright so this looks
crazy I know I at this point let's go
ahead and connect all these so with the
pen tool selected we'll we'll connect
that to there and I'll select that back
here to deselect that and then we'll
take this one connect that over there
and then we'll do this again we'll take
this one we'll end it right around here
and then finally take this over here
we'll come right around
I'd say here's good and then hold shift
and down alright so everything's really
thin right now so let's go ahead and
take everything and it's all by the way
is on the same path and we're going to
increase the stroke size and I think 17
is pretty good and when we were
duplicating these these weren't exactly
snapping to the grid points so if we
just select this one and just slightly
move it it'll give us a perfectly
horizontal path like you can see right
here it's not perfect so just take this
and move it slightly and that way
everything is actually straight actually
this still there we go alright so it
sometimes it's just a matter playing
with it so if we hit control 1 we go
back here to view will hide the grid and
we will turn off snap to grid take our
move tool move this over at this point
if you want to make any adjustments you
can use the direct selection tool to go
ahead and move these around I think this
is pretty decent but if you want it to
be a little bit more condensed you could
do so like that and once you're happy
with the actual shape we can select
everything go to object path and then
outline stroke so now it's no longer a
stroke everything's outlined as it needs
to be and there we go so as you can see
the letter mark here is taking this P
right here and then it's also combining
it into the shape of a paperclip so that
is basically all we need to do now if
you wanted to color this or whatever
that's fine but since this is strictly a
video about you know creating the shape
or the form of a letter mark then I'm
just gonna end it right here though we
could real quick if I wanted to just to
show like what this would look like
alongside an actual word mark to create
what's called a combination mark which
is taking a symbol along with the actual
type I'll just real quickly type in
paperclip
let me just scale out here and I'm gonna
use a font this is one I purchased
called trade gothic and you could
present the logo like this I'm gonna
take everything copped or duplicate it
rather or you can have it at the top and
there you go you have yourself an
effective logo this here would again
this is a combination mark and then we
just have our letter mark up here I and
there we go so hope you enjoyed it if
you have any questions let me know and
as always visit design course calm and
if you need access to the project files
they are below in the description all
right I will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
