comm today I'm gonna do something I did
in one of the other previous videos
earlier in the year and I'm gonna put
myself on the spot and I'm gonna use
this random letter generator website I'm
going to click generate the random
letter and then once it generates the
letter I'm going to think of the first
noun that begins with that letter and
then the goal is to take that letter and
somehow try to convey the idea of
whatever that noun was like first came
to my mind within that split-second
through the negative space and through
the form and the shape of the letter so
this of course I if you're unfamiliar
with it this is this would be like a
logo design it's also referred to as a
letter mark and so basically I yeah
let's go ahead and get started check out
design course comm if you haven't yet
though and subscribe here on youtube all
right okay so we're at random letter
generator calm so I'm going to go ahead
and click on generate another random
letter and then whatever's the first
word that comes to mind a noun I will
say nose okay alright let's do this no
we're not in Photoshop we're in
illustrator nose okay and alright so I'm
going to put a capital and a lowercase n
I think right off the bat well let me
just go through some fonts here I think
it's gonna make the most sense to use a
lowercase not this is like sharp edges
right here which a nose isn't that so
I'm gonna switch over here try to come
up with something that could emulate a
nose out of this shape it's gonna be
tough I can't really figure out how I
might do this yeah maybe maybe that way
I'm thinking of some things in my head
okay
trying to think of I you know it kind of
looks like you know the the two eyes and
I could be here and I could be here the
start of the nose right here and I kind
of like you know let me try that I don't
really like this with the way it has
that tail up there so let me hate well
that's going to be the same thing just
flipped let me try a couple different
fonts here
alright you know what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna make my own end because this is
kind of irritating so let me we go to
view and show grid view we're gonna snap
to grid take the pen tool here and then
we will get out do that gradient section
and get rid of the fill for the
foreground add a black stroke make it
like 15 I think somewhere around there
just to start with and I'll go ahead and
click right here click right there
actually let me alright right there
there okay so let me increase that size
get rid of that all right so I I know
what a little nose looks like but let me
go ahead and get up I kind of like a
reference here so I'm gonna get this off
screen all right so I have I off-screen
let me drag it on to the screen real
quick
I just have Google Images up here just
so we can see you know we all know it'll
nose looks like but kind of helps just
to see them up front so we can get an
idea of how I can put this together so
that it still looks like an end but it's
also a nose all right so all right I'm
gonna try this so we're gonna have like
the nostrils gonna come from like right
around here
yeah real quick let me get rid of that
stroke gonna make this white and I'm
also going to get rid of the grid hide
grid okay and
let me come over here kind of pull this
up all right so far so good
all right and I'm gonna get this back up
here just so I get a somewhat of an idea
of what we can do here all right so I
I'm gonna take this yeah we're gonna get
the black back on our foreground oops I
forgot that still a stroke I'm just
going to take that go to object path and
outline stroke take this yeah okay so
now I want to add an actual like nostril
sort of black area so naturally it would
come down right around here so maybe
right here bring that back up just say
good idea okay so right around here
I may have to adjust this we'll see all
right I all right so what I'm gonna do
right real quick is take these two and
just stock control C control F duplicate
them right click and go to reflect
vertical and just place these over here
and see if that looks like a nose yet I
mean I don't know maybe it looks like
two bells right here like the belt and I
don't know all right so those nostrils
need updating so start around there
again
all right I think this will probably
work a lot better we'll see though yeah
this is some pretty big nostrils I'd say
that um I take them both and scale them
down maybe a little bit one two three
four five six um yeah kind of you know
it does look pretty decently I kind of
like a nose I guess you could say you
know we could even add some more
possibly some more definition to this
but I what we can do first though is we
take this layer select that layer cut a
window Pathfinder and click on this we
can get rid of that let me drag that
back up on top real quick and click on
that alright so now we got rid of that
so it's transparent here let me just put
that over here real quick
yeah maybe something like right around
there and then
does that make sense I don't know about
that yeah maybe for me like gray or you
know that what's that thing called
underneath your nose just above your lip
is like a yeah this part right here or
what if I did like a shadow of sorts
I'll try it just for the fun of it I
don't like this over there so I'm gonna
get rid of that you know what I could
try just going down like this coming out
that way it kind of shapes the nose a
little bit better okay so let me reflect
that real quick
oops that did not get copied reflect
yeah I'll see that one too I'm gonna get
rid of that though just temporarily and
then try one final idea
this might be difficult to get this
right
all right all right around there
probably would use a grid at this point
to make sure this is all correctly lined
but that's okay I just this is just for
quick practice
ah trying to show like like what it
would look like with a shadow count like
a nose shadow sort of thing yeah and
yeah you know what I think I kind of
just like I like the other one
although this is pretty simple usually
when it comes to simplicity simple is
better so this over here it's a it's a
little bit much I kind of like this we
have the end it's identifiable I let me
put some type with this real quick OSE
convert them to outlines real quick got
an object path offset path thicken it up
a little bit so it matches that over
here a little bit better it okay yeah
all right so yeah that's it I think I
did pretty effectively you know put
myself on the yeah myself on the spot so
that I try to come up with a cool letter
mark type of logo but yeah you go ahead
and do this on your own it's good
practice just to try to think outside of
the box you know using colors or the
shape of the letters using negative
space to come up with something that's
pretty cool alright so I'll see you guys
tomorrow I'm thinking about tomorrow
being the design challenge number three
announcements so we'll see all right so
I will see you then check out design
course if you haven't yet and also
subscribe here at YouTube alright I'll
see you tomorrow good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
