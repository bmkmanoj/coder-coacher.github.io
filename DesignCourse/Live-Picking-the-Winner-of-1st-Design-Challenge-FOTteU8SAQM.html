little intro I want to make sure this is
streaming first because the first time
I've streamed a live event awesome okay
it looks like it is working stream
versus first time and now I can hear
myself at an echo one second sweet
alright so basically we are going to be
choosing the very first design course
are not designed course but my god
course tetra com design challenge winner
and we had 129 entries a ton more and I
thought we were going to get which is a
good thing and let me minimize this I
see myself talking in this video real
quick Gillian alright and yeah we had
well I won't say well we had a ton of
you know subpar entries because there's
a lot of beginners here I and then we
had you know probably about twenty five
percent were pretty good alright and
then we had just a handful that were
really good I so again the winner is
going to be receiving just fifty dollars
via paypal or whatever method that
person or that we can come up with and
just free access to our single paid
course okay so what I want to do now is
just switch over to my desktop make sure
that works correctly there we go and
okay so you're good ended just an hour
ago again 129 entries and 96 users not
too bad and i also just integrated the
ability to sort these by the newest
oldest highest rating and Louis writing
so right now by default I have this on
highest rating and so I I just want to
preface this by saying I the top I would
say 10 almost 2 15 we're very very close
I the top five
almost indistinguishable in terms of the
grading now I know I this person they
got the eighty-four percent eighty-two
percent eighty percent 78 and 78 there's
only you know four to six percent by the
difference in terms of percentages but
to me they're almost all pretty equal so
choosing one it sucks I don't want to
have to do it but I have to do it I and
so I'm just going to give some of my
thoughts about maybe the first ten
entries and then i'll choose the winner
also yeah this guy was rated the highest
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
win though i can say that about the top
five um so looking at this this is one
of the initial entries one of the first
entries on the first day and I really
liked it I simplicity definitely has it
I'm looking at the relevant factor we
have a hamburger that's pretty sweet I
obviously accurate we have uniqueness
you know the hamburger with the two dots
and middles pretty unique versatility is
very good there's nothing that's too
small that's going to get lost when it's
scaled down and color and contrast I you
know probably that's where it's lacking
the most but not much there's still
really good contrast and then coming
down here this is a good entry as well I
liked it a lot obviously it's ready to
top simplicity again all the same things
can be said about this one up here in
terms of simplicity I very unique
concept I probably should have read the
unique to such a tad bit higher just
because it's a um you know like one of
those fancy dinner plates with a platter
or whatever but also at the same time it
serves as the the bot of sorts so this
one very good this one I really liked
the concept of having you know your fork
over here up dinner plate and then over
here however also worked in very
uniquely and works well is this little
message icon and the the biggest part
that I didn't necessarily like was I how
big this was in relation to the size the
textplus it's all kind of separated out
because there's three different objects
a part of the single symbol
other than that I really like it coming
down here everything is spot-on for this
maybe not for in terms of color and
contrast this is I doesn't really
contrast a lot cuz this isn't up here
white but everything is spot-on I'd say
the only area that was lacking part we
would be the uniqueness factor um you
know we have a fork we have a message
icon still everything else is very well
designed I'm coming down here I really
really like this one as well I and I'm
not going to read their comments but I
noticed they did not mention anything in
terms of trying to symbolize like a
stethoscope which to me I see a step
that goes stethoscope here I because we
have like the part you put in your ear
but it also serves as a heart obviously
and also the baud thing is taken care of
the only minor grep has this is pretty
large dissemble in relation to the size
of the word mark but all in all really
like this concept in normally I wouldn't
like how the colors were applied here
I'm looking over here making sure
everything's going well and but I do
like how they I them really integrated
seamlessly works well in my opinion I'm
coming down here this one very kind of a
cutesy sort of concept with the egg the
yolk here and then just you know a tiny
little um sort of message blip down
there I'm not sure their intention was
to be so loose with this but I still
kind of liked it anyhow good entry I'm
coming down here I like the century a
lot in terms of simplicity and the
concept very unique concept kind of like
the what was that robot from that famous
movie I forget the damn movies name it
but whatever I like that the only thing
I didn't like was 22 different aspects
everything is too thin I mean if you
really scaled this down as it is real
small I mean it would be really skinny
lines are thin wait um and then also the
the proportionality um in distance
between the letter or the word mark in
the symbol itself I think we scaled down
just a bit this rate here kind of
separated a little bit more it would
stand up just a bit more but i really
like a good job over here now we're get
a little bit more of a separation
between the entry
up here I like this a lot in terms of
design aesthetics very well put together
the concept is good as well it's
definitely relevant color and contrast
is good I also the type in relation to
the symbol itself is good it's
consistent because you have these nice
smooth sort of corners as well and up
here and they match well I think I
didn't like it just gets a little bit
too complex you know we have the handles
over here we have these three blips up
here just a little bit too much but very
good otherwise same thing over here we
have a um you know very good entry I
like the color simplicity versatility
I'm not I don't like necessarily the
hand coming off to the side I especially
given you know it starts up here it ends
down here a little bit kind of
disconnected in a way um but still very
solid entry in the last one I'll review
is this one right here um you know I
definitely don't like the color and
contrast with the gray in the white but
not a big deal in my comments up here I
big issue I wouldn't even say it's a big
issue it's just the relevance category
because brain is usually seen as logic
not necessarily health and that's it I
we had a lot of really good entries
though down here um this could easily
have been up there and rated higher
possibly um this as well I but I can't
go through all these he's going to get
too long so uh yeah Johnny Five are
Wally awesome all right I so a lot is
really good we have nine pages I before
I announce the winner um let's look at
some of the lowest rated all right
though coming down here this guy this
guy wins as the the Biggest Loser
concept I obviously this is a joke I
assume very good miss over here yeah
more like a it's kind of like a graphic
or definitely not a logo up here I but
yeah so these are the people that you
know could really stand to benefit
obviously by sorting
by the highest rating and just taking a
look at my comments how I judged them
I'm as well as these video reviews as
well so cool stuff ok so again it came
down really to the top five entries so I
what I did was I went into Photoshop and
I took those top five when I put them
side-by-side to kind of better help me
arrive at a conclusion again any of
these could win don't get pissed off if
yours is up here and you you don't win
you know someone has to win it's just I
have the crappy job of choosing it but
looking at these and I think also in the
future I'm going to make it so you know
don't you know everybody has to use the
same color background because this kind
of makes a little bit more difficult
when there are different backgrounds but
probably say everybody use a white
background in the future but ignoring
that I'm just looking at how well be
scaled down and kind of what just
catches your eye on the one that I think
does the best terms of scalability it's
probably this one right here again
there's not much difference between many
of these so I really like this one and
also in terms of just raw uniqueness I
in terms of how they put the concept
together and all the various elements I
you know we have food illustrations here
all four of these and of course there's
been many other entries that didn't ill
illustrate food at all I but I really
like this one I just I overall just by a
tad bit more so the user who submitted
this concept is the winner of the very
first course cetera calm design
challenge so what I need to do over here
is click on make winner and now it even
refresh the fuck is going on here all
right winter winning entry right here
alright so again guys I yeah don't get
mad that if i raided your enter terribly
terribly or you didn't win or whatever
we're gonna have a lot more of these and
i let me just switch back to speaking to
you directly
I very shortly after I make a few more
adjustments to the design challenge
system I we're going to have multiple
simultaneous design challenges so I
build it so that we could have you know
as many as we want but I'll probably
just stick to two or three at a time and
that way it gives people more of a
chance to work more on multiple things
at the same time um so having said that
the next entry I will be very shortly
maybe i'll announce in the next couple
days and that time this one is not going
to be a logo design this next entry I'm
not exactly sure what it's going to be
probably something like an app launcher
icon for mobile apps something you know
very simple it doesn't take a ton of
time to do you know again like a logo um
or something like a UI element a custom
UI element of sorts I so if you have
ideas submit them I on the YouTube
channel in the comments and let me know
and yeah so in a couple days announce
the next one also be integrating more
features with within the system for
example when I rate your entry I'll make
it email you so you have to find it I
and also when you login it'll show you
like a quick you know version of where
your entries are so you don't have to
school through all these damn pages yeah
and that's that okay also coding
challenges going to be developing that
soon so if you're interested in coding
learning how to code I know a lot of you
come from Viv's you know slide nerds
channel you're all coders you're going
to be able to work submit on interesting
design or not or coding challenges and
Viv's will be kind of controlling that
and judging that as well we have to come
up with a really good concept because
obviously design and coding two
different things but anyhow I that is it
alright hopefully you guys enjoyed it
let me know if you have an ink any
comments again and I will talk to you
guys later
and what you find</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
