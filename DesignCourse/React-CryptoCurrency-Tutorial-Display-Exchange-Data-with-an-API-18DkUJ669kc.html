Gary Simon of course Sestero calm and
they are continuing on with this sort of
introduction to cryptocurrency api's and
the last one I did I the same exact
tutorial except for a few J s today this
is based on react and then the one
coming up after will be angular so being
that react is perhaps you know the most
popular front-end modern JavaScript
framework then it makes complete sense
to start using it to develop for the
growing cryptocurrency industry so in
this tutorial you're going to learn how
to use react to connect to a hundred
percent free public cryptocurrency API
called crypto compare alright so let's
get started here first prerequisites as
always react requires no js' with npm
where they no package manager oh but
real quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera comm
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on youtube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it manager so to check
whether or not you have that installed
go to your command line or console and
type note - V and NPM - V now if they
don't give you version numbers and their
unrecognized then just go to node.js org
the download section and download the
appropriate installer based on your
operating system and then install it
with the default settings and then
reload your command line or console you
can run these and they'll give you verse
numbers all right so the next step we
need to install the react CLI or command
line interface tool to create the
project so to do that we simply run npm
install create react app and then just
add the global flag at the end so it'll
stall it to globally on your machine hit
enter and it will install I already have
installed so I'm not going to do that
and then once it's finished we're going
to use it and by the way run this
wherever you store your you know your
projects at mine's in a folder called
code and
we're going to name it react crypto all
right so this will run through doesn't
take too long I'm going to pause for it
to finish alright so once it's finished
it's gonna say CD into the project named
folder so ours is Curie I react crypto
so CD react crypto and then you can use
yarn start or NPM start which you
already have that installed I have yarn
as well so I'm just going to hit start
and this will in another window launch a
local development server with the
project and this is what shows up at
localhost 3000 so this is just the
default template says just yet started
use the source app J s and safe to
reload automatically so we're not going
to do that just yet instead I'm going to
round to bed by the way I'm using
commander which is this console emulator
for Windows I if you just let me bring
that up a real quick if we right-click
we can choose new console hit start
we're going to go back to the same
project folder so it's going to be CD
code
react crypto and this way the reason I'm
doing this is so I don't have to stop
this I this the start command and we're
gonna use NPM to install Axios which is
an HTTP client library and we also use
the same library for view Jas and this
simply allows us to make calls to get
calls to the public API from crypto
compare so I'm just gonna wait for this
to install and I'll come right back
alright so once that is finished you can
open up your code editor I'm using
Visual Studio code which is free from
Microsoft and we have our react crypto
folder open right here and this is the
folder and file structure so we're gonna
keep this real simple we're not gonna
have multiple components or anything so
we're gonna navigate to that source app
j/s component which is really all the
logic and the the basic template that we
see here currently I write here so we're
going to be gutting all this but first
before we work on the template section
we're going to import Axios which we
just installed with NPM so import Axios
from Axios alright and then next in our
component logic which just resides right
here within the class we're going to
create a constructor and we're going to
pass in props for our properties we're
gonna use super props here and then this
dot state is going to equal an object
containing our property so we're just
going to have Kryptos as an array right
here this is going to hold the response
from the API request that we're going to
be doing next after that we're going to
use the component did mount function and
did mount and all that does is
essentially anything inside of here will
be executed once this component loads or
the app loads by default in the case of
you know I was just using the default
app component so then inside of here is
where we make our Axios get call so
Axios get and then this is where the URL
goes for the API endpoint now let me
just show you real quickly the crypto
compare API documentation so you can see
here this is the URL cryptic appear calm
for slash API we want to go to the data
section and this is going to provide you
with all at the endpoints and the URL
parameters and the return data so you
can do one for the entire corn list and
this is huge so you get just general
info on all the coins available on the
website and it will return an example
right here for instance of you know the
data associated like with LTC which is
like coin you're gonna get the URL image
URL the name of it the coin name the
full name of the coin and just a few
more other properties are associated
with each coin and there's tons that are
returned so this this particular call
does take a little bit of time to
actually process and so this is the URL
where you would put in that get request
we're not going to do that though we're
gonna focus on price because it's a lot
quicker
and we're going to use the one that is
price multi and I like this just because
it allows you to specify you know any
type of cryptocurrency here and then
also the currencies that it will show
you that this these currencies are worth
so we're just going to use this example
right here except I slightly changed it
up I'm going to copy that real quick
off-screen and I'm going to paste it
right in here
all right so I'm gonna hit ctrl B to get
rid of the sidebar so Axio so we can see
that we're you know using the price
multi here and then we have two
different parameters F simms and also T
simms so we're going to get the data for
the price data for Bitcoin e th is
aetherium and IOT is iota and then I
only want the US dollar amount
equivalent of what they're currently
worth next we'll put in then so once it
gets the response we're going to say
response arrow function we're gonna
create a constant of Kryptos and we're
going to say it's going to be response
you could just put your response but we
only want the data property of the
response if you want to see the full
response we can console.log Kryptos
right here and you'll see that once we
do this we'll see we have the data or
the data property and that's the only
thing that we're really interested in
and then we're gonna do this that set
state pass in Kryptos and bind it to
Kryptos so now let's save that and I we
have this failed to compile error I
found that it's fixed that if we just
rerun the MPM or yarn start command in
the console alright so hit control C hit
Y do this again that's right there's an
issue right now that doesn't seem to be
working out based on my research where
we have to run NPM and install once more
and then you can run yarn start or MPN
start and it will work and it's based on
I believe the NPN
that's currently being used I I mean
have an older one but yeah anybody if
you find a solution to this particular
issue just mention it there in the
YouTube comments
now once it's finished I'm gonna run
yard start once again yep there we go
okay so it's rerun and here we are if I
hit control shift I will get up our
console we see we have the object that
we console logged and here we go so we
have the coin theorem and iota being
returned in this object so now let's go
back and now we can work on our actual
template section right here so we're
going to go everything between div class
name is app and we're going to put in
some curly braces with object keys and
this is because what's being returned up
here is not really a an array it's an
object so to get access to the keys we
use object keys we pass in this state
cryptos scripts what am i doing I'm
reading something else Kryptos and on we
map it and we take the key we use arrow
functions here and then inside of here
is where we do the actual iterable so
we're gonna put a div ID of crypto
container inside of here we're gonna put
a span class name of left and it's one
of the reasons I do not like one of the
very small reasons why I don't like
react here I have to put class name
instead of class also class name of
right so the key of course will accept
or ill to display you know btc-e thri ot
and then to get the actual value we use
this state kryptos and then we get the
key USD and USD if you recall is the
property name associated with the dollar
US dollar amount
all right so let's go ahead and save
this
check it out in a browser and this is
what it looks like very very very very
very ugly
so also logo is defined but never used
let's go ahead and fix that real quick
we're gonna remove this logo
we're gonna hit ctrl B we're gonna go to
the app CSS and I'm just going to paste
in four different roll sets here you can
find these at the written version of the
tutorial which is linked in the first
line of the description here in YouTube
and this is all I'm doing it's just
gonna make it look a lot better now if
we go back there we go something a lot
better so also notice this looks
horrible
I because these aren't correctly
improperly formatted numbers for US
dollars so to fix that real quickly just
to show you because chances are if
you're doing cryptocurrencies you may be
displaying dollar amounts in some form
so let's go back to our console and the
other tab right here and we're going to
use NPM to install a package so in p.m.
install react number format save it as a
dependency and this should go pretty
quickly alright that's done we're going
to go back to our app j/s we're going to
import the or assign a variable rather
to react number format which we just
included and then right down here I'm
just going to copy this real quick and
we're going to put in the way we use
that package is by number format the
value equals what we just copied and
then display type will be 'text and then
also a decimal precision equals two
because we only need two decimal points
for the US dollar amount and then we
also need thousand separator
equals true and that's obvious and then
prefix will say equals the dollar amount
there so let's save it and see if this
sucker works all right I must have
messed up that property cuz there should
be a comma let me go back yes because I
don't know how to spell yeah it can be
at ease supposed to be an a there and
then I there we go awesome and that is
it essentially so you know I obviously
crypto compare it provides you with a
ton of potential I end points to you for
you to gather a lot of information so
suggest definitely checking that out so
now some of these I you may need to
install when you're developing at least
this course plugging in here if you're
going to use Chrome and this allows this
adds that allow control allow origin to
any and that way if you run into an
error running some of these like coin
list I believe like if you try to access
this you will need to enable that in
order for it to work correctly alright
so hopefully you learned a lot
throughout this and if you're interested
in learning how to do the same process
in angular or view you can also check
out those associated tutorials check out
course cetera calm and I'll see you
later good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
