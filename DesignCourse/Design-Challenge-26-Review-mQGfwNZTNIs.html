time course calm welcome to design
challenge number 26 review and this is
based on designing an iOS app icon or
app launcher now we have like 40 entries
which is great because that's more than
any other contests that we have before i
but i have to say i am pretty
disappointed in most of the entries we
had a couple really good ones I but for
the most part the quality wasn't there
that I would hope at least as a baseline
I think what I'm going to start doing
from now on for future design challenges
is put forth more specific guidelines in
terms of what you can and can't do all
right because most of you are just brand
new designers and I'm just going out
there and say hey design a logo and it's
just not working out I think it's going
to be best for you guys and myself when
I'm reviewing these and critiquing them
if I put forth more specific guidelines
so look for that in the future so now
what I want to do is pick the winner the
one random winner for the live
one-on-one design training from design
course calm and then I'll do the review
all right let's get to it alright so
here are all 34 unique entries are
submitters to the contest right here so
if you submitted one your name should be
in here and so let's go ahead and do
this pick a random name and this person
once again will wear it well win the
one-on-one design training and again let
me get that up on the site real quick
and that is right here so this is what I
released last week this is airoli
one-on-one design training with myself
we use something like a skype client I
so yeah check this out and this person
just 11 hour cool so i will get a hold
of you I and we'll set that up if you
wish to take advantage of it alright so
let's go ahead and get started here with
the review there's a lot of them so I'm
going to go through these kind of
quickly all right so Laura Cass all
right hope I understand the over idea of
network secure unfortunately I think you
misread that it was neighbor secure I
believe yes it was so maybe you kind of
got that confused
a bit let me scale this down just so I
could see a tad bit better I see ya
unfortunately the shape that we have
here with this doesn't really make sense
to me I'll know me sure what this hero
is like maybe like some type of stand
for this to go on but unfortunately um
it's just too confusing so that would be
the major crux off the issue here with
this design I mean plus its I the fact
that its neighbor secure obviously no
neighbor was worked into this symbolism
at least so that is one issue but thanks
for the answering anyhow let me go back
to a hundred percent here ok so n for
the neighbor makes our house and around
strokes to give it a technological and
friendly approachable feel to it alright
so this isn't bad but I just think
there's probably it's a little bit too
difficult for me to make out the N if I
didn't know an end was worked in here
somehow so there's a lot of lines coming
together even though it's simple which
is good i but i think if we if you could
try to maybe eliminate the idea of
having a bunch of lines I understand
that will take away from the technical
kind of what you call this thing is a
schematic board I the reference to it
but making it kind of just filled in
would make it easier to see the house
shape in the end other than that I like
the idea in the concept behind this
alright although i'm not sure what this
is right here the shadow i wouldn't do
that alright so I ten 4091 first time
submitting anything here ok so let's
take a look at both of these real
quickly just a different color scheme
apparently I think I like this one
better at the top because the white
container at least against this darker
purple background stands out more
there's more contrast here we kind of
have contrast issue slightly I'll look
at the contest the concept of itself
this is probably the most obvious
approach to take it which is a house
with a lock so I like it for the
symbolism I really can't say anything
too bad about it maybe it's the most
obvious approach which gets you know be
construed as a negative but not so much
I think it's you
it's simple and it everything that
you've done design-wise is good and
you've I've definitely one of the better
entry so thanks for that alright so
man's em okay so the issue here is we
don't have the conventional the rounded
corner container which is unique to iOS
app icons now when it comes to android
app icons you can make him a circle like
this if you wish but they has to have
the this I this square rounded corner
thing so that's one issue aside from
that technical issue I would say you
know the idea you know that you were
trying to allude to the idea of
neighborhoods cure app icon and I
representative security with a
reflection of a house and the pupil of
the eye it's it it doesn't look like an
eye enough I to the point at which if a
person didn't know it was an I already
they would have a hard time making that
connection having this little I would
additionally i would say when it comes
to this this very light blue I you know
once again if you're on the white
background which you have it against a
white background you can't really
there's not enough contrast so that's
one issue as well so I like the other
the concept that you're trying to
portray here I just think it would
probably need to be executed a little
bit better alright thanks for that
submission alright so been in size R and
Omega a tres pronounce that all right
hey I had two ideas hope it's not a
problem okay so let's see here okay so
this one from a conceptual standpoint
makes more sense than this one I'm not
sure what the diamond really has to do
with anything with when it comes to
neighborhood secure so that's one issue
with that that's the biggest issue here
this one we have a shield but I don't
really see anything that's alluding to
the idea of a neighborhood or people or
social or anything so you've missed out
on there so we were really trying to
work with what's called a monogram you
know the idea of taking a single symbol
and representing at least two ideas
which is neighborhood or social and
security so you got security here with
the shield
unfortunately not the other aspect and
then when it comes to everything else I
would say there's probably a little bit
too much going on in terms of all the
gradients we got the thin strokes here
get a block we got a white one I we got
this kind of glow reflective area coming
off here and got the red gradings over
here just too much going on in the realm
of effects so I would try to work on
simplifying it a little bit better all
right so Tobias here we go this is a
good submission so the idea here is to
take a house with and combine it with a
padlock so I think this is a pretty
effective approach and this is
definitely one of the better design
submissions that we had so didn't go too
intense on the the long shadow which is
good some people try to do try to
emphasize it too much and then it takes
away from the design itself so it should
always be just a very secondary element
barely noticeable if you're to do it all
right but yeah I can't really say maybe
this gray right here should be white
aside from that I probably not going to
critique this anymore it's pretty solid
so thanks for that submission okay so
Mike's design all right all right
fourteen-year-old designer here all
right so the lock in the middle supposed
to resemble represent the fact of
secured neighborhood is entry took me by
okay I was thinking about recording my
screen ok so the lock in the middle is
supposed to represent the face that are
the fact of a secured neighborhood so I
don't really see anything that's
representative of the neighborhood
aspect um you know we have like the
keyhole and then we have the padlock but
there's we don't have that other element
so that would be the biggest issue now
in terms of keeping things simple I and
everything else in terms of white space
and you know margin padding that you
have going on and use of color and
contrast everything else is good just
that one element was missed I would say
so thanks for that this is the first
mission of the gala
I were like your work okay all right so
there's a couple issues here I see what
you were trying to do from a conceptual
standpoint you're trying to take the
idea you know the neighborhood idea by
embedding it into the center of the lock
and having you know stylized human
figures here in the center so I like
that idea the problem is we have a lot
of issues with color and contrast here
so if you take a look at this I you know
the container right here the iOS
container I and then we take a look at
you know the type of colors you use
specifically over here it doesn't
contrast enough for with this shape the
padlock shape the padlock should be
something that really stands out a lot a
lot more than this muted grey that you
have should be like a light almost and
then inside of it we have another area
where there's not a lot of contrast
either specifically if you're looking at
this turquoise and then you're looking
at the bottom of this container or this
this padlock where this gray makes it
kind of clashes there's not enough
contrast there and if you fix these
contrast issues it would be a much
better approach and much better design
essentially so work on the color and I
say that would be the best bet all right
so coming down here Youssef all right I
ok so there's some issues there's
definitely interested it's too complex
you try to work on too many things and
there's a lot going on we have tiny
little thin strokes right here as well
over here so if you scale that down to
the actual size of what it would be on
an iphone for example it would look
blurry and you don't want blurry trust
me all right so secondly you know
working the binoculars into the N itself
it's just a little bit too complex of an
idea that you try to portray here and
then we have you know a certain type of
N and then we have a lowercase s I and
then it collides with the back portion
of this shield it creates for clutter
it's generally you want to try to when
it comes to the app icon you want to
work things you know you want to avoid
overlapping things basically if you can
do it so i would say focus on
simplifying the design and try to avoid
overlap
parts of the design that are separate
from each other alright thanks for that
alright so Julia all right but first
challenge the key teeth I don't know
what they're called are supposed to be
houses to represent a neighborhood okay
all right so looking at this um let's
see here definitely this one is a better
approach opposed to this one just
because if you were scale it's down at
the size of what it would be on an
iPhone or an iPad or whatever I all
these strokes especially right here it's
only like two pixels in between we see
the white that would become blurred and
once again you don't want blurry
additionally so that's why this one
would be better a lot better just
because it's a filled in shape and
people would be able to see the actual
shape rather than just looking at the
outlines having said that I looking at
this there's also an issue when it comes
to how small the the spaces are we see
like this one pixel which is literally
one pixel in between each of the houses
and that's going to get blurred when you
show it at the actual size I should have
required you guys to take your the icons
and scale them down to a size of what
they would actually be so if like you're
at this size probably scale it down to
like 48 by 48 pixels or something like
that because then we would be able to
see if something is truly effective I
like the concept itself but I don't
think these little key notches would be
obvious enough at the actual size the
icon would be used unfortunately all
right so thanks for that everything else
is good though about the colors and such
all right so coming up to here okay came
up with that idea either another idea
things better than the first one the
icon is a monogram s okay so I had a lot
of like a lot of difficulty figuring out
what was happening just to be honest
here I could not see in s really I mean
maybe it's just me maybe it starts up
here and it comes down um but what I saw
initially without even reading I saw two
individuals sitting on top of each other
or one sitting on another person's back
like I saw a head here or see a head
here and
arm the torso and the bottom and the
legs here and then the same object kind
of just sitting on that person's back
honestly that is what I saw now reading
this I the icon monogram s the two
streets combined to make an S for secure
and the doors are next to each other or
across anyway it still captures a
neighbor feeling with two doors side by
side it's hard for me to see the door
here I can see like you know a doorknob
but I don't really see how the door it's
very abstract it's difficult for me to
to understand what's happening here what
I honestly see are two people sitting on
top of each other so having said that I
ignoring the concept of execution part
of it I would say that the colors would
need to be a little bit more contrast
with this type of blue in this green I
think the blue would need to be a little
bit darker or the green would be need to
be a little bit lighter just a little
bit though alright thanks for that
alright so Rovin I'm not a designer just
a hobbyist hope you like this I do it
lacks creativity I come here to be
inspired okay ya see this it's just I
four different houses not different they
were duplicated or replicated rather
slapped on top of a shield so the
execution isn't really there now you
instead of just replicating objects you
go you really want to come up with a
single unique idea or concept instead of
you know just kind of slapping on
randomly these objects here so you want
to try to think of when it comes to to
with these let me come up here I when it
comes to these symbols for example
everything is like like this one for
example very simple it's it's own idea
and a couple one over here this one it
is its own symbol we're going to find
another one because I know we had a
couple this run right here is its own
symbol so the submission over here it
just kind of locks that execution in
terms of making a single symbol so
that's what I would focus on alright
thanks for that alright so Z so I let me
know so I out the spell or pronounce
that let's see here umm
okay so design-wise I like what's going
on here it's simple the colors work well
the long shadows work well because
they're not very obvious but they're
obvious enough that you can see them but
in terms of the symbolism I do have a
problem with that just because they're
they seem a little bit to separate and
there's also an issue it's kind of
annoying me with these three elements
here kind of seated at the bottom of the
icon it almost feels like a need they
need to be centered like right here is
the center and then Center it into the
center of like move everything up by
about 40 pixels basically I think it'd
be centered inside of the container
itself a little bit better in terms of
the symbolism it's just yet the things
are separated because you have two
houses here and then a key or a padlock
ideally we work these in together
somehow someway instead of making them
three separate objects because then you
introduce a level of complexity to it
other than that everything else is
really good all right so looking down
here all right so yeah some big issues
with this one yet when it comes to your
symbolism we have again something is
repeated or replicated four times the
other rooftops again you you want to
stick to just one ideally otherwise it
gets too complex too much happening here
basically then you have issues white
space I margin and padding in terms of
the the roofs getting too close to the
edge right here you want to try to give
your symbolism room to breathe basically
a lot of good white space on the top
left right bottom okay so focus on that
all right so Jonathan Gray all right
look at this one several issues I the
icon itself just looking at this icon
itself and the idea of it it's not bad
you know we have the padlock we have the
house inside of it you know somebody a
couple of their took this approach but
the execution seriously lacking a couple
ways first I there's no anti-aliasing
going on so all the edges are jagged not
ideal and then a coloring contrast so we
have this you know this nice pretty
color right here for the icon
background but then we have this gray
which transitions into a darker gray and
over here particularly it starts to
clash a little bit need a little bit
more contrast it should be either black
or white and this one will be a little
bit darker in the case of this being
white the long shadow of course just
kind of keeps on going ideally keep it
right here inside of the icon but yeah
the anti-aliasing issue is really making
it I kind of just throwing it off big
time so definitely look into that into
rabbiting that situation in Photoshop
assuming that's what you used okay all
right so looking at this the issue with
this is once again if we scale this down
to the size that would be used on an
iphone for example it would be probably
it would lose a lot of its detail
especially with these individual houses
so you scale it down it's going to look
like little blurred lines essentially
and then you lose the concept so I like
the idea of the concept I just think it
would I yeah and once again I thought
this may be from this person because we
still have the anti-aliasing issues kind
of going on here it's a little bit
jagged right here so I'm not watch I'm
not sure what's happening for you guys
to create that especially over here I
see those like a it's barely even a
pixel and you can barely see this stroke
area so it's really throwing it off and
kind of making it look bad unfortunately
you would probably also lose the end in
the S at the size it would actually be
used other than that I like the concept
you just need to execute a little bit
better in a more simplistic manner with
a lot less you know details and such all
right Vlad okay so this one I I do like
the concept itself this is definitely a
different take we have the house roof
top and then we have it kind of just
wrapping around I this shield here so
the concept I like it the colors I don't
unfortunately I there's too many first
you know we it looks like there's like a
five pixel stroke going around
everything and that's a slightly
different hue and /
pull against what's inside in the middle
of it right here and I think all those
elements just kind of clash with each
other too much there's too much going on
in that realm ideally get rid of the
stroke make everything a solid flat
color or if you're going to do a
gradient make a very subtle gradient and
that way you get rid of the complexity
the unnecessary complexity so you could
be complex but it has to be executed
correctly so just to be safe I would say
you know get rid of all the strokes in
the gradients on the strokes and the
gradients on everywhere else and try to
keep a bit more simplified other than
that I like it all right so all right
Liam okay so I wasn't exactly sure the
biggest issue right here is we have
these two rooftops I would assume they
are in the background and they're there
a pass ities probably at like seventy
percent or something like that so
they're kind of faded but not faded
enough so it makes it kind of hard to
see what's happening here you know it
looks like this is the focal point you
know the key in a house but then this is
still cluttering things then you have
this this glossy area to come in there
so I would remove that I would probably
just remove these as well in the
background there necessary you know that
way you'd have something that's much
more simple and it's easier to see and
you know you've already proved your
point in the concept you know you kind
of have a house and a key there we go to
stick with that I would get rid of this
portion too I see is a very subtle area
that's outlined inside of it alright
coming down here alright so this one
unfortunately a lot of issue is going on
here way too complex so when it comes to
icon design you want to stay away from
as much as possible unless you're really
executing it correctly all this details
you know so the starburst effect get rid
of that get rid of the glossiness and
all these very subtle reflections and
highlights get rid of all that stuff and
then I understand you come from a three
this is a 3d render so it's kind of hard
to make it work as well as you would
want it to but there's just too much
going on we have the red
green rather green red and blue here we
have all these tiny reflections and we
have the padlock going through it I like
the concept you know very unique of
course but when it comes to icon design
it's just too much going on especially
with all the reflections and such so I
would work on just probably stay away
from 3d until you can at least master
icon design from a flat 2d perspective
first alright thanks for that and this
is well very difficult to see if this
were at the actual size you would you
wouldn't even see these houses
unfortunately and there's a lot of
issues with the color and contrast not
enough contrast here with this gray I
think my voice is starting to go all
right scollay okay too much happening
here I in terms of the bevels you this
outer portion right here the bevels here
that's not bad but when you get into
here that's where it gets kind of hard
to see especially on the type the
neighbor there's too much I could see
that some sort of bevel was added to it
and it just looks a little bit blotched
if this were scale scale down you
wouldn't be able to read it I think in
my requirements i'm not sure and said
not to use neighbor secure and that
because again you wouldn't see it I
having said that assuming you didn't put
the text here I all we have is in I here
and that that's probably not ideal in
terms of the concept execution just
because an I could be interpreted to be
essentially anything I it's not a bad
route because it is generalized but
again I I think that babbles right here
on the text is what's throwing it off
and then plus we have issues with
contrast this were scaled-down you
probably wanna be able to see the eye so
just too much applied on the effects
grout so I would stay away from that all
right coming down here okay so
unfortunately I this doesn't say
anything about security I mean the
glasses don't really I mean you could
say it does but to your average person
looks at it no in terms of the design
itself or what it is that's good I like
you know the flat design appearance that
was pulled off pretty well
but I say the major issue is just the
concepts okay coming down here all right
all right a blender submission here all
right looking at this so it is just a 10
s letter mark but I don't see anything
else that points to the fact that this
is a neighborhood or a social security
app so with that said I would say the
biggest issue is the concept looking at
this if all we wanted was a like a
letter mark this would be pretty cool
but again not much to out to there's not
much else I can critique unfortunately
aside just to say that you know it's not
executed correctly in terms of concept
thanks for the entry though all right
another entry combined two houses a lock
in an alarm sirens secure all right I
let's see here so yeah there's a little
bit too much happening here and then
also I probably stay away from the 3d
LMK as well I try to stick with making
it you know forward-facing 2d because we
can see all these little notches in here
and it's just becoming a little bit too
complex I do this with illustrator I
assume ignoring the 3d element of it it
seems like there's probably just a
little bit too much going on you know we
have the path the whole pad lock itself
we have the two houses we have the
keyhole and we have these out here and
we have this right here try to simplify
it simplify it much more and I think you
would have a much more solid concept all
right let's go to page two all right
okay so Richard KL so we get a house
with binoculars so this is definitely a
nuke entry I it looks like there's too
many lines just going on here so we have
this right here we have these over here
these at the top we have the two
portions of the house so if you ever
scale this down it would be kind of hard
to see all those details because they
become a little bit cluttered having
said that you know using the house as a
center portion of the binoculars is a
unique ideas creative I think if there
is a way to simplify the whole you know
the binoculars and get rid of all the
lines i did get be a much more solid
concept
so overall not bad all right so I Simon
re I'm this person submitted I'd to
resubmit because their name wasn't
showing up where's this at okay uh so
yeah this is I this is the same person
or no okay no I don't think so so we use
use the same idea of binoculars in a
house I I like the concept I I'm not too
sure repeating them four times is the
best bet the colors and all they're
pretty cool I they complement each other
pretty decently one thing I don't like
is like the inner glow or inner shadow
that's on this binocular kind of throws
things off I would have just left it as
you know without that um but it does
look it visit like it aesthetically it
does look pretty good but again on a
small size you kind of lose as that
detail you know for example if you look
at this one you know what this is right
away you know it's the itunes store it
has something to do with music right
then if we look at this one well
unfortunately kind of lose the the
binocular shape now if you had just had
wine and made it larger you might be
able to see that as details so thanks
for that submission all right here's one
okay new to photoshop yeah so we have
issues here with uh there's too much of
a heavy glossy area I would completely
do away with that because you kind of
almost lose a face it feels like there's
missed on the page or something having
said look at aside from that looking at
this I yeah you don't want to replicate
your your symbolism so definitely don't
do that and in terms of the camera we
have an issue here this tiny fine little
line is going to get lost when you scale
it down and it's used at its actual size
so get rid of all those and try to
combine everything into one unique
symbol instead of just trying to have
separate symbolism all over alright
thanks for that all right Jay tinker all
right so too much happening here with
the lines yeah I think one of the
biggest issues with new designers are
relatively new designers at least is
trying to overthink things I think
overthinking has been
one big issue in this challenge you know
trying to do more than what you need to
do simple is better that good design is
simple good design is as minimal as it
has to be that's what we need to focus
on so you know again I understand the
concept that you're trying to go for but
the lines here the zebra pattern just
throws it off way too much and be way
too complex it's almost disorienting so
I would work on simplifying I would get
rid of those lines and you know for what
it is it's not too bad but
execution-wise with the lines and stuff
I would stay away from so thanks for
that all right column that that yeah
this is the resubmission of that other
one okay so GBC design all right so not
enough here is unique execution-wise for
an eyeball this isn't bad it's it very
simple you would be able to understand
it and a smaller size but there's
nothing relevant here in terms of
combining the two ideas of neighborhood
insecurity unfortunately but thanks for
that all right two attempts excuse the
basic nature but it's the first time
I've tried this all right so this would
be more relevant than this concept i
would say um sorry I'm like burping here
this right here there's a little bit
it's it would be kind of difficult even
to scale this down at its actual size to
see what exactly is happening here we
have some contrast issues and color and
contrast issues with this black in this
dark blue that would be kind of hard to
see this little to pixel shadow right
here would probably get lost in detail
in terms of the pixelization when you
get smaller and too much is happening
even though it's simple there's still
too many subtle things like you see part
of that blue right here part of that
blue padlock right there that's not good
you don't want those tiny details just
sitting there cluttering the design all
right so I would work on simplifying
this even more I know you said the
simple nature but it's still actually a
little bit too much going on this one
unfortunately I mean you can actually
tell what you're trying to convey here
but I just don't think it has enough for
relevance
the idea to make it appropriate all
right all right so this is one of the
entries that I would say is pretty good
you know they are one of the designers
who are able to do something that's
complex but still execute it in an
overall aesthetically pleasing manner
basically so we could clearly tell we
kind of have a padlock sort of situation
going on here and we have a person as
the keyhole I and it's still one thing
it kind of does bother me about this is
this the top padlock portion it seems to
get lost a little bit too much over here
with the shading but other than that for
what it is it's a it's a really cool
take and it's one of the one of the type
of iOS icons that are real graphical but
pulled it off and executed it
appropriately if you're going to do
something that complex and really cool
kind of recreation here as well so
thanks for that submission all right so
white out all right you know this is
actually a pretty cool concept um you
know we can see a surveillance camera
with kind of like a front door house is
probably one of the most unique concepts
I'm not too sure about the I all of the
when you call this the the strokes
inside of it you just simply because
once you scale it down we're going to
run into issues there of complexity I
think a little bit yeah this one's a
thousand times better than this one no
just because it's illustrated well and
the concepts really unique and it's all
tied in together I think if we worked on
the colors a little bit and possibly the
strokes it would be a really solid
concept so thanks for that submission
all right another one okay I house the
doorknob are the pupil in the eye the
neighborhood watch this is the one for
sure nough okay um so the I house okay I
could see and I and that does seem
pretty unique that's a cool concept I
think I maybe this is just a slight
critique of it to try to emphasize the I
just a tad bit more somehow maybe on the
left and right
to try to define that entire eye shape
possibly but yeah that's definitely a
cool concept so thanks for submitting
that all right so the biggest issue here
is color I would say we have a lot of
you know we have the kind of like this
this very dull lime green here and then
we have this screen I and then we have a
lot of details here this is it this
shield itself along with the door is
like flat design you know this is what
we considered flat and minimal design
and then we have out here this is radial
gradient and mixing those two along with
the color combinations kind of makes
everything a little bit complex and it
throws off I what's called formally as
the visual hierarchy you're not really
sure what's supposed to be the main
element of focus here so I would look on
simplifying that aspect of it all right
but thanks for that and Katie sign all
right so too much was really worked at
trying trying to be worked into here we
got the shield we got the two
flashlights we got the house a very
detailed house at that too much
happening in terms of complexity and i
would say gradients and color as well
because we have all these different
colors we got the blue we got the orange
we got the yellow we got the the dark
gray we got the different reds and pinks
so what you overthought this one and you
really want to keep things simplified in
terms of the concept you know look at
looking at this result up here yeah you
could say well hey that's complex and
you know you're not talking crap about
his I'm not heart talking to crap about
anyone's but I he executed the concept
well it's very simple concept I but over
here we're trying to symbolize a bunch
of different items and it just doesn't
work out as well unfortunately and
especially if you're a scale it down
would be hard to really understand and
see all these details so I would work on
simplifying those all right another one
with a slightly different approach so I
probably would not do that because it
makes you look like a terrorist or
something like you don't like houses
let's destroy him or something so I'm
not really sure what the the you know
the no symbol is in relation to
the houses I'm not exactly sure so I
think there's an issue of execution or
concept execution in that realm but
thanks for that so kpaz alright so this
is once again one of those issues where
you need trying to repeat symbolism and
you try to ideally you just try to stay
away from that try to come up with a
unique symbol it can stand on its own
without replicating it unnecessarily and
plus I don't really see any element of
security embedded in with this so those
are the two issues I would say with that
design other than that I like the colors
and such although i think this right
here clashes a little bit kind of makes
it hard to see but in terms of
simplicity definitely there alright so
hacks bite we got two more we have some
I edge aliasing going on here
unfortunately which really makes it just
really throws off the entire to design
at least for me just because it looks
all jagged on the end and then we have
some issues here in terms of the
symbolism inside so we're repeating
symbolism again you know stay away from
that try to remember that and making
them invert when they connect with each
other that adds an extra level of
complexity that's unnecessary and makes
it hard to follow and see exactly what's
going on if you just put one single
house here in the center would have been
a thousand times better alright so
thanks for that submission and then over
here once again we're repeating
symbolism don't want to do that and
everything's just kind of separated you
know it doesn't really make it a unique
symbol it just kind of becomes a collage
of objects which you want to stay away
from all right so thanks for all those
entries that well it was a 36 minutes
there I yeah the winner go ahead and
yeah I'm going to try to contact you and
try to remember that if I don't contact
me on the YouTube page or here by going
to the contact at the bottom and yeah so
everyone thanks for the submissions I if
you check out the video courses or
released a I OS and Android app icon
design course it's only ten dollars you
go here you really see my take on
designing icons not just for iOS by
Android as well so check that out
subscribe here on youtube check out the
other courses are going to be more
coming down the line and please consider
the one-on-one training alright I'll
talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
