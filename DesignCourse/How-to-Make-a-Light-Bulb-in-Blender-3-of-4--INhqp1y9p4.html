calm today is part three of our light
bulb tutorial and we're going to focus a
lot on actually replicating the light
bulb and setting up the scene and also
do a little work with compositing all
right so it's always check out design
course calm if you haven't yet and also
subscribe here on YouTube alright let's
get started ok so let's go here to solid
and let's drop this down here to our
plane just above it and then hit our
we're going to make it look like it's
just kind of laying on the ground so
let's get up here and try to adjust this
so that the both this point and this
point are sitting on here so our and
move it down that is almost good are
again that looks pretty good yeah to me
yeah not early
around there is good and so let's set up
our camera view so if you hit zero on
your number pad and then hit that letter
n as a nose lock camera to view and
again and this is where we kind of want
to set everything up for our view I'm
going to take this make sure this is
selected the light ball hit scale it
down a little bit all right and also
here's where we're going to going to
duplicate these things or replicate them
I shifty and then hit Z no sorry X hit
our and then hit Z and that will keep it
on the ground and we'll move it into
place we're going to have several oops
no not that one I'm sorry I we're going
to have several of these right next to
each other kind of and you can put you
know put them however you want it's not
that big of a deal I'm going to hit zero
just to get out of there that camera
view alright and you want to make sure
things aren't like going into each other
all right shift D I will do X and pull
it out here on the y r z all right we'll
move these clothes together like that
let's go back in a camera view see what
this looks like so far all right we'll
take this again or duplicate this and by
the way you want to save your project
periodically all right shifty and x RZ
get out a camera view make sure things
aren't touching back in I will duplicate
another one shift D and why this is the
oops I hit Z by accident i G and then Z
no sorry x RZ put one like right there
and I think we'll do maybe one more so
shift d x RZ see here to get out make
sure nothing is so if you have a slow
computer this render it will take quite
a while because we have a lot of stuff
going on here so it's at zero hit 5 or
poop sorry you have a perspective okay
by default all right and I'm going to
make one more so shifty and why RZ and
we'll move it over here 0 make sure it's
not touching anything and it is so 0
alright that's good alright so let me
zoom out just a little bit I want
basically an area for type that will go
over here alright so now if we I just
switch to rendered mode we can get an
idea this is going to take a little bit
of time I I'm just going to hit 0
actually
and 54 perspective
all right pretty cool-looking so I'm
going to experiment with changing the
background here so if we click over here
to the world tab key chain we have a
background color here we can take that
completely black and also take and hit
right click for this plane surface and
if you're familiar with Photoshop at all
you know this is kind of like your
layers are area so the plane is selected
so we come over here it doesn't even
have a material so hit new and we'll
leave it at to fuse and what we can do
here is change by clicking this little
picker thing over there change it to a
gradient texture and that kind of
changes you know the appearance of this
and so what you can do is bring this out
over here take the node editor I should
have done it the other way so I have
more space but no big deal we can shift
a and put color mix RGB connect that
right there and then we can specify you
know well first time I changes to
quadratic sphere kind of like that how
that looked I didn't expect it to do
that though let me see here also you can
join these instead of right-clicking
just by taking this and pull it over you
know I wasn't really planning on having
it to be this dark and I think it still
is too dark but um let me yeah I had to
pause that just think you know if this
is really why what I wanted to do and so
I'm going to leave it at that and what I
want to do though is try to make
one of them appears though they're lit
up which is going to play into the whole
type that we put over here okay my kids
being loud all right this anyhow let's
go back here I think the one I want to
be lit I you know I think it's going to
be this one and so actually let me zero
see what this is yeah that's good I so
I'm going to go back here to solid so it
would be this one that I want lit up so
I'm going to add inside of it I should
have done this before i started moving
these around but that's okay i want to
add inside of it a an emission plane in
the form of like a cylinder that kind of
goes the length of those you know
there's two-armed things so I let's see
here first I'm going to go to wireframe
just so I can get an idea where those
things are so it's kind of positioned
like that ok so I'm going to left-click
to put the origin there I'm going to hit
seven top three on the side it's
basically where it will get added so I'm
going to hit shift a mesh cylinder scale
it down a ton and all right just a look
at where this thing's at I mean to do
that actually just take it on hit five
so we're going ortho mode here hit are
slightly on that axis scale is down a
little bit more all right s
and that's fine yeah if you hit s and
then shift Y Z or X that means it will
only scale down on those two I accesses
so I'm not sure which want to be shift y
no shift X shift see there we go of
course it's the last one I tried alright
so you can see if we kind of rotate
around this isn't completely I'll be
honest screw that up mmm yes and why
there we go yeah i just made life a real
difficult on myself by doing it this way
that's no big deal now I mean you're not
going to be able to tell because it's
such a tiny detail I I'm just hitting
are here
and that's pretty good I think alright
so now it's inside of it and let's give
it I an omission let's see here color we
could change it like right around their
strength I'm gonna try 20 I have no clue
what this is going to look like alright
so don't hate me alright let's see let's
go to let's just get it rendered here
I'm going to hit 5 get that out of the
way and I'm just kind of panning around
basically i really like it to kind of
create a fuller brighter emission which
i know i could do with photoshop but i
mean if you can achieve it in here you
definitely let's just try to really
increase that and see what happens so i
tried 60 let's try something saying like
300
I'm going to pause this i'm going to do
research to see how can really make
these things like it create like a more
of a glow okay basically an hour has
passed since I on pause let's try to
figure out the best way to add the glow
and it turns out i doing it in the
compositor seems to be the best way at
least that's what I found and Andrew
price of blender goober calm was the
solution so I basically followed
step-by-step how to use the compositor
and in order to create you know an
effect that looked good here so that I
that video is right here actually I see
ya that's just a quick shout out he's
taught me a lot of stuff I am still a
newbie alright so here's how we do it
basically we want to find that I I think
its cylinder for me its cylinder 007 I
should probably name these but anyhow
its side that is our little glowy
mission thing we know it is here because
of the material property so basically
what we need to do is move that to its
own layer so the way you do that is hit
em on your keyboard and this little
thing pops up and then you just click on
the second one right there very simple
alright so then we come over here and
this is the scene tab I guess you could
call it and you have all these things
out here so by default you have this
render layer everything is I like
selected right here I is only going to
take it's going to basically render
every single layer so we only wanted to
render this first one so that means it
will render everything except for that
emission thing so we want to add another
one and we'll call this scene no
actually will call it glow glower
whatever and then we I'm pretty certain
yeah we we take this and just select the
second layer yes right there I and I
think that would be good to go alright
so once you've done that
I and it looks in acts like that so what
we want to do is render it now based on
you know the final render settings and
so I'm going to come down here real
quick for performance change these tiles
to 256 x 256 and then also the samples
where we at for render i'm going to
choose 1500 alright and so i'm going to
click render all right let me go and can
review just to see what we have going ok
I mean just this lightly all right and
then I'm just going to hit render and
this is going to take a while so I'm
going to pause ok so here is the result
and as you can see it looks pretty nice
I but again we want this part to be you
know will to glow a little bit more so
here's how we do that basically now that
we have it rendered you want to switch
here to compose compositing view all
right and we click use nodes we will see
these two things come up alright so this
is going to get massive basically kind
of just going this using the same steps
that Andrew price basically used I in
that video that I showed you so
basically we want to cut this connection
and yours I should have this down here
render layer and glower so if you switch
the glower you see this tiny little
thing right there so let me go back here
leave that render layer and so will take
this hit shift D move it down right here
or wherever you want rather and we will
choose glower for that so it's basically
on its own layer and what we want to do
is add a couple of different things I
guess nodes I guess you could call them
to this too so that we can make it glow
specifically alright so if we
ship a and we go to filter blur and put
like right around here connect this to
their rather being slow I'm sorry it's
right here lista they're all right so we
want to change this to let see the x and
the y which is basically the size of the
glow too yeah he had 150 and it worked
well for my scene as well so 150 x 150
so now you can see right there you kind
of have this preview of like this outer
glow area and if you want to view it
like in this area up here I it's just a
output and you put in viewer and my kid
is being really loud outside and connect
that up and now we could see you know
basically what this glow will look like
alright so I we could also make a more I
more intense inner glow by adding
another blur so shift a filter blur and
basically we need to get this thing
connected from here down back over here
alright so you can add as many of these
things as you want basically I and you
could change us too fast gosh and if you
want and we can make the size of this
one 15 by 15 alright so you can see it's
more of an intense eye view right there
and you can I you can also add let's see
here
just down here let me take this viewer
off just delete it you can also add so
over here color RGB curves connect it to
the image portion right there and this
will adjust the intensity of the
invention see here if I add a viewer to
this output viewer and then put back
drop so you can see how intense you know
you can basically adjust the intensity I
think I'll leave it there for now
alright and this you know what I think
that's a little bit too bright I'm gonna
go down to 10 not bright but I want it
to be smaller rather so if we added a
viewer here let's cut that connection
and add this over here we could see that
that is a little bit more right there I
may even make it smaller five
alright alright so then I see here what
else do I want to do we can add i can
add another thing that we can uh note
that we can connect this a call it a
glare shift a filter glare temporary i'm
going to move it up here so i can see
take this and connect it over here and
if we put a viewer on it so we'll just
cut this connection behind control put
this back over here we can see what a
glare does and by this is basically you
word for word video of what enterprise
so is doing by adding 2 square but
basically you can adjust these quick to
really change it up quite a bit um so
let me see here iterations i think five
and five is the max you have an angle
offset which i don't think is really
doing anything fade is something that I
for our purposes probably drop down
pretty low right around there alright
alright so basically we have all those
hooked up and now what we want to do
alright so now to bring everything
together you go to shift a color and mix
and we will take Nova remember we have
three different things going on here so
we'll take this and plug it in to this
top image portion and take our blur and
do the same thing
alright and we'll go ahead because I we
only have yeah first of all you want to
change this mix here to screen on
disperse one so yeah if I could find it
am i doing right there all right and the
reason you do screen as you can see it
kind of updated it there I basically if
you're familiar with Photoshop at all
you know you have layer blend modes and
it's the same thing for this so this
will just kind of add on this entire
image and make it you know this
background black portion just like
transparent basically but you can
experiment and we probably will anyhow
so we take this and we want to duplicate
and create another mix just to get a
third one I basically connected because
we have three of these things so I could
take this shift D and we take this in
the top portion and then get our other
one that is way down here and let's get
rid of that viewer and plug it into this
bottom one alright and this can be
screen as well although I may have to
adjust that based on you know what it
looks like alright so now that we have
that now we need to get everything I
kind of just get these two basically
connected and so this is the basically
the last node so I we have to add
another mix so we can just go hit shift
D here put this here connect the top 12
this portion and then also take this one
and connect it there and now you can see
just barely that's glowing and then
finally I if we want to add a viewer
here and put viewer or output B or
rather
put that in there and then hit back drop
all right and I can't really
yeah just to make this bigger I think
its control up yeah up arrow key that
way we get actually see everything I so
that's kind of an issue that's created
right here I i found that just
experimenting with these to see how that
changes anything I think it was dodge
possibly there all right and then
basically what we do is also take this
and just put it into the composite right
there all right so if you want to save
this I what you do is hit control and
then the up arrow key again and we'll
change this to viewer node then hit f3
and that's where you would save it as
your PNG and hit save image alright so
I've gone ahead done that and you know I
actually came up with a different idea
for this poster i basically i'm not
going to show this it's going to be very
simple I you would priority know how to
do it if you did everything else I'm
just going to take this center portion
and change it to like a circle a and
you'll see when we get to the portion of
Photoshop or whatever what type comes
through it would just fit the idea of
this image a lot better all right so i
am going to go ahead and basically oh
yeah i'm gonna conclude here for today i
wanted to get it done today but the kids
are going crazy and it's going to be a
little bit more time already at 25
minutes so basically I yeah we're going
to conclude tomorrow I and really come
up with a cool image and I think it's
going to be something that it's going to
be shared on Facebook quite a bit i'm an
admin of a few pages that would probably
find entertainment out of this image
alright so i will see you tomorrow all
right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
