Gary Simon of design course mom today
I'm gonna be doing another random letter
love design practice technique video and
the basic I haven't done one of these in
a while but I decided you know what I
have some time I'll go ahead and do
another one of these and the idea is I'm
gonna click on generate another random
letter right here and I'm gonna think of
the very first noun that begins with
that letter that comes to my mind and
then the task is to design in Adobe
Illustrator something that symbolizes
the shape of the letter but also the
idea of the noun and some unique manner
so I'm gonna go ahead and get started
D I can't say dick come on I'm such a
nasty mf'er dog alright so dog that's
that's the most likely that's probably
almost everybody else said but I'm a
pervert so let's go ahead and work with
that some house a dog all right
file new here I put at 8:50 all right 60
by I think 500 works well for this 1280
resolution I'm working on for recording
and these videos alright so I'm gonna
get D and a lowercase D so I got a
capital D and a lowercase D and the goal
is to come up with something unique
ineffective and designed well that
symbolizes some aspect of a dog okay so
I'm just gonna filter through some are
some fonts here and the way you do is to
just left-click up here and the
character panel and then you use your
keyboard down arrow key just something
that might spark some ideas so this is
something I'm completely doing this
randomly I didn't think of this before
hand so I'm just kind of challenging
myself to see what I can come up with
it's a good practice technique for
coming up with concepts quickly alright
so you know the first thing I need to
consider is you know do I want to work
with the lowercase version or the
uppercase version alright so when I
think of a dog I don't know why I just
think of this font right here I just
silly and although I guess it depends on
the type of dog we're talking about but
I sometimes you can help just to get up
a reference images so if I could have
images I mean I know what a dog looks
like it looks like but sometimes it just
helps to see dogs alright so these are
all front-facing this is a good
representation so obviously the tail
would probably be the easiest thing to
work with because you don't want I don't
want to necessarily get into try to
trying to depict specific features of a
dog I mean you have the ears okay I
don't want to try to get a silhouette
because I would just be lame I'm so
thinking of this I'm gonna work with the
lower case D I believe alright get this
thing nice and big alright so I'm gonna
try something we'll see how this works
out just with the pen tool and I may
have to tinker with it quite a bit in
order for it to work so when you drag
these Bezier handles here you can just
hold alt and left click
alright and escape and take this get rid
of the fill give it a stroke alright and
increase the size substantially can
already tell it's not very smooth it's
something that would need to be worked
with let's see here we'll go ahead and
change to this variable width profile
where it gets smaller one thing that
might help of course I can use the add
Anchor Point tool real quick
perhaps right around here to add an
anchor point and then take this the
direct selection tool and delete that
one all right and we'll go back here
make ctrl H to get rid of the outline
there
yeah it's gonna be like twenty-eight
point five or so based on the current
size of the font to get these matching
up just initially here alright so let's
go ahead I'm not sure if I am I'm too
satisfied with that but we'll see it for
a second um I want to smooth out this
tail make it a little bit more because
flow a little bit better so you just
take the direct selection tool modify
that just a little bit I'm gonna go
ahead and add in with the pen tool in
area just to right around here maybe
coming up about this much and down
okay and then maybe try to add some
sense of motion because we need to give
a dog's tail you think of it wagging all
over the place so I thought about I'd do
that so I'm just creating a single very
slight Bezier curve here and we're gonna
make the stroke here black variable with
profile one so it goes thin to thick to
thin maybe move it in just a little bit
closer I copy that control C control F
and scale this one down will be right
around there so now it feels like a dog
tail much more just by adding these two
lines just to symbolize motion and in a
sense so I'm going to move this one over
here and I'm also I'm going to
experiment with another idea real
quickly I'll go ahead and take the pen
tool real quick
just block out this area all right
go ahead and I'll make it simple I know
like the I'm thinking of adding like a
paw print here that might be too much
though but I just want to do it anyways
just to see my mouse is about to die
that's nice alright so we'll go ahead
and add some ovals for paw prints you
know what I want to make sure I get this
right dog paw print yeah they're really
not a whole but like I was thinking I
want to make that a little bit better
make it black for now and alright so
what could I do I just take this middle
bottom anchor point well there we go
that was pretty simple alright so take
that back move this rotated rather
get a reference image there's four four
right here that is my cell phone all
right ah yeah not very much quality
control happening over here right now
my wife just texted me all right nice
move this over here
these ones are usually larger who over
there I'll just take this one I'm pretty
certain that's gonna be way too much I
mean when you add all these shapes and
then you create kind of issues of
clutter because we have this year we
have this area this long tail this is
too much
I still wanted to see what it looked
like now let's go ahead and just remove
these things well it just has become too
bad at that point it's certainly not as
bad as I what it was with the tail added
I'm not sure what happened there to
scale that up again actually just like
that that would be more ideal though not
quite as unique so yeah I'll take this
one and just scrap it remove this one
back now let's say for example see in my
opinion I I like this pretty much as is
I wouldn't want to go further with this
otherwise you're just gonna get too
complex so you remember you know when
you guys are submitting for example to
design challenges that we have a design
course comm don't try to go too
elaborate you know like I did over here
because we ended up just being too much
so yet you take you know when it comes
to come up with low design concepts you
take a single idea some element or some
aspect that relates to the purpose of
the business or whatever it is you're
trying to do and you integrate it into
the the letter form or the icon or
whatever you're working with and stick
with that don't try to add too many
things so let's say for example just for
the heck of it it's only been ten
minutes um you wanted to use this maybe
you wanted to
get it printed or something well you
can't leave your text layer here you
need to make sure everything's flattened
in the paths I well the past don't have
to be converted to outlines but I kind
of like doing it sometimes just because
if another designer messes with it and
they scale it the past could become
screwed up so what I do is take
everything hit ctrl shift and oh so that
converted the this right here to a an
outline with a path rather and then we
want to basically take everything and
combine them so I'm gonna take these
strokes right here go to object path and
outline stroke and then I want to take
everything with exception to this little
the white portion where the tail is
cutting into the letter and go ahead to
the window and Pathfinder and merge them
all and I got Facebook up man this is
just terrible I should have checked that
stuff before I started and then finally
take this this little white path here
and hold shift and select this one and
then just specify minus front oops
I'm going to ungroup that first just
like this minus front then you can take
everything and combine them to a single
shape like that and that is it and the
reason you would want to do this is
because you don't want a white path sit
in there that way if you have a
background or something that's gonna
look messed up but yeah that is it you
know just thinking of things off the top
of my head you know it's not too bad of
an of an attempt and it's a little bit
separated a little bit ideally it would
be a little bit more condensed but uh
yeah that's my attempt so hopefully you
guys took something from this if you
want to see more of these videos let me
know they obviously don't take very long
but yeah so check out design course com

yet and I'll see you later good bye
