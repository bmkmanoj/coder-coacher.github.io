course calm Gary Simonet and Envato
networks toots plus calm course
instructor so in this tutorial we're
going to take a look at designing a logo
in the recently launched Adobe Photoshop
CC now first thing I want to say if you
have access to adobe illustrator that's
the program you would really want to
design your logo in a photoshop if you
only have access to photoshop then
you're pretty much stuck with using it
but it's still I acceptable to use
Photoshop if you do a few things
correctly so just before this tutorial
the previously uploaded video it shows
how to design the logo that I'm about to
show you I in Illustrator so if you have
illustrator just close this and watch
that one now if you don't have a
illustrator in you have Photoshop you
can continue to watch this and I will
show you how to design a logo so the
first thing I'm going to do is go to
file new we're going to call this logo
project and I'm setting this at points
and I'm personally going to use 750 by
500 the resolution will keep at 72 and
we want CMYK color here alright let's go
ahead and hit OK and let me drag this
over open up in a new window and first
thing I do is just use the paint bucket
tool and make the background white okay
so for this tutorial we're going to
design a logo for a fictional company I
came up with a TV series that we'll just
call in blood so the first thing we want
to do is take the type tool and we'll
make black or foreground color and type
in in now ordinarily if you're designing
logo one of the first steps will be just
to brainstorm ideas that may be relevant
to the actual company for the logo I so
I already did that and so what I thought
would be cool the name is in blue
we can actually make the in kind of
circled and inside like blood splatter
source powder so that's what we're going
to do so I'm just going to hit ctrl T
real quick and hold shift and alt and
scale it up a bit and now what we want
to do is get the ellipse tool out here
right here and we'll just choose a red
color hit OK and a hold shift while
dragging out a circle so if we put this
behind the end and we make the in white
now we can see the basic shape now
instead of just making it a perfect
circle we can go ahead and use the pen
tool to kind of make it like an envelope
seal like one of those old seals and
that way it kind of just looks like a
little bit like a blotch of blood so I'm
going to take the magnifying glass and
zoom up and take the pen tool and make
sure shape is specified and not path and
if you've never used the pen tool don't
worry it just takes a little bit of
practice getting used to but I just
clicked up here randomly and you can
just kind of follow my guide but you
don't have to be perfect obviously so
I'm going to left click and drag and do
it a couple more times
okay and so now we can drag this
underneath and we could delete our first
circle and let's go ahead and hit ctrl
one to zoom back out so if we take our
move tool choose auto select layer we
can go ahead and just select the n type
hold shift thing we can select both of
those and just move them over so now
what we want to do is take our in type
and we're going to duplicate that right
click duplicate layer and hit OK and
we'll move it over here take the type
tool and we will make it this same color
right here and we'll just type blood
okay so that looks pretty good for now
now we want now if I were to hide this
we can see that the the actual in is not
transparent so I want this to be a
single transparent area for the type so
that any background we have will be able
to see the background through the actual
letters so what we have to do in order
to achieve that first is take in amber I
go to type and convert to shape so what
that does we can no longer edit the N I
and it allows us to select it and we can
even play around with the points but we
don't want to do that what we'll do is
just take this a direct selection tool
and it automatically takes all these
points and selects them and so we can
hit control C now what we want to do
just hide that and let's select our
shape one path right here that we
created and then hit control V so now it
is a part of this shape one except we
can't see behind it so what we can do is
specify subtract from shape and we can
see now that we can see behind it all
right so that was pretty simple let's
bring back the background now this logo
right here
I will know if it's effective if we can
scale it down and still see the logo and
read the type and all that so in order
to do that let's go ahead and just
select both of these layers also for
blood we want to go ahead and convert
that to a shape as well so what with it
selected we'll just go to convert to
shape and we could also even combine
these in to the same layer so we can
control eat with both of them selected
all right so now we can hit ctrl T and
hold shift we can scale it down real
small and we can see even at a very
small size we can see exactly what's
going on so that's one of the most
important things about logo design is
readability even at small sizes so
ordinarily when you have the logo design
you want to reproduce the logo in
various formats so one thing is it
absolutely has to work in black and
white so what we would do is take a
black color hit OK and we would hide
this background just make sure it is a
transparent background and the logo will
work transparently on any background and
we would go to file save as and we save
it as obviously a PSD and then we can
also export it in various formats so or
save for web as well like a PNG or gif
or jpg etc and we need to know each of
those file names as I like in blood -
black so we would also want to create a
version that uses the same color of red
so all we have to do is right click and
duplicate that now what it's called this
first one blood black and this one will
be blood - red and let's hide that first
one and this would be our red variation
so let's bring back both of these and
let's scale them down both the same size
oops
yeah control T oops sorry about that
it's we have to select both of these
there we go if we take the direct
selection tool and select all of them we
can hit ctrl T all right and then we'll
take the the red one position it right
around here and we'll drag them down and
so these would be two variations that
the logo could be used in so in
instances where there's only black and
white allowed we would die and we would
inform them to use this logo in ones
where there's only limited colors to use
we would use this and then finally we
can create a third variation which is
one that can be used on the web or any
other medium which I color variants is
not an issue and a lot of popular
companies and brands they do this and
like for instance Ford has a very
colorful logo with gradients and shadows
and chrome and all that that they use on
their website and in TV and in other
areas as well so we can do that as well
so let's just go ahead and one second
and hit duplicate layer on the red
version and we'll bring this up here all
right so let's scale this up a lot and
we can do some things to give this some
more life so we can make the in eye
blood spatter area right here I kind of
just pop out a little bit by adding some
highlights and shadows so the way we can
do that is take the magnifying glass and
we'll zoom up a bit and we'll take the
pen tool and ctrl H to get rid of the
points there and for our color for the
shadows is just going to be a slightly
darker red so if we go up here and we
want to follow the contour basically of
the shape and
just kind of continue on until it
matches up and let's make that darker
and then hit ctrl H all right so we have
that now we can add a highlight so we're
going to assume that the light source is
kind of coming up here diagonally to the
left so let's go ahead and create a new
path here with the pen tool and do the
same exact thing
and then close it up so now we'll make
this a lighter kind of like a pinkish
all right so if we hit control one we
can now see that it kind of just sticks
out a little bit more um and we can even
go ahead and do that with the type and
we can add highlights and shadows to
that as well so let's go ahead and do
that real quick and I'll just go ahead
and create a shadow right here
and we want this to be the same color as
the shadow down here
hold alt and to get rid of the direction
and we'll create another one right here
just in between these and then let's
create some highlights so we'll go up
here
actually one second you may have to play
around with it just a little bit
and we'll make this that highlight color
up here and again if you want to adjust
these points after you create them
that's very simple all you have to do is
just I like this here oops
we want to bring this down and take that
out just a little bit so that's how
we're able to edit these more
specifically and then we can go ahead
and add another highlight just up here
on the top of the eye and again make it
this color and also we can make one more
right around here on top of the eye or
the end rather and again if you're new
to the pen tool and this is a little bit
tough to follow just give it some
practice and you will eventually be able
to pull it off alright so I that was
just a real quick we could probably
spend more time adjusting these shadows
to make them a little bit better but I
so that works pretty well there we could
even take the red here let's see yeah
that's it
I and what we could do is right click
and duplicate this real quick I'm going
to hide this by the layer beneath it and
with the a direct selection tool we can
just take the type oops hit ctrl H to
view that and delete it and then I bring
this one back and we can double click on
this to the right just to bring up the
layer styles and hit gradient overlay we
can choose radial and then we can adjust
the gradient and the gradient editor
right here
and we'll take this one double-click
that way there's just kind of like a
soft gradient underneath it I and this
is a very this is the pervert we would
call it the preferred logo variation
that we could that could be used and
then of course the secondary variations
down here would be used in other
instances where gradients and a lot
colors aren't possible so we use this in
TV advertisements or on the website etc
etc and I one thing that we could do
just to present it a little bit better
and just to give it obviously you would
definitely want to present it with the
white background but you can also invert
it with the black background to show how
it would work and then we can even do
something like for example we can go to
deviantART calm and click on resources
and stock images and we could type for
blood background or something similar
let's see here
error with my request do you say ok here
it is and we can now browse around and
see if we want to use one of these so if
we click on this one the author
enchanted Gallaudet stock I they always
kind of allow I put specifications in
terms of how you can use the artwork so
there's no need to note me just leave me
a comment here on the stock you used on
the page and blink or whatever so if you
want to use this then you can just
follow their guidelines a lot of times
they'll say it 100 percent free and you
don't have to do anything you just use
it and if you wanted to you could you
just click download image and this
massive image will come up and I'll just
right-click and copy it copy image and
then go back to photoshop and just click
on layer 1 and we can control V to paste
it and hit ctrl T to scale it down a lot
I'm just holding shift and alt to do
that quickly
and now we have a cool blood-spatter
background we could you've been to work
with a little bit more just to make it
like a white one and adjust the opacity
just a little bit and essentially that
is it uh so that's one way that you can
design a logo in Photoshop and what's
cool is because all of this all these
layers they're all shape layers they're
paths they're not R a stirred so if you
have if we took one of any of these
shapes and we're a stirred it and then
we try to enlarge it really like say for
like like a 300 dpi pixel size for a
print or something it would become
distorted but these are all shapes so in
Photoshop we can still use them and
export them to any size imaginable and
they will still remain crisp so I hope
you learned a lot in this tutorial and
if you have any questions go ahead and
post in the comments section and I will
try to answer all right I'm Kerry Simon
and I'll see you next time thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
