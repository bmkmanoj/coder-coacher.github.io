refresh this and we see that the line
animates as SVG paths from illustrator
we can click on it and also make CSS
properties appear and animate and it is
also responsive hello give it Simon here
design course comm today we're going to
play around with what's called SVG line
animation and so SVG files of course are
scalable vector graphics and they are
superior in many ways to PNG s or JPEGs
and so basically what we're going to be
doing is taking the DC design course
letter mark logo and you can download
that for free at design course column
just requires very quick in free
registration and then take that into
Adobe Illustrator and modify it so that
it has no fill but just a stroke and
then we'll open up a code editor and
then work with CSS within the SVG in
order to make it animate that line the
stroke that goes around it alright so
check out design course comp if you
haven't yet and subscribed here on
YouTube
alright get started alright so here in
Adobe Illustrator let's go ahead to open
up the project files that you need to
download and by the way to download
those just check out a design course
comm for this video and click download
you'll have to register real quick it's
free and then download the project file
and this is the project file which I
just magically opened without going to
file open are now just getting a pause
and open it up that way you want to see
on my porn folders now I'm just kidding
so I this is the DC i-- logo letter mark
and the eye the idea here is again we're
going to do a line animation so by
default this filled and there's no
stroke so this is the fill this is a
stroke it's empty so what we need to do
is kind of just reverse that so over
here make sure your color panels up and
if you need any panels that aren't here
that I use just go to window and then
open them up in here alright so let's go
ahead with the fill
selected and just click on this one with
the red act slash and that makes it none
so now there's nothing now we'll switch
over here to the stroke and we will make
this one temporarily black alright so
now let's go ahead and and by the way if
you want to get rid of these these
little vertices you just hit ctrl H or
command H on Mac so now it's selected we
can increase this and this looks like
crap right there so what we need to do
is go to stroke and we can align the
stroke either rate by default it sits in
the middle of the line or the path we
can change it inside or outside in which
case it looks a hell of a lot better
alright so I'm going to see something
real quick this looks strange it's like
an issue right there hit ctrl H to bring
this back ah what I could do is try to
experiment real quick with the settings
here and stroke and let's see if well
first let's try to mess with the stroke
wait well that makes it pretty much
invisible or we can't really see it at 6
points we can see you can see even more
right there I
let's try adjusting this okay so taking
that down to zero let's try like 40 all
right well let's try 5 oh sorry about
that oh man there's not quality control
with these daily video tutorials I tell
you yeah changing it to 2 doesn't really
help 0 does help you know what we're
going to do we're going to leave it at
10 and we're going to simply go down and
sighs that way we can't see it maybe
it's an issue that won't even pop up
when it comes to actual yet the SVG so I
yeah this is it it's transparent here in
the middle so whatever's behind it will
be
able to see it in the center of this and
I yeah so what we want to do now is go
ahead and save this as an SVG file so go
to head to file and save as and save it
in a project folder an empty folder and
come down here change out to SVG let's
leave it as DC logo as the name hit save
and then we'll come out here
SVG options 1.1 I linked yes
mount the by default I think I
illustrator will set this to
presentation attributes and if you do
that and you hit SVG code right here
that brings that up in a new document
let me scale this window down so you can
see it alright so we can see that it has
this elaborate path that's the actual
eye
I think the S feed the line for the DC
logo and we'll see that it has this path
and D equals and there's no like classes
or anything so what we can do is change
that in we could do that by specifying
style style elements so now if we click
on SVG code dang the stupid thing load
it up in another big window I come down
here now we have classes on these
although I don't see a class on this one
but that's no big deal we'll figure it
out so I yeah now what I want to do is
go ahead and hit OK all right
oh and I just realized what those were
are these like these other layers for
some reason I had hidden so let me bring
this back real quick delete those now
we're going to go to file save as
overwrite it now if we go to SVG code
it's just going to be that big long path
so cool alright now we'll save it ok so
now that we have that done and I'm going
to open up my code editor and I use
sublime text and you could use notepad
or whatever allows you to enter text
doesn't really matter
I and I have the project folder open
right now all there is is our I've empty
well almost empty there's a speed V that
SVG file but there's nothing else and so
sorry about that I had to pause people
were being loud downstairs and so I just
want to save this I go to recent places
your project and name this index.html
alright and then I'm going to paste in
some just real quick HTML structure just
like that very simple we have the HTML
opening tag the head tag we got some
other stuff in here in the title closing
head tag body that's where we're going
to work alright so I'm going to create a
quick div I'm going to do some inline
CSS as well just so it's centered up and
everything alright so I'm going to put
in for this div eye style equals and
this is how you do inline CSS instead of
like linking up a CSS file properly this
is just for demo so I'm going to do it
real quick i i'm going to do i thinkyeah
text - align center and when we embed
the SVG there's several different ways
to do it you can embed it via an image
tag or an object embed tag which is what
we're going to do and so we'll just get
this centered up there I think I'm also
going to do padding for the top and
bottom I'll try 150 pixels and 0 and I
yeah I think that's all for now close
that div tag up and I'm going to put in
our embed tag so we put first object
close that up come up inside embed
source equals DC logo SVG and then we
could put actually you know what I kind
of forgot so let me go back here to
illustrator and because okay let me zoom
out here holding alt in the scroll wheel
usually it's a good idea
to go to document setup click on edit
artboards and then you can scale this
down roughly to the size of the object
the SVG element so just do that real
quick and then we'll save it again there
now we'll save I want to save ass just
to make sure how's our settings set here
properly and yeah yeah yeah style
elements okay cool now we'll come down
and put over here I I'm going to see
what happens if we don't give it a width
and height I never did that before but
so we'll see all right and cool so let's
just see if this works
by default obviously it's not going to
animate yet but I'm going to preview
this in the browser so I'm going to open
up my index dot HTML looks like it
worked fortunately for now at least and
we could see it right here
just like that pretty simple all right
and so if we come back here and we click
on our SVG we can see all this craziness
inside here and there's a few things
that we don't need these first three
lines at the top that illustrator
generates we can just get rid of those
all right and what we can do at the end
of that tag this is all one I attribute
Esper SVG we can put in a tag called
depths as a definitions and that's where
you could put JavaScript and CSS in our
case we're just going to stick with Java
CSS rather and I'm going to put style
style and then inside here this is where
we have all of our stuff at so I you can
get this is called a group and basically
that means a layer so if we had multiple
layers they could be separated into
different groups all right so I this one
I'm going to give an ID of DC logo all
right
it and here's where we're going to get
started so we're going to reference the
DC logo open that up in tags and I'm
going to put stroke
oops no stroke - and then da SH - array
and I'm going to try like 800 just for
now and then stroke - offset zero and
because I'm using Chrome I know I need
to put WebKit animation - two seconds
linear Fords now if you want this to
work for all browsers what you would
have to do is copy this three more times
change this to o for opera I what the
heck's the other one Oh
Mose for Mozilla and then just animation
like that it's a pain but I yeah we're
doin I guess and then down here okay so
when it comes to this animation where it
says - that's the name of the animation
and then what we have to do now is set
up keyframes so at - WebKit - keyframes
- that's the name that we're referencing
this is where we could put keyframes at
and kind of control how you know
whatever it does that it's going to do
so from stroke - offset 800 and then
we'll come over here just copy that real
quick change from to zero and then save
now the any luck we go back and refresh
this now it's not going to be correct
it's going to look half-ass probably so
if i refresh and nothing happens of
course so let me go back real quick
alright and I had to pause to figure
that out why that wasn't working and it
was because I was I had this stroke
aligned inside and apparently that's no
good so what I have to do is switch back
here real quick and all I have to do is
take
this and we will wait one second we got
to go back and make sure we save our
stuff here so I'm going to copy this
because this is going to get overwritten
unfortunately so copy that and save it
and we'll go back here switch this to
the center where it's supposed to be
take the limit down to five that way it
doesn't look so much like crap over here
and then save it reload it there we go
now it added an actual stroke width and
all that stuff that we can mess with all
right so get rid of these three lines
and it gave it a class time of Sto which
is fine so now what we could do I'm
going to paste in our stuff again
deafs and take that change that all
right now let's see if this thing will
work all right go back and refresh oh
yeah sweet but it's not long enough so
we have to take that 800 and really
increase it to a different size now it
is possible with JavaScript I haven't
done you haven't messed with it yet to
determine Diwali automatically so I
haven't done it so I'm just going to do
it just by estimating that looked like
it was like halfway I'm going to have
troll try 1200 real quick and this may
take a couple times
all right needs to be a lot longer than
that
all right so I change that to 2000 and
that seems to work and two seconds is
like way too quick so you can see how
fast that is although you don't want to
sit there forever
watching this animate so maybe just an
adjustment to four seconds like that
pretty cool all right
so what if you wanted this to be
responsive like right now if we drag
this in it's going to be like this
massive thing that's just taking up
space so what we could do is come up
here the width and the height have exact
values we can just delete those just
like that
and this is going to be probably become
massive at this point yeah so what we
want to do is in our index.html we can
write put this in another div oops
actually you know what we could do I
think width equals 40% height equals 40
percent instead of square and I mean now
hold on it may not be perfect yeah that
appears to work still to refresh that
and I look how cool that is
sweet and so of course you know if you
go in here you can have fun adjusting a
lot of interesting things I let's say
for example you want something to happen
when you hover over it all right so I
all you have to do is we'll give this an
ID on the SVG attribute area so ID
equals
logo and then what we could do is put
logo hover sto and let's say we want to
change let's say we wanted to give it a
fill color just make it black fill
that's the color code for black of
course oh and that's because I said that
id was redefined and you know that's
already had an ID it's right there oops
yeah that'll make it break I guess I'll
just rename that to logo get rid of that
also I noticed I screwed this up over
here
this needs move down even though it was
still working somehow you can just put a
type of bulls taxi
yes all right now we'll try that again
refresh what the so ridiculous got to
delete this other style tag from the one
I deleted up there damn it
refresh and let's see what happens when
we hover over oh yeah that's nice look
at that that looks so nice doesn't it I
like it I so yeah you can even do more
and I guess I'll just show you more just
because I don't have anything else to do
I let's come over here and let's say we
want to give it a little bit of a
transition so the white to black Phil
isn't so dramatic I guess you could say
or instantaneous all you have to do is
put a transition point I will try eight
seconds and what will happen is this
still won't work I'll just show you I
it'll still be instantaneous because the
Phil is set to none by default so it's
not true it's not able to transition
from one color to another so if we just
change that to white we can try it now
let me make this bigger kind of look
stupid like that and then of course you
can add so much so many other I've
animations to this using CSS animations
so if you've never messing around with
CSS animations you can do a lot of cool
interesting things you can move this
thing around you could rotate it you can
you know whatever you think you can do
you probably do so I and also say you
wanted to make it a button or something
so what you do is I yeah we are logo
yeah we would do is take out logo
cursor:pointer and now if you hover over
it it's now like a link
and if you wanted to actually change
something based on it being clicked like
nothing happens obviously and apply a
specific CSS class to that well you can
add JavaScript I wasn't going to do this
I wasn't going to go into this much
depth but screw it over here might as
well so I script type equals text -
JavaScript and what we can do is VAR a
let's call clicker equals document query
selector and we want to select the logo
clicker add event listener click
function and close all that up and then
inside this class list toggle and we
want to toggle on a class this is it
going to be the class name and we'll
just call this click it whatever okay so
it's four lines of code what this does
is basically say if there's if somebody
clicks on anywhere on this logo portion
I add click it which is a CSS class
which will write now so what we'll do is
put over here is logo not PHP what the
hell
hands on the wrong place logo dot click
it dot st0
all right so now we could put in some
other things so I what could be make
happen um you could take the fill and
make it yellow
regular looks stupid I don't know let's
see here refresh it and over over it and
then click it DM you one second that
might be why I have like a dollar sign
instead of the number sign oh look at
that
let me like let it complete before I do
that cool you click it again and it'll
toggle off and then you could probably
even add some you get to add animation
to that as well so I want to click state
you can make animations play and all
that cool stuff so yeah hopefully you
guys learn something you know what this
is stupid this yellow thing that annoys
me for some reason I want to make it the
actual color of the logo oops let me
come out here so if I get out the
original AI file file does not exist it
must have deleted it there it is and get
that I RGB color code here copy that
come back fill will be that color and
then stroke will be that color as well
so there we go so it goes from all black
to blue there we go that's much better
you know transition between fun stuff
alright so hopefully you learned a lot
here and I you'll definitely see SVG
becoming more popular as time progresses
because it's truly vector you don't have
to deal with the pixelation from my PNG
s or JPEGs or anything like that and
sorry my audio or my recorder cut out
but yeah that is it so check out design
course comm if you haven't yet subscribe
