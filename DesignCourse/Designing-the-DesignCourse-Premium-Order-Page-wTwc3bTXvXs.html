today I decided to kill two birds with
one stone and knock out some work that I
needed to do in order to get design
course Premium ready to launch and
that's the design the order page and I
decided to also make this a part of the
daily design course comm video so you're
gonna see me as I'm actually trying to
figure out how to design how to layout
the design course premium order page I
haven't actually designed it yet so
you'll get to see actual design as it
happens you know most people who do
tutorials and myself included most of
the time I'll sit there before I record
the tutorial and figure it out and then
I'll record it and I'll know exactly
what to do and I just work all fast well
that's not really designed as exactly
actually happens so that would be a
benefit but one of the negatives and a
drawbacks is it can be a kind of lengthy
and a little bit boring and I'm just
changing things and everything but
that's how it happens naturally so
anyhow I check out design course comm if
you haven't yet subscribe here on
YouTube all right let's get started all
right so I first I want to switch over
here real quick to the browser and I
need to log in real quick and I'm gonna
go to a page here that shows the product
page and this isn't yet ready it's not
public or anything but this shows kind
of the setup for premium that I have
going here for each product so click on
here you know we have this ideal oblong
you can click on mentor I'm changing up
the background and the product box
design and all that and and I haven't
done this stuff down here yet but it's
going to give detailed information about
each product they you know depending on
whichever one you have clicked on and
then why is banner same thing and so as
you can see I still have some work to do
so the idea for this page is I you know
when you click join premium right now
there's nothing happening it'll have
that page yet that's the page I want to
design and so I haven't actually DS
beforehand like a lot of these tutorials
I'll you know I'll record or I'm not
record the project but I'll do the
actual project that way I know exactly
what I'm designing before I record the
tutorial and this time I'm not doing
that I'm just gonna wing it
that way you can kind of see the process
as it happens naturally for me at least
and you'll see that it's not so smooth
usually I sense an accident alright so
yeah I so that we want this we have to
keep in mind you know what pages they're
coming from based on I when they click
on join premium we have to really fall
and just make a nice transition when it
comes to the user experience and trying
to get people to join that's the whole
point so I'm in Photoshop and also by
the way you'll notice I'm recording at a
higher desktop resolution because I like
to be able to design and see everything
at a much larger so this is actually
1920 by 1080 but I'm scaling it down for
the video into 1280 by 720 so hopefully
the tools don't seem too small here I
but yeah so I just have this page that I
work with for the mentor page opened up
and is I'm gonna delete a few things and
alter them but this is going to be the
canvas that I work with for this initial
join premium page alright so I a couple
things that you have to ask yourself
when you view every whenever you go to a
new page you know you have to ask
yourself you know what are the
expectations of the page and what are
the goals of the page and how can we
best lay it out so people who click on
join premium they're probably going to
be curious about the price and you also
want though those who reach this page to
really click the next link which is
going to be a payment link or a payment
option I may even have the credit card
processing right on this page I'm not
sure yet this is the decision I have to
make within the video though alright so
one thing I want to do is I'm going to
get rid of the large product blocks I
don't need that but I do have the three
product box that
launching with there's gonna be a lot
more in the future and these are their
actual sizes and then those images are
on the server already so I do definitely
want to kind of just maybe combine these
a little bit but let's see here
so this is a tough part I don't know
what exactly I'm going to design yet I
know I'm probably going to get rid of
this background here so I'm gonna delete
that all right and let's see here I'm
gonna take this container control T and
just push it up here perhaps now it
would be redundant to have the you know
get in and get into access to all design
course products joint brainy and you
just go to the same page so we can get
rid of that so I'll get rid of those
layers right there alright and does it
really make sense to have these up here
as well trying to think maybe I can even
get rid of this entire bar it all really
depends it could just this may be
unnecessarily cut clutter the reason I
had these here is just so that you know
when you're on one of the premium
products you can click quickly to the
other ones but a person who's interested
in joining I don't know do they want
that quick access because right now if
you go to the site here you can access
those three products this way but let me
think here only come down here may keep
this call-to-action button I'm gonna
bring this back down just so I can see
what I have here in terms of content
that I need to get rid of so I alright
keep these same font sizes but I'm just
gonna make them black alright and then
also I'm gonna get rid of this button
here just deleting these and that thing
as well a little shopping cart icon now
I'll take this and push it back up just
temporarily alright so this is the page
again that people will go to decide
whether or not they want to join this
thing so let's think here
let me experiment with getting rid of
this I'm just gonna hide it for now and
where is this little thing rectangle for
okay what the hell of this thing go
I had a product box somewhere in it okay
it's not a part of that layer did I
really do that
no all right time to pause obviously let
me click on it oh there it is
release clipping mask there we go
ridiculous all right so I've hidden that
and these are also 24-bit transparent
PNG so I don't have to worry about
saving them again for a different
background okay this could be kind of a
cool idea maybe just feature the product
boxes here let's get up the columns here
and we're right in the center this would
be right here in an exact center all
right
hide those real quick
and these seem to be pretty I lined up
in the middle just a quick tip right now
this isn't the right type of text layer
what I could do is just left-click and
drag to the full width if we want this
to really look it perfectly centered in
our mock-up at least and let me just put
some filler text right there
copy that well that's great what size of
that it's nice to have perfect amounts
so I'm just gonna put 50 for this and
then Center it just like that
all right and then I we could take that
duplicate it I've set up a sort cut key
ctrl shift + D and come over here copy
that what size was that real quick 28
will say and 28 and center it okay so
now these are perfectly centered
due to having left clicked and dragged
the full-width
alright the hell did I just do step redo
there we go alright so now we can get
rid of these push these both up alright
so temporarily I'm gonna take this I
these two layers what is this this is in
a group okay I have a couple empty
shapes there let's call a CTA for call
to action button alright so let me go
ahead and take these three I'm gonna
remember not I want to merge them on a
group him though and I'll call these I
Fox's auto select group I was wondering
maybe what it would look like if I put
them beneath I think maybe leave that
right there and one one design turneth
Gary Simon I want to change that this is
very important so you know when it comes
to the headline of a page especially a
very important page where you have you
know a lot of I guess you could say user
friction in terms of you know okay this
is the page that they discover the price
I this is what makes or breaks usually
the the commitment of whether or not to
join a service so when it comes to the
headline it's the first thing they read
and it become so freaking important that
you get this right and the really the
best way to go about trying to get a
headline right is to split test it if
you don't know what split testing is
google it and you'll see it's a be split
testing basically it's the process of
you know using a split testing service
and you experiment with the headline and
see which one results in the most joins
essentially or the most fall through
click there's to the next page so really
what you can the only thing you could do
is just your best guess on the first try
and so I'm going to pause and think
about
that a little bit all right so I've
thought about this a little bit I
changed this to take your skills to the
next level I'm actually going to change
that I'm gonna put in design course
premium just state the product name and
then let me move this up real quick and
then over here yeah I kind of want that
to be a little bit longer we'll see um
let's see here we can make these larger
as well at least this right here I so
come in here just try 80 whenever that
happens just got to pull this down a
little bit maybe 70 all right now it
looks like way too big
damn it 60 would be better okay I so
design course premium I yeah we want
some white space here definitely take
your skills to the next level today
and
and I'm sure if I like that maybe but
Siri already I'd already did this sell
the selling of you know the benefits of
the course with these three paid
products so on those pages I'm doing
everything I can to really reinforce the
idea that you'll become a better
designer by just one but by joining
design course premium so maybe instead
of doing that here I can put in
something like one price it gets you
access that more it gives you gives you
or maybe something maybe a little bit
more catchy I'm gonna make it a little
bit bigger one price one price okay I'm
gonna go ahead and pause you don't want
to see here watch me do this alright so
I'm gonna change this access to every
product for one low price okay there we
go alright and I do want some a decent
amount of space between this if you go
up a little bit too high then it kind of
gets lost bring it in
down a little bit spread things out just
to experiment may I take these put them
down here temporarily
maybe that makes a little bit more sense
since I'm mentioning access to every
product for one low price show the
products alright and you know again
that's another thing that can be split
tested you know the position of this in
relation to this top part alright so I'm
gonna stick with this just for now and
so now I have to really really question
myself in terms of how I want to
structure the rest of this page so I
know that the monthly price I'm going to
be charging is 49.95 for this and so I
definitely want to have trying to think
here I'm trying to decide whether or not
it makes sense to just have the order
form right here or have something else
see because I want to have you know the
monthly price is gonna be forty nine
ninety five but I'm thinking of allowing
people to order three months at a time
for a discounted price so that kind of
that definitely changes things up so
because you want people to perceive you
know that they they're they're getting a
value for something and also the entices
them to obviously commit a longer period
and while saving something so I'm trying
to think you know generally if you can
keep something with as few clicks as
possible you're gonna have more
conversions and that's just that's not
just I for order forms that's for
anything basically and where people have
to click around the more friction it
causes more difficult it becomes I so
I'm really trying to think I'm gonna
pause while I just sit here and ponder
that all right I'm still a little bit
stumped so whatever this happens I
always just like to I do a Google search
for maybe just modern ordered pages and
this could spark a good idea I haven't
done it either I didn't like pause and
do it beforehand so I don't
what the hell I'm gonna find so let me
just bring that up I'm gonna go to
Google here and put in
I don't know modern order pages or
something like that come on now there's
nothing out here well the plan B would
be to just find some of the most common
web-based apps or sites and see what
they do if their pages let me pause just
to find that okay so let me switch back
here it automatically goes back to my
photoshop the way I have set Camtasia up
but I just got four different real
popular services and the order page is
up just to show you know what these
people are approaching how they're
approaching their their initial order
page so right here we got too much of a
fan of this one although I like the
headline because it really doesn't focus
on your typical join now you know it
actually gives you an interesting raw
number here Squarespace
this is their pricing page as simple
prices no surprises very big and easy to
see for the price and they have
different columns here for the options
that show the benefits of each I
creative cloud from Adobe we have
different options here lynda.com I guess
you could call it competitor to me they
have C they obviously they're the most
closely related to my type of business
and so basic month-to-month they charge
25 a month again you don't get
one-on-one training which is something
you get with me so that's why they would
be cheaper basic annual building so
they're gonna allow some
to subscribe for an entire year so you
save $50 that way premium which is
month-to-month wait how is this
different than this one basic Oh premium
okay so okay you get they allow you to
they charge you 17 all right now I yeah
they told you $12 extra to download
project files that's a little strange
premium annual billing that's to be able
to do this and offline viewing
okay so just the download project files
that's crazy but anyhow okay so for me
really when it comes to the the data
points I gather the data sets in terms
of what I'm going to offer I just have
two things I say you just joined month
to month or you can also join X months
for a price reduction now I'm a little
bit wary of allowing like a full year's
worth of someone to do that only because
I if they end up using mentor for
example the one-on-one training and they
go crazy and they they use it it submit
like 20 projects a day that's not
somebody I really want to be a part two
where honestly so I think in maybe just
a three months at a time
I and now that will help discount
somebody and also make it so that if
they do join three months and pay for
three months maybe at like 39 instead of
49 per month if they decide to say after
the three months it will stick with that
$39 I'm thinking still so uncertain it's
very important I get this right
alright so I'm gonna go ahead I just
pause for a good five minutes just to
think about this so I'm gonna go ahead
and just experiment with just an idea
and see where it takes me
I'm gonna get out the grid and I don't
want to use the full width you don't
always have to use the full width I
guess I'm not a guess but no it's a
certainty
so I think I'm just gonna come out just
start out this second one and then I
don't know we'll see I'm gonna get out
the rounded rectangle tool and I have 12
pixels for the radius so that I look
fine and just coming out somewhere
around here left-click and alt you can
maybe right around there
alright let's get rid of that and I'm
going to make it light I think just to
start and double click on this layer
style and give it a stroke
maybe like a gray color just for now hit
okay alright so inside of it I want to
put some text here so I'm gonna call
this I month-to-month
alright so also left the line it
I left justify it my ad 17 is 415 and
yeah maybe 17 and maybe I want to space
these out further I'm not sure put this
right here for now and then just over
here I'm gonna put in
all right
something like that for now
now let's see I'm obviously
experimenting put this along the way
let's see here
alright I'm gonna increase that a little
bit the height and move this over here
alright so we have paid month and month
we have the price you know what maybe I
need to move this over a little bit and
then put
yeah like that yeah that's better yeah
that makes a little bit more sense put
it on to there just immediately look
better when I centered it I'm gonna give
it some sort of container as well up
here I think for that heading alright
and what happens if I stick this thing
in there alright I wonder what other
people are using for their call to
action for the individual packages I'm
going to look here
sign up now join this is just a big
button that you can click they don't
really have that at all alright so I
joined paint premium would be redundant
based on the previous pages maybe I'll
just put in a joint premium join now
what were they using again damn I have
such a terrible memory Linda's using
sign up now you know maybe I'll just use
a right now or something there we go and
we'll take this I things are still
cramped I think I mean scale the size of
this just a tad bit
all right and i auto-select layer get in
there
all right and I leave that there for now
all right so paid month a month
this is 4995 per month all right so I'm
not really sure how I'm gonna word this
one over here so I'll just wing it
select all these duplicate them get out
that grid all right okay so alright so
change this to by three months and save
and then this one
but we have to mention you what this
price is times three so get out that
calculator I'm 39 9 5 times 3 it's 1
1985 maybe able to just make this a flat
119 alright so do I put 119 here or do I
mention the lower price early signify
the lower price but put the full price
the initial price they ought to pay for
those three months down here
we put eye
1:19 see here
if I can make this bold here all right
one change I'm gonna make is I want to
make this one bold okay so by three
months thirty-nine ninety-five per month
see it feels a little bit too wordy
right here I move this back by three
months
I need to mention the night the 119
though some we're trying to think all
right I've completely changed my mind
what I'm gonna do is put the 119 here we
don't need this and put in right here 39
95
but 94 95 and up here
and then what I'll do is I come
underneath 39.95 and I'll highlight this
so let me go ahead choose this color we
use aam that way we take a little a
tenth or focus off of the 119 and we
bring a lot of tension to the fact that
this is 39.95 opposed to 49.95 yeah I
think that works better yeah all right
and another thing I have to wonder about
is i-mate having should I change join
now over here and leave its to be the
same color or should I emphasize this
one and maybe just make this a different
color let me see almost like layer well
we don't want to look like it's grayed
out that's for sure
maybe we could yeah I'm gonna leave it
like that for now another thing I wanted
to do is add a promo box so I'm gonna
code in a probem box for this I'm gonna
put this over here
put this at the top give it a stroke
light I'm just gonna use placeholder
text for that I think
and then we'll take this
these should be the same oh well I'll
just that one second um
what I want to do is change this to be
white give it a stroke I'm going to use
one change this here to black
and let me come back over here you know
what maybe I will
as you can see I going back and forth
back and forth like crazy just changing
my mind on certain things I think that's
fine right there
all right so another thing I have to ask
myself on going allow people to choose
PayPal or processing through a credit
card or a debit card right on the site
so so many people use especially young
designers they may have a PayPal account
that's all they have access to so I want
people to be able to use PayPal so where
do I allow them to specify that option
at the actual checkout page or right
here
I'm thinking maybe right here shoot it's
always a pain in the butt I think me
what I may do is this so I'm going to
take this here direct selection tool H
Cottrell H pushes down quite a bit and I
need to find the checkout with PayPal
button or graphic or whatever it is
actually I should check out their
official page for that
that's this graphic right here so if I
copy that image paste it now it's a PNG
damn it all right now I'm just clicking
on random all right
um let's see here I could just drag this
onto my desktop right click open with
Photoshop okay now I can copy that and
get this in here all right
some like that and I I'm not sure if
this should be joined now or check out
now I'm gonna leave that join now and I
need to put like or and should these
beads to decide of each other no I'll do
is put in or two white that's why I
can't see it
alright we still need some more height
on this almost done I know this is a
long video
alright so now control h-space these out
a little bit all right
and real quickly oops
click on this one a stupid pixel grid
thing I need to get rid of that or stop
showing that and then just take these
two layers duplicate them push them up
it's almost a little bit too a little
bit too much it feels like with this or
PayPal thing here it look like if I put
it to the side of it or check out with
PayPal maybe I just need to make this
join now a little bit bigger so if I
take this really scale that thing up
okay so actually delete this to crop
all right take this promo code stuff put
that back there all right you know what
I think I like this now I may end up
changing it before I actually launch it
but I for now this is good especially
being at 37 minutes long watching me
being boring here so yeah I kind of
wanted to do this video just because
this is something I needed to design so
I decided to kill two birds with one
stone I so yeah if you have any
questions or even suggestions of what
you were thinking let me know all right
I will see you tomorrow goodbye
