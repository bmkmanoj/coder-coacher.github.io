hey everyone Garry Simon of course
cetera comm today we're gonna do
something a little bit different and
cover something that's based solely on
design and I do understand I you know
we've been tackling did the development
side of things for the past several
months but I do want to focus on pull
stack which does include things like
identity and logo design so I'm going to
show you the process behind designing a
logo for a cryptocurrency business and
the process of effective logo design
though remains the same regardless of
the niche so whether it's a
cryptocurrency business a flower
business or a gaming business the
following approach is one that you can
use while designing a logo for literally
any business or purpose so we're going
to talk about what constitutes effective
logo design while showcasing a single
project that I recently tackled for a
cryptocurrency related business oh but
real quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera comm
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on all right
let's get back to it so what is this
business well I'm into crypto currencies
like Bitcoin and iota and I came across
an individual who's launching a
decentralized charity called fort based
on iota which is a cryptocurrency you
don't really need to understand it but
if you want to learn more you can check
out this link here at iota org and Fort
as a name is a PlayOn for them and fort
as a whole is being used to signify a
shelter for the disadvantaged for
example so a description of fort as a
charity and service is you know it's a
decentralized charity that employees
they iota tangle now you don't have to
understand what that is either
again visit iota org to understand more
and it's based on the idea tangle to
provide economic aid to people in need
so if you want to learn more about this
business specifically which is not
fictional it's actually real you could
check out this lake here I'll try to
remember too
these in the YouTube description so you
can just click on them alright so I was
approached to design a logo for fort and
I took that as an opportunity so let's
talk about brainstorming here so
regardless of the business it's
necessary to brainstorm and identify key
attributes that both identify the
purpose of the business and also what
makes it unique so for the fort project
after talking with one of the you know
the main guy behind it I identified
several attributes crypto digital
currency and money charity and giving
help an aid port hideout enclosure
safety and security so giving these
different attributes we can begin to
form concepts that relate to the word
mark which is the type portion of the
logo like the name fort and any
associated symbolism or marks so where
do we begin
well I like starting with the name or
the word mark personally so again a word
mark is the type portion of a logo in
our case it's fort and if we want a
unique treatment applied to the type
outside of just using a strict font like
this without any modifications then it's
best to ensure that whatever is done is
unique and relevant based on the
business so looking at for for it right
here not fard for it this is just a
regular sans serif font not all that
exciting so but the purpose of looking
at it is to help us determine and
formulate potential visual
representations of the attributes that
we formulated and we listed out earlier
so the one that I came up with
immediately was to connect the top of
the F with the top of the T which could
help for an enclosure or a fort over the
entirety of the word mark so let's look
at that and see what that looks like
alright so a few things changed here I
decided to capitalize the O and they are
to help create visual consistencies
because the lowercase letter n kind of
throws an extra element of complexity I
just do not like now I like this concept
because it's simple relevant in unique
all of which are necessary
attributes to an effective logo but we
can't just stop there as logo designers
so it's always worth further exploring a
given concept to see if we could take it
other places so the next one I came up
with is right here so this is an
approach that further solidifies the
concept of being in a fort or an
enclosure or being safe by encasing the
entire wordmark in a rectangle with a
single point of entry under or to the
right of T so I also took this concept a
few steps further right here so the
concept on the Left creates an entire
enclosing though I thought it might be
hard to read so I created a variation on
the right that separates the F right
over here now at this point I show the
client the series of concepts and their
feedback suggested that they wanted to
see a separate symbol like the nike
swoosh so combinations or combination
logos they consist of a word mark in a
separate symbol that can be used
together or independently so for this
cryptocurrency logo they wanted to see a
unique mark that can be used outside of
the name so symbolism it can come in
many different forms some are purely
abstract others are literal and some are
letter marks now a letter mark like a
word mark uses a letter as the
foundation of the symbolism it's usually
either just a single letter that
represents the beginning letter of the
business name or multiple letters in the
case of a business that has multiple
words now in the case of fort we just
have F so the task is to represent the F
while also representing in a unique and
relevant manner the purpose of this
cryptocurrency business so the process
is the same as the above in the case of
the word mark so here we have a simple F
so it's all about identifying unique
forms and shapes in this app that
pertain to this business while
maintaining the readability of the F so
my idea was to recreate the F form by
using a perfect square so now we have
something that's unique but still has an
identifiable F here on the right but
still there's nothing that says anything
about this company so I decided to stick
with the enclosure slash fort concept by
completing the square in a less thick
weight
so overall we have a square which is a
very vague I albeit relevant
representation of an enclosure or a fort
so it looks interesting but what if we
rotated it say 45 degrees all right so I
added a second variation to the right
which provided for an entrance into the
fort by separating a portion of the F
right here while also still making it
identifiable although still pretty much
in an abstract manner so the final logo
I presented the symbolism in this form
below so here we have two variations as
full combination logos but notice that
the word mark here is much more
simplistic than the word marks that I
presented earlier
well that's because if you're going to
use a combination logo it's best to keep
the word marks simple as opposed to
complex I did slightly change the F
right here but nothing else
now it's also helpful to present the
client with an explainer graphic if you
have something that's pretty unique and
as we could see here we're isolating the
F to show that it is an F and it is
serving as basis of a letter mark and
then also over here we're describing you
know the point of entry and the actual
fork concept itself so at the end of the
day they chose the above symbolism to
represent fort so this is the process
that I use to design most of my logo
concepts so hopefully you learn to think
or to going forward when you design
concepts all right once again I'm Gary
Simon's a'course cetera comm and I will
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
