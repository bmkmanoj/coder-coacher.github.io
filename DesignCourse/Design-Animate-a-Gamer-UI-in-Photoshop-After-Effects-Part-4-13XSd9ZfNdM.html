calm today is February 12th and we're
going to finish up the four-part video
tutorial on how to create a cool gamer
user interface design and also animate
it in after-effects so that's what we're
going to focus on today is animating it
in after-effects so as always check out
design course comm and if you haven't
yet subscribe here on youtube alright
let's get started alright so let's begin
here um this is where we left off I
didn't even save my project so yeah you
might want to do that it's my project
folder down here and call this you know
whatever you want to call it and okay so
now what we need to do is get started
with all these layers and start
animating them in some shape some way
shape or form so I what I want to do is
take okay we got this layer this is the
main UI and then we have our little LEDs
up there and so that's gonna be the
first thing we want to animate so
temporarily I'm just going to take all
this stuff and just push it out a little
bit in this time timeline right here so
take everything else and push it out
okay so except for the LED parts we're
gonna bring those back okay so the first
thing we'll do I'm gonna I think I yeah
I want to pre compose these so I'll go
to layer with all them selected of
course precompose me and UI yeah hit OK
alright so now what I want to do is
figure out you know how I want this to
kind of form you know because it's going
to start basically at nothing and then
just going to just build out so there
are a few different types of
affects that we can apply to the layer
that we can animate that will distort or
not to store it rather but you know just
kind of bring it into view in some way
shape or form okay so I had to pause it
just so I can get it step ahead and
figure out you know how exactly I want
to do that so I what we'll do is in the
effects and presets initially there was
a glow there before it's paused it's
just type in linear and that will give
us the linear wipe so animation presets
this is already animated but we want the
one that's not animated yet so just take
linear wipe right here and just place it
onto this thing okay
so exactly what does this do
alright so if we take the transition
complete right now it's at zero and we
pull it to the right we can see that it
animates this thing in some way so what
we'll do is we'll start it out at you
know around anywhere where we can't see
it so I have a 84% and so what we want
to do is click on this little icon right
there
and that creates a keyframe so if we
look down here in our timeline you hit
you you will automatically show only
what has been keyframe down here and you
see this little thing that's that's your
keyframe all right so if we move this
forward right around well you know what
now let me go ahead and take all these
and move them further alright so if we
move it yeah we'll just try right around
here put another keyframe change this to
zero well there it is so it now animates
in if you hit zero you know what I think
this timeline is wrong so if you go to
composition composition settings you can
readjust yeah this is actually I think
one second
oops
hit one right there and now we have a
lot more room to work with so if you hit
zero on your number pad that will kind
of just load it and you get everything's
kind of very quick here so just take
everything holding ctrl and drag it out
further along with this flare oops yeah
we want to take these and there I know
our animation is it going to be past 40
seconds or 25 or even 20 but we're just
giving ourselves some room to work with
same thing with this
why isn't that allowing me to I think
it's because the what's inside here so
we have to go back to composition
settings and adjust it for that
composition because we that's basically
an entirely new composition sorry about
this I screwed up thinking that was the
minutes or the whatever when I initially
started the project we did that
incorrectly so same thing with the damn
flare double-click on it
composition settings and one over there
all right all right so now we're ready
to get started okay so I'm gonna take
all these layers down here and up here
above that and just move them a little
bit forward just throw that out of the
way all right so now if we hit zero you
can see how fast this thing comes in
it's like really fast so we can just app
by pulling this second keyframe out a
little bit just like that so I'm just
hitting zero on the keyframe just to
look at that and see how that works
alright and you can also adjust how that
animates by taking both of these right
click keyframe assistant easy ease in or
out so you get ease in it changes you
know what these look like but also
changes the animation slightly all right
so that's good and we'll leave it at
that so now what else do we want to kind
of animate well how about these well I
think we'll take that a little bit after
how about the things that are down here
so what we'll do is find those I think
we'll just have to sub you I know that's
not those
that's these ones down here right there
yeah the thin bar okay
so we'll bring these in we'll bring this
in closer so here's an animation stops
right around there then we'll push this
right around there and I'll think about
how I want to make these things animate
in and honestly I'm just gonna
experiment and just kind of show you you
know a process that you can use to
experiment with getting things
transitioned in so just delete this this
brings up all of the available effects
and so if you get an animation presets
you have all these different types of
folders in here so you have like
transform and then you have transitions
like movements and stuff I let's see
here
wipes so really you can I experiment by
just taking like barn doors you know
what is that it's probably retarded but
let me just place it on there and you
know what happens oh that works exactly
how I wanted it to so barn doors so just
make it a reveal right in that's awesome
all right cool so hit zero it'll load
that cool I worked out awesome
I got lucky because I didn't even
experiment with that so cool all right
so we got that animating in let's go
ahead and take our thin line and we
created that in here as a shape layer I
think yeah so let's bring that in so
okay and we could probably do that barn
door thing as well let me see
so just like at the beginning of the
layer we'll put that on it and let's see
what happens now
oops hangs here on the number pad cool
okay it's a little bit too slow so if
you hit you get these key frames and
bring them closer hit zero and we could
push this a little bit closer to the
bottom here let me collapse that if we
hit you all right so at you here okay
all right cool
all right so your should look roughly
like that all right and let's go ahead
and I think after that we'll take the
sub UI and work with that so yeah put it
right around there and let's try the
barn door thing on that one too just for
the heck of it and I've decided just to
leave it as is
it was too much of a peanut but so yeah
it still looks cool now what do I want
to do okay so then we have the glare
things coming out so let's do that or
those that flares okay so bring it over
here alright so we don't want these all
to come in so we're gonna have to edit
the individual layers inside of flare so
what we'll do is all right so
what we'll do is I'm trying to think
about how I want this to animate first
yeah we'll go ahead and do the opacity
basically so hit control or maybe at T
rather will put a pasady on this start
it at zero and then just move up a
couple frames hundred so now it goes
from 0-100 maybe around here now take
both of those and copy them control C
and right around here on this second
layer or shape layer 4 which is the
other one
control V so now if we hit you on this
you see they're a little bit further
start slightly after and do the same
thing here possibly we'll see what this
animation looks like all right so now if
we go to game or UI
so let's go ahead and just hit zero and
let this load up it's way too slow um so
let me pull this in yeah that's like way
too slow so let me go back in here to
flare you know that happens sometimes
that is life so let me go down and hit
you you wait you know what the hell one
second why is it showing me everything
about one second okay I can individually
hit you apparently that works okay so
what we'll do is take all these hold
shift move them together a lot closer
and then we can take these and move them
in as well all right so now we'll go
back and hopefully this is the
animations a lot better or faster rather
here's actual speed
all right that's I yeah they say that's
is so slow what am I doing wrong okay
yeah it's just way too slow got to do
this again sorry it's so ridiculous let
me zoom up here oops I double-clicked
brought up the opacity break those damn
things in closer all right take this and
just pull them all in ok gamer UI there
you go
please be better it should be zero on
the number pad alright that's better
cool alright so let's continue on we
have this flare thing so we can control
D and duplicate that and we want to flip
it actually we don't need to because
it's uniform I think so
put it right around there cool and we
have the thing inside I think that's
this layer right here
and that kind of sort of needs to come
in okay
so we'll have that come in before the
flares come in and so let's see here and
we'll just keep consistent with the
animation type and it's going to need to
be quicker though so it you close it in
right around there there hit zero
not so fast and let me think I saw it
all right whatever I think that's good
all right so actually that's kind of
messed up what is that over there
is that oh man you hide that now that is
a part of that layer so that's an issue
oh let me fine turn that back on
yeah I'm very interested in knowing what
the hell that is
well you know what I'll do I think I'm
just gonna remove that there's a lot
here Jesus Oh what is this thing I'm
gonna have to back up here yeah okay
well that was irritating I had to delete
all those effects sorry about that
let me go ahead and get linear I think
there's gonna do a linear wipe because I
don't know what that was those white
things were showing up so let me go
ahead and put that there we will go to
transition complete make that 100
initially create a keyframe and then go
to zero all right so I'll hit zero on
the number pad
alright and then I all right so we're
almost done with this and we're gonna
make this we're gonna come together well
at the end here so I've got this this
this that and then we have to text start
it like right here and there's a preset
called typewriter and it's an animation
preset so it's already like created for
us the animation drag it on top there we
go alright so we hit zero on the number
pad you can kind of get this thing
working you might want to be faster so
just hit you drag that in maybe around
here
and also the background keeps on you
know where is that ad this needs to go
all the way all right
hitting's here again to preview this
cool alright so now what we want to do
is take all of our layers we we forgot
that glow in the back let me do that
real quick so let's find that the glow
glow glow yeah we'll just put this at
the bottom here basically make sure
nothing selected and we will go to lips
tool ctrl + shift + I will put this
let's drag this to the back or to the
bottom rather get down there alright
just above cloud we'll take the fill and
yeah we want radial so we'll change it
to radial here and a justice get rid of
those just drag them off this is going
to be like a blue color and this is
going to be zero alright so we can't see
it because we have to pull this up
actually we want to be in and then take
this hold shift and scale that up
alright so if I get 100% yeah alright so
as this layer right there alright cool
so what we can do is also animate this
as well so we don't want this to come in
I'd say until right around here yeah and
then we can just plot apply this scale
to this so hit s and
well put it right around there a
keyframe come back over here and make
the scale zero okay cool
all right so save that control s my hard
drives being slow all right okay so now
what we want to do is take all of our
layers and yeah with except that with
exception to the cloud layer right there
so you have them all selected good a
layer pre-compose it's at the bottom
there I'll just call it everything yeah
there we go hit OK and also f4 here this
switches back and forth like you can
specify a blend mode if you wanted to so
if you hit f4 we want to select this C
because otherwise if you take this and
scale down and hold shift sometimes
you'll have I don't think it's a problem
our case though but if you just do this
it lets anything that's outside of this
pre composition and it allowed to extend
outside so if you had that glow real big
it would get cut off otherwise if you
didn't have this option selected all
right so what we want to do is basically
take ya s for scale right now we have at
76% so we will basically turn on a
keyframe there and right around maybe
five seconds or just before take this to
100 we could turn on if we go here to
let me see here everything we turn on
motion blur for all the layers and
come over here turn them on as well I
think that will still work hopefully and
then turn it on up here as well yeah and
then hit zero on your number pad and
it's being slow it's a the more complex
your scene gets the longer the render
time is I should probably just pause
this until it's done so I will do that
all right so let's see here
are you serious it was already rendered
but uh it's going a lot faster now
though all right so this is it all right
and for some reason this isn't coming in
so let me find that that's on everything
I think yeah where to go let's go to
hundred percent then that was a shape
layer hopefully I didn't get rid of it
oh there it is
I'm a hit you what is going on with this
thing might be because of the weird eye
what do you call these invert alpha
things maybe there's just making it hide
so I need to get rid of all of these and
we will animate that with a linear wipe
okay so now it should be there okay just
take linear wipe on one of the other
layers I think this one right here
where's that at
that's right there I've hit you you just
find those real quick and copy them and
come down here to the shape layer which
one is it there okay and then paste that
in hit you so we could see it maybe
extend it just a tad bit and all right
that's good all right also we forgot
about these things up here so let me
find those I'm just looking for oh yeah
that's over here okay so let's go back
here to the beginning I think right
around here
so where we can have these things kind
of come in so the light is on the top
it's good a hundred percent
all right so we'll do a linear wipe on
those basically so it's still we have
that copied still so all you do is just
paste this in all right so hit you
there you go alright so let me save that
I'm gonna go to a hundred percent I'm
gonna try to get as much as this in view
as possible so if it hits zero it's
gonna quickly get this ready to go and
then they're hear these things coming in
alright this is the actual cool I like
it alright so now what we need we need
some sound because it's just kind of
boring in and of itself alright so I
haven't even looked into sound and what
I'm gonna do for that there are various
sites that you can use well that have
kind of like cool interface twitchy sort
of yeah sound files that you can
purchase and some might even be for free
if you look around hard enough so I'm
gonna try to find one real quick I'm
gonna pause this alright so there's a
site I usually I would use something
like audio jungle calm but or a.net I
forget which one it is let me see audio
jungle yeah I'd usually use this these
are paid ones though but they have a ton
to choose from in their cheap but just
so everyone can kind of follow along
there's one called freesound.org you
search for all different types of things
so I found this switch type thing I
think would work well for one sound and
we can start to layer these things and
also I'm not sure if you probably heard
that too well but I'll link these in the
description of the YouTube video so what
I'm going to do is go back to After
Effects and get back everything over
here alright
as a project and import already saved
that file you have to create an account
real quick it's free on that free sound
website and then just download it and
then put it in your assets folder so
import file right there
drag it on and let's see how this sounds
when it's coming together you may have
to adjust it a little bit but we'll see
and it probably worth maybe trying to
find some other ones that you could add
on top of like some type of like
interface elements so you have all these
options down here in which we can just
play and and basically just experiment I
mean just a ton of them obviously so
what is this I mean I'm not sure if you
guys can hear this either I believe I
have this set to record yeah
the Windows sound but if not oh well you
get the idea alright so I'm just going
to pause and find a few more of these
that I can use
so I also found this one and I let me go
back and hips import that which one was
that one they eat okay so it's this one
and we'll just see what this sounds like
alright let me and I'm just moving this
round seeing if it makes sense anywhere
and you know really it's a matter of
just trying to play around with this to
get you know what's happening in the
animation to match up with the sound so
so when these things come out to the
side
these right here seems like they should
match up with the part in that initial
audio that I had where you can hear like
something banging so let me okay so let
me just try this for now
it looks a little bit it sounds a little
bit better
yeah just alright so you get the idea
basically you know you can find these
sounds and you can add however many of
them you wish to try to get them all to
match up with what's happening and so
yeah I'm gonna consider this completed
so hopefully you learned a lot about you
know just using Photoshop to really
create something that's cool that you
can take into After Effects and animate
alright so if you enjoy the tutorial I
subscribe here on youtube and check out
design course comm see we have going
there and I will see you tomorrow
alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
