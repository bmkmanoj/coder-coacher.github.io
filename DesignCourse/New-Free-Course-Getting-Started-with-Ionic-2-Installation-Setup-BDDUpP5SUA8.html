comma today I'm really excited because
we're going to start learning something
new and that is ionic - so you've been
following my channel for any length of
time especially within the last few
months you'll know we've been focusing
on angular 2 development so why would we
start shifting emphasis to ionic 2 well
simply put ionic 2 is built on top of
angular 2 and allows you to add native
mobile functionality to your apps it is
a hybrid app development framework and
so what hybrid app development framework
means is simply on one hand you're able
to use HTML CSS and angular to develop
to develop apps but on the other hand it
also allows you to add native app mobile
functionality and also apps that are
browsable and downloadable in app stores
such as on iOS and windows and Android
alright so this is the very first video
that's a part of this free course series
that I'm releasing a course at calm and
this YouTube channel and within the next
day or two I may be releasing the next
lesson video as well so make sure you
check up at course tetra comm for this
course I'll link it here in youtube
description so let's go ahead and get
started with installation and project
setup all right so you want to make sure
you hop into your console of choice mine
is commander and we want to type in node
- V and NPM - V to make sure that we
have no js' and a node package manager
installed because these are
prerequisites that you need before you
can install ion - now if you don't you
want to head on over to this URL right
here nodejs org this will take you to
the home and then we can click downloads
and then depending on which operating
system you're using Windows or Mac go
ahead and install it and then just go
through the standard installation all
the way through it will automatically
include node package manager I during
the installation process so once you
have that go ahead and reload your
console here and then you can run these
two commands
should give you a version number okay so
next step we need to install both ionic
and Cordova now the way we do that we'll
type in NPM install - g for global this
means we'll only have to install it once
on our machine and then ionic and
cordova then you hit enter and it will
take a while to install these I've
already installed them so I'm not going
to run this command so go ahead and
install those if you have not yet
installed them now once you're complete
now we can start our very first IO to
project with the ionic command-line
interface so the way we access that is
through ionic and then if we hit enter
by the way it's going to take a little
time but it will spit out some version
information as well as available
commands and we can scroll up here and
we'll see all of this stuff here and
also you can type in ionic that H or -
help and it will give you more specific
information about each of these commands
and their associated options okay now
again to start an actual project will
take Bionic and then the start command
and then the next command it takes will
be the name or the path of the project
so we'll name ours in camelcase first
project and this will also create a
folder depending on wherever you're
currently at in my case I'm in my code
folder and my users and windows username
and then we can go ahead and type in
blank now bank this is optional ionics
who allows you to choose from several
different starter templates based on
your project needs so the other three
options are tabs if you want tabs right
away installed a side menu and tutorial
which kind of just helps you go along
with a tutorial that they offer now me I
just like starting from scratch so we
can understand how things are created
you know from the very basic elements so
we can course if we wanted to add tabs
we can do that manually or a side menu
and all that
and then we'll also designate the - - or
- - v2 flag and this will designate that
this ionic project will be based on
version 2 now it's just left out or
emitted it will automatically install an
ionic 1 project which you don't want
because it's older I'm not sure why they
would require the v2 flag but no big
deal
I once you do that hit enter does take a
little bit of time to install so I'm
going to go ahead and pause alright so
with any luck you'll see this little
message your ionic app is ready to go
yadda yadda yadda so let's go ahead and
CD into that path we created so CD first
project alright and now if you want you
can serve your ionic 2 app which means
just to build it and show us for the
purpose of testing and development in
the browser so to do that we'll simply
type ionic and serve I'll enter and
momentarily it will launch our default
browser with the project ready to go and
here we go
so we're at localhost 8100 which is a
beat to default port and our basic ionic
blank template ready to go so the ionic
serve command that we just ran it does
accept a number of options that you can
add to that so to view them all you can
type in ionic - H in the console but I
also kind of want to mention just some
more of the notable options you can
designate through - - port you know if
you want to change it from the default
port of 80 100 to something else you can
do that you can also say no live reload
and that will turn off the library load
feature which is something where if you
save designated file when you're
developing it will automatically refresh
your browser which is a handy option so
I wouldn't use that you can also
designate hi - browser and that allows
you to specify which browser to use such
as Safari Firefox or Chrome and then
also you can use - lab or - l and this
is a great feature because it allows you
to view the app on
simulated mobile platforms and screen
sizes even simultaneously so let's try
that out let's exit out of here behead
ctrl C we'll hit Y for yes and I'll take
an ionic serve just last time except
this time I'm gonna add - L so give it a
moment to run here and there we go so
now you can see it kind of automatically
has this set in this sort of emulated
phone view and we can come up here for
platforms we can see iPhone is toggled
on we can also choose Android and
Windows as well now let me just zoomed
out here to 100% again and now we can
see all three devices here which is
really handy for the purpose of
development and then on a final note I
just wanted to do a real quick overview
of what the project and folder structure
looks like for net ionic - project that
was generated with the command-line
interface so as we could see typical to
a angular 2 project we see you know in
the root folder we have a package JSON
file we also have a TS config we have
node modules up here and we also have a
source folder now this is where the bulk
of your work the vast majority of your
work will take place in we also have
that standard app folder along with our
app component TS as you can see it's
very similar in fact it's exactly the
same as your standard angular 2 project
for a component we have our HTML we have
our module one thing that's slightly
different is that we do have instead of
a CSS file we have a sass file and
that's because by default when we start
a project with the ionic command-line
interface it will use in default - sass
instead of just CSS now if you're not
familiar with sass it basically allows
you to create variables in your your CSS
along with mix-ins and functions and all
this other handy step stuff that allows
you to create essentially a dynamic CSS
also we have ass
here and one thing it's a little
slightly different is we have a pages
folder and this is where all of your
different screens will go that's
associated with your app all right and
then we also have a theme folder down
here where we can do customizations and
all that stuff so all in all it's not
very different in terms of your folder
structure in your project structure when
compared to just starting up a regular
angular 2 app alright so hopefully you
were able to get through that without
any issues and in the next lesson we're
going to focus on ionic 2 components
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
