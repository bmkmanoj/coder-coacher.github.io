course calm welcome to a new design
challenge first I want to make an
announcement though every Tuesday you
can now expect to have a new design
challenge uploaded to the channel so
this means instead of having seven days
to get your submission in you now have
five so by Sunday night you need to make
sure your submission is entered on the
forums and then on Monday you can expect
the review video to be uploaded alright
so for this challenge we're going to put
you on the spot because we're going to
have a random noun logo design or a
monogram design challenge some of you
may recall in the past I've uploaded
these videos titled random noun logo
design practice where I put myself on
the spot well now it's your turn with
this design challenge so what I'm going
to do is switch over to the desktop and
use a random noun picker and choose to
random nouns and your job will to be
able to take those random nouns and turn
them into a unique symbol to convey both
of the ideas all right so make sure you
subscribe here design course calm are
and also the youtube channel and let's
go ahead and switch to the desktop ok so
i found this just searching for a google
on google rather and it says how many
random nouns do we want to generate
we're going to try to and sometimes it
does generate words that we just can't
work with so if that's the case i'll
just regenerate so here we go all right
what is catsup see that's just one of
those things one of those times it does
not make sense try this again earth and
sailor ok we can work with that I yeah
we're going to stick with this so your
goal is to take Earth and or the idea of
Earth something that emulates the idea
of Earth and also something that has to
do with a sailor and combine them into
one unique symbol known as a monogram so
I've just paused the video and i created
the form challenge thread over at design
course calm and here it is so the
objective is based on the two random
nouns that we selected just now on the
live video challenge you have to take
the idea of Earth and sailor and combine
these two nouns to form a single
identify identify double symbol known as
a monogram so do not use any words
unless you're going to explain your
concept alright so the requirements are
a 500 x 500 pixel document Center the
monogram and don't make it too large it
must relate to earth and sailor and
submission deadline now this is
something new those of you who've done
these deadlines usually I just give you
seven days this time I'm going to change
it to five and the reason being is
because I five days is plenty enough
time and I find that most people have
already submitted everything by those
five days I in also the next day after
that the sixth day I'm going to actually
do the review so the reviews from now on
are going to become immediately after
basically so you have all the way to the
night of sunday and then you can expect
to review the next day later on and the
day after that that's when we're going
to have the new contest so every seven
days on schedule that's going to be the
new routine all right so that way we can
come to expect that tuesdays are when we
have new challenges all right so
inspiration here's just some examples of
monograms there's so many out there I
only chose three though I this I
couldn't contains the idea of just chain
links and an M so two ideas into one
symbol this right here a box out of B 0
X is right here talk they have a tea and
then a little message icon and that's it
so just take the idea of Earth and
sailor and combine it in some unique way
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
