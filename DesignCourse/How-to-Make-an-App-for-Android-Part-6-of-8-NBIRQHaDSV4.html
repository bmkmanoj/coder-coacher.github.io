splash screen actually I forward over to
this screen and the way we want to do
this is I under the Java folder we want
to double click on splash and that's
going to give us this screen right here
and under public splash public last
splash rather extends activity we need
to add a couple lines and the first one
will be private final int duration
equals 3,000 which is milliseconds so 3
seconds is how long we want that splash
SEC that splash image to show you can
adjust that however you wish obviously
you don't want it to be too long because
then I become increasingly annoying so I
private red and then M splash thread
alright so not entirely too important to
understand exactly what's going on here
it's basically creating a variable that
says the durations 3000 seconds and then
we're creating a new thread here and
then underneath here it says public void
on create and underneath set content
view our layout activity splash we're
gonna put in and I'm going to paste some
code here and I'll try to remember to
you know I'll make that accessible as
well so you don't have to sit there
typing line by line so what I'm going to
be pasting here is this code right here
select classes to import just hit OK
alright so we're going to make some
adjustments to this but I let's see here
so basically it said in M splash thread
new thread and then public void run this
is I what we're going to do is try is
wait duration that's up here it's in
reference to here and then finish in an
intent new intent is this is the I the
intent or the activity that we want to
have it forward to essentially and mine
is not called my activity its main very
simple
and make sure you save that and by the
way I I didn't really discuss how to set
up emulators if you don't have an
Android phone I like I said I'm gonna
include links in terms of how to set
that up but if you wanted to set it up
real quickly click on this AVD manager
and under Android virtual devices you
can hit create here's one I've already
created so I'll just hit edit it'll show
you the specs that I set up of course
you can change the devices and all this
stuff I use LGB you hit OK and I when
you go to head to hit play you would
choose instead of choose or any device
you would choose launch emulator and
then it has your emulator name that you
chose and then you'd hit OK now
something to remember is sometimes it
can be very slow so it could take
literally 5 to 10 minutes in order for
the app in the phone actually to load up
so that's why I choose to run I choose a
running device because it's a lot faster
in my opinion I believe there are ways
to really speed it up so I'm gonna look
into that in and also include that as a
link to the reef source file i so what
i'm doing here i'm looking at my phone i
and will hope that it will work yes it
does so it shows it for three seconds
and then it forwards us off to the main
area where it has our layout alright so
i if i come back here
let's go to activity main i'm going to
collapse this real quick I did kind of
notice that I this was up a little bit
too high so I'm just gonna
oops I'm gonna pull it down to the base
there and it also did work when I
clicked on it I pressed on it it changed
to the the down state as well so that's
good the text though was not as large as
I wanted it to be so if you ran into
that same issue I you can change the
text size
one second right here where it says text
sighs I'm gonna choose as 65 pixels and
it makes it a little bit larger and also
we want to make sure that this is
centered when we view it so what we'll
do is add a couple things and in the XML
so the text views right here what we
want to do is put in Android layout
underscore center vertical equals true
Android layout Center horizontal equals
true and then another one which would be
Android gravity equals Center and then
another one Android text alignment a
cola Center oops all right so what we
want to do now is I'm gonna hit play and
run this to make sure everything I look
smooth okay so I just paused and I ran
that and I still notice a couple issues
for one it's aligning this to the
beginning of this quote fuel and you can
see that reflected if you go to layout
to line component and drop that down
you'll see left left image view too so
if we just go into I here get rid of the
align left and align start right there
and now it doesn't do that anymore
also okay in insert a new item accident
I also if we take this it still wasn't
large enough for my liking so we can
always just go to the pixels I'm going
to change it to 80 and really it doesn't
look this big when it's on the screen
so that looks I pretty much better so
I'm gonna run that again just to make
sure everything is good all right so
there's still a couple things I want to
fix about this I noticed that this
background right here the diagonal lines
was a little bit too bright so you can
give it opacity or transparency so that
is would be right here under individual
ooh I where it says drawable BG we can
put Android alpha equals zero points
maybe two four which is 40% of its
original brightness I and then another
thing I don't want to Center it
perfectly in terms of vertical it was
being it ended up looking a little bit
too close to the button so I'm gonna get
rid of this as well so now it's just
layout Center horizontal is true go back
here to design and I noticed once again
that the the font size still is not big
enough to my liking so I'm gonna put in
ninety five here enter oops
cancel and there we go that should be a
lot better what I want to do now is just
put in statically um like an actual
quote so to do that I'm gonna load up
your get up Photoshop rather and I'm
going to open up my I the file that we
had going here so let me see here main
UI I just kind of forget what the slogan
is so I just want to copy that text real
quickly so that's right here oops just
copy that come down here in the text and
the text view has the ID our large tax
there we go
alright so now that looks terrible but
we'll see what this actually looks like
when we're when we run it I run it on
the phone okay so I looked at it and it
looked a hundred percent better it does
not look anything like this fortunately
it's not overlapping that's just because
it's not rendering the text right it's
not using the font
etc so there's no worry there so yeah
now in the next lesson what we're gonna
do is step outside of Android studio and
we're gonna set up the database because
now that we have the design working the
splash image isn't working what we're
gonna do is set up our MySQL database
structure for storing the quotes all
right so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
