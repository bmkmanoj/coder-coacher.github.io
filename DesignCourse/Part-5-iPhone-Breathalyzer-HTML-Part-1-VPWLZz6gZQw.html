today is January 29th with or 29th video
of the year and today we're going to
initially work in Photoshop and go ahead
and cut out our images and export them
for use in HTML and CSS and then we're
just going to go ahead and get our HTML
document ready to go
so tomorrow we'll actually start writing
out all the code and then the day after
that we'll focus on CSS and finishing it
up all right so as always at design
course comm check that out also
subscribe here on YouTube and if you
need access to the project files they
are available for free in the
description of this video or on the
video page on design course comm alright
let's get started
alright so the first thing we need to
consider is what can we create through
CSS and what will have to be images so
before we get to any HTML we're gonna
have to save out these images and so
basically let's escape start of method
from the top and down basically the the
logo is almost always going to be an
image even though we kind of have typed
out a type logo we're just gonna assume
you know it can't be so this will be an
image in and of itself the background
here like these these blurred outline of
course that will have to be an image as
well but I want to make an adjustment so
I'm gonna zoom out real quick I'm going
to take my move tool with auto select
layer on just click anywhere so it
selects it and I'm gonna take the eraser
tool pretty large maybe not that large
367 and I'm just going to blur out the
sides so that we really don't want any
clipping if somebody expands the browser
and they see the end of this then it's
gonna look you know crappy so then I'm
just gonna go down a little bit smaller
just to be sure and come out in this
edge hold shift left click hold shift
alright and then also of course this is
going to be its own image a transparent
I PNG
this right here we can achieve through
GSS alone these two images obviously
will be saved as well and then the face
and then this so I think comes out to
like seven images alright so the first
thing to do is select a logo and it's
currently it's a it's a type usually it
would be rostered so we'll just do that
just right click and raster type and
then we want to go to hit ctrl a and
then ctrl C so look at a file new hit
okay and also when you go to file new
make sure background contents is
transparent ctrl V to paste in and then
file save for web and I'm going to use
the hockey for this for now on and then
we're going to save it as a PNG eight
and make sure transparency is selected
and all these other options there it's
only actually you know what to PNG 24
never mind that I it's almost 1 KB which
is obviously pretty good low so
transparency is on we'll hit save and
it's in the wrong damn directory one sec
alright I found where I want to be so
I'm going to create a new folder for the
whole HTML or the website project so
create a new folder called HTML and
inside of it will create two more
folders one for our CSS in the future
and then another one for images and then
we'll go in there we'll call this logo
yeah alright so we'll go back to our
document here and the background we're
going to tackle that last I just want to
get all this ready to go here and so
we're going to save this image here next
alright so make sure you click on it and
we do have two layers this Baxters and
combined so select both of those pick a
truly and that will merge them alright
so this one is a little bit tricky let
me zoom up a hundred percent if we were
to take this image and save it as a PNG
24-bit let me just show you real quickly
we'll take we'll go to just ctrl a and
then ctrl C that copies everything go to
file new hit OK ctrl V to paste
alright so it looks like it would work
perfectly right and
but if we go to safer web and we leave
transparency on and we look at the the
file sizes 30 KB so that's kind of large
and that's usually what would happen for
a 24-bit so if you wanted to go to down
to an 8-bit u it cuts the file size in
half but there are when it comes to the
edges you would see white pixels
outlining it and it would look like
absolute crap especially against the
dark background which is kind of what we
have with that wine thing so we have to
save this differently we have to copy
the selection rather differently and so
here's what we need to do so we'll take
the lasso tool hit ctrl D to deselect
and we'll just click on the outside
anywhere so it's selecting everything
except for this so we just have to go to
select actually first before we do that
uncheck anti-alias that's very important
so don't now do it okay so now we go to
actually it's ctrl shift I select
inverse and now we could edit copy
merged now what copy merge does is
instead of just copying everything on
this layer like it would if you hit in
ctrl C it would not basically get the
background as well there's a little tiny
background pixels and because the
background is pretty much you know kind
of a dark type of color and it's not
going to move much this image even even
when we're I'm responsive we can get
away with copying those those pixels
right there so we'll go to file new ctrl
V to paste so now if we zoom up here we
can see that the background was copy
with that whereas we zoom up here it was
not and again that's fine if you want a
large image in terms of file size then
it would work on any background but this
we know it's going to work there and
we're going to get away with when we
save for web that we can change this to
a PNG 8 it's only 13 Kb we cut down the
size big time all right
so I know that was a little bit complex
over the next one
but it's worth worth noting so this is
going to be called phone - top and we'll
come back here control D I'll zoom out
just to see what's going on we might as
well go ahead and just save that
background image right now so what we
need to do is take with Auto suck layer
and a move tool I'll select everything
up here and we'll come down we will hold
ctrl left click these two and what we
can do is just to see you know which
layers that we've selected we can turn
those all off and now we just have our
selection in view all right now if these
were already on one layer those two we
wouldn't have had to do that we get to
just select a layer and then select this
and control C but and there was two
layers down there so edit copy merged
file new hit OK save for web which is
ctrl shift alt and s to change this one
to a like for example 153 KS huge if we
change it to a jpg even at 92 I even had
high quality at 92% we're only at 92 K
which is a lot less so for these type of
images JPEGs are a lot better to use and
we can also get away with really taking
down the quality down to like 44 or 45
and you still can't tell any type of
distortions too much and we're at 24 Kb
so I think I'm going to leave around 55
and we'll save and we will call this BG
alright and if we want we can get all
those layers back just a couple more
here
all right so we have this image in that
image so basically if we take this and
control a and then control C it and
control n for new and the Hatter paste
it in save for web go back to PNG 8 now
it's okay to use PNG 8 even though we
kind of just hit ctrl C instead of copy
merged and that's because it's going on
an absolute white background if you were
to try to take this image that we save
and show it on a black background you
would see white pixels but we're not
what's going on white so it's okay so
we're only at 6.8 K and we'll save this
as why have to keep on calling it a
phone it is not a phone I've done this
throughout the whole series breathalyser
there we go breathalyzer
versus breath odds are good yeah because
that was like the green or whatever and
then we just come back over here select
I think it's layer copy - yeah select on
that just hit control C because we
already have the selection you can hide
this and then just paste that in save
for web and this is going to be
breathalyzer bad okay all right so we
have a decision to make you know let's
just select one of these basically we
select on here the we have a border that
goes around this and we could either
choose to save that a part of the image
or we can go ahead and do this with CSS
I think just to avoid I going to into
too much detail for this tutorial I mean
this is basically a beginner for website
design we're just going to include it as
a part of the image so what we would do
is just take both of these layers
holding shift and ctrl e and now they
are you know basically on their own
image and
based for this one I'm just going to use
a jpg and I'm not going to make it
transparent we know it's just this is
the only area that it's going to be the
only background color that's going to be
on so we just take this roughly around
there and edit copy merged trill shift
and hit okay we'll save that for web
save it as jpg take the quality up you
may be around 80 we're only at 5k so
that's good and we'll save this as
person and then we just have one more
down here this is going to be a JPEG as
well
and I'm not going to make it transparent
or anything I think it's fine as is but
if we select it real quick
thought it'll suck layer and then take
the lasso tool we can see how far this
thing actually goes
you would think it may end here but
sometimes when you would cut it out
right there you would see when you put
on the site that there's actually a you
could see a faint like line that cuts it
off so there's a couple ways of going
about this we could take the eraser tool
and just kind of make it even kind of
extend it out further there and now if
we do the lasso tool it's a little bit
more even I'm going to bring this one in
a tad bit we kind of want it to be even
on both sides in terms of the width so
control D that's better
okay so all I have to do is just click
on the outside go to select inverse and
we'll take the square marquee tool and
we'll hold shift and then left click and
drag right around there edit copy merged
drill shift n penner and save that for
web and
at 63% we can get away with no visible
distortions and it's only 7 Kb
so we'll hit save call this phone - side
oops
I called that CID by accident alright so
that is it for cutting out the images so
next I want to get out my HTML editor
and I use something called sublime text
and I'm going to get out the website
real quick and I you know you can
download it I think there's a trial but
it does cost money $70 you don't need to
buy this you don't need to use this I'm
just letting you know what I use you if
you don't have any money for anything
that cost money you can use notepad you
can use any type of text editor to do
what we're going to do in the next
couple days and complete this so let me
just get that out and that is right here
basically this is our folder that I
opened up so we have HTML with CSS
nothing in these and then we have our
images right here so I before I get to
that part I want to get back up that
browser window and right here this is a
framework front end frame or kind of
like bootstrap if you're familiar with
that at all
that 1140 pixel grid that I used the 12
grid that I use is actually from this
site and so in the future I will do a
bootstrap tutorial but if you go to 1140
px calm or I'm gonna make this also
available and in the project files you
can download the source so if you click
that I've already downloaded a few times
so once it's downloaded you open it up
in any type of zip application yeah you
go to CSS this is the file that we want
to basically save to the CSS forwarded
that we created and so I just did that
off-screen and we can close this stuff
out or minimize it and now we see our
CSS file is in here if you have no clue
what this any of this means don't worry
we'll kind of get to that here tomorrow
and the next day so now what I want to
do is create a new file and you can do
all this you know remember you know in a
different HTML editor or notepad you
don't have to use this out and so this
is going to be our actual HTML file so
if I go to ctrl s to save we're gonna
save this just inside the HTML will call
this index dot HTM or inch DML whatever
alright so real quickly we are going to
write out some it's HTML but we're not
going to get into the actual body of it
yet we're just going to get the head
stuff done so basically the first tag
that we use is HTML classical's
though j/s and lank equals en if you
don't know what that means don't worry
uh-huh so now we have our head tag and
I'm just going to come down just to
close it and then we're gonna focus eye
on them in the middle so we have a
variety of things to do HTML this is a
first opening tag so you know it's
opened and it's not closed cuz we don't
have this down error yet but we're gonna
have some other things in here so inside
the HTML tag goes all of the HTML of
course
so the first tag that we usually use is
head and that will contain a variety of
things which we'll focus on today and
then inside after head comes the body so
we just do Bani for now and then body
here alright so this is a very basic
structure of kind of how HTML files
structured so we have a variety of
things up here and usually I will just
copy and paste this stuff I wouldn't be
sitting here typing each one hand by
hand but it's worth doing just for this
tutorial so made a charge that equals
utf-8
and I am going to include this this a
very basic file right here in the
project file so you don't have to type
this out I'm just doing this just
on-screen I'm going I am going to copy
this bit off-screen and these are all
necessary for our response it's young
and I we also have the title this is
basically on every every site you need
this is whatever shows up in the browser
title obviously so we'll just call this
iPhone breathalyzer close the title tag
man I'm screwing up alright so then we
have other meta tags you know I'll just
put these all together up here beta
equals name equals robots which are
basically search engine spiders you can
put nofollow if you don't want it to be
showing up in search engines and let's
see if there's anything else that we
want yes one thing that's absolutely
crucial is the viewport content equals
with Eagles D device with initial scale
equals one point zero and close that and
that is you know if you don't include
that the response of nature the design
won't work all right
and so then we have to link up our CSS
file so the HTML for that is link href
equals CSS forward slash and I think it
was 11 for you yeah okay CSS and let's
see here rel equals stylesheet type
equals text CSS and we are going to use
a Google web font so let me get up up
the browser here and if I just type in
my Google web fonts we'll go here to
this just google.com slash fonts type in
source because that's the name of it
source sans Pro right here and while
they're being loud down there all right
click on it you can click on over here
for quick use so you click on that and
then it allows you to specify the
different widths or wait wait it's not
with but waits for the font that you
want to use now remember the more you
include the longer load time because
this will actually require download so I
believe if we switch back to Photoshop
here we use the light here I think we
used light there I don't think we use
extra light anywhere usually I would
include I mean for this we could
actually get away with just one weight I
believe so
if need be we can come back and just add
it to so if we need a bold version which
I don't think we do so let's go back
here to yeah here
we're just changes to light and
automatically based on what you select
this code will update so we need to take
this copy it and then we'll go back to
our editor and just paste that in right
there ok and then let's see that I
believe is pretty much it and so now in
here is basically where we're going to
start with our HTML tomorrow so if we
save this and you know
I open that containing folder open that
with our browser we can see what it
looks like right now which is basically
nothing we just add our tot over here so
tomorrow we'll go ahead and start right
now at the HTML and I'll be able to
explain basically you know how we're
going to use this CSS to structure the
layout and there we go alright so check
out these nine course comm if you
haven't yet if you haven't yet subscribe
it here on YouTube please do so and I
will see you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
