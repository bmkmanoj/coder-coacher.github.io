go ahead and we're going to open up the
splash page that we did and so on lines
right here and basically we have three
different things going on in this image
and we have the background we have the
letter mark and then we have the board
mark now we want to save all of these
and condense them on to one layer and so
the way to do that first to preserve
what we have going here we'll select
these three layers hit ctrl G to group
them and then duplicate that group and
we'll hide the initial one and this one
we're going to merge so ctrl e and you
can also access that by right-clicking
and hitting I've merged layers so now
they're all merged onto the same layer
what we want to do is hit ctrl a and
then ctrl C and that copies everything
on it layer we'll go to file new we'll
hit OK and then pasted in now something
I don't like about this is the fact that
it did extend a hundred percent to 1080
for our width so I'm gonna go back here
real quick and the reason that happened
is because I want to take this eraser
tool it some of some of the pixels
extended beyond here and I just don't
want that so I what I'll do is just make
sure everything is off the sides and the
way we can verify that is by taking the
magic wand tool and just clicking out
here and so now we can see nothing is
extending to the edges so we'll just do
this again control a control C file new
and hit OK now we can see it's 984 and
then paste it in alright so with that I
selected basically what we want to do is
save this and remember I when I
mentioned what for about mdpi ldpi HD
PPI X X hdpi an xxhdpi this these are
terms that may be completely confusing
to you but just
for your reference we design this design
over here this resolution based on an
xxhdpi resolution and the that's first
newer smartphones that support that sort
of screen density and so we want to save
that in this this image right here in an
xxhdpi folder so we'll go to file save
for web and also I'm going to be using
this shortcut from now on after this to
access that menu and we can see here we
have I we want to specify transparent
PNG 24 and everything else is good to go
here and so we'll hit save and let me go
here one second
and I'm the modified project there we go
and we're going to create a new folder
and in this folder we're going to call
this one is xxxx hdpi
we're going to create another folder
called xhdpi another folder hdpi and
we're just gonna stick with those three
for now you can actually add actually I
think we'll add in one more mdpi or
medium screen density pixels and I yeah
those four are good so we're going to
save this particular image and we're
going to name it splash and hit save in
the xxhdpi folder so what we need to do
now is save another version of this
image so we're going to go to save for
web and down here where it says image
size and percentage we need to adjust
this by a factor of 66 percent so
sixty-six percent of this original image
will give us the scaling factor for the
next resolution down which is xhdpi so
66
now it got smaller you can see and so we
go into the xhdpi folder and this is
splash alright now it didn't scale this
size down I only did it when we went to
save her web for the copy we were going
to save so we could go here back to save
for web and for the next one which is
hdpi that is set at 33 or I'm sorry not
33 50 percent rather so the previous one
was 66 this one is going to be 50
percent and then the mdpi will actually
be I 33% all right so let's save we'll
go back into the HTTP I say this is
splash and then finally we'll do this
one more time file save for web or use
the shortcut this is going to be 33% it
was essentially 1 through the size of
the xxhdpi size and we'll save this as
splash so they're named all the same
alright so I'm going to go ahead and
close those out without saving of course
all right and now we have our main UI to
work with so what's going on here is we
have one to this background image right
here which is the diagonal pattern and
then three this button right here so we
have three images this text of course
will be put in dynamically so we have to
worry about that so I'm gonna hide that
text and I'm gonna start with quote fuel
so what we can do is select that layer
which is word mark control a control C
file new hit ok and then control V to
paste it in and it looks a lot bigger
than it was over there because we were
only scaled up at 45% view so now what
I'm going to do is save this
for web save come out here xxhdpi will
call this logo and will also come out
here in change this to 66% and this goes
in xhdpi logo save it again 50% and in
hdpi and then one more time at 33 and
come out here to mdpi alright so now we
have the button as well to worry about
the way we'll do the button so we have
two different states that we have to
scale down appropriately so what I want
to do is I'm going to group those up
control G and then duplicate it okay
well let's call this button so this is
our original here if we want to make
changes to that and then I'm going to
come over here and ungroup those and
what I want to do is merge these I are
flatten the layers so they control e
that takes the group takes it to one
layer and same thing with up here
control e so now we have two layers and
they should be exactly the same size so
control a control C on the up layer file
new it okay alright and we have to go
through that same process so instead of
you just sitting here watching me do
that remember just the scaling factors I
for xxhdpi or a hundred percent so you
don't have to worry about that for the
first time so if you save this real
quick xxhdpi
will call this one button up all right
and then again we have to go through
that same process of saving this for
each of the necessary sizes and
resolutions so xhdpi let's see here yep
not all right so go ahead I'm going to
pause this until I finish all these
because you don't really want to
necessarily see me do this so go ahead
and do that all the way through the mdpi
versions ok I've saved all of those the
remaining and now we have to do the same
thing for the downstate so we'll take
that ctrl a ctrl C and we'll just paste
it in right on top of that one and get
and hide this bottom one can sometimes
the pixels can I overlap and creating a
false image so make sure that's hidden
and we'll do the same thing again so
save this for web going back into xxhdpi
and we'll call this one button down and
do that again through all the other
necessary sizes all right in here I am
with the final one mdpi which is 33%
button down and save all right so then
finally I'm going to hide both of these
I'm also going to hide the top wordmark
just so we have this here in view and
what we want to do is for bg2 we want to
make sure again that I these don't touch
the edges same thing down here and here
okay so now if I take the magic wand
tool we can see that this is just a
selection in the center so now control a
control C file new hit OK
control V and then save for web and
again we have the same sort of issue
going on here that we're gonna have to
deal with so I will go ahead and save
this and actually you know what we could
do now that I'm thinking about it to
save space is ctrl shift and for a new
layer put it beneath it and give it a
black background
now here's what this is going to allow
us to do before this like when we had it
just like right here the size of this
image is 417 K and that's because we're
using a 24-bit PNG transparent if we
bring back this black background I mean
because we know our background is going
to be black no matter what we can save
this and we can now see even if we leave
it as transparent it's a hundred eighty
five K so it's a lot smaller I so
if we just go to png-8 and you could
turn off transparent that obviously
doesn't effect anything but go to png-8
that's 129 k and that'll just be fine a
lot better so I will come back up here
we'll call this I BG and then again go
through everything in saving them for
the other sizes as well so remember it's
66% and then 50 and then 33 all right
and now they are saved all right so I
just bring back our design here all
right so this is essentially again what
it's going to look like along with the
splash image and now we so now that
we've saved all of our necessary images
we can now proceed to the next lesson
which will involve getting Android
studio open and getting our splash page
and this page here I ready to go on the
layout all right so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
