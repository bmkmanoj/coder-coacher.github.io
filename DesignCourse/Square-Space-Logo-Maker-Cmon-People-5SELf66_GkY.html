logo maker now this has a designer
community kind of an uproar because they
believe that it could potentially take
away future business now whether or not
that's true that remains to be seen and
we probably won't ever know but it seems
as though people are kind of missing the
point let's look at the other hand
forget about the designers focus on the
clients now looking at this their logo
maker literally gives you a little bit
more over 30 different icons or symbols
to use and they give less than that in
terms of font selection now let's assume
for example you're starting a business
now whenever you start a business your
goal is to reach the top of your
industry no matter what nobody comes in
to the by creating a business with the
idea that they're going to become
mediocre now just imagine you actually
reach that and you have a logo produced
by the squarespace logo maker now you
have a logo that has been replicated
thousands of times likely so now you
have a major issue on your hands so
instead of using a square space logo
maker and you literally only have ten
dollars to invest in your business use a
site like fiverr com and try to find
somebody who is actually somewhat maybe
an aspiring designer that way you
increase your chances of having a logo
design that is not specifically
replicated thousands of times you will
increase your chances maybe by a little
bit that actually might be unique which
is the whole purpose of a logo
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
