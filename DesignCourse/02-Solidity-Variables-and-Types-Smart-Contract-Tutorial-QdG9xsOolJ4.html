to the second lesson that's a part of a
100% free course on developing and
deploying a theory of smart contracts
for beginners now in the first lesson we
just did a very brief rundown about what
a blockchain is and smart contracts
along with decentralized apps if you
haven't watched that just go back and
watch that first before continuing on
alright so what we're gonna do now is
step into the remix IDE now when it
comes to the remix IDE it's
browser-based but you can also
optionally install on your own machine
if you want we're not going to do that
we're just going to use the online
version which you can access at remix
etherium org now I'm going to switch
over to my browser and this is what
you're going to be presented with by
default they kind of have just some
boilerplate like a sample ballot
solidity file here this is a smart
contract and before we get rid of this
and start our own I just wanted to kind
of do a real quick outline of the
interface so on the left here we have
our files
none are here except for this default
one I over here in the middle section
this is where we actually write our code
in the editor down here this is where
the debugging occurs and over here we
have a bunch of different tabs and the
only ones that we're going to mess with
I just initially are the run and compile
tabs and so the one area did want to
describe if where we begin coding is the
environment section and we can see we
have by default the JavaScript VM that's
selected there's also two other ones so
by default we want to leave it at the
JavaScript VM or EVM which is stands for
a theory virtual machine but we will be
changing this later on in the course now
the JavaScript evm means that you will
run into pull your smart contracts
locally they are not live on the
etherion blockchain this is ideal when
we're learning about the absolute basics
because it's very quick and easy okay so
let's talk about smart contract basics
here so in the IDE we have this sample
contract we don't want it what we want
instead is to create a new one and we'll
name it course set row dot sol for
solidity you can name it whatever you
want actually so we'll hit okay alright
so we're gonna start off by writing the
following code we have in here pragma
solidity and then the caret and then the
version of solidity
all right so every let me increase this
just a bit make sure you guys can see
everything so basically every smart
contract we'll start off by defining the
version of solidity up there in that
format all right the next section create
a contract and we're going to name it
course set row alright so it looks very
similar to a JavaScript class alright so
right now we're not actually going to
run any code or write anything instead
right over here we're going to click on
this create button okay so a couple
things happen first this little blip
showed up as well as something occurred
down here and the debugger alright so
this means that the smart contract yes
it's not very smart at this point lives
at in address so we could see 0 X 6 9 to
here now if we want to see more details
we simply click on details right here
all right let me drag this up just a bit
alright so there's several things here
to note but most importantly we have a
contact address which is noted right
here this is where the smart contract
actually lives no again it's not live
right now on the etherion blockchain
because right now we're simply working
within this development javascript evm
also notice gasp right here alright so
gasp is the name for the execution fee
that senders of transactions in our case
are centers of a smart contract
transaction will pay for Varrick
verification so there's actually quite a
bit more I that probably sounded
confusing if you've never heard of it
before but I basically it's the name of
or for the execution fee that the
senders of transactions need to pay for
every operation made on an ethereum
blockchain so the name gas is inspired
by the view that this fee acts as a
crypto fuel driving the motion of smart
contracts so gas is purchased from ether
from miners that execute the code now
you can read more about this and that
was just a little excerpt from ether
Doc's org which will just describe gas
for you more specifically
alright so let's go ahead and define a
smart contract variable as well as a
type all right so obviously the most
simple concept in any language is a
variable now because solidity is
statically typed that is the type of the
variables must be defined before compile
time then you must specify the type of
the variable so let's define a string
variable in our contract so we're gonna
put in string so we put the type first
and then the name will just mean this F
name equals I'll just put my name Gary
all right so obviously very simple now
there are other types of variables so we
have a boolean variable which is
represented by B ool for bull we also
have an integer in unsigned integer
represented by int and uint also we have
address and the address type represents
a 20-byte value and that's meant to
store an aetherium address and these
address variables that are typed as
address also have members including
balance and transfer we'll see that
later also we have bytes 1 through 32
which are fixed size byte arrays we also
have bytes which are for dynamic sized
byte arrays we also have string which
is for a dynamically signed string
mapping and these are hash tables with
key types and value types and we're
going to look at that more in a later
lesson
and then also struct instruct allows you
to define new types again we're going to
go over that in a different lesson as
well now let's also define my age all
right so no one can have a negative age
so we will use an unsigned integer for
this you int age equals 34 all right so
let's go ahead and hit create you can
see we have a new a brand new contract
that showed up beneath here now at this
point if you look under details for
instance it's not going to show you
anything here in terms of my name or age
all right so this is where public and
private visibility comes into play so
solidity has four types of visibility
for both functions and variables so
first we have public and this allows you
to define functions or variables that
can be called internally or through
messages we also have private so private
variables and functions are only
available to the current contract and
not derived contracts we also have
internal and these are functions and
variables that can only be accessed
internally or which is the current
contract or derived contracts and don't
worry when I talk about derived you'll
understand that later and then also
external so functions that can be called
from other contracts in transactions but
they can't be called internally except
with this dot function name all right so
let's add a public visibility to our
variables way we do this we simply put
in public public here and let's go ahead
and hit create ok so now we could see
that we have two of these blue buttons
down here and these also represent the
names of the variables now when you
define public state variables the evm
creates getter functions for them so you
can actually click on these buttons and
we'll see down here
we have the debugger going here because
these are separate calls so again it
creates these functions as if you can
just call them in a we return the value
for you okay
so let's also talk about the smart conch
contract constructor so every smart
contract has a constructor function so
this constructor is called when a
contract is created so inside of it you
can define the values of variables and
do other things so for instance if we
want to create a constructor function
which will execute when this contract is
created we simply define it by function
and then always has to be the name of
your contract okay so in our case it's
course set row and then here alright so
we'll see this little I error show up
this didn't use to show up or it's a
warning rather if you want that to go
away we have to define a visibility on
the function okay so now if we were to
remove the actual values we can define
them here by saying F name equals Geary
and age equals 34 all right so if we hit
create
we'll see it works exactly the same way
alright let's also talk about constant
variables so variables can be declared
as being constant in that they cannot be
changed so once you've set them you the
AVM will error and you'll see it in the
debug in such a way that will not let
you try to update that value anymore so
let's transform the F named variable to
a constant variable so the way we'll do
this is we now change this from public
to constant and we have to set the value
here all right so we can see we have
this X right here and if we try to
create it it's going to error it will
not work so what we'll do in order to
fix that is get rid of that here now we
can create it
and we'll see down here it only just
returns the age at this point all right
so let's also talk now about setting
variables at this point we've only
established just defining variables
manually but let's see what it takes to
actually set a variable all right so
let's integrate a potential user
interaction where we can manually define
through like a text field the course
instructors name and age as we've been
working with okay to do this we're going
to make some adjustments we're going to
make a string of fname and also a
unsigned integer of age next we don't
need a constructor function right now at
this point so I'm going to get rid of it
I'm gonna type in function set
instructor and it's going to take in our
two different parameters for a name and
age so this will be a string of f name
and then unsigned integer of age inside
of here we're going to bind f name to
the URL parameter that's passed in and
also age to our age next we'll create
this get instructor function now this is
going to be public it's a constant and
it returns a value of type string and of
a type unsigned integer all right so now
we're going to return our f name proper
variable rather that was set up there
and age okay so now let's go ahead and
hit create and now we can see down here
we have this red area which means we can
actually input data so this would
simulate if you had a user interface
like on a website for instance a text
field so what we'll put in here is first
we need to specify any type of string
value has to be encased in quotes so you
can't just put Geary for instance so the
first parameter is the name Gary or
yours or whatever and then the next is
an integer of an age
so if we click on set instructor you can
see something happened over here there
was a state change because we updated
these variables so if we click on get
instructor there we go
now says Gary and h-34 all right so
hopefully you were able to learn a lot
there because I did go through quite a
bit but still things are really simple
at this point which is how they should
be when you're learning something new so
in the next video we're going to step
outside of solidity just for a bit so
that we can actually connect this very
smart contract right here to a web-based
user interface where we will be able to
call our two different functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
