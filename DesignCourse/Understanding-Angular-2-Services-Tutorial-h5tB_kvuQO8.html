comm and today we're going to take a
look at angular 2 services so what is a
service does it mean you're going to
become an entrepreneur and create a
service for people no it simply means
it's referenced to JavaScript functions
and their associated methods that you
can import into your angular 2
components to be able to be used ok so
let's go ahead and switch over real
quickly and this time we're going to use
the github angular QuickStart and we're
going to clone it through get so I
already did a video on how to do this
explicitly so if you need a refresher
just refer back to an earlier video in
this series so I'm going to copy this
line right here and by the way just
access the URL up here or just go to
google and type in angular 2 QuickStart
github and now let's go to our command
line here and I'm in my projects folder
and right click and paste and we're just
going to call this services - project
and hit enter alright and then we're
going to go ahead and CD into services -
project and then type in NPM install at
which point this we've got to take a
little bit time so I'm going to pause
and I'll come right back
alright and it is done so I'm going to
switch back here I'm going to type in
MPM start it's going to create a light
server here and we go here to our
browser it'll open this up alright and
it's good to go alright so now let's go
ahead open up our code editor I'm using
Visual Studio code which is a free code
editor for Microsoft and I'm in our
projects folder so it's good app folder
and then create a new file called
example dot service TS ok so here's how
we create a service first we're going to
import what's called an injectable so
import injectable from angular core
then we add the injectable decorator
that's step two and we don't end it with
a semicolon and then the step three is
to export the class and we'll call this
example service all right so that's the
three steps we import the injectable
member from the angular core library we
add the injectable decorator and then we
export the class okay or the service
rather all right so now inside of here
let's just create a very simple method
and remember if you know anything about
JavaScript which hopefully you do if
you're watching this a function inside
of a class is basically a method just
it's a function essentially though so
what we want to specify is just really
simple one we're going to make up one
some method and we'll open this up we're
going to return just a string type so
return hey exclamation point that's it
so if you made it this far
congratulations you just created your
very first service very exciting I know
so let's go ahead and save this and now
let's go ahead and use this inside of
our app component TS that's currently
our only component so we need to import
that class that we just created so
import and that's going to be example
service from angular core earned out I
was looking at the top line sorry same
folder and this is example dot service
so we just imported this class or the
service from our file that we just
created now we have to add it into
providers property of the component
decorator metadata so it's at a period
or a comma there and add providers and
then open up an array example service
and that's step two so step one import
the service and then step two add it
into providers here in the component
decorator step three we have to now
inject it through what's called
dependency injection now I know calm
down I know it's very
but don't worry you'll see how this
works so we inject it through what's
called the constructor now that is a
default method of the class which is out
component that's executed whenever the
class is instantiated and basically
ensures proper initialization of the
fields in the class and its subclasses
okay if it's still confusing and you're
new to this well and that's because it's
going to be mean but once we start
working with it you'll understand
and you'll internalize it and all will
be good so the way we do this is we
specify constructor and then we open up
here in the arguments this is where the
dependency injection occurs so we
specify a private variable and just a
good convention for naming convention of
private variables is to underscore the
name and then camelcase which means the
very first letter of the name of the
function is not I capitalized basically
example and then service and then we put
a cool n which references now this
example service up here and then we open
it up in the curly braces now we don't
put anything inside of here what we're
going to do instead is reference this
through the ng on a knit lifecycle hook
now I haven't yet covered this in the
series so you understand what this means
a little bit more down the line but
basically ng on a knit is a lifecycle
hook called by angular 2 that indicates
that angular has been done creating the
components so you know if is in our case
since we only have one component when
the browser loads it up and app is
loaded and the component is done loading
it's going to immediately execute
anything that's inside of ng on the net
so ng on an it and this is where we put
our code so what are we going to do with
it well let's say for example we wanted
to use our example service to add in
this string right here as a title in our
h1 HTML tag so we'll put over here
through interpolation interpolation and
then specify a variable called title so
let's define title outside of ng on in
it and this is through typescript so
title and of type string and then we
reference it through this dot title
which is reference to this variable here
equals and then this dot example service
which is defined right here in the
constructor and then we access the
method and we can see it shows up right
here some method that's what we named it
alright so let's go ahead and save that
and let's see what happens there it goes
Hey
all right so that's how you create it
and use a service now let me show you
just one more thing so if we go back
here
we can see that we've included our
service directly from within this
component but what let's say for example
you create a service that you want
multiple components to be able to access
well we can include it instead of adding
it in the metadata here of our component
and the providers property let's go
ahead and remove this let's save that
and by the way if we save it you'll see
we'll get an error we look at the
console it says no provider for example
service we can go to our app module TS
and we can add it right here so example
service we have to import it let's go
back up here and just copy this real
quickly and now that error goes away we
can save it and now it shows up there so
the difference is now that it's been
added in our app module ng module
decorator here we know
longer have to include it in the
component metadata however we do still
have to import it as a member up here at
the top of the file in whichever
component we want to be able to use it
for all right so hopefully you learned a
lot about services obviously the very
basic example however down the road
we're going to get more in depth and
more complex when we use services all
right I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
