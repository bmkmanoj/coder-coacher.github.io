course comm and today is January 18th
with our 18th video of the year and we
are going to take a look at a new tool
in Adobe Photoshop CC which is an update
that you can download from Creative
Cloud and it's called the perspective
warp so the perspective warp tool is
really cool it allows you to change the
perspective of certain images and it's
really useful for photo manipulations
and compositing so of course we're gonna
use Adobe Photoshop CC in this tutorial
and if you need access to the original
or end result the file that is available
for free in the description below we're
going to use two images that are
available for free from deviantART and
those are also linked ok so let's get
started
all right so to get started I go ahead
and click on the resource the first
resource link below this video in the
description here in YouTube and you'll
get this image right here made by this
person right here so click on download
and we'll right click and copy image if
you're using a browser that doesn't
allow you to save it to your desktop and
then open it up in Photoshop
so I'm gonna switch to Photoshop here
I'm gonna go to file new and we'll call
this perspective warp and ctrl V to
paste that in alright so I'm just going
to work in I block it in white so we're
just going to desaturate that and then
we're going to click on the other link
here in the description to get this
house
alright so let's say we're for example
we wanted to do some compositing or
photo manipulation and we want this
house to look like it's a part of that
image so we'll go ahead and download
this one right click copy and we'll go
to Photoshop and I'm gonna go to file
new I'm not going to paste that directly
in there just yet I want to cut this
house out real quickly so I'm not going
to spend a lot of time trying to get it
perfect but just to get started take
your pen tool go to path make sure it
passes selected and we'll just start
clicking down real quickly and I'm gonna
leave some of the brush here so I'm just
going to go outside of the house and
we'll continue it up for right around
here
and I'm just very quickly going around
this house
almost done and done okay so right click
make selection hit okay and copy that
and then we'll paste it in alright so
what if you know I wanted to have this
image for whatever reason I don't know
why it would be right here a part of
this so we could see that the angle that
this building is shot out is different
than this and to illustrate that real
quickly we'll go ahead and I'll take the
just the rectangle tool just make a long
line real quickly ctrl T and we'll show
that the that the angle that this
building this side of the building is
following the path and it is roughly
right there so if we take this image
down here and move it we can see that
this side of the house follows a path
that's more like this so this would be
the perfect usage for the perspective
warp tool so we'll hit ctrl T I'm going
to scale this down just a bit so we can
see the whole thing so if it were to
start here leave that right there
hit apply we're going to go to image
adjustments desaturate that real quick
now what I want to do I'm gonna save a
backup so this is going to be called the
original we're gonna duplicate that and
I'm just gonna hide this and then I'm
going to go ahead and go to admin or
edit rather prospective warp I'm gonna
zoom up actually gonna hit don't apply
yet zoom up first and do that so we'll
go to edit perspective warp and I'm just
gonna draw a square around this portion
of the house and I'm gonna leave it
right there for now and then I take a
second one now you see that how these
got an outer kind of a blue color that
means those are going to be joined so
I'm just going to end it right around
here and then I'm going to situate these
to follow the actual shape of the house
alright that looks pretty decent and
then once you're done go ahead and hit
warp so now we can actually warp this
thing to the angle to the desired angle
which would be right around here so
we'll take this one down
all right so I'm not even really minding
what's in here I'm just taking a look at
these points to make sure that they seem
to go on a pretty equal path based on
this building once you're ready go ahead
and hit the move tool and select apply
and now you can see how it automatically
changed the perspective of this house
without really any type of noticeable
destruction or damage to the actual
house itself into pixels so if we let's
go ahead and zoom out real quick
oops not on a percent rather fit on
screen and now if we hide this we can
see that this much this looks much
better than this so let me go ahead and
real quick just for the fun of it
make this look like it's a little bit
more part of the scene so I'm just gonna
take the eraser tool real quickly
and then we can use the clone stamp tool
select the original image and I'll
select maybe around here click on on our
original oops go back here and select
over here and then if we hide this we'll
click right here and bring this back
oops going original
let me get back over here oops
keep on doing that sorry about that
alright so that looks a lot better than
what it originally did so let me just
zoom out here and what I want to do is
go ahead and take this image right here
and then we'll go ahead and duplicate
this except we'll have this image just
so we can show a side-by-side comparison
so if we go to image canvas size and the
width will just double basically I'll
just change this from 45 to 90 and we'll
push it out to the left all right so we
have the I want to take these two and
just duplicate them
all right so we will call this the
original and am i doing here yeah that's
that stays there and this one will be
here all right so now we can see side by
side just how effective the warp tool or
the perspective warp tool can can be and
making adjustments that would really
help in photo manipulation and
compositing all right so as always visit
