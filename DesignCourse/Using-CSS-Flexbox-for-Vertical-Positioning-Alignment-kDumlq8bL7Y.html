cetera comm and today I'm going to show
you how to structure this layout using
flexbox property I'm doing this because
I recently started working on somewhat
of a similar layout for parent although
in nowhere near as ugly and I have some
difficulties getting the positioning
correct and mainly I'm talking about
this text input field at the bottom and
making sure it stays at the bottom of
the browser and this overflow scrolling
div here extending all the way and
filling up the necessary space so I'll
be taking you one step at a time
through the creation of this layout and
hopefully in the end you will have a
good understanding of how to use flexbox
in the future especially with vertically
positioning items so let's get started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're going to find a bunch
of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost of buying me
like expect each month that did now also
it probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe
here on YouTube and be sure to make sure
the notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it now because it says
solely a CSS tutorial I'm not going to
bother setting up some sort of robust
development environment with unnecessary
bells and whistles instead we're just
going to create two files in a single
folder so I've created a folder here
it's empty and I'm using Visual Studio
code by the way which is free from
Microsoft and I'm going to create an
index.html right here and also you can
follow along with the written tutorial
which is linked in the very first line
to the description here in YouTube and
you can just copy this initial
boilerplate for HTML right here so we'll
go ahead and save that I'm going to
create another file we're going to call
that style CSS and because as we can see
it's linked right here as style.css and
we're going to leave that empty just for
now so the first thing we're going to do
is define a two-column flexbox layout so
basically I'm not going to be bother
using any type of CSS framework for this
like you know bootstrap or Balma or
foundation instead we're just going to
keep the
simple and custom so in index.html the
first thing we'll do is within the body
tags of course we're going to put two
divs so the first one is going to be
sidebar and the next one will give it a
div of class content all right we'll
save and great so now in our style dot
CSS we're going to reference the body
element and I'm going to get rid of any
default margin font family will make
Arial and then we're also going to put
in display flex and we're going to make
the body element the flexbox container
itself we're also going to added flex
direction row and that means any
children within the body tag which is
pretty much any HTML essentially I will
be situated in rows as opposed to
columns so we could also change this to
columns for instance if we wanted the
columns to stack all right so next we're
going to reference our sidebar and we're
going to put the background grey just so
we can see things with will make just
15% and padding 1 a.m. next we have our
content and here the background will be
light gray and the width will course be
85% ok so let's go ahead and save and
visit the file in our browser the
index.html will see that we have our
columns here and is how the height of
the column fills the browser review port
now what we wanted to add a horizontal
navigation header above these columns
right here at the top will it still work
well let's see let's go ahead to our
index.html and I'm just going to real
quickly copy and paste in just some
initial HTML here for our header and our
unordered list and we can see that it
consists just of a header element and an
unordered list
element with three links okay
so let's save this and we'll go back
real quickly to the browser to see what
has happened all right so that's
obviously not what we want this is
happening of course because header is a
child of body which will align all
children as a row right next to each
other so to fix this let's go ahead and
modify our HTML and CSS just a bit so
when it comes to our div class of
sidebar and content what we want to do
is wrap them in their own div and give
it a class of wrapper alright great so
now after that lets go to our style CSS
and we're going to reference our wrapper
and we're simply going to move these two
properties inside of there alright next
let's go ahead and style up our menus so
it's not a vertical menu and I'm just
going to paste some initial rule sets
here just because they are not really
relevant to this we are using however a
Flex container on the unordered list
element which will mean any children
within it such as the LI the list item
elements will now have a flex direction
of Rho which means they will write a
line I justify content is also we have
Flex end which will push it to the very
right side of the browser so now if we
save this and we go back to our browser
we'll find that our header now works as
we wanted to but the height of the
columns no longer extends to the bottom
of the browser so why is that well
initially these two columns their parent
was simply the body element so if we get
out the inspector we click on body we'll
see that by default it extends to a
hundred percent of the browser so
now their parent happens to be div class
of rapper and it doesn't it's a custom
class so we have to add a height
property so let's go ahead back and
we'll go back up to rapper and we're
going to have height 100 VH as in a
viewport height so if we save this will
see that it has now worked however look
just over here we have this very
annoying unwanted scrollbar well that's
because we have to subtract the height
of the header element from the height
property of rapper so going back up here
or down here rather what's reference
header and I'm going to give it a
definitive height of 60 pixels and I
didn't just kind of pull this out of my
ass I didn't basically got out the
inspector I work within the CDSs to make
sure it's pretty consistent with the
current height as it is by default and
then we come up to rapper we're going to
use calc to take 100 viewport height and
we subtract 60 pixels so now if we save
and go back refresh it goes away and you
see everything will work as expected
awesome so now let's say for example
that this is a chat app and in the
content container right here we want to
add an element to display chat messages
and at the very bottom always aligned to
the bottom of the viewport a text area
not a text field but maybe just an input
type of text all right so to do that
what we'll do is come back over here
into our HTML and this is where we want
to work usually a sidebar would have
some type of menu or whatever we're not
going to mess with that
and we're going to add just two
different divs i1 is going to be a chat
container
and the one inside of it is going to be
divided e of chat this will actually
hold the chat messages themselves and
secondary would be the input type of
text and we'll give it a place order
value of chat here okay so what we're
going to do is save this and let's look
at the result as it stands just here
initially alright so we don't see any
type of messages going back because I
kind of just forgot that I'm going to
paste in just some filler lorem ipsum
text it just gives us a few paragraphs
or a few sentences to work with okay so
obviously we need to work with this in
our CSS file to get this fixed up as
needed
so first we'll reference our chat
container so the reason I used two
different divs to do this is because
chat container is going to be a new Flex
container similar to how we did it with
the body tag and the wrapper tag also
the unordered list and we're going to
set the Flex direction this time to
column and that's because we're
vertically stacking this chat messages
which happens to be the chat ID and then
also the input so to do that we're going
to put in Flex Direction is a column
display Flex of course min height will
be a hundred percent and we'll make the
color of the chat messages gray next we
have our chat container we want to do
extend all the way across we're going to
add flex one and this is very important
overflow Y will be scroll give it some
padding and box sizing will be border
box and this happens to fix an issue
with I D scrollbar so then input type
will be 'text put that in there and with
100%
ten pixels so let's save this and go
back and refresh all right awesome I'm
going to real quickly just copy and
paste a bunch of times or shift alt and
down and save this just to simulate what
it would actually look like in a real
chat message context I'll move the
browser around we'll see that the footer
stays no matter what and there we go
alright guys so hopefully you were able
to learn quite a bit
I just realized a really explain what
this guy did if we remove this and go
back and refresh we'll see it goes all
the way down and it completely breaks
the layout and that's why I said adding
that flex property to one was really
important when basically adding that
property let's go back and just fix that
real quick
adding to flex one property means that
basically let all the items or the
children be the same length so since
we're only applying it to one of the two
children not the input down here it will
take up the entire space minus the
height of this input so just to
demonstrate this if we were to take flex
one and add it on to our input which is
also a child of the flexbox container up
here and we go back and refresh we'll
see it takes up equal space right here
which we obviously don't want we only
want that for the messages we only want
it to take up as much space as it needs
to all right so again just to fix that
and removing it there we go all right so
hopefully you learned a lot
check check out course tetro calm for a
lot of other front-end and also even
back-end development tutorials and
courses i'm gary simon once again
that'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
