hello gears Simon here of design course
calm today we're going to stick with
unity and we're going to spread this out
over three or four days and we're going
to be designing an interesting sort of
metal looking room with a logo the
design course comm logo you can make it
your own if you have one spinning in the
middle and so the purpose of this is
just to gain more experience learning
new techniques and so obviously this in
a game environment doesn't really make
sense but you could still take what you
learn and apply it in an actual sense so
basically today we're going to be
focusing on just doing some very basic
modeling and UV unwrapping in blender
and then tomorrow we'll move on to
photoshop material and setting that up
and actually designing everything and
then the final day we'll be working the
unity alright so if you need access the
project files you can go ahead and
download at design course comm they're
free as always and if you haven't yet
subscribed here at YouTube alright so
let's get started alright so basically
if you've never used blender I of course
it's free so you can download it at
blender.org and once you have it opened
up this is the basic to fall seniors
presented with right-click to select
objects and if you want to move around
in the viewport you'll hold your middle
mouse button or third mouse button and
if you want to zoom up use your scroll
wheel if you want to pan shift in that
third mouse button as well alright so
that's all I'm gonna going to you know
initially just get into it before we
begin so I what I want to do is we're
gonna delete the camera we don't need
that just hit the Delete key and we'll
keep that just for the heck of it and so
what we want to do is take this cube we
don't need it so we're gonna delete that
as well
hit enter alright so basically so
another note if you've been following
you know for a few months and you
downloaded blender before they came out
with a new version of 2.7 so there's a
couple changes here so if you want to
download that it's only like 50 make so
you might as well alright so the first
thing we're going to start with is the
actual room
and so I am going to hit shift a and
that's the same thing as going to add
and you know add mesh so that's what I'm
going to do from now on so when I add an
object I'm hitting shift an a and I'm
going to choose a cylinder now when you
choose a cylinder over here is the
amount of sides that you have basically
so I want to take that down to 16 all
right so if i zoom up we can see that
and then I'm what I want to do is size
it down scale it down on the z zet
access so we hit the S key for scale and
then hit Z and then we can flatten a
little bit I'd say roughly right around
there all right and then what I want to
do is go into edit mode so object mode
you can move and scale objects and all
that stuff but when you go to edit mode
what you can do that in here or hit tab
as I'm going to do from now on you have
the option of selecting the and
manipulating the object in three
different ways the vertex selection by
default right here there versus we see
we have the sides and then we have faces
all right so what we want to do is hit a
that will deselect all and hitting it
again will select all so you can toggle
back and forth hitting a make sure it's
all selected what we want to do is the
next step is very important because when
we go to import this later on in unity
we won't be able to see it correctly if
we don't do this next step so in 2.7 we
go to this little tab over here and we
put four normals flip direction
so basically when it comes to being able
to view this in unity we'll be able to
view it from inside of here because
otherwise if you don't do that step you
import it and everything would be
invisible once you're inside instead we
would see everything outside of it but
our character is going to be in here so
very important
some nation you know take note of if
you're actually constructing a room that
you will be inside now if it comes to
creating an object you know like a chair
or far up crate or something you don't
have to do this step of course okay so
now I what I want to do is separate the
top and the bottom and the reason for
this is when we go to do the UVs we're
basically we want two different
documents to work with when it comes to
photoshop and working with these so
you'll see what I mean I'm not going to
sit here trying to explain everything so
basically to do this to make it easier
to see everything we can switch from
solid to wireframe and now we could see
the center of this face right here at
the top has that dot right there and we
can right-click that and also make sure
you're in face mode and then we see the
center of the bottom run right here hold
shift and left or right click rather and
hit the P key and this will separate
this top and bottom we'll call them the
ceiling in the floor by selection so it
looks like it kind of just hid but it
didn't really it's still there but if we
go into the object mode hitting tab we
can now select the top and bottom and
this as well as a side so if we hit I
tab just selecting these sides and hit a
it's only selecting them not this kind
of important all right so what we need
to do now for these I guess you could
call them walls I we have to drag this
out left click and drag and we'll change
this over here the view to UV image
editor and we want to click new and we
want to make the width and height two
zero four eight so we're going to
multiply by two basically and if you
ever want to multiply something you
could just hit x two and it'll get you
there automatically all right so now
what we want to do is leave everything
else the same hit okay
and then we can zoom out here with our
scroll wheel and now that we have
everything selected we need to UV unwrap
this
so to unwrap it you have several
different ways of unwrapping it and so
unwrapping it basically means I
constructing it and displaying it on
this canvas which will eventually be
brought into Photoshop and there's
different ways so if we hit you and just
hit unwrap we see that it gives us this
this shape right here which is kind of
strange if we hit you and we go to smart
UV okay it's a little bit different
things are still waiting it doesn't
really make sense if we hit you and we
go to well this is a cylinder right so
if we hit cylinder projection it's still
not cool because it's like all warped
and stuff so if we hit you again we do
project from view well whatever is
currently in view here is what its gonna
show here and this is a problem when it
comes to actually trying to apply a
texture so if you hit you again and we
go to cube projection I found that that
seemed to work best and so real quickly
you want to make sure I have everything
selected so some of these faces are
actually overlapping each other but
that's okay so what I want to do is over
here hit a oops there we go a and that
will select everything and I'm gonna hit
s and Z or Y rather sorry and just scale
them down a little bit all right and
then I'm going to hit a to deselect and
hit B and this is kind of like the lasso
to unfold Photoshop and just left click
and select those hit g4 move and then
hit X to make sure it goes on basically
over here and then we can go and take
hey and then a again hit s to scale down
just a little bit hit G and we'll stick
it right around there all right so yeah
that is all is required for UV
unwrapping this so when we go to take
this into Photoshop what we need to do
first is go to image and then save as
image all right so I paused and I just
switched over to an actual project
folder and basically I if we come down
here we can see our options you want to
make sure that you have okay I messed up
gonna hit cancel I meant to go you v's
export UVA layout cuz that stuff wasn't
showing up because I did the wrong thing
so let me I go back to my project folder
you want to make sure all UV is selected
and we can use PNG that's fine and the
fill opacity is at 25% what that means
is for the UVs it's going to make that
layer 25 percent opacity it's fine so
we'll save this as wall - UV - layout
export it and now we got to do the same
thing for the ceiling basically in the
floor so let's hit tab to go to object
mode right click the top ceiling portion
and then go ahead and hit tab to go into
edit mode hit a and then we're gonna go
to image a new image leave everything
the same and now it looks like it's UV
unwrapped because what we want to do
though is go to hit 5 on your number pad
that basically takes you into
orthographic mode makes it easier to
kind of see things and work with it
hitting v again will toggle to
perspective which is what it actually
looks like but go to 5 and then hit 7
and that's the way you switch to the top
view you can also hit one for front
three for right hitting control one will
get you to the left
control 7 gets to from the bottom view
and then control one gets to the back of
you just a quick tip all right so let's
hit 7 and what we want to do is hit you
and let's see what happens if we just
you know we have everything selected if
we just hit unwrap all right
basically it's very simple it has the
top and bottom eye and what we want to
do is just move them over so the way we
can do that is select the by
right-clicking the top here hit G oops
hit a and then G and then X and we'll
put up right here and then also kind of
move it down a little bit away from the
edges and then take the bottom hit a G
and move that up so now if we hit a a
everything is the lining pretty good we
could probably make them larger but we
don't need to on there I fine right
there all right so now what we need to
do is this time do it correctly export
uv8 layout damn it why does it keep on
doing that all right and then we're
gonna do I I'll just call this no hands
are in the wrong place floor ceiling UV
- layout all right
export and there we go
all right so now what we need to do is
to get the logo in alright so I let me
load up Adobe Illustrator and get that
project file out I'm gonna pause real
quick alright so this is the logo and
you can download this at the project
files at design course comm for this
video and basically this is an adobe
illustrator logo ai it's a vector and
it's a real important day yeah if you
have a logo it better be vector but yeah
basically when it comes to importing a
sort of like a logo or any type of
illustration or whatever into a blender
I you need to save it as a SVG so we go
to file
save as sorry I cut myself off there I
think and I basically just go to SV save
it as an SVG file right here
and we'll save that basically everything
can be left kind of like this as it is
hit okay all right so then what we want
to do is go back to blender we'll go to
object mode alright and we'll put this
over here temporarily and now what we're
going to do is go to file import and
that is why am I not seeing it there it
is okay SVG so go back here import it
now it's like okay where the hell is the
thing well whenever imports logos
sometimes it's really small for some
reason so if I look in here oh you know
what I think I had a layer that was
hidden so that's why this thing shown up
I just right-click and delete it we'll
get rid of it as well because these
stupid things on one second there we go
now if you select this get out of here
real quick and we hit s and we scale
this thing up a lot and then also if we
go over here to set origin right now it
has the origin point over here so we
want it to be the center of the object
so go to set origin origin to geometry
right there all right
and
you know what's really sure why that
happened but that's no big deal so it's
kind of like an issue but it's not an
issue really all right so I basically
now what we want to do is go ahead and
hit r for rotate X and then hit ninety
four ninety degrees and hit enter all
right so we get this over here and then
we want to do is I'm going to move this
over here real quick pull this out so
that we can see curve and then we want
to extrude it a little bit so as you can
see it's automatically extruded the logo
I'd say that's pretty good around there
which is zero point zero zero seven and
you don't really want to mess with out
like adding depth or whatever and
offsetting it because it's gonna add a
lot more geometry in vs. so when it
comes to games that's not a good thing
generally so what we want to do now is
take this and hit alt and C so this is
really important because right now it's
not really considered to mesh so if we
do that we'll see that that option went
away we can't really mess with the
extrude or whatever so now if we hit tab
you could see has a lot of a geometry
here so basically when it comes to
texture in this we're not not in terms
of messing with it in Photoshop or
anything because it would be really
difficult to UV unwrap this but we still
have to unwrap it so what we'll do is
bring this back we're gonna hit a to
select all over here we're gonna go to
well it doesn't really matter we don't
need to do a new image because we're not
working with this and Photoshop will be
will be applying a material to it but
that'll be in unity so what we'll do is
just hit you and then unwrap and then
this garbage over here comes up so all
right I now what I want to do is
basically get this will join these areas
so if you come over here right click
join area and you can either you know
choose which one you want to go
fullscreen go over here just left click
once all right so now these are two
separate objects but they'll get
imported together
in unity you know if we go to I let's
see here the object mode got a wireframe
we can kind of see where it's at but it
doesn't matter because we'll be able to
select this individually and position it
in unity all right so that is basically
it for this kind of you know obviously
we didn't do too much modeling or
anything but yeah I'm just kind of
slowly working my way you know through
these tutorials you know this is almost
2nd unity tutorial and I eventually
we're gonna get more complex and do
cooler stuff but this is still pretty
cool we're gonna make this rotate in
unity and just make it look like a
really cool scene so yeah that is it for
today tomorrow we're going to go ahead
and work in Photoshop and get in
everything textured the ceiling the
floor in these side panels basically and
so yeah check out design course if you
haven't it's on course calm rather and
just subscribe here on YouTube
alright I'll see you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
