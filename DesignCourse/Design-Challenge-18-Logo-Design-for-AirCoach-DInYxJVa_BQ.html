course calm and this is the design
challenge number eighteen and we're
going to do another logo design for a
fictional company called air coach
alright so the objective here is to
design a logo for this air coach company
and it's basically a new company that
gives customers skydiving lessons all
right so that's the only information
that we have to go on and so here are
the requirements only include air coach
no other words we don't want it slogan
or anything you may use air coach in all
capital or lowercase or any other
variations of upper and lower case that
you think are necessary all right you
can include a symbol if you wish or you
can just keep it as a word mark with
meaning only the type and making some
unique adjustments on the type itself
and then also new provide a brief
explanation behind the concept or in
other words explain why designed what
you design so I never really require
this before but I think it would help
just to get maybe a sentence or two from
each submission that would help let me
and others know you know why you
designed what you designed or what the
thought process behind it was and then
as always make sure it's at least 500 x
500 pixels included a good amount of
white space between the logo and outer
edges of documents so if you're going to
make a 500 x 500 make sure the logos
with isn't like 450 I mean make it
something make maybe even half this
amount so that it's centered in the
middle of the document and just not
stretched out all the way to the full
form container here and then the
submission deadline is simply a week
from today and that would be Monday
January 26 at 12 p.m. eastern standard
time and then usually I'll link some
inspiration here but I decided you know
just for logo design I we can this is a
pretty good site that shows pretty good
logo design so you know you want to know
what a good logo is you know you can
check out some of these examples and
that is it so make sure you subscribe

goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
