calm today is februari 15th and I wanted
to put out a video here that's a little
bit different I then just regular design
work this is something that a lot of
creative freelancers face and that is
procrastination I so basically I got
again this idea first stumbled on this
idea from stefan molyneux of freedomain
radio and you put out a video about the
roots of procrastination and it's
something that resonated with me so much
that I would really wanted to kind of
just reiterate it a little bit and going
to gear it towards my audience so
basically where does procrastination
come from alright so two systems usually
I parenting you know basically how you
were raised and also school so most of
us unfortunately had to undergo the
public education system for 12 years and
there are two parallels when it comes to
parenting and education so basically
when it comes to parenting you have the
parent up here and you have the child
down here it's a hierarchy of in a sense
that we create as a society and we
believe that whatever the parent says
the child must do and that's kind of how
it is largely deal throughout the world
and in the same way when it comes to
public education you have the teachers
and the faculty up here and then down
here you have the students and the
students are to obey them and listen to
what they say because they're the
teachers and that's the you know that's
it so when it comes to all the busy
homework when you just got to do it
right and I can tell you with certainty
I'm 30 now and it's been 12 years since
I've I graduated high school you
ninety-seven ninety-eight percent of
everything that you were forced to learn
or memorize and then forget you either
just forget it in you don't use it
alright so much in the same way when it
comes to parenting and I have two
daughters I'm trying my best not to do
this when it comes to parenting well
it's a belief that there must be blind
obedience
and you must do what your parents say
and that's that just for that alone it's
ridiculous really if you think about it
so what happens is from very early
childhood from day one practically and
all the way through you know when you're
arbitrarily considered to be an adult in
a free person you're conditioned to do
things that you aren't internally
motivated to do and so much in the same
way when it comes to slavery you have
the master up here and you have the
slave down here he performs the work but
it's not very good and it's against his
will and so there are so many different
parallels between those three things in
societies and what happens throughout
those 18 years is you develop
unfortunately a reaction a negative
reaction every time that you are to do
something and what's really unfortunate
about it is even if that something is
going to be productive or good for you
and your life you have this immediate
inherent sort of push back struggle it
you don't want to do it and that's
really what procrastination is and
that's really how it starts and it's
formulated it's not something you're
born with when it comes to nature versus
nurture it's definitely your environment
it's the nurture and that's a good thing
because if you were we're all just born
procrastinators or certain people who
are just born being a procrastinator you
can't change it so here's the thing you
can't change it and the way that I kind
of helped are not help rather but I kind
of overcome my problem of
procrastination was simply watching that
video and then just letting it resonate
because once you understand that it's
not a permanent fix journey of life
that's when you will become naturally
internally motivated to do things that
you know will be good for you so when it
comes to designers or freelancers you
know that's going to be good for you to
learn new things so watching these
videos that's great you're going to
learn something new you're going to
better your position in life I when it
comes to creating by obviously putting
out work bettering your skills better in
your business try and maybe try to learn
marketing if you're a freelancer these
are all things that you know people they
know will be good for them
but they'll they'll just put it off man
that's unfortunate and that's an issue
of procrastination and it results from
years behind years of kind of being told
what to do not wanting to do it and
that's unfortunate so if you're in the
boat of procrastination I don't worry
it's not permanent let this resonate
with you watch stefan molyneux video
he'll go into a little bit more details
and depth about procrastination and if
you really let it sink in you will
definitely overcome it alright so I'm
