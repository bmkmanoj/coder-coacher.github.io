Gary Simon here of course tetra comm I
just wanted to put this out there real
quick just because Adobe just released
February's update for experienced design
now if you've been paying attention then
you'll know that Adobe is planning on
releasing an update for XD every month
now fortunately they're sticking to
their work so just yesterday for this
update there are four editions two of
which are big in my opinion so first we
have sharing the ability to share your
artwork now and I already created kind
of like a share just for this little
fake project here and screwable
artboards blurring elements of the user
interface and exporting SVG and
previously you can only export PNG so
now you can import and export SVG files
okay so let me just show you scrollable
artboards and blurring elements of the
user interface and how all that works
now right here this is just kind of a
template that I took from the Android or
the Google material design I user
interface kit I have two windows open by
the way so this is where I grab that
problem and you can just grab it from
right there over here if you want to
follow along or not and so what we can
do now is if we click on the artboard
itself we can see that it has a viewport
height section right here it's kind of
hard to see can safely do so you know
not very much contrast on why they did
that but as you can see it's set to 667
4 D as the actual viewport height so to
make something screw lab or like for a
given artboard itself all you have to do
now is we can select it and we can just
drag it down so you know maybe just a
little bit further right around here I'm
going to get rid of this and then we'll
take this repeating list of names and
we'll just go all the way down
the viewport as you can see it has this
little dotted line that lets us know the
viewport and so all this stuff will be
scrolled content that will be visible so
just to give you an idea of what that is
go to prototype hit play and now we
hover over it previously this did not
happen we can see that we have this
scroll bar and we can scroll down
obviously a basically a necessity of a
feature for a full-fledged app but
they're getting there and so I just to
show you I the blurring of elements
let's go ahead I'm just going to take
this and copy it the artboard and then
paste it and this one doesn't even need
to scroll necessarily so I'll just bring
that back up and what we'll do is you
can use any of these shapes our shape
tools the pen tool or whatever I'm just
going to use the rectangle tool as that
one makes the most sense I want to let's
say for instance we wanted to blur out
the whole interface in order to have
focus brought towards maybe a little
pop-up window here so the way we do this
we draw it out and get rid of the border
here we do not need that and or you
could just uncheck it and we're being
quicker and then you can see we have
this new option background blur all
right so it's like was that okay does it
make sense what's because the amount is
so high so if we drag this down now it
looks a lot better so maybe right around
there makes sense and then if we switch
back to I'm going to switch back to my
interface kit I'm just going to get one
of these pop-ups right here and copy
that go back and I'll just paste it
right in and position this as I need to
and it's a little bit a little bit too
much showing through here so I'll click
on this background blur blur it out
just a tad bit more maybe increase the
brightness so you can see you can wash
it out a little bit more you can also
control the opacity I think I like that
now it's going to prototype real quick
and just say we click anywhere on here
we'll go here now we'll leave these are
default settings we'll click on this and
we'll go back and then we'll hit play
yada-yada-yada click and there we go
very cool so these are two big features
that are definitely going to be you know
coming in handy for pretty much any
serious app design or mock-up project
alright so that's it for this update I'm
personally looking forward to what are
called micro interactions
now I hit up Adobe on their Facebook
account to inquire about what or when
they're going to release the ability to
animate individual user interface
elements as opposed just to being able
to animate the page transitions which is
really all they allow you to do at this
point in terms of animation and they
actually responded and said that yes
they're calling these micro interactions
and it is on their roadmap okay
so I've been really busy with other
stuff lately but look out for more
tutorials in the very near future like
within the week or so once I get all
this other stuff out of the way I'm
recording courses for another network
but that's almost completed fortunately
alright so subscribe here on youtube if
you haven't yet and check out course
