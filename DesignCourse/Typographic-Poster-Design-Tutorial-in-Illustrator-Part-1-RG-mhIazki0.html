today is February 3rd with our 33rd
video of the year and today we are going
to design what's called a type of
graphic poster so what is that well one
it's a poster and two it's based around
type pretty simple so we're going to use
the initials DC for design cores you can
use whatever you want we're going to use
Adobe Illustrator CC to do this and it's
going to be a two part two video series
so will I get it the initial part done
today and then we'll finish it up
tomorrow so as always check out design
course comm and subscribe here on
YouTube if you haven't yet already so if
you need access to the project files to
kind of see what I did there available
for free in the description below
alright so I this is a preview of what
we're going to design
all right so let's get started go to
file new in adobe illustrator we'll call
it typographic poster 16 inches by 20
inches so make sure that is 20 inches
over there everything else can be left
the same CMYK 300 et cetera alright so
let's start off by making our pattern
we'll take the rectangle tool and we'll
hold shift and just draw right around
there I mean you don't have to be
perfect that doesn't really matter
so I basically this is just a square it
has a black back stroke with a white
fill we can get rid of the fill we don't
need that I it's just one pixel so let's
take this go to object pattern make
alright this little dialog box comes up
and I want that anymore so if that won't
happen again and we'll leave it at 5 by
5 for the copies obviously this is what
we're working with we're not going to be
keeping this square it's just gonna help
us see I it'll help us make the pattern
basically so alright what we want to do
we will zoom up with our magnifying
glass hole and you know me but a little
bit more and so anything that we do
inside this square the reason these are
dimmed out is because we have dim copies
to 50% so it just kind of lets us
differentiate between you know that
active basically pattern square thing or
whatever
between the copies so we'll leave that
like that so I'm gonna take the pen tool
and I'm going to click right around at
the top portion of the square and next
parts going to be kind of tricky I've
done this a couple times and it's
actually been quite irritating so look
kind of around the center yeah you don't
have to be specific or perfect or
anything and then come down back here so
we're just left clicking and dragging
these points alright okay so let us at
this point go ahead and take the direct
selection tool which is this one up here
and we could kind of see if you hold alt
and use your scroll wheel you can zoom
out easily our goal is
to get this this basically connected
over here I so let's go ahead and zoom
up again so the goal is like I said we
want these two to kind of just flow into
each other all right so I'll just adjust
we can't adjust these points because
they're they don't really exist so
that's just one thing to note here so
what I'm trying to do is visualize kind
of like a smooth curve that goes in
between these two and obviously you know
you're adjusting these points you know
however you think they will work best
all right so let's go ahead and hide
that square layer right here in the
layers panel and now what we want to do
is create another point all right now
I'm going to take both of these and
increase the stroke
okay that's at a hundred percent now I
know what I want to do is take the
ellipse tool and will come out right
around there
you know just something that's kind of
like a pattern I I think that will work
out pretty decently okay
all right so once you're done what you
want to do is take I we can just you can
name it whatever you want I'm just gonna
leave it a new pattern I'm just gonna
hit done and then I'm going to take the
rectangle tool and just go basically the
size of the document and we will click
on that all right so that's our pattern
it's filling this in here and it is
basically transparent once again I I
want to go back if you ever want to edit
your your pattern you can just double
click it over here in the swatches and
I'm gonna make an adjustment we'll go to
object path look you got to select them
all first object path and outline stroke
it done all right so now what we want to
do is I'm going to move this above this
top layer and yeah it doesn't have a
fill that's why we can still see it I I
was that the actual I'm sorry what we
want to do is duplicate this rather so
ctrl C and ctrl F and then make it black
and then take the opacity down just to
90% so now we can just barely see our
background right here all right so now
what I'm going to do is go ahead and I'm
going to zoom out here alright so I will
take this right here this is our pattern
and hit ctrl C and ctrl F to duplicate
that and I'm gonna double click on our
pattern over here and I'm gonna click on
save a copy that brings up this window
so I'll just leave it at new pattern -
we'll hit OK and okay so I'm gonna hit I
I'm gonna hit done over here and I'm
gonna double click on the copy that we
created
and I'm going to get rid of that circle
and then just hit done all right so
we're going to take the one that we
duplicated and change it to this and if
I just temporarily hide that or rather
lock it so we can't select it now if we
move this thing you can see it's staying
right there so we have to fix that let
me get back here all right so to do that
we just have to go to object expand hit
okay and now once we move it you know we
can kind of see how oops I think I
selected the background by accident the
other one because the fill is
transparent so now if we move this over
damn it
okay with selecting wrong one let me
zoom up here
and then we can go ahead and take our
transparency of this one just bring it
down to around 20 percent and it just
gives us an extra element of design I
guess you could say all right now I'm
going to zoom out here and then real
quickly I just want to get the actual
text that we're going to use and so I'm
just going to click left click once and
I'm gonna type in D we can't see it
because it's tiny so I'm gonna hold I'm
gonna scale this up a lot we will make
it white and the font I want to use is
no it's not that it's one of these
around here there we are
Museo slab 900 it's big thick kind of
serif font and so for our for the
typographic portion it's just going to
be DC for me that's short for design
course you can use whatever you want and
then I'm just going to copy that by ctrl
C and ctrl F mu this thing down you can
use shift to make it on a diagonal
course and I'm just going to change it
to a capital C and I want these to
intersect kind of right around there
and then for just one final thing I will
take the rectangle tool and just kind of
come in right around here kind of want
it to intersect the characters just a
little bit and let go we'll go to
gradient or you could just go up here
same thing and hit the X right here to
take away the fill we'll give it a
stroke make that a little bit thicker
and so you'll see what this looks like
66% now we'll go to object
outline stroke and then I want to get
rid of I want a little bit of a I guess
you could say a margin or a padding
between and I want them intersecting so
we could take the square tool or the
rectangle tool and right around there
will work and I want to take both of
these and if I just hold shift so we
have the both of those layer selected
we'll go to window Pathfinder and we
want to choose - front and so that will
automatically subtract that Square
portion we got to do the same thing over
here as well so I will take the square
tool again right around here and then do
it again right around here
selecting both oops I had the wrong one
uh-oh I think I select the wrong one
here - all right well let's give me a
pinion hold on a second
okay so basically if you take this all
you need it's a group right now you need
to select the one that we're trying to
work with specifically inside of that
group which is right here so take that
hit control and select also this right
here there we go all right so we're
already at about 12 minutes I think
that's a good time to kind of end it we
can adjust this real quick get that over
there yeah we can fix that at the end so
it's not kind of hanging off all right
so that is it for now
I tomorrow what we'll work on is kind of
cutting these these characters up and
give them a little bit of color so all
right I will see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
