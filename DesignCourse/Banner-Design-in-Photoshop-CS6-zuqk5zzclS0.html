course comm and today we're going to
take a look at how to design a couple of
website banners and we're also going to
take a look at a new product i've
created and just launched called wise
banner and we'll look at that at the end
so first here in Photoshop cs6 I let's
go ahead to file new and depending on
your resolution and I'm using I
specifically for this Photoshop windows
all around 1280 by 720 I choose a width
and height that will fill up your
artboard here near basically a hundred
percent yeah with no scroll bars so it
may be this may be something higher
depending on your resolution and then
everything else here should be pretty
standard and we'll just call this wall
gonna not hit okay I already have my
created so go ahead and just name it
being a project and hit OK alright so
we're going to assume that we want to
design a a large square banner and one
of the standard sizes here is 336 by 280
so we're going to select here on the
rectangular tool and we'll just double
click and this will allow us to specify
those exact dimensions 336 by 280 and
hit OK and it will automatically fill in
the foreground color here for the
background alright so now what we want
to do is take the foreground color we're
going to change it to black hit OK and
then we're also going to and rename it
to base hit control G and that
automatically creates a group and we
will give this the name of the
dimensions so 336 X 280 alright so now
we have that eye we're going to for this
tutorial I just
I use this right here this is at file
which is linked in the description of
the YouTube video and open that up hit
ctrl a and then ctrl C to copy and with
the base layer selected hit ctrl shift n
for a new layer and we'll call this logo
and also make sure use previous layer to
create clipping mask is checked go ahead
and hit OK and hit ctrl V to paste so
what that clipping mask does and you can
see it's pointing down here if you're
unfamiliar with clipping masks it keeps
every sign everything inside the
viewable area of the base layer right
here and that's important obviously for
a banner project I so let's go ahead and
scale this down hit ctrl T hold shift
and we'll make it something around that
size it's like the move tool hit apply
okay so wise banner by the way is that
project that I mentioned that I just
launched and I'll describe what that is
at the end here so we're going to assume
this banner right here is for our wise
banner project I know the one of the
most important things when it comes to
effective banner design is understanding
what makes an effective banner which is
inclusive of a good call to action a
good headline I and also paying
attention to the use of colors and
making sure it's relevant I so wise
manner what we'll do here we'll take the
type tool and we'll just click once up
here and I'm going to type in rapidly
produce now I'm using a font called
source sans Pro it's actually a free
font that you can download and I will
link that in the description of the
YouTube video so that you can download
it basically it's actually a
a font family and I'm going to use a
light and bold version so for this right
here we're going to make it light and
then we're just going to select the move
tool hit ctrl shift D actually never
mind I can hit that because it's a
shortcut to the Camtasia screen crap
capture program I'm using but I
basically I we want to duplicate it so
we'll go ahead to right click duplicate
layer and let's hit OK
and rapidly produce so we're going to
put a beautiful banner sets take the
move tool hit ctrl T we'll scale this up
this would be considered our headline so
this this copy right here is extremely
important because this is what's going
to grab the attention of potential
visitors depending on where we're
advertising so this is also something
that we would want to split test which
I'll discuss a little bit further so
let's go ahead and make this one bold
ctrl T we'll scale that down a little
bit more alright and now we want a good
call to action now call to actions
generally speaking a a button something
that entices people to actually click on
or perform some sort of action so down
here we'll drag out and select rounded
rectangle rectangular tool I have radius
set at 20 pixels up here and we'll make
the foreground color the kind of this
lime green right here so let's go ahead
and just drag out right around there all
right so now we'll take the foreground
color and make it black click right
around there
a couple periods in minutes okay now for
the aliasing I want to choose smooth up
here okay and then I just kinda want to
put a arrow right here so I'm going to
choose the ellipse tool hold shift
change that foreground color to black
and we'll move it right here and then we
will take the pen tool make sure shape
is selected and the foreground color is
the color of our button let's just zoom
up here we'll use a one-point there
hold shift select one down there and
hold shift again and we'll make our
foreground color right there okay so
let's zoom back out all right so that's
our button we can give this button a
slight gradient so the way we apply a
gradient we'll go down here let's rename
this real quickly to button so we right
click over there and that gives us our
layer styles so let's go to gradient
overlay and we'll click in the gradient
options up there and we'll click on the
first preset which is just the
foreground and background and we'll take
this color right here and just make it
slightly darker as you can see up here
hit OK and then we're going to go to
inner shadow will take blend mode to
normal opacity to 100 check off use
global lighting and for size we'll put 0
distance 1 now we'll change the
foreground color to this light color and
this kind of just makes it stand out a
little bit we'll hit OK
and okay alright so with the move tool
selected let's go ahead and select and
also make sure auto select layers on
we'll hold shift and select this text
layer and this one and then also we'll
hit control and select all the button
elements right here
and we'll just move them down a little
bit and we'll uncheck those two layers
at the top I'm just so we have the
button and we'll put that right around
there alright so so far so good I know
let's go ahead and give the background
the base layer I just some textures just
so we can stand out a little bit so for
the base let's go ahead and create a new
layer and we want to make sure use
previous layer is still selected and
we're just going to call this background
okay alright so just something there's
many different ways that we could give
this texture on but one way here I'll
try is we'll take this I the brush tool
with a feather brush right here hardness
is zero and we're just going to make
this by kind of a darker purple and it
was randomly going to click around here
and then I'm going to change the
hardness and size will scale that down
all right I'm going to create a new
layer
background to slightly change the color
here
and we can mix up the sizes of course
all right
and then we can adjust the eye layer
blend mode up Here I am putting our down
arrow and just seeing I how these two
layers can interact with each other on
different blend modes I kind of like
that and then the final thing we'll do
is create another layer just above the
logo layer and we use I a clipping mask
there we'll call this background 3 ok
take our rectangle tool make the
foreground black and then just draw
right around here
okay control H to get rid of these
outlines and then just slightly change
the opacity just so we have a maximum
contrast right there all right so let's
say for example we're happy with this
but we're going to be advertising for
example on the google adwords network so
Google AdWords allows you to advertise
and up to 8 different banner sizes so
this is only one so if we really want to
maximize our exposure we want to have
this same banner replicated into those
seven other banner sizes so what that
requires is a lot of manual labor
basically duplicating our layers and
adjusting the location and all these to
meet the new dimensions of each banner
size so let's just do that for one
banner just so I can show you how that
process is done I what what we want to
do is I right click and duplicate that
group will call this 728 by 90 which is
another popular leaderboard type of
banner size and we will move it down so
let's go ahead and expand that group and
basically out right up up here I'm just
going to create
you layer the fill up here will be black
I'm going to double click width is 728
by 90 hit ok all right so now this layer
right here we want to take this and
basically replace it as this base layer
so right here we see we have these top
four layers and they are currently
clipping mask so this layer so if I
delete that that will go away real quick
so all I have to do is move this call
this base again take those few and right
click create clipping mask and let me
move this down see we can see see
everything in here now and let's go
ahead and just take all these layers and
move them back I where it logically fits
into this new banner size so what we'll
do i first is let's go ahead and take a
look at the logo okay so here's the logo
we may or may not use this so it depends
so sometimes you get down to really
smaller type of banner sizes and
sometimes you can't use all of the
elements that you used in the bigger
size that you initially worked with so
right now we're just going to hide that
so let's get the type out here rapidly
produce and be intercepts all right so
that appears to work pretty well right
here now let's go ahead and take our
button let's see here
okay so we can group this as well call
this button so do we have enough room
for the logo well let's go ahead and see
here right here it's pretty small
actually I'm going to drag this above so
does it really make sense to have the
logo there if it's so small and does it
really serve our purpose because
remember we want people to as many
people as possible to click so we can
have a high click through ratio ah is it
necessary to have it I really don't
think so here we can add it because we
have enough room certainly so what I
want to do is take this button right
here and we'll move it right there take
the rapidly produce we're going to
delete this layer take this one down
here beautiful banner sets
we'll make this bold ctrl T that way it
kind of flows together and it's larger
and it sticks out okay so also we don't
need this background right there but we
can play around with these a little bit
and we could probably stand to make in
minutes a little bit larger and that's
it so at this point now we have both of
our banners ready to go and ready to be
exported so the way you export these is
pretty simple I am going to take both of
them and just duplicate those and hit OK
and I will hide these and then I'll just
select this one hit ctrl E and then
select this one hit ctrl E and then when
we go I say for example we want to save
the 336 by 280 just go to control a and
then just elect all and then ctrl C file
new and then obviously it has our width
and height specified from the clipboard
whatever we have copied currently hit OK
and then hit control V to paste and if
you want to save for web file save for
web and we have our options up here on
how to export them so depending on the
ad network they may allow pngs or JPG
files was due and you can experiment and
sometimes you also have file size
restrictions or limits for instance I
believe AdWords is 50 kilobytes so we
would be fine with this banner in these
settings right here I sometimes you can
get a little bit more graphical and you
may go above the 50 KB and at that point
you would just adjust the quality and
play around with these settings until
you can get under 250 KB and then hit
save so that's pretty straightforward
very simple um and then you would do the
same thing down here for the rest of
your banner sizes so that's basically
the task of creating banner sets
recently though I well actually the
beginning of 2013 I came up with an idea
I to really streamline this process and
automate it as much as possible so we
can get rid of all the tedious aspects
of this so
just to show you real quick it is called
wise banner and let me bring up a
browser here
all right let's banner com
all right so let me just get this scaled
up properly so we can see it so wise
banner I this is product I created and
it's basically a set of Photoshop
actions scripts and PSD files so the way
this works I let me log in real quick
and go here so we have the banner
catalog so it's probably a little bit
confusing at first but basically if you
know what how many text layers you want
in your banner and object layers which I
those could be buttons or they could be
photographs or anything you can specify
right here so if we select two text
layers that we want for example it
automatically updates and if we want to
choose the object layers um say we want
to object layers then we have this
template right here so if we click on
this this template is ready to go in
different colors so let's just choose
black so if I specify download action
file and download PSD file and load this
into Photoshop and also load the PSD
file we're ready to go so we can see we
have up to 15 different popular banner
sizes all ready to go and to be designed
for so the way this works is you specify
your text up here
and you obviously don't have to follow
along I just wanted to quickly
illustrate this like a pro and then for
the object layers we can specify
anything we want really so if I wanted
this object layer right here to be the
actual logo go back scale that down real
quick and it's okay if this overlaps
initially that's fine and then this
could be like a call to action button so
what I could do is I real quickly take
this button and merge it to one layer
paste that in there
and then we could also very easily I
adjust the gradient or do anything with
the background but just for the purpose
of showing you how this works I say for
example we're happy with this just for
now and we go to window actions hit
background replication it gets a the
same background on all of these and then
we hit process banners now what this
does is it manually takes all of these
banners now these layers right here and
it automatically replicates them to all
of the other banner sets or banner sizes
down here and it takes roughly about 20
seconds you can see it's working
automatically right here so now we have
these all replicated so I can move this
off here
we can see that we have a pretty
simplified version of this up here so
now it becomes just a matter of quickly
adjusting the size and position of these
various layers down here so real quickly
we can just make sure everything's good
with that one and sometimes based on
oops
change this to say 15 so it doesn't
create that down there oops wrong one
and I'm not going to go I'm not going to
go ahead and bore you by making these
adjustments to every single banner but
you basically get the point usually on
average to create a banner set it only
takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to
create 15 different banners and that's
why I personally use wise banner
whenever whenever I'm designed banners
for a client because it's really
powerful actually and basically you
would do that through all of these and
then when you want to save them you
bring out the actions window again and
what's really cool is this can
save animated gifs and it will
automatically animate the title layer
just so you have a version of 15
animated banners and then also you can
save and export to JPG files and I'll
show you how quick that is so if we
wanted to save these JPG files hit play
it allows us to specify a directory hit
close documents after saving leave jpg
quality at 80 and hit save banners and
what it's doing right now is exporting
all these real quickly and it
automatically flattens them but if I
were to go to that directory we would be
good to go so if you ever have to design
a banner set and you want to be able to
cut out like 90% of the work go ahead
and check out my project at wise banner

I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and I'll
see you next time
all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
