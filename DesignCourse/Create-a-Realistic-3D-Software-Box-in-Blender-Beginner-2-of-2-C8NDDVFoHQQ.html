today is the second and final part of
our 3d software box design in Photoshop
and blender and so we'll be working
exclusively almost until the end in
Photoshop for this and we'll be
designing the actual appearance of the
design box alright so if you haven't yet
check out design course comm and
subscribe here on YouTube alright so get
started alright so now open up Photoshop
and also open up the UV layout that we
created in the previous lesson and this
is what we're presented with so I'm
going to hit ctrl shift in N or command
shift + n on a Mac and we're going to
name this new layer background drag it
beneath that layer 0 we can just rename
that as well to UV and we'll give the
fill a white color for the background
now whatever I the base color of your
product box is going to be it may not
always be white like this that's what
the color you would definitely want to
fill it in with I so the way this works
of course is any of the UV areas
anything inside it that was going to be
shown on that particular face or that
side of the box
alright so also when it comes to whether
this is the front or this back doesn't
really matter because we can always just
rotate the the 3d software box in
blender alright so one problem is I did
not design this beforehand so I have no
clue what I'm going to design maybe I'll
just experiment maybe I'll use some of
the same techniques that it did with the
product box for the VIS ID so yeah so
let me go ahead and I'm going to create
a rectangle so select the rectangle tool
rather and I'm going to use a color what
color should our box be I don't want to
use blue I've been using that
um maybe a greenish like a lime greenish
color come out somewhere around maybe
here yeah so I'm using 9 8 d 0 1 8 if
you want to be exact you can use
whatever color you want and once you've
selected that we're going to assume this
is the front so we'll left-click and
drag and you can hold all if it does
that to you
and maybe right around there okay so you
see if i zoom up here I extended it a
little bit beyond the actual outline of
that UV and the reason being you want to
make sure it doesn't get cut off because
you'll see a white tiny 1 pixel line
there if you're not careful so for it to
extend out a little bit it's not a big
deal
alright so if you hide the UV layer we
can see the actual color because it does
change it makes a little bit lighter
alright so at this point when it comes
to designing your software box you know
this is where creativity and all that
stuff comes in and in depending on what
your software or your fictional software
box is supposed to be representing you
know I just try to come up with
something that will really wow people
and want them to buy it whatever it is
whether it be some type of digital
product or if it's an actual CD or DVD
so I I'm just going to I'm going to use
I'm going to use the F form icon that I
made a think for this alright so if you
are not a few probably a bunch of
lessons or days ago I created a video
tutorial on designing a a chat icon for
design course comm forms so I'm going to
open that up and I'll also make this
available in the project files if you
want to follow along alright and here it
is and when I open up this AI file I you
get a dialog that asks you you know how
you want to import it one of the things
you want to leave it at 300dpi that way
you make sure it's big enough for this
big document over here so if you hit
ctrl a ctrl C and
you take this rectangle one layer
control-shift-n for a new layer hit tab
so that it's kind of selects this area
and it's space that'll give you a real
quick way of making any future layers a
clipping mask without literally have to
come on over here and clicking it I know
I'm lazy but it makes things go faster
so hit OK and then you know what I don't
think that worked yeah there we go
control and control see I didn't see the
little marching ants
I want to did that initially so now we
can paste that in control T to move
shift and Alt + left click and drag down
so we'll get this sucker right around
I'd say right here select the move tool
hit apply alright so I'm going to change
the color of this I want to make it
white I think so fiii I'm going to zoom
up here a little bit too so if I double
click on this the right side of the
layer will get the layer styles color
overlay select that change color to
white
BAM so we get a little cool flat sort of
eye form icon there and let me think
about what else I might want to do just
to make it a little bit more interesting
than that so maybe we can add some type
here I'll type in forums I'm really
original ctrl T shift and scale that
thing up
I let me think here I'm going to use a
font called trade gothic I really like
that font it's not free unfortunately so
you can use whatever fonts you want but
I do like it we'll put that right there
I now I need to think of something that
can go as a cool background element for
this so alright so I've kind of paused
and I was trying to figure out what I
wanted to use so I'm going to use Devia
art and the resources and stock images
sections and I just typed in a pretty
girl or something and I came across this
image and I thought I could be
interesting like one of the first ones
like I saw but you can use these images
as long as you eye
respect what the author has required so
I will link to this gallery on the
YouTube video so I'm going to hit
download it's a large download and I
will bring up a new window and
everything you see is white there it
goes right click copy image you can do
that in Chrome or Firefox I believe and
get out of there minimize that create a
new layer underneath this
control-shift-n it will automatically
have this checked off as a clipping mask
if there is a clipping mask above it the
whatever you have is selected hit OK and
then ctrl V to paste in ctrl T to
because this is massive
I to get the transform tools shift and
alt left click and drag that thing down
now maybe right there is good
alright and let's go ahead and image
adjustments and desaturate it and then
we could play the layer Bend the
lap-band modes don't blend modes by
clicking over here and then you can just
do it one by one like this or you can
just click this again you can see
there's a tiny blue outline and lets you
use your down arrow key on your keyboard
to experiment with what this will look
like so it down and we have all these
different options these looks really
which are pretty interesting kind of
like this one because when it comes to
good design again you don't want
something to stick out so much that's
soft light by the way like if you want
to do if you want to use that no it's
actually not too bad but you don't want
it to take away too much from the
primary elements right here the type and
the icon so soft light where were you
it's pretty good I like that doesn't
stick out too much alright and now we
can worry about the portion beneath this
alright so you know what I'm a double
click on this and make this slightly
darker that way these the contrast is
good for our forms text and the icon
okay alright so now what we want to do
is get the UVI back out the layer and
we're going to duplicate this layer now
if you duplicate a layer when they have
clipping masks watch what happens and I
have a shortcut set for this you can
right click and hit duplicate layer my
short my hot cut my hotkey is ctrl shift
in D hit OK what happens is the the
image they're no longer clipping masks
so if I undo that just take all three
duplicate those get rid of those layers
and this one can come at the bottom and
we'll make it black move it down right
there is good alright we get rid of the
UV layer right there and now we can do
something over here and I we double
click it come over here to the patterns
overlay section and we want to do
something with this honeycomb thing I if
you want to use a pattern like I did
just go to Google type in Photoshop
honeycomb patterns or something like
that and you'll find some free ones that
you can import into Photoshop and use
you don't have to use one though opacity
will take that and come down a little
bit or quite a bit actually a 22% hit
okay and I don't know what I'm gonna
type here on also when you select a
shape layer it has an outline and you
you will see that the cursor icon it's
kind of changed all you have to do is
hit ctrl H that way once you click here
and will create an issue alright so I'm
going to click somewhere right around
there son of the text I'm going to call
I'm just going to put a quote the
hottest forum no design forum out there
so cheesy
alright and then ctrl T will scale this
up and actually I may
hit enter like that right around there
and I'm going to get the character panel
I here go to window character if you
don't see it um hit Auto the way it
brings everything together a little bit
more and just for the hell of it I'll
take the the the chat symbol I'll
duplicate that so ctrl shift D or right
click and duplicate that duplicate that
layer ctrl T hold shift scale that
sucker down and we'll just drag it over
here to the right so I can move tool it
apply and then move this up above that
layer alright cool so that it serves as
the front of our package design alright
or a software box so let's get the UV
layout back up and this is going to be
the back of it so what we can do is just
take everything I'm going to hit group
call this front so hit ctrl G that will
group it up and then we'll duplicate
that move it over and this time let's go
ahead and change things up maybe real
quickly call this back real quick and
let's get rid of the UV thing around
there I'm going to go ahead and well
temporarily hide that I get rid of the
forms tax and get rid of that text as
well if you hit if you get control left
click it automatically select the layer
I'm going to get rid of hmm I'm thinking
do I want to extend this all the way up
or extend this down we can make it all
black I suppose so I'm going to get rid
of her
and that one take this hit ctrl T move
it up here like apply get out our
icon and maybe make it like that a
watermark and then normally what you
would do is just put in a ton of text
like your requirements or pictures or
whatever for a back I'm not going to
mess around with that just because we're
already out like 13 minutes you get the
idea at this point so we're going to UV
again we'll get that layer back up there
and this is the right and left side so
what I'm going to do is take front
duplicate that layer or right click and
hit duplicate or that group rather move
it over here we'll call this side I
don't know which one's left or right I
don't think it really matters so what
we'll do is move this over right there
and I think we can I let's see here
obviously we have to make some
adjustments and bring that out we will
find okay that layer ctrl T drag that in
apply and then also the black layer
which is right there
ctrl T drag that in hit apply and then
we'll take our forms text wait what's
going on here oh yeah if you don't want
to select the UV layer just I put a lock
on it there you go take this and we'll
ctrl T scale that down letting shift do
the same thing with this one we'll ctrl
T
maybe we'll move her over I don't know
like that whatever I and then I'll
delete that text all right and then
we'll duplicate this ctrl shift D I've
set up a hockey key for that right-click
or duplicate and just for the hell of it
will click on will quickly go ahead and
make some adjustments like that move
this stuff down and this maybe we can
control T and rotate that thing around
holding shift just for some different
looks I guess you could say I'm cool and
then we'll have the top and bottom to
worry about you know what I'm just going
to leave these white just because you
know what we got the idea already so
this is a serious project you would want
to go ahead and fill it all and with any
necessary information so we already had
almost 16 minutes so what I want to do
is save this don't save it as the the UV
layout PNG you would really want to save
this as a PSD file so I paused and went
ahead and save that as box - design dot
PSD now what we have to do is save this
for use within blender so if you hide
the UV layer and you definitely want to
hide that otherwise that will be baked
into the image to hide that so now we
want to do is save this and you save it
as a PNG you just go to file save for
web control shift alt RS and you can
save it as like a high jpg file and hit
save and let me go to recent places
right there and we can save this box
design hit save BAM alright so with any
luck we'll switch back here to blender
and I'm going to go ahead and right
click this area in hit join area like
that and I'm going to
this to object mode and yeah there we go
and I'm going to switch to rendered real
quick make sure this is selected and
we'll go ahead real quick and switch
back to or click on the material section
use nodes make sure you're on cycle or
under and we want to change this view to
the node editor you know what I'm going
to real quick join that area I should
have left that other one up sorry about
that I'm going to switch this one to the
node editor it's much more easier to see
the nodes when you're dealing with with
them stack those views so we'll change
this one again to rendered alright so
the node editor if you've never used it
looks alien it's scary no big deal
though over here if we change this to a
mixed shader you see a reflects that
change right here and we'll have two
different shaders here we can actually
you know what we can just do a regular
diffuse so I'm going to undo that
diffuse there we go hit control Z a few
times because this will work as diffuse
just right on the box so shift a over
here and then put texture and image
texture connect the color to the color
of those two nodes it goes pink because
there's no eye image selected yet so if
you hit open image which I've done and
you click on UV - actually you know what
that's not the right one here's all my
videos isn't that nuts this is all from
2014 each one of these videos
consecutive every day I can't believe
I've done this much anyhow this is the
right one where I've say so it's box -
design dot jpg and oh my god look at
that alright let's go ahead and right
click join area so we can see this
sucker
a little bit closer
and so as you can see it would look even
cooler and more realistic I if you
probably positioned her a little bit
better on these sides um
the back of course adding text and stuff
adding text over here maybe like
requirements or something obviously the
details would make it look really cool
but still this looks cool in and of
itself you can always do other cool
things like I I think we have we
currently have a selected more object
mode if you hit shift D you could
duplicate it via X you can make it move
back further or in front
shifty again and we'll hit Y so it looks
like you have like a big stack of them
or something like that
I see yeah you could really play around
with it it's fun I messing around with
this so let's say for example you wanted
to render this hit the zero on your
number pad and this is the camera view
if you hit n as a nose it'll bring this
area up scroll down just to where it
says lock camera to view hit n again and
then you can rotate your view based on
what you want the camera to see if you
right click onto the plane and when
you're in rendered mode as we are it
won't show you an outline if you have
selected but it is selected if you're
right clicked it over there hit new you
can also adjust the color of this area
if you want it to be like all white that
way it doesn't show like that cut or in
the background that'll work alright and
come over here maybe right around there
leave it right around there yeah it
looks good I think we'll be done right
around there
you know what just because I want to I
want to take this I'm going to get out
of camera pose mode so you just hit zero
I'm going to zoom up here I want to take
this hit R and
why and move this down so they get
sitting on the ground alright right
around there maybe move it back a tad
bit I don't know just to show some
different angles of this thing so
they're all standing up rendered um yeah
that looks fine okay cool
so that's what our rendered view will
look like so if you hit zero again on
your number pad this is what will render
so again we came out here and we
specified 1280 by 720 we have 700 for
the render one other thing if you do
have a GPU and you're using GPU compute
and go to performance change the tiles
from 64 to 256 by 256 hit enter and that
is it so all you have to do oops damn it
now all you have to do is come up here
hit render and it's going to start
rendering this thing out so we're using
again 750 I think so I'm going to pause
until this is done
and then only took about 40 seconds or
so and this is it and it's obviously
bigger than that this is the full image
this is like a hundred percent right
here but yeah if you want to save that
there's hit f3 on your keyboard and save
the image that is it obviously a lot
better than dealing with like you know
Photoshop and trying to create these
fake 3d boxes that way you have so much
more control and you can do cool
different renders based on the scene and
all that stuff so yeah and even you
cannot learn a little bit of basic rent
of blender animation and really make it
look cool for like a promo video have
them animate and stuff anyhow that is it
so if you like this tutorial and and you
like designs tours in general I'm doing
one every day of 2014 I stuck with it so
far and it's April 22nd so yeah I've
been pumping these out like a crack
addict anyhow
yeah subscribe here on YouTube and check
out design course comm alright I'll see
you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
