comm today we're going to continue on by
doing a tad bit of PHP and then writing
out the HTML for the main GUI basically
when a person's logged into Bart Volcom
alright so basically if you need access
to the project files from everything
that's been done up to this point you
could check out yesterday's video and
then if you need today's project files
after the project's done you can
download it from this video at design
course comm alright so I if you haven't
yet check out design course comm and
subscribe here on YouTube let's get
started ok so this is where we left off
yesterday finishing this step to PHP I
so real quickly before we get on with
that main GUI what I want to do is get a
first bit of PHP actually going I want
to include the header so this portion
this HTML is our header and so right now
it's on both of these pages but I if you
ever want to make a change you'd have to
make a change multiple so a great way of
dealing with that problem is just by
taking I let's see do I want to include
the header portion yeah I all this HTML
copying it delete it and go ahead and
open up the PHP tags and that's how you
do if you've never done it and then
include and that would be we'll just
call it NAB PHP and then end that line
with a semicolon which is something
you'll see often and then close the PHP
tag so save that go to file new ctrl V
to paste that HTML in save it and we'll
call it now HP alright and then we'll
come back over here copy this line real
quick and then come to index by HTM
we're going to rename that to PHP and
you're not using an enter that allows
you to do that you'll have to do it with
your file browser and then go ahead and
paste that in hoops yeah there alright
so now everything's a PHP file and that
includes both of our our header or now
for PHP okay so switching back over here
this is the page that we created for the
main interface once a person's actually
logged in and I so yeah let's get
started with this i real quickly let's
switch over here
I'll just take I our step to save it as
I'll just call it main PHP all right so
one of the things will will work from
top to bottom so the first thing is this
has to align to the left and then we
have to add these three links so it's
going to require a little bit of PHP to
do both of those and you'll see why so
let me get out my FTP which I use I one
that's called flash FXP there's a bunch
of different every TP applications that
you can use if you've never used one
before you have no idea what it is
basically allows you to transfer files
onto your website so right now all these
files this is showing index dot PHP
basically or HTM for now so this is the
old file so what I'm going to do is just
delete those and you know if you're
interested in transferring your files to
a website if you actually registered a
domain you know from the beginning of
this tutorial I you can go to your host
and log in to your host panel and
they'll tell you what your FTP
information is like your FTP address
password and cetera so I'm not going to
go into details about how to
specifically use it but it's very simply
it's kind of like drag-and-drop system
and so very quick and just to make sure
our header include worked it does so
that's good alright so basically I let's
see here
let me go back here what we want to do
for this main dot PHP
is we need to create a variable at the
top very top just before that first line
so I'm going to open up with the PHP tag
and I'm going to put in basically a
variable the way you create a variable
you just put the numbers are the the
dollar sign and then whatever name you
want to come up something that's
relevant obviously for that variable
name equals there's one that's it so
we're just going to set a variable you
know we can make this anything it
doesn't have to be one eye basically is
just creating a variable and then in
na'vi HP what we want to do is come over
here so right now our alignment of it
being right aligned in that the column
seven that's a that's set by pierre our
CSS basically so what we want to do is
right here inside the image source PHP
if is set aligned logo that's our
variable name so is that basically means
if that if the variable exists so if
that variable exists then now what I
just did was I opened up e
by bracket here where and then it closed
the PHP so basically if a line logo
exists anything that comes out to this
is going to be executed essentially so
the I we're going to have a class so
class equals I'm going to put Al for a
line logo and then open PHP back up
close that bracket and there we go
close PHP so this is what your should
look like basically alright so save that
and up here we have a line logo equals
one and so we want to get out of our CSS
style that CSS and we want to add a
style here right at the top al we're
going to reference that class float
left I'm going to put important as well
make sure that actually works alright so
now what we can do is go back to our FTP
I which files did we get it I think it
was nav and main as well as the CSS all
right and then if i refresh this it'll
work it'll because we're on index dot
PHP that variable is not set so
everything stay the same but if we go to
main dot PHP it now aligns left perfect
alright so now we know what you need to
do is also get this over here I'm having
it show instead of login here it's going
to show those three links so because
we're going to be assuming this book
that person's logged in on that page so
let's go over here and all right so
basically we're not going to create the
whole login system yet but this is it's
going to use the login system in order
to work so we're going to hack it a
little bit just to make it think that
the variable exists that we're going to
use so basically I actually know we want
to go inside here alright so inside here
I'm going to put PHP close it as well
and then inside of it I'm going to put
if is set so you know we used is set
before just without that exclamation
point but this basically means if it's
not set so very simple I we're going to
use sessions PHP sessions for a login
system so you understand how that works
basically are variables that kind of
save throughout a person's between
visiting different pages I so I'm going
to save I'm going to say client ID here
so if the client ID is set that means
they logged in if that's the case or if
it's not set in this case it's going to
show this login here link so open that
back up and then we'll put else which
basically means otherwise if it is set
do everything that comes between these
brackets and so that's going to be three
links one two three and let me refer
back yeah okay so the first one was edit
my barter second one was my account and
log out I'm not going to worry about the
links right now leave them the same and
then because this is styled differently
it's green and these other ones aren't
we'll give that a class and we'll give
it a I don't know important link there
we go now by default this isn't going to
work because we don't have the actual
login system built so what I'm going to
do is simply declare this variable right
here and now we'll be able to see these
three links because we set that up there
alright so let me go ahead and make
those changes I don't know if we updated
main dot PHP or not but here we go see
all right so now what we want to do is
make sure that these float left of each
other so we'll have to go back to the
style dot CSS and that's going to be
header ul Li so I'm just copying that
pasting it and what we want to put here
is display inline float:left and then we
want some margin because there's not
going to be a space between those links
right now so I'm going to put 12 pixels
from the top because I did want to push
it down a little bit and then 15 pixels
from the right of each other so zero
zero and let me come up here there we go
alright I and we can also go ahead real
quick and edit that portion to make sure
that that is the correct green and it's
not Dekker
with any lines so let me come over here
important link a for the attack and then
this is going to be text-decoration:none
that gets rid of the end of line and
then I color will come back here
Photoshop and there it is alright so go
back and upload this there we go alright
so now if we drag this in alright that's
fine for now alright so now we can
actually get started on the HTML for
this page all right so let's come over
here what I'm going to do is basically
delete all of the HTML so we have
container 12 nav and then that so save
that alright so we have quite a bit of
work to do
so for the first thing off the moment I
focus on is this submenu right here
alright so let's do that basically we'll
call this div class equals sub menu I'm
not going to open it up with a container
12 yet because we want it to extend
oh yeah I messed that up because we want
the this bar to extend all the way has
to be outside of that container 12
otherwise it will just end right here so
yeah when I did this initially before
recording the video I didn't think about
that so just a problem all I have to do
is this outside of that container twelve
div class equals sub - menu ok and
that's the one that will be you know
making it that dark color and then
inside of it we need div class equals
container twelve
all right and then inside of that we'll
put the actual form because it is a form
that they submit in this submenu so form
action equals nothing and then method
equals post oops
close that form alright and what we want
to do is now be I didn't use call the
grid
to align these but I'm just going to
make them two columns long each that
seems like it would be pretty accurate
yeah roughly that's no problem so we
need two column 2 column 2 column 2 and
then column 6 and that's where this
thing will reside basically alright so
let's go and do that diff class it goes
column 2 and inside of that we will put
the first input input type it goals text
class equals small FLD the other ones as
you remember we're large FLD name equals
city value equals nothing for now though
we'll party populate that with PHP later
on placeholder equals I city all right
the next one is a state so we have to
switch back over to step two I'll just
copy that real quickly all right
all right so now let's change that class
to small field to copy this again and
this goes right here then this will be
not a text field this is our check box
and put our input type equals checkbox
name equals ignore location value equals
one so if it's checked oops
if it's checked then the value will
equal one so we'll know that with PHP if
the person checks it or not all right so
I also it is gray text so I'm going to
put span here class equals gray - txt
ignore location and it close a span tag
all right and that's all alright so then
what we need is another div class equals
container 12 because this one ends right
here and then inside of here is where
the main content will go starting with
right here all right so this is going to
be pretty simple of the dues to work for
one of these basically and then just
replicate them five times and change
these things around all right so let's
go here and all right so I'm going to
use I h1 ID equals full as in the
hundred percent matches and we'll be
able to get that icon in there class
equals I'm just going to put main title
and then strong 100 percent matches
close that and then span because it's
grey text light grey text I believe and
I'm just going to copy off screen this
portion right here people who need what
you have and how what you need someone
told me that the period belongs outside
of it so I'll trust them and say okay
all right and then close that h1 tag as
well
all right so save this and continue on
now we actually have I our three
containers to deal with so they're all
floating left so we're going to put div
class equals row and then inside of that
we're going to put div class equals
column four because there's three of
them and then inside of that we're going
to have div class equals barter -
container and what that'll allow us to
do is give it a outline basically and
you could have done that just by adding
another class to this column tag right
here like just adding barter container
right there but I found that because of
this little text that falls outside of
it that's why we have to create a
separate div element for the barter
container you know whatever you'll see
that works alright so in and inside of
here this is where we put the actual you
know there's actual content of the text
there once you know and all that stuff
so what we'll do is put a P tag class
equals once offers and there once I'm
going to hit enter and then put span
exercise machine of course this is all
going to be updated dynamically when we
get to that stage this is just
placeholder stuff close that P tag and
I'm structuring it like this instead of
all in one line just because it makes it
easier to see what's going on copy this
their offers and I'm going to copy that
off-screen real quick alright
and tickle feet so messed up and then we
have our gray area that contains we have
this area right here and then we have
that actual button so let's go ahead and
I'm just going to put div
sequel's contact container and inside
I'm going to use an html5 element called
button type equals button and contact
this person I close that button tag
alright so then outside of this barter
container and this is the portion it's
going to be that with that gray outline
is where we have this stuff right here
oops so I'm just copying that and then
we'll put p class equals barter data I
guess man all right and then paste that
in there and end that P tag and that is
it so now what we want to do is take
this all of column four paste it in
twice just like that then we want to do
is take everything from the h1 and make
sure I do this right yeah so with
exception to the last container tag copy
that paste it in this is going to be
half change this to 50 and we can get
that we can add that text up there
all right and there we go
let's see let's check out what this
looks like so far I mean there's no CSS
applied to that so but the general
structure should be there yeah and it is
obviously there's a lot of work in terms
of they CSS but the basic layout is
there cool all right
so it's already been about 21 minutes so
far so I'm just going to end it there
and tomorrow we'll get into the CSS
possibly I'm planning on doing a video
it's going to have nothing to do with
this project one of these days based on
my commenting system so I'm not sure
that's going to be tomorrow or not so
we'll see all right so I yeah if you had
also I'm thinking about doing a custom
what do you call I form on my site as
well so that people can actually if you
have questions or whatever you can go
there instead of messing around on
YouTube all right anyhow yeah so if you
haven't yet check out design course calm
and subscribe here on YouTube I'll see
you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
