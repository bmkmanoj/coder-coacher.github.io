very overdressed just came from my
four-year-old daughter's dance we heard
so I'm actually in the dance and I'm
lazy I didn't really feel like changing
so it's going to knock this out alright
so welcome to now the third section in
this hundred percent free course where
we're going to cover the app that we
created in the mock up process using
Adobe XD and also the app that we
created in view j/s we're going to take
the app now and we're going to see what
it takes to create that app now in
Facebook's react now react is a
JavaScript library that's there simply
for the view portion of an app alright
so if you're just hopping in feel free
to follow along with the course the very
beginning you can also download the
project files which are going to contain
the HTML and CSS that I will be pasting
in we covered that process of typing all
that out in the view GS portion of the
course in case you're wondering so
alright let's go ahead and get started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're going to find a bunch
of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost of buying me
like an ex pack each month that's it now
also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on all right let's get back to it all
right guys welcome to this new section
of this 100% free course about react
versus angular verse view j/s now we
just covered view now in this section
we're going to be covering react and for
those of you who are just kind of
hopping into this course from this video
we're sort of here in the middle of the
course just beginning this view or the
react section rather and we just covered
view and what we're doing is we're
taking this app which by the way we
covered the dhole design mock-up process
and prototype process in the very first
part of the course within Adobe XD so
you can check out the course page and
just take this from the beginning if you
wish but I we just finished here I this
basic landing page in View j/s and we're
going to recreate this from scratch
in angular in react as well just to do a
comparison so all it is just a static
page here pretty much we also have a
fact page which is pulling in this these
fake question and answers here from an
API so we're going to be doing that with
all three frameworks just to get a grip
on you know how things are just set up
from a basic standpoint okay so what we
want to do is you know as within view as
we already covered you can add react to
an existing project or you can start
from scratch and you can do so which is
what we're going to do with the react
command-line interface called create
react app alright so there's not many
features associated with the react to
CLI really it's just for starting
project projects thus you have the name
create react app so first we have to
install it so we're going to run npm
install if' and g create react app and
by the way if you're also just kind of
jumping into this video i some as a
beginner then you do need to have npm
with nodejs installed so head on over to
node J s org if you don't have it and
download it and then reload your console
and you'll have access to MPN ok so
after that we're going to go ahead and
access create react app in order to
create natural project because right now
we just installed globally which is the
hypeeeee in G
since our I flag now we have to access
it and actually use it to create a react
app so create react app and based on the
previous naming convention from the view
project will use compare - instead of
view we'll use react hit enter alright
it just finished for me by the way I
paused it that's why I went so fast and
then we could see based on the
instructions at the top we can see D
into it and then run NPM start which
will build out the project and launch it
in the browser and here it is at local
local toast is that localhost 3000 all
right so here in the in the next section
we're going to go
ahead and start working on structuring
the components and kind of getting a
feel for how everything is set up and
laid out here in react okay so here in
Visual Studio code you can use whatever
code editor you want here is the project
that we just created and we're in the
compare reacts folder okay so somewhat
of a familiar set up based on view Jas
and it's also pretty similar when it
comes to an angular project we have our
node modules folder here because we're
using node.js for this which all three
use we have our public folder here we
don't have to worry about anything in
there but all of our code we reside here
in source and as you can see it's very
simple the CLI creates just seven files
here initially and I won that thing
that's a little bit strange to me is
there's a folder organization for
instance we have a logo graphic just
stuck in here with over here would have
been a little bit better if they could
create an assets folder off the bat but
really first world problems right not a
big deal so I the main files that we
need to worry about all your components
there they're just declared in just
typical JavaScript files ojs right here
we'll see we also have an index that j/s
here and this is what really helps get
the project loaded up we can see that we
have a react on we have a render and we
have our app ID passed in and this is a
reference to the component right here
fjs alright so the name of it is of
course is class app and then we're
exporting app to be used there in index
J yes so I there's a few differences
although also a lot of similarities when
we're comparing these frameworks on
libraries to each other so at the top
which is consistent with all three of
them we have our imports up here one
thing that's pretty and quite different
on that sets react apart from angular
and view is we have a DES class app
extend component really for angular this
sort of thing I want to say sort of
thing but within your class
is really just designated for being
solely for your component code but when
we have our class app extending here of
the upper component we have both the
template which is defined right here
within this return so all your
templating your HTML although
technically this isn't HTML it is JSX
and I'll discuss that slightly in a bit
goes right here within this return and
then your component logic largely lies
outside of render right here so if you
want to call or hook into component
lifecycles for instance you would do it
out here and we will do that once we
develop our little landing page app all
right so I also your styling you simply
import your your CSS file up top so in
terms of inline styling that's something
that's not done here in react so we
simply imported at the top okay so I
what we want to do is create just to
bring about more structure I don't want
all of my component files you know being
relegated into the same directory I
we're going to create a folder called
components all right and inside of
components we're going to create just a
few different component folders
additionally based on our needs so let's
head on over to Adobe XD so I can show
you the layout real quickly once again
alright and here's the layout that we've
been we already designed and already did
in view and if we try to think about
this in terms of component structure
again this is going to be the same thing
as view if you followed along there
first we have our whole app interface
and this is really where we would
structure everything and we would
consider it the actual app or in other
words this right here this is the
starting point of the app I going
further into that that we have our
header here navigation we also have a
footer these are two elements of our
layout that we want to remain this
we want to remain present in all pages
so we can create components out of those
and then we have this middle section
here our content section and this would
be the content that's shown you know
whether at the home page and then this
inner content here is where they would
be shown when they're at like for
instance a FAQ page so there's really
three different things happening here we
have a header we have this intersection
here and then we also have a footer so
let's go ahead and create these elements
consistent with that so back when we
were working within view we didn't
create components specifically for
header in footer we could we just stuck
it right here and not not this far
because we're working with a different
but in terms of structure we didn't
create components here I'm going to show
you how to create components out of
those headers and footers just for two
different purposes just to show you how
to import or nest in another component
but also to show you how to create two
different types of components one is
stateless which I will explain shortly
so what we want to do is go ahead and
create these files real quickly so the
first rather folder so the first folder
we'll call header and inside of here
we're going to create a few files
alright so first this header is going to
be heterogeneity create another one this
will be footer create another one oops
we don't want to create inside of there
we'll create another one for FAQ and
then finally one more for home keep on
doing that sorry about that all right so
we have our two pages here for home and
footer or sorry home in fact rather and
then also our header in footer all right
so the first thing of course will focus
on momentarily is the header section
alright so
what we'll do is an app jas real quickly
we're going to going to just change
things up to slightly here within the
template so I'm going to get rid of
everything between this app class tag
here and by the way when it comes to JSX
you can see that some slight differences
for instance when you have a div and
you're trying to specify a class it's
not class equals apps class name equals
app very important otherwise your app
will break alright so one thing we need
to do is import the header so at the
very top we did create that header file
already so I'm just going to copy this
real quick actually we'd only need logo
so I'll just change that real quick so
import header from components header and
header alright great so we'll save that
and inside of let me take this real
quickly ctrl a ctrl C to copy all let's
go over here and just paste this in now
for our header we're going to get rid of
that and we will also include a header
CSS file a little bit later but we're
not going to worry about that for now
all right so we need to change this here
to header and we also have to export
header right here
so inside of here I'm going to do is
just type in my header and save it now
let's go back to our app KS and inside
of here what we want to do is import
that header component that we just
created so to do that very simple just
come in here we open up like it's a HTML
element essentially so header and close
it out like that so we'll save and this
is what the app should look like so far
very ugly but let's keep on going anyhow
so we also want to create a footer so
here we'll create footer at this point
the app will break because we didn't
actually create the file so let's take
this we're going to copy that and for
our footer let's create a new footage a
s alright and we're going to paste that
in alright so remember when I mentioned
I there's two different type of
components in react we have a stateless
component I this right here is a
stateful component so you have stateless
and stateful and when it comes to your
stateful components which is what we've
been using right here so far the way
they are declared is we import react and
component from react now if we want to
transform this to a stateless component
then we remove the component import and
we also change this line right here so
the way we do this is instead of class
header extends component we do Const
fitter the name of our component here
equals function arrow function just like
that and this down here also has to
change as well so what we do is close
that parenthesis and then also the
bracket right here and we also do not
have a render method there all right so
now this is has been transformed from a
stateful to a stateless component now
long story short use a stateful or a
stateless component rather when it comes
to components that you know aren't going
to need any type of access to what's
called the state or any type of really
functionality okay so for our footer we
know there's nothing really happening in
our footer aside from just static
template information all right so right
down here I'm going to change this to my
footer okay and we also have make sure
we export footer
then we'll go back to our app das and
we're going to import footer this will
be footer I keep on doing that with my
caps log sorry about that guys
there now we can go back to our app and
we have my header and my footer now a
little bit later on we're going to
inside of here put in our routes which
will load our two components of which
being home in fact but before we get to
that in the next section we're going to
focus on integrating our Balma CSS
responsive framework alright so we'll
get started then okay so well the next
step in order to integrate Balma which
is a CSS runner framework is to use NPM
and to install it in order to give our
app local access to the Balmer framework
now this process is the same across all
three of the frameworks and libraries
that we're using which is react view and
angular so to do that we're gonna head
on over to our console and I'm going to
create just a new console window so I
don't have to keep on I'm starting or
running this NPM start command and by
the way I'm using a console app called
CMD ER commander you can just google
that and I what we'll run here is by the
way let me get into the correct folder
well run npm install Balma and save it
as a dependency in our package our JSON
file and by the way if you're kind of
hopping into this video without watching
the previous lessons here in the course
then um balm is just a growing in
popularity in terms of being a
responsive front-end framework so I'm
starting to like it and use it myself
alright so now it is saved so now it has
been created here in a folder somewhere
a node
Jules okay so actually I'm going to find
that real quickly just to show you one
thing real quick where you add balm on
there we go
because IBAMA comes with just you know a
straight-up CSS extension if you want to
import that which is it's relocated
right here or a SAS version if you want
to use SAS the preprocessor SAS so we're
going to use SAS because we did that
already in view so it requires just I a
few extra steps to make sure that that
works so by default when you create a
react app here with your create react
app command-line interface it's set up
just to work with straight-up CSS as we
can see so we have to modify a couple
things in our package to JSON file if we
want this to work correctly so I just
pause to bring up here let me just show
you at the very top we're here at the
create react app github official dock
page and I basically this will just give
you a few lines that you need to paste
in along with some instructions on how
to i click on this where is it going why
is it not going there there you go there
you go right here in terms about what
you need to do in order to get SAS
compiling up and running so as it
mentions in package to Jason we had the
following lines to scripts so we added
these two right here so copy those we're
going to paste them we'll get rid of the
little plus signs here and then also if
you scroll down on that same page we'll
find that we have to also remove the
standard start and build and add these
right here so start build we'll go ahead
and delete those pasted in with it
instead this right here alright so now
we can go ahead and save this
right so now we can create an app dot
SAS file or s CSS if you wish and I'm
going to use SAS extension simply
because Balma is set up to work with SAS
so I'll just keep things consistent so
just click on one of these files
randomly create a new one called
app SAS all right and then inside of
here this is where we're going to
actually import the Balma SAS library
alright so the location is going to copy
this in real quick is import node
modules Balma balm dust ass and then
also balm let's set up to work with font
awesome so we're going to import that as
well and font awesome is used for icons
quick access to a ton of different icons
all right so we'll save that and I'm
going to exit out of here hitting ctrl C
and just hit Y and then hit the up arrow
and NPM start all right so we have an
issue here and that's because we want
we've got one step and we need to
install and base by the way I skipped
over this one we're at the github page
just momentarily you have to run NPM
install save as a dev defense and that
dev dependency NPM run all all right so
that's we're on NPM start now oh yeah I
keep on doing this I am horrible sorry
about that there's another command that
we need to install or package rather NPM
install node SAS choke adder and they
say that as a dev dependency as well
yeah sorry I promise when we run NPM
start again it is going to work all
right now we're going to run NPM start
there we go all right cool all right so
now I'm going to go back to our editor
here and if we click on app dot CSS
we're going to notice that we have our
framework imported right here alright so
the reason it's doing that is because
app dot SAS it will take this it will
compile it all down to app dot CSS all
right so we don't really change anything
in here we still import even though
we're using SAS we still import app CSS
right here alright so that's it I in
terms of integrating our ball mount
framework and inside of these folders by
the way we will create SAS files and
once we save those SAS files it'll
create you know from food or SAS it will
create footer CSS and then inside of
footer for instance we will import
footer CSS to work with the the CSS that
was compiled from the SAS file
alright so now in the next section we're
going to focus on the very top of the
layout just because it makes the most
sense and that will be within our header
component here in getting that looking
more like this up here alright so let's
work on this header now now if you
follow along with the last section of
the course when we created the view app
well I really don't want to have to
rewrite all the HTML I've for everything
again so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to open up that project the view
project I'm going to copy the HTML and
make it work here in react so again if
you want you know if you want to be able
to follow along and kind of understand
essentially you know all the HTML
process then watch the view section of
this course alright so here I have the
view the app dot view and this really
has the header portion of top going to
create or copy rather everything from
div nav hash shadow all the way down
right to here just above the router view
section so once I do that I'm going to
real quickly create a new file the
we're going to copy in or replace rather
every instance of class and change it to
class name so create a new file it
doesn't matter the name because we're
going to delete it just going to copy
this or paste this in rather and right
here I'm just going to select class
control F and we're going to replace and
we click on this little button right
here to class name and click on this
button and I'll change them all to class
name as need be all right so I'm going
to copy that now select all copy delete
that go ahead and delete that file right
there and now inside of here take this
and paste in everything that we had
there so now if i giving us some issues
here because we have this v on click
stuff happening right here that's super
view so we're just going to delete that
and then also delete this v bind right
there all right cool so of course this
is this won't work as well because we
have router link and that's specific to
view as well so we're just going to
delete that right there so if you have
NPM start still running on your console
and you save that file this is what it
should look like now because remember it
doesn't look like it's the actual full
navigation doesn't have the dark
background because we don't have any CSS
yet working with that alright so what
we'll do let's get our CSS stuff working
as well so what we'll do at the top is
we're going to import a file that
doesn't yet exist and that will be
header is s and then we're also create a
new file in the same folder called
hetero sass alright and again this is
all simply coming from on the previous
view course the review project rather
I'm just using the same sass rule sets
or CSS rule sets that I created before
so we're going to going to paste in this
stuff right here and it's not going to
work yet we have to import our mq sass
file which we haven't yet created by at
the top we want to import a file that
we're going to create out here and
that's our media queries sass file and
so this is something that we had set up
in the previous project and view as well
so out here I'm just going to click on
any of the files and create a new file
called mq sass and I'm just going to
paste in everything that we had there in
the previous so this is just some
initial variables that we want access to
and then there's also some mix-ins for
responsive CSS basically for our view
ports right here so we'll save that
we'll go to here and we'll save that
notice it will create a header CSS file
with all that stuff now written and then
over here we'll save our header KS file
to alright so now if you save everything
you'll find that if we go to our app
here that I it's not really we don't
have our background even though we set
it already and that's because we are
going to go to our app dot j s and we're
going to take our import of this app dot
CSS and put it at the top here and that
way it doesn't override the settings
that are in our header and our future
footer so now if we go back after saving
that we'll see that I now we have our
header working here properly okay so
next step is within our header J s into
template remember we moved the four
links here so those links again are
basically right here so in order to get
these working properly we're going to
set up a routing and we'll sort of work
backwards and we'll just start here in a
header jf or by using the link attribute
here so link two and this is the URL
class name is nav item and sorry about
that and our - item and this is going to
be the home so again we don't use
regular a H refs or anything like that
we're going to copy this and we'll paste
it three times this is going to be
features about and FAC this will be
simply oops we're going to point all
three to fact because we're not going to
bother making all these pages now we
also have to import link at the top so
import link from and react router Dom so
we'll save that and now it will error as
I intended because we do not have react
router Dom installed so we're going to
install that real quickly in the console
so we'll come over here npm install
react router Dom and we'll save it as a
dependency alright once that's finished
we're going to go back to our project
here and we're going to head out over to
our index J s file and we have to import
a browser router from the package that
we just installed so that looks like
this right here so import browser outer
from our package that we just installed
and that we have to make a couple
adjustments here just under the app
portion all right so I'll tab this in
and this is going to be we're going to
reference what we just imported it's a
browser router and the app goes inside
of it browser router all right that
looks good we'll save it and now we see
our links here which you know don't work
they don't go anywhere because we
haven't set up the routes yet
so let's do that real quick in our app
j/s alright so like I mentioned before
these go straight here in the middle
okay so what we do is reference route
which we're going to have to import at
the top and for the home page or just
the root page we're going to set exact
to path or sorry to true and path to
just a forward slash and the component
that we're going to load for that URL is
the home component alright so we haven't
yet imported so we have to import both
of those at the top both the route and
home so we're going to import route from
the react router dome package and then
also real quickly let's copy this footer
I'm also going to copy and just paste
that twice this is going to be fact from
fact back and then also home from home
or footer right there at home home
alright so not all these files are
created though so fact there's nothing
in there and homes nothing in there so
let me just real quickly create that so
we have our header right here I'm just
going to you know one real quick tip I'm
going to show you actually is if we
create a file we'll just call this home
KS here in Visual Studio code if you
head on over to this section right here
and you type in react for instance I
you'll see that we have all these
different you know packages that we can
install right here and we have code
snippet so you can install any of these
or some of these and they'll give you
access to certain just shorthand
commands so for instance we just created
a new component if I type in RSC this
will create a stateless for instant
for instance react component so remember
I talked about you know this type of
stateless component well there we go we
type in our SC and we get that well if
we type in our C C we'll see we have a
react component and this is a stateful
component alright just a quick tip there
so we'll save this here I'll just call
this here in the middle home and we'll
give this a name of home or here and
also export it I'll take all this stuff
and just copy it we'll go to our faq
page and create a new file called FAC GS
and FAC here here here and here
alright so now you've seen the browser
if we're at the home page we'll see it
says home now because this is all the
content that's inside of our home
component fact doesn't yet load anything
because we haven't imported that into
our app J s file so just underneath this
we're going to reference route the path
is /faq and then component equals FAC so
we'll save that go back to our project
and there we go you can now see fat
corresponds with FAC in home is over
here alright great so now in the next
section we're going to focus on getting
this footer down here working alright so
you can see here we have I just a simple
footer down here so let's work on that
real quick so let's go back to our code
editor or visual studio code and what
we're going to do now is I come over
here to our footer j/s and remember this
is a state list component and let's
import real quickly our forward slash
footer dot CSS which doesn't exist
save that let's also go ahead and create
a footer sass file
alright so in our SAS file we don't have
much happening this is all we have
happening just a reference to footer and
the icons so we'll save that create our
CSS file poun saving alright so where it
says my footer we're just going I'm just
going to paste in real quick the HTML
that we created in View and I also ran
through the process that we covered
earlier of replacing the class to class
name alright so just in here I'll paste
that in like that we don't have to give
it a class name of app or anything like
that so you can delete that and save it
and now our app looks like this very
cool so back and home alright so another
thing that doesn't work is if we drag
this in our responsive navigation
remember we got rid of all that view the
view directives to make this click stuff
work and show the actual mobile menu
let's go ahead and make that work real
quickly as well so let's go ahead extend
this back over here and we're going to
head on over to our header j/s so now
you may be wondering if you're new to
react I know we already discovered so
far how we handle for instance user
events like click events in view well
how do you handle quick events for
instance in react all right so this
right here the span class nav toggle
that is the CSS or the HTML and CSS is
responsible for creating that little
hamburger icon menu so right here when
someone clicks on it we add on click
equals and then we use our interpolation
brackets and this time we just use a
single bracket as opposed to two which
is what you do in view in angular but in
reaction simply one and then we
reference this dot handle click and by
the way when it comes to
this right here when it comes to a
stateless component such as in our
footer which is a stateless we don't
have access to this by the way just
something to going to be aware of also
before I move on to this section over
here we'll go ahead up top and we're
going to create our handle click method
so just right here we'll put in handle
click we reference this dot set state
and then the previous state inside of
here we're going to reference is toggle
on and then the previous state is toggle
on all right so this is just going to
toggle back and forth I what we need to
do first is work within a constructor up
here we pass in our props or properties
react we call them props we run super
props this dot state equals is toggle on
and we set it to false by default then
also underneath here this dot handle
click equal to this dot handle click dot
fine and this so a lot of high probably
confusing stuff happening right now now
I'll explain it momentarily though
looking at this make sure everything is
good to go alright so let's say this
real quickly I got to fix this typo now
we'll save that and basically what's
happening here is on click it's going to
call our handle click method right here
and we're using this set state and this
is toggling back and forth is toggle on
from true and false essentially and so
if we ran it now and we clicked it
nothing would happen that's because this
menu right here we have to add or attach
in is active class onto it based on when
this is clicked all right so to do that
just after render right here we're going
to create a property called menu active
select menu active equals this state dot
is toggle on we're using a ternary
operator here so so we add the class is
active otherwise simply nothing all
right so then just over here for our
class name what we do is get rid of this
and we're going to put them in
interpolation brackets and I'm going to
put in what was just there which was nav
right and nav menu and then space and
then end a single quote and we put menu
active that we just declare it up top
like that so now we'll save it and if
you bring your browser in enough to see
this mobile navigation we click it and
there we go we have access to our stuff
down here our drop down navigation
alright so also if you recall if you
fall along on the first part we this
changes to an X if is active as added as
well all right so let's do that so we'll
just come right here I'm going to copy
this just way up the basic scaffolding
right here
remember it's called nap toggle that's
the current class name so we'll just
replace all that with nav - toggle and
save so now we'll go back click on it
and now it changes to our X and the
animates like that awesome ok so now
obviously the bun huge eyesore is this
home component and we want to take that
and turn it into this section right here
alright so that'll be the next section
alright
so we're going to make this ugliness
once again I look like this here in the
middle for our home component now notice
there is a graphic here so we're going
to have to import from the project files
any clouds dot jpg and then assets
folder alright so let's go and do that
real quick before we start working on
our home j/s component so within I this
source folder we're going to create a
new folder called assets and here visual
studio code allows you to right-click we
can reveal an explorer and I'm going to
simply from the project files which you
can download clouds jpg okay so now
let's head on over to our home j/s and
again this is very straightforward the
only thing we're going to be doing here
is just defining properties for our
heading and subheading which are right
here in here and the only reason I'm
doing that is just to show you basic
interpolation and so we did that with
view Jaso I want to show you how to do
it here as well in react I so just to
define those two properties real quickly
very simple all we're going to do is
right after inside of render we're going
to put let heading equal soaring to new
heights and then also let sub hiding and
we just have some warm up some text here
very simple alright so we'll save that
now I I already did the HTML for this
into view so they would be rather
redundant for me to go through that
again if you want to see that whole
process oh you know how to structure
these columns and the layout based on
the Balma CSS framework then just go
ahead and watch the view section of that
because when even when it comes to
angular I'm not going to retype all that
stuff so I'm going to paste in just the
hero section I which is this bit of HTML
right here alright so for our hero
section if I go ahead and save this and
we take a look at the browser we will
now see that I we have soaring to new
heights now it doesn't really look like
our mock-up simply because of two
reasons well first I we don't have
our CSS setup for this home Jaso let's
do that real quick I just so that we can
actually see it looking more consistent
with our mock-up so import home CSS save
it will create a home CSS file or sass
file rather just head on over actually I
have a sass file already off-screen on a
separate project someone's going to copy
and paste that in real quickly so again
this is all consistent with what we did
with view and again if you want to see
me hand typing all the stuff out and go
back to the early part web portion in
the course and save this and now there
we go now it's looking a lot better in
terms of uh being consistent with the
prototype that we did alright so now
let's I focus on this content here so
I'll simply just paste in the rest of
that so we'll go back to our home j/s
and after this section right here i'm
going to paste in that so i paste it in
the wrong content one second there just
pasted it again
alright I'm going to save that and we'll
go back to our content and here we go
one thing that's looking problematic is
the font it's not actually using our
right font let me get this in our index
I'd CSS see if that helps fix the issue
or not alright there we go much better
alright alright so the final section
here is going to be our FAQ page in
getting that working and we're going to
use the Axios HTTP client library which
we used in view and i want to show how
to use it here in react to grab from a
public API just a mock fictional you
know question and answers for a FAQ page
alright I'll see you then okay so let's
go ahead and get that FAQ page up and
running so again this looks like this
and so we will grab all this stuff from
an API so first we're going to use Axios
like I mentioned and we're going to
install it with NPM so install
Axios and save alright so now let's go
over to our FAQ component which is fact
ijs first let's get some initial setup
done typically we go to our header GIS
real quick and grab just a simpler I'm a
little bit lazy I don't want to type it
all out by hand so fact that CSS will
create a fact sass file alright that
looks good for the facts sass there's
really not much so what I'll do is just
we don't need access to the media query
import line so I'm just going to paste
this in and save it you can pause by the
way and copy this otherwise you can grab
it from the view project if you follow
along there alright now let's go back to
our fact jas and so the first thing that
we're going to do is I'm just going to
paste in some of the template or all the
template stuff rather then we'll focus
on the logic stuff in terms of grabbing
an API object from or JSON rather from
Axios or with access so what we'll do
paste right here alright so let me just
tab these in real quick
so between those two divs that we have
going and what we have so it's just the
you know this typical stuff is for the
FAQ and we have a subheading here and
then we have a div class of columns and
in here is where we take the object that
we're eventually going to define up here
and grab and this is how in react that
you iterate through an iterable in a
sense so everything inside of here is
going to be repeated based on this facts
property right here and which is going
to be you know JSON and so for each one
of the results it will spit out this and
we're using interpolation here for a
title and a body of D
answering question okay oh by the way
this should not be here
that was for view alright cool so now up
here in order to make all this work I we
have to define a constructor again and
pass in properties or props and then we
run super props by the way I didn't
really describe it before but when you
use super props here when you want to be
able to access this dot props for
example in the constructor so after that
we define this dot state equals an
object here and we pass in a property
it's going to be a type of an array all
right sorry about that
just trying to put a semicolon there at
the end and then we access a react
lifecycle by component did mount and in
other words when the component loads
then executes what is ever inside of
here so this is where we have to first
import Axios from Axios just a package
we installed and then the if you
followed along for the view GS portion
this is almost pretty much identical so
who put Axios yet and then we pass in
the URL of the API so I'm using the JSON
placeholder type a code comm and we're
grabbing the posts right here and by the
way you can visit this URL just to see
what the sites like it's just you know
allows you to create or access an API
and then we run then response to a
constant of FAQs equals res response
data and then we're going to run slice 0
10 just to get 10 results the first 10
results and then this does set state we
pass in facts
all right great so let's save that we go
back to our project and there we go
we're at our FAQ page we'll click on
home all that jazz looks good let's go
to our FAQ page and there we go the
first 10 results alright so now you
probably have enough to go on you know
just to ascertain the very basic and
standard and core concepts and
differences between react in view j/s so
now we have one more left which is
angular so we're going to see you know
how we correct construct this same
project and how we do these basic things
like you know handling user events like
clicks and also property and style
binding and also grabbing information on
our data from an API alright so we're
going to be doing all that in angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
