today I wanted to make a real important
video that I've been meaning to make for
quite a while and that is the
announcement that I'm not going to be
sticking with a goal that I stated so I
hope some of you who've been following
me for a while don't get pissed off all
right so basically at the beginning of
the year 2014 january first I put out a
video with a statement that i'm going to
be recording a video every single day of
2014 or at the end of 2014 to have 365
videos recorded well currently there's
men 168 days in 2014 and I have 169
videos including this one so I've stuck
with that proved that I could stick with
something especially through some pretty
difficult times I member my wife had
pneumonia and my other two kids were
cute kid and it was so difficult because
i put this commitment on myself to
record a video every single day and then
also the time when i started getting
dizzy and ringing in my ears and I was
starting to faint practically and
realized I had high blood pressure I
mean just look at what I used to look
like two and a half months ago so yeah
I've made some big changes in my life to
negate that high blood pressure i've
lost like 25 pounds already in two
months but anyhow i even through all
that I stuck with this whole video every
single day and I've proved myself I
could do it now the reason I'm quitting
our stopping that Appa commitment
basically it's because I've started to
realize and it's become kind of evident
to that it's really difficult to do a
video every single day when we're
talking about web design or logo design
or identity design because the topics
are starting to become a little bit
exhausted and secondly because to really
put out a very good tutorial you have to
spin
then time really preparing in multiple
multitude of ways first you have to make
sure the I content is accurate so you
have to do research and then second you
have to actually prepare the project
that you're about to teach in advanced
and if you want it to be a really good
project you can't just not get out
within a few hours that day so my goal
is my new goal is is every video
tutorial that I put out I want it to be
something that all the big design sites
want to share or even adobe photoshop on
there I their various social accounts
will want to share and so that means you
know instead of doing every single day
it may just be once weekly or maybe a
little bit further but in terms of my
frequency of videos it's definitely
going to be at least once every week I
probably twice or maybe three times so
it's not going down you know to consider
will be because I'm still going to do
the weekly design course challenges so
there will be an announcement video plus
the preview video I'm still planning on
doing the different series that going to
be putting out one's going to be called
design course revised where I visit
other websites and I revised portions of
the designs and their logos possibly so
yeah so that's it so I'm not really this
isn't a decision that I'm making and
feeling really really guilty about
because ultimately everyone's going to
benefit by this and also um you can also
check out design course a comp / forums
to check out the forums because I'm
going to be there every day as well to
answer questions that you have you go on
to post on there or whatever and of
course I'm also going to be focused on
design poems premium and design course
premium members alright so that is it
i'll stop rambling that was kind of long
so yeah check out these not course calm
