design course calm with the review of
the twenty-first design course calm
design challenge and this time it was
where a word mark logo design for a
fictional company called pure cig which
is basically an electronic cigarette
company fictional entirely of course I
initials a popular form of smoking now
without ingesting actual tobacco so a
word mark of course is something that's
heavily focused around the type essing
here by the examples I the submission
deadline was yesterday so it's quick on
the review this time around which I will
try to be from here on out alright so
let's get started here we had a decent
amount of submissions alright so
designer HD 2015 first off big no-no
that the the background here just try to
keep it plain white honor or a solid
color at least of some form otherwise
it's going to take away from the concept
I other big no knows we have here we
have I the pure cig type here I'll give
the bevels inside you have a stroke you
have drop shadows all completely
unnecessary remember look at these very
simple flat that's what you want and
then with the this cigarette it looks
like an actual cigarette not in a like a
vaporizer so complete no go here try to
reexamine your approach and just take a
look at some of the other examples here
there's one that's pretty good near the
middle I and I will make a note of that
alright so yeah thanks for the
submission anyhow right so we have
another one here I so yeah definitely
simple we have a couple issues though in
terms of white space I in margins so we
can see the letter spacing between P you
are in E and then we have this real
close sort of I space here a lack of
space rather kind of throws off the flow
of the logo now of course another big
concern with this is you actually do
want to have the name you can include
this symbol separately i would say I
though it wouldn't be a word mark
anymore so the word mark it's kind of
important
you know the business name is there and
not just interpreted because a lot of
people who may not even know that this
is a vaporizer company would look at
this and say P or what alright so that's
the one thing I would focus on I in term
terms of I everything else you did it
well by keeping it simple big contrast
up here so I thanks for that and here's
another one from the same individual and
yeah this one's a little bit more
readable in terms of what the name is
but we just have a cert you know just a
really tall block like this and it's
going to be a little bit difficult to
place this on certain mediums when it's
this tall i would say additionally it's
not kind of obvious just by having a
long rectangle like this that it's an
actual I or a vaporizer I like the
simplistic approach though so you're
doing that right alright so another one
all right so turn the eye into an
electronic cigarette try to connect the
P and the G alright so it's not too
obvious we you know about what this
portion is here this I just charcoal
dash right here I and how they're
connecting to P&amp;amp;G for parental guidance
I'd so I'm not sure if that idea is
relevant secondly looking at this I hear
I you know this logo you're showing it
kind of large so imagine for example if
it's being used on the website chances
are it's going to be a little bit
smaller than this maybe by like 75 or
twenty-five percent smaller than this
when you scale it down that much more
this little tiny power switch or power
on status is going to get lost it's just
too small so i would probably get rid of
that and then additionally this vapor
and smoke portion up here it kind of
looks like it's blurry a little bit and
you kind of want to stay away from
blurriness when it comes to logo design
you want to stick with solid shapes okay
so i like the idea you know that you're
trying to cuvee but i think the
execution p could be worked on alright
but thanks for that alright so I by the
way I need to fix us I transition
hosting recently and anybody who tries
to get a custom avatar it's not working
i'm gonna try to fix that soon alright
so i let's see replace the eye with an
ad server app which is what the
individual but that above did and
heart symbolizes smoke who is not
pollutant so I I would say this little
bit more obvious that it's a cig
vaporizer just because it has a little
bit of notches in it the heart could
probably be worked on a little bit I
just because it looks a little bit I not
uniform and not symmetrical so I would
even try to maybe even do it's a heart
that looks like it's kind of smoke 'ish
in a sense and I think it would be a
little bit better and so everything else
though in terms of simplicity you are
definitely doing it well alright so
thanks for that and looking at here
let's see here we have no comments so
yep pure cig I would say you're showing
it on this darker turquoise background
it clashes too much with this I this
orange color essentially there's not
enough contrast and it just seems like
this probably should be a little bit
brighter or change the background maybe
just to a white and make this black
anyhow I aside from the colors I'm not
Tuesday this you know it's not too bad I
actually kind of look at if you look at
it it kind of does look like a cig and I
think choosing this color kind of
emulates a traditional cigarette the
part where you smoke it or you put your
mouth on so I interesting concept I do
like it all right right and another one
same 1i so the issue with this is I you
know you have this tiny little kind of
charcoal dashes right here it kind of
just doesn't feel like it's a part of
the logo you know you have this strong
type here but then you have this small
thing off to the side it's not too
evident about what exactly this is is or
what's happening here so I try to work
on trying to keep things a little bit
more uniform in a sense all right so
thanks for that all right so looking at
this I too much happening unfortunately
I we have I didn't it the name once
again inside of this this cigarette
vaporizer that's a definite no because
again this is already a large logo so if
you scaled it down if it's shown on a
website you're going to lose this and
it's
you're not going to be able to see it or
read it and so just becomes like
cluttered mess so I would remove that
for sure I would simplify the design of
this as well just because again you you
scale it down it's not going to look
great with in addition to all these
lines that you have here way too
redundant you won't you only really want
to work on just you know if you're going
to have something like this do only off
one of the letters perhaps when you add
it to all these you know various parts
of the other letters it becomes
cluttered so we want simplicity all
right otherwise thanks for that I some
someone was having a hard time post
right there obviously I so pure sig I
let's say look at the idea it deals that
you posted relation of simple in nature
so give it a simplistic look in a very
basic implied line paired with lines to
signify heat to get the shape of an
electronic cig within the modified see
and I all right so looking at this the
biggest issue I would say is this area
right here I there's not enough white
space between you know the white portion
right here and above the two little red
strips so I would have opened those up a
little bit more because otherwise once
again if you scale this down a little
bit more it's going to be a little bit
more cluttered so if you're going to
have something like this you want to
have a lot of white space between the
different lines I that come close
together so you want to space them out
further I asked for it being I obvious
that it's a a vaporizer right here going
through the area it's a little stretch I
mean most people are going to look at
this and they're not going to see that
so I would try to work on maybe I having
just like a black line at the bottom I
kind of give it form and maybe that
might work a little bit better all right
otherwise I like the idea that you're
trying to convey so good job all right
next on what we have here I actually
like this I I like the idea behind it
but I think there's just a little bit
too much happening with the G because I
understand what you're doing obviously
this is kind of just smoked or vaporized
vape vapor essentially but I think
they're just having a little bit too
many and this thing coming up here
trying to connect
the I I would definitely get rid of that
because we'll know this is an eye
anyways I and I think it would just
simplified it a little bit more while
still keeping the same idea of you know
the smoke feel or the vapor fill and it
would be pretty good all right so thanks
for that and looking right here I again
if you can submit another concept in the
future make sure that it's a little bit
bigger than this just so I can see a
little bit better but looking at this
yeah I like the idea you're taking it e
and an abstract eating and you're
combining with the idea of vapor or
smoke in a sense so with that said
that's a pretty good concept I do like
that just make it bigger next time
alright so hope discounts oh of course
accounts you submitted it I but there
are some issues here so the biggest
issue we have here is the the vapor
that's coming down here it's not uniform
it's not smooth you can kinda see it
just kind of looks very I what would you
say not uniform and not smooth
essentially so I in plus you have
several of them coming out here and
they're not really I there's not enough
space in between them so if you scaled
that down it's going to look like a
blurry mess between these individual
lines and then also i'm not a fan of the
I being real tall like this it kind of
throws off the rest of the type I'm but
you could definitely work with this idea
and improve it big time just by making
these more smooth with the Bezier tool
with a pen tool and also working with
this type here and trying to make it a
little bit more uniform bringing this in
all right so thanks for that all right
there's another one I you know this has
potential but again we have this issue
here with the the vapor kind of coming
up here and this tiny little notch right
there then you have something that small
it's going to be indiscernible with
smaller sizes and it's just going to
kind of clutter things so I try to stick
with maybe just one of this this one are
here and also making it smoother with
the pen tool trying to get a nice smooth
curve curvature on your angles here I
having said that like I said if you
improve that part maybe bring the
letters together just a tad bit I think
it would be a pretty good solid concept
all right so look in here okay so I
let's see here I would say you know it's
fine to overlap ladders as long as
they're readable and they are but the
issue here is there's not enough space
between you know we have this this I the
stroke right here it seems like a gnome
only might be two or three pixels I was
staying increase that maybe just 5 to 7
pixels because again if you speak out
scale this down it's going to be blurry
there and then they're going to kind of
bleed into each other essentially same
thing with this just a little bit more
space in between them I haven't said
that looking at this I I would probably
keep the same I you know how you're
separating letters currently like with
the white space I would do that as well
instead of adding like a shadow right
here that you see that way everything is
consistent in appearance all right so
thanks for the submission looking at
this very simple I'm not too sure though
that a lightning bolt sort of thing
would I mean I understand you're okay
you're saying electronic you trying to
kind of think of electronics but I think
more people think of a more like an
organic vapor sort of thing so maybe if
you made it vapor it might be a little
bit more relevant but then that's just I
is a minor gripe not a fat big of a deal
aside from that you have everything else
pretty much good terms of simplicity and
not cluttering things too much so that's
good right looking at this big no-no for
the background again we want try to keep
it a solid color I makes it hard to see
especially this is G over here you have
a light blue and this G kind of hard to
see what this is and right here I see
you I two different concepts i would say
the pier in the sig type they just too
much i think you know you're using two
different entirely different types of
fonts in that clutters that creates
clutter so i would stick probably with
this font right here I for the pier and
then additionally you're trying to
convey multiple forms of symbolism I
literally in the logo concept and that
creates for clutter essentially and so
you don't want to try to get too many
ideas put into a logo you want trying to
stick to just one
most of the time I and so when you have
the the vaporizer right here plus you
have this the plug over here I would
stick with one or the other I actually
like this one to just get rid of the
plug over here and keep this font and
it'd be a pretty solid concept all right
all right so looking down here all right
so this individual went all out
obviously I just look at all these
examples here with this custom type here
for the name I mean this person just
went all out and I think they've entered
other contests and I have done very well
in the past with this contest as well
plus got the nail dia the imposition
here I on the vaporizer so I can only
say good things about this I mean just
the fact that it's a custom file it
seems to be a custom font obviously
right here and that's great so if you
can know if you can ever come up with
something that's custom that's awesome
so the idea behind the symbolism right
here a unique symbolism I think this
could be good I this is what basically
makes it unique outside of the type I i
would say at this size I think this is
supposed to be right there on the I
possibly a little bit hard to see that
so maybe just I bring this down a tad
bit so you can see it smaller sizes and
would be perfect so great submission and
thanks for taking the time alright so
moving on to the next one ink pop
designs alright so again we have
multiple forms of symbolism so ideally
we'll stick with one of the other so
because we have a cigarette right here
and then we have a leaf right here I was
like I said try to stick with one
together I'm not too sure that having a
traditional cigarette butt is a good
idea because this is not you know a
cigarette as we know them conventionally
I so maybe I would stick with probably
this right here pure and the lease right
here and aside from that everything else
is good I like the type I like the
simplicity nailed that so good job all
right
they made a fix right there just about
Don pure sig I yeah so when you were
going to in case something like I'm in a
rectangle you wanna make sure things are
aligned up correctly so if you look at
the the space between the Pete left of
the P and over here you have the decent
amount maybe 25 pixels then over here we
have like 10 so you want to keep things
even say anything at the top we have a
decent amount of here but then tiny
amount right here so keep them even
aside from that these two lines coming
off they just don't look very good I
would try to maybe use what's called the
variable width stroke a profile what is
what it's called an illustrator if
that's what you're using and that way it
could start out you know a very small
stroke to a thicker stroke to a small
stroke and that will give it a little
bit better appearance in my opinion so
just those couple things and you'll be
able to improve that I here's another
one I think from the same individual yes
again don't want to have so many of
these copies you want to stick with one
basically and again same comment about
the variable with profile and then I
brahim we have I okay so would it be
nice to see it just a little bit larger
um yeah I kind of I do like the color
choice here it's not too bad looking at
this I'm not too certain though I see
you've used white space within the
letters which is great especially for
word marks I I'm not too sure though
this looks exactly like a vaporizer if
that's what it's supposed to be so I
would maybe try to make it a little bit
more obvious I but is it sad from that I
do like it it has a lot going for it so
thanks for that all right I we're just
reading this real quick all right so
yeah unfortunately I would say this is
not ideal I just because it's you know a
vaporizer shape I it's just a little bit
too dynamic and then you're fitting and
you're sticking in the pure sig text
right in it and it's just it's just hard
for it to look good based on this shape
alright so especially you know if you
are going to put it in here you make
a lot more white spaces so thicken up or
widen I and probably also don't go with
title case just make them all caps pure
sig and get it away from the edges
because it's a little bit too close you
scale that down even more it's going to
look worse in my opinion I and also we
see we have a linear gradient that's
going for this way to this way and it's
just it makes it a little bit harder to
read especially over here when it's a
darker grey against the black so I
probably get rid of that as well I with
that said though thanks everyone for
submitting the entries I can see that
the logo design I challenges are
definitely more popular so we can keep
on doing those if you wish just let me
know what you think make sure you
subscribe here on YouTube you have if
you haven't if you like what I have to
say please thumbs up there's been people
who've been thumbing down almost
instantly when i upload lately i don't
think they like me so yeah i will go
ahead and announce a new challenge here
in a couple days and again if you have
ideas let me know in the comments all
right talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
