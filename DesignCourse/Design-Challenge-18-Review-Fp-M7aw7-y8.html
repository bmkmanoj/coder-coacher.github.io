design course calm and today we're doing
the design challenge number 18 khloga
designed for fictional company called
air coach and it's basically a new
company that gives customers skydiving
lessons alright so the requirements you
know most of you watching this are and
you know these so I'm just going to skip
this the deadline was yesterday so let's
go ahead we got quite a bit of entries
got two pages 30-something entries i
think so i'll move right along now one
thing that we did different in this week
I I required a brief explanation behind
the concept alright so unfortunately
ball fee or whatever did not do that
although we can kind of see you know it
this is a very literal representation
now when it comes to logo design I
prefer try to stay a little bit more on
the unique / abstract is path in terms
of creating the logo and the symbolism
behind it so you know we have a very
literal plane and a person falling out
of it I also don't really like I the
this too close when it comes to I know
there's a separation there's a stroke
around the text but it's still too close
if we were to scale this logo down it
would probably look a little bit blurry
I when it's used maybe on a regular size
for like a website for example so same
thing right here you want to try to
separate your forms a little bit more
than this all right but thanks for the
entry all right so this one to whistle
and wings okay so I looking at this you
wouldn't be able to tell exactly what
this is upon mediately uh looking at it
so that would be my only concern I mean
yeah you can see the whip with the
whistle form but just looking at
initially you had no clue about what
this business is that might be a little
bit difficult to tell so that some one
of the only downsides I actually kind of
like to the type I so yeah thanks for
that submission we have barliss here
okay so first mission I thought it was I
and the something in air maybe a cloud
would suit well I think it's too
simple honestly but I'm not very happy
with it yeah I would say you know this
this cloud shape it's not very unique
especially when you consider other logos
that have clouds in them so I one issue
I kind of I do like the type but I you
have an issue of these two words kind of
just cluttering especially when you have
different color so this this turquoise
sort of color with this white and then
it touches the edge I would move that
over definitely just a little bit though
so yeah thanks for the entry all right
mr. Pierre all right so here's this logo
um you could clearly tell that it is a
whistle and we have a cloud so this is
pretty good symbolism I you know because
you have the coaching aspect and then
you have the cloud I just looking
through this real quickly clean and
minimalistic geometric shapes and that's
all good uh yeah the one thing to be
desired is the type here i would say um
it's just a not much thought it kind of
looks like not much thought has gone
into it and i'm not too sure if i like
the idea that air is a towel size and
coaches not but you know again that's
just a minor gripe but overall pretty
good i think i would have liked to see
maybe a little bit more I saturated
colors perhaps but either way good entry
all right I so let's see here I have
avoided the glitch or cliche air driving
human in Paris suit I instead having a
cloud with this serif font could look
meaningful and simple alright so there's
a few issues here when it comes to the
type and the form so we have the cloud I
and then we have inside of it the coach
and we have these two points
intersecting and it kind of makes it
just a little bit cluttered so I would
try to find a way to separate this
ideally maybe just having air inside of
this cloud and then couch starting or
couch I'm a really really saying couch
coach over here to the right I and this
here I understand the ideas with these
little tails is to symbolize speed
perhaps or following through the air but
looks like these could be done a little
bit better kind of just like three
little lines hanging off the side also
when it comes to creating highlights
like this this is a little bit too thin
I so if you were scaleless now maybe on
the size that you would use on a site it
would become a little bit cluttered I
but yeah otherwise if you to fix a few
of those issues I think it would be a
lot better all right let's see here when
I I'm not going to read this initially
but when i look at this i thought to
myself okay it's kind of like a arcing
parachute thing and maybe like a hand
like grabbing or helping so that's why i
initially thought then I read this I so
the orange shape is a parachute actually
so I'm not sure if we can really get a
parachute out of this although you don't
always have to be literal and I would
say it's better not to be literal most
of the times when it comes to picking
symbolism for logo design I so this arc
I actually kind of like the arc in a way
because in an abstract way it can be
symbolizing a parachute I like the
colors I in the font actually isn't too
bad I I don't like this part here
because it seems like this is italicized
to the left and then just once to the
right I'm not sure I but still overall
it's good that you're trying to be
abstract rather than literal so thanks
for this mission all right over here we
have I more of a little representation
you know which is fine but the one thing
I would say is you know you have I kind
of like this type down here this coach
type I but then you have air and it's
completely different it's a it's a lot
taller you could tell and a lot thinner
and then you have this line here going
here it seems kind of a little bit
unnecessary especially when you have
sort of a complex sort of shape right
here you want to try to keep everything
else simple so I would say take the same
coach type and make that error I for the
air type as well and things would be a
little bit more simplified and uniform
alright so thanks for the submission all
right so here I'm almost immediately
reminded of Twitter just because they
have a similar sort of bird I understand
the symbolism behind this though because
you have
maybe like a a mother and a child or
something let's see what he said I
experiment bird teaching how to fly to
New be gap so overall not bad I I think
there's probably a way to try to combine
these into more of a single symbol
perhaps moving this one over and having
some maybe like a thicker stroke behind
this and that way it becomes more like
one civil instead of two I but I like
the idea behind it definitely different
all right so I let's see here so I want
to make a logo is fun I as simple as
possible alright so looking at this all
right so it's actually not too bad i
live i love that it's simple I and this
definitely is a unique take on it so I
would say this is pretty effective in
terms of coming up with a concept so I'm
not too sure well I'm not too sure if
this this here this red container is
supposed to be a part of the logo or
you're just featuring it I definitely
possibly scale that down they would have
some issues using that in different area
so it wouldn't be very versatile I but
yeah the concept itself I do like it so
thanks for that alright so I think this
is double post alright so over here this
I'm almost immediately reminded for some
reason of a game I don't know that
probably been some logos in the past
I've kind of used the same sort of
approach so when it comes to being
unique this may not be the most unique I
do like you know assuming I've never
seen a logo like this before I would say
this is really good you know because you
have the wings and it's on the side and
I would definitely say get rid of drop
shadow because that's kind of overused
in this specific usage at least when it
comes to the very soft drop shadow I
other than that I good entry let's write
see here i gwan one let's see I alright
so the symbol depicts a skydiver with a
whistle to represent the company
president in two variants of two color
schemes alright so looking at these I
kind of well
I do like this character like this one
thing that I don't like is too high the
whistle and the mouth you can't really
tell that this is a mouth or that it's
blowing or anything it's kind of stuck
on airs a little bit confusing and the
whistle itself is a little bit complex
when you have all these lines in here
even though this is very simple I like
the individual character itself but not
so much the whistle especially you have
a lot of moving parts here and I it
becomes a little bit more it's not the
same aesthetic is this right here so I
would try to keep that uniform I like
the type though this would be great
without the whistle actually I would say
so yeah thanks for that alright so again
we don't have any type of I explanation
unfortunately for this one I i would bet
that this is an outline of a face that's
probably already been used probably not
custom design so I hopefully that's not
the case because you run into some
issues but assuming that it is hundred
percent unique I it feels separate you
know you have this symbol over here and
then you have this containing container
over here with the type and it doesn't
feel uniform and consistent or you know
as one identifiable mark for a company I
so I would work on trying to you know I
probably get rid of this red in this
blue right here and give this a red or a
blue color for the air coach and then
move the symbolism over more on the same
size and scale as the air coach alright
so thanks for that post let's see don't
think any explanation is needed I so I
was saying couch earlier which is kind
of funny that I this was submitted air
couch as safe as it gets I looking at
this initially i'm not sure if people
would be able to connect the dots
because it is quite abstract which is
good but you can go so far to the point
of which it could be like when i'm not
too certain that i mean i like the idea
that it's very unique and it's a unique
idea I so overall yeah not bad not bad
alright so moving on alright so Eric
this I individual spend a lot of time on
this and I really like it actually is an
abstract symbol I which is great and it
has a lot of I guess you could say
character to it and it's very consistent
with the type and everything else here
so the star sometimes usually in
reference to something that's I like in
the air or airplanes I like that and
look how much this but this person I put
into this is really cool I so skydiver
shooting star and speed these are all
represented into this I concept which I
love very very good so thanks for that
entry so this this is probably the best
entry that we got all right so coming
down here air coach discover your
daredevil i stalked great but hopefully
my answers we get better over time
alright well yet they will I looking at
this you know of course it's a literal
representation I which isn't always
desirable but in terms of everything
else like the alignment and the type I
actually like it I so thanks for that
submission alright so air coach here
again de explanation but I yeah I'm not
sure if this would be to appropriate in
terms of a symbol having kind of like
the the paper airplane sort of thing I
other than that I would say it's not too
bad it kind of feels a little bit not
too consistent in terms of the
appearance you know because you have the
air coach and it's it's circled but then
this is hanging off to the side I don't
know this is one thing that kind of
bothers me I can't really pinpoint it I
but other than that you know if you try
to remember not to use these drop
shadows these soft shadows because just
overdone and the gradient with a gray
going to a dark blue doesn't really look
good either so just try to stick to you
know keeping it simple like these these
displays here that will only help all
right but thanks for the entry alright
so we have a down here we're moving
long all right so first time to
participate all right so nothing really
that's denoting what's going on here so
unfortunately this one is a little bit
too cluttered there's a lot going on in
the background there's not much
separation with the stroke and these
lines down here and I'm not sure what
significance they have in terms of you
know the relevance of the company I so
if you were to scale this down like i
said this would get blurry these lines
inside of here so you definitely don't
want that you would only have more of a
stroke width on the type separating the
design that you have in the background
all right so looking at this I kind of
just reading through this real quickly
the mark itself complements this idea of
air and space wind tunnel all right all
right so it's good that this type is
kept simple I this isn't it actually
isn't too bad what I would like to see
is more separation between these lines
because again if we scale this down a
little bit more it would become a little
bit blurry so just push them away from
each other a little bit more and I think
it would be a little bit more effective
I do like the fact that it comes off the
eye as well so overall good concept and
thanks for this mission all right look
at this air coach okay so the one I
would say the one issue here is there's
way too many lines you know so you could
have taken the route of course of just
going solid shapes instead of having all
these strokes here and there's a lot
going on so ads and creates for an issue
of kind of complexity and clutter I
would say take these get rid of the
strokes and just make them solid colors
I that way it's a little bit more simple
and it's also just a little bit more it
appears stronger in a sense because you
have clearly defined objects instead of
just strokes and outlines same thing
with the the type i would get rid of
this type it doesn't really fit in my
opinion I you know we get rid of the
strokes and I would just make them solid
colors all right but other than that I
understand what you're trying to go with
this and that's good so thanks for that
all right looking at this I the
parachute I but also the blue colors for
the sky all right so
at this yeah it's an abstract
representation of a parachute I and
that's fine looking at this i would say
probably like this version a little bit
better just because it's just a little
bit easier to read you have air and then
this thing and then coach opposed to
just having this or you could have just
moved this over here up to the top so
overall good submission thanks all right
so look at this I look at reading this
really quickly yeah so I understand that
the leg supposed to serve as a part of
the a which is kind of cool I one thing
I don't like it the colors especially
the strings they're blue and it clashes
with this orange color so that's not
ideal alright so definitely find a way
to Remy that because i don't like when
in colors touch each other in this
manner so it kind of creates you know
initiative clutter in complexity so
other than that you know this isn't too
bad again it's apps it's not abstract
it's pretty literal but you know that's
okay thanks for the submission we have a
different one down here I kind of
looking at both of these yeah this may
be a little bit better I would say
ditched lines I do probably be able to
tell that it's a parachute anyways
because the lines do create for a lot of
I complexity so thanks for that alright
so looking at this again another already
put my thoughts on this I kinda this is
very kind of feels very NASA ish i guess
you could say I it's an interesting sort
of type I would say a little bit hard to
read initially just because you know
it's a really sci-fi sort of font so
maybe separating air or in the form of
changing its color to red perhaps might
help that the terms of the concept
already gave my idea about the the paper
plane sort of thing but it is kind of
definitely cool i I'm not sure if I like
the I the this type of red with this
this blue right here but overall good
concept i would say do you have just a
few more here
alright so this person didn't realize
it's not supposed to be any taglines no
big deal though all right so yeah so
this is a word mark which there's a blue
color playing which represents get the
sky color all right so I would say this
is kind of an not ideal because you have
this really large symbol up here which
is obviously an airplane and it's way
too big when you compare it with the
size of the air coach so I would
definitely scale this down a lot and
probably ditch this sort of a shadow or
highlight because you don't have that
highlight anywhere else so it's kind of
confusing and not very uniform and
consistent and then also the parachute
down here not too sure if I like that I
mean this is so big throws everything
off so if this was scaled down a little
bit more it may look a little bit better
in my opinion and I'm not sure if I like
the two different colors here as well
because they're both in the blue sort of
category and ones just different i I
don't assure i think the colors could
use some work and this needs to be
scaled down a lot all right so thanks
for the submission and again I would I
would not do this either because the
lines if you scale this thing down a lot
or maybe by a hundred percent or so
you're going to see that things are
going to start looking blurry with all
these tiny lines so I would definitely
stick more with this opposed to this all
right and this is our last one all right
so no explanation was getting given um
yet see and this is another issue for
some reason this is and for this contest
a lot of people did this I the stroke
with this symbol here is too small to
separate from the air right here alright
so if we scale this down you're going to
see that this stroke will almost vanish
and it will become pixelated looking so
you need to increase the stroke of this
quite a bit in terms of where you placed
it I would probably just move it over
the whole thing this whole symbol right
here so it starts maybe right here and
just cuts off the are instead of going
straight through error
because it makes a little bit hard to
read when it's like that other than that
it's very abstract it's very simple and
I think if we just moved it over it
would be a pretty good concept actually
so thanks for that alright so that is it
look forward to the 19th design
challenge coming soon i'm not sure what
i'm going to do yet seems like the logo
designs challenges are pretty popular so
if you guys want me to keep doing logo
design challenges i will otherwise if
you have other ideas let me know so that
is it check out these encores comfy
haven't yet and subscribe here on
youtube all right goodbye
