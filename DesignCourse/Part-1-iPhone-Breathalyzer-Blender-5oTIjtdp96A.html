today is Jerry 24th without 24th video
of the year and we're going to begin to
the mega tutorial and actually get to
work in blender by modeling our
breathalyzer so as always if you need
access to the final project file that is
available for free in the description
below this video and also please check
out design course calm if you haven't
yet and subscribe here on YouTube
alright let's get started ok so if
you've never used blende blender before
to select objects it's right-clicking to
hold shift you can select multiple
objects to move around in the viewport
you use your middle mouse button or the
third mouse button and to zoom up use
your screw rule and the pan use shift in
your middle or third mouse button
alright so file new I'm going to just
reload that so we're looking at the same
thing we're going to stick with this
cube so we have to make some adjustments
let's go ahead and zoom up a little bit
hold s hit Z to scale it down on the z
axis and it's a writer out there we'll
move it up a little bit and we want to
keep this thing basically a square so
we're not going to change anything else
other than that and so now what we want
to do is make the corners beveled so to
do that we'll drag out this over here
and we'll click on the modifiers add
modifier bevel within segments is
basically what you have to deal with
here for your options now with we're
going to leave their segments I'm going
to leave at f9 looks fine to me all
right and then I'm going to go ahead and
add a subdivision surface it basically
just makes things eyes smooth increase
the view 22
all right okay so so far so good now
what I want to do is hit apply for this
bevel and now what we want to do is add
the circular breathing part that you
would put your mouth on for the
breathalyzer okay so I'm going to click
right great around here this is the
origin point basically wherever you
click is where the object will be added
shift a brings up this menu or you can
just go to add so I'm just going to hit
shift a mesh and we want to add a circle
and I'm going to going to hit our X 90
so oops sorry it's our y 90 there we go
and basically rs4 rotate and then you
have your access is right here which you
can make them rotate on those by hitting
that key and I want to hit s4 scale
scale this thing down quite a bit we can
see it's like not in the correct
position so we can use these and
position it now hit 54 orthographic
we're in perspective mode right here up
here so if you hit 5 on your number pad
we can go to ortho mix it mix modeling a
lot easier okay so I'm going to scale us
down just a little bit more I'm going to
hit 10 actually we're on our I that's
not the front technically so I'm just
going to hit three we're on the right
side all right pretty much in the center
and then we're going to go to edit mode
so object mode you can slept autodesk
you move them you can scale them you can
actually edit the the form so you if you
hit tab you can go into edit mode now
you can see we have three different
options here we can that we have the
vertex mode which is what we're
currently in we have the site or the
edge and then we have the face we want
to go to edge and hit a two who select
all and then we want to extrude this so
we're going to hit e and we're going to
extrude on the x axis X and we want it
just to be right around there not quite
connecting I with our area alright so
now what we want to do is
join these two objects so we're going to
get out of edit mode so hit tab we're
hold shift and right click on this now
we haven't both selected hit ctrl J now
we can see this change this I circle
into something that looks like a lot
smoother circle that's because of this
subdivision modifier so now we need to
go back into edit mode and we need to
connect this to this but there's an
issue we have four sides here and we
have eight here so we need to create
eight edges basically that will allow us
to connect these two things together so
the way we'll do that is will come in
here and we'll hit ctrl R and that gives
us an edge loop this is purple thing and
we left-click once and then we have to
drag it wherever we want it so I'm going
to put it right here for now and then
i'm going to hit three to move this on
my number pad to move this over here
correctly i'm gonna hit ctrl r again
left click bring it right about there
actually I'm you want to move these out
just at a bit so I'm going to hit alt
right click to select that edge move
that out all right and then I'm going to
hit ctrl R on this AI to create a
horizontal and then control are again
right there and then control are one
more time and then click twice so we
have I see how many edges we actually
have we have one two three four five six
well we need another one so ctrl R and
then click twice so now we have to get
rid of the actual faces so we're going
to go to face select mode right click
hold shift and select these four
hit delete and select faces alright so
now we're ready to connect this thing up
so the way we do that we go to edge mode
right click this shift right click that
and then hit F now we got to do this for
all eight edges
oh oh select the wrong one all right now
sometimes you can't see the edge so go
to wireframe there it is and go back to
solid alright so this is how your should
look right now so now i'm going to
create some edge loops control our i'm
going to create one and push it up here
and then left click control our do
another one around here now i'm going to
select all these edges and then extrude
them so to select them alt and right
click so if you just right click it it
gives you the one but i'll click will
select all the ones on the same path
we'll go ahead and hit e and then s4
scale right around there and i'm going
to hit each extrude again and i'm going
to hit s to scale just real tiny and
then again and then x to push it all the
way in it doesn't matter where just so
it's farther up there alright so far so
good now we're going to go ahead and add
the back piece and back pieces where the
actual you know power connector thing
will go so this can be tricky if you
don't do this correctly so what we want
to do is basically add a cube so i'm
going to get out of edit mode and i'm
going to go to shift a mesh cube now
it's real big so we're scale this down
well i'm going to move it up real quick
scale it down hitting s move it over
here
and just move this down I'm going to hit
three now right now that gives us the
the right but to go to left hit control
three and then we want to go to the
front so we can see the side we're going
to hit s + Z to scale this down a little
bit all right control three again we're
going to s and why to go on the y-axis
so you right around there you're also
going to move this over alright so far
so good and that's a pretty well s + X
just a tad bit it doesn't need to be
that thick alright so now what I want to
do is a tab out of here or right now
we're in edit mode so that's okay I
select this and go back to edit mode
with tab we need to kind of figure out
how we're going to join basically neat
member we need an even number of edges
to connect this to okay so what I think
I'm going to do is take all of these the
space is back here and I'm going to
separate them from this object and then
take that resulting object and connect
it to this or join them rather so the
way we'll do this is go to edge mode
where real quickly I'm going to
right-click and just pull this back
timeout we'll go back right click and
tab to go back there I'm just going to
select all these now once or I'll select
it i'm going to hit p and that just
makes it basically separates whatever
object or whatever selection from your
objects so now if we go to edit mode we
have their different objects
i'm gonna move this back right around
there looks pretty decent and i'm going
to select both of them make sure you
don't select this and make sure it's
just this thing that's outlined and then
we're going to go ahead and hit ctrl j
to join subdivision modifier created
this little funky looking thing so it's
a tab okay so i basically i'm going to
hit ctrl r and add an edge loop right
there and then pull out just a little
bit wider than this area control our
pull out around there okay so now i'm
going to hit ctrl R and basically kind
of recreate how many edges there are
from the back piece so yeah I'll just do
this click once put this right here
control our left click this will just
make it kind of quick and easy and
control our to do one right there okay
so you just left click twice now we have
to get rid of and this is very important
get rid of the edges so I want to take
this temporarily not the edges the faces
rather I want to take this temporarily
and hit ctrl L that will select only
this separate object even though they're
both the same because if you hit a and
then a he would select everything so
ctrl L oops just select one any random
thing on here and then hit ctrl L and
back it up Hannity she had to back up
but I basically we want to select these
faces hold shift right click hit delete
and make sure you don't hit faces you
want only basis because I did faces when
I was doing the tutorial and it got rid
of the damn edges to decide to back up
so just make sure it's only faces
and then go to scroll around this one
will hit delete we'll hit faces it keeps
the edge intact now we want to get rid
of these inner edges what I didn't want
to lose was the top one so I'm go to
edge right click all these hit delete
edges alright so now I want to connect
these things up together so I'm going to
kind of keep them far away for now just
because i want to see be able to easily
select these edges so those two right
there we'll hit f1 here and here f F F
right click shift F
right click shift F and then finally
come down here and finish finish this up
this is what your should look like there
should be no funkiness going around when
it comes to this connecting part all
right so it's at seven I want to hit I a
to deselect everything hit be sorry be
left click drag and let's get this thing
oops yeah that's an issue sometimes i
messing i forget about that you have to
click on this that way it will select
everything beneath so it'd be may be
right around there alright so now we
want to start defining this so it looks
a little bit better so I'm going to go
back what we're in age mode so I'm going
to hit ctrl R and I want to add some at
the top left click once and drag this up
right around there pretty close to the
other one hit ctrl R again and we can
drag this in right around there and then
I want to hit ctrl R and right around
here control our do the same thing
alright so far so good now we want to do
the next piece which is going to be its
own object we don't have to merge it
we're just going to push it into there
and that's going to be that metal
connector piece that we see so for the
iphone so i'm going to tap out and
we'll go ahead and start by this time
we're going to do a new technique to
model this little connector and we're
going to do a mirror modifier so we're
going to click around here for our
origin point hit shift a mesh cube hit s
to scale and I'm going to drag this up
at three patrol three rather it s to
scale on these Z Z right around there
get this in here on lined up hit s and y
and we'll move this forward right around
there then we want to do is hit control
three again zoom up here we're going to
hit ctrl R out I wasn't in edit mode
sorry about that hit tab to go to edit
mode hit ctrl R and click once and then
twice and what we want to do is it's
seven a hit d and that gives us the
option to so it's kind of like the lasso
tool in Photoshop and we want to select
actually it's a switch to vertex mode B
select those and then hit delete it
versus and then we want to go back here
to tab into object mode and in here we
want to select mirror and then choose Y
now it mirrors everything over here and
when we start modeling it'll
automatically duplicate what we're doing
so that's a very handy tool probably
should have done it for this over here
so that these edges are correct but
they'll no big deal all right so it's
going to tab to edit mode and it's
probably worth having a reference image
to know how to model this thing
correctly so I'm going to pause this and
find that real quick
and this is basically what we're dealing
with here pretty much there is quite a
bit of detail we're not going to get to
all of it but we will do this here and
let me see there's one that I know
there's few that have like a perspective
view and kind of see how there's like a
ridge here on the edge so I'm just going
to click back to there and we'll maybe
go back and forth a couple times so the
first thing I want to do let's go to
edge mode we'll go ahead and I'm going
to take all these edges here hold all
right click I hate when it doesn't do
that so wanting shift selecting them I'm
going to extrude those so I'm going to
hit e and then why and we'll put it
right actually pretty close and then I
want to take the top one top edge and
push that down then I'm going to take
all these edges and then hit e and why
all right now I wanted to go back to
that reference image real quick
I pause it real quick we can't see it
just kind of goes down to slopes down so
I'm going to pull it out just a little
bit more take that top edge pull it down
right around there and as you can see
everything is still marrying ok and now
what I want to do is I believe on the
side it has I know I saw it when I was
doing this initially and I could do is
go to search tools size large get some
other ones so we can see there's kind of
like a kind of like a a notch thing here
so let's go ahead and do that and the
way I'm going to do with this is hit
ctrl R to add an edge loop left-click
drag it right around here control our
add one at the top control our add one
right there we'll go to face mode right
click and then just delete the face all
right see the same thing over here
alright so now what I want to do is add
in those top notches and the way this
will work is you switch back here sorry
I should be scrolling around no terrible
tutorial all right right here this is
what we want to create so yeah I thought
I'd get big review that all right so
what I want to do is add some edge loops
up here so
I'm going to hit ctrl R we're at a bunch
of these things so control are again and
roughly right around may be right there
and then you know looking back at our
reference image we're going to need one
two three four all right so control are
again right there all right and looking
back here it ends it starts like right
around here it's pretty close to the
edge and then end you know kind of like
in the midpoint so this edge loop is
already pretty good for the distance so
I'm not going to mess with that now I'm
going to add edge loop right here and it
was just right around here i'm going to
add another one though right here
actually before I do that I want to look
real quick at that reference image the
there's a part it kind of sticks up
right here so and it's kind of back
further it's not exactly in the middle
so idle edge loop there wait a second
loop make sure this is working properly
what is going on oh I think it it didn't
do that initial edge loop let me see
here yeah it added one at the bottom but
not the top so that's what that that
craziness is going on pull that out hit
ctrl R again to add it right around here
ok now it's a little bit confusing now
we're going to go to face mode right
click shift select those four hit delete
faces then we're going to take in to
edge mode right click this and pull it
up
all right so it looks like you can't say
anything but that's because it's the
same color down here I but yeah that's
basically correct if I'm looking at
correctly the shading will provide so if
we want to go to rendered there we go
you zoom out here alright that's a lot
better okay so now we have to get rid of
obviously the faces in the middle here
so I'm going to go to solid face mode
price should have got rid of these
initially but that's okay so i didn't
have to do so many but I'm just holding
shift and right-clicking oops selected
one in the back you don't want to do
that oops this one make sure nothing
else got selected there delete faces
alright so we're not going to be getting
like extremely close up on this so i
think that is definitely sufficient
alright so i'm going to hit a tab and i
want to go ahead and add a plane here
and kind of set some other stuff up so
we're going to select just around the
center somewhere hit shift a mesh plane
s4 scale 10 to multiply the scale by 10
and push it down just to right around
there okay and then I want to change
this to Cycles render I'm going to go to
the world tab and change the background
to like a gray we're going to go over
there to this tab and this is where we
control the materials and right now the
plane is selected so I'm just going to
hit new we're going to choose to fuse
and make it a gray color
alright so we have separate objects here
and what we want to do is make sure this
this and that one up there which is
still a same with this part of the same
object has the same material so we want
to do is select by both them and we're
going to give these materials so if I
click use notes I can change this color
or rather change this surface to a mix a
derp mix basically allows you to add two
different shaders and control which one
is shown more or not and then we want to
make the top line as diffuse and i'm
going to choose like a gray bottom one
the bottom shader down here will be
where that this one right here and I'm
just kind of experimenting right now
we'll see what this looks like here in
one second I i also want to i know i'm
going to want to lighten the scene up
but real quick let's go over here to
rendered ok and I'm going to go here to
render i'm going to change the device to
GPU compute makes a lot faster and then
i'm going to come down here for sampling
renders at ten that's a very low just
for now i'm going to hit 100 and preview
100 as well the previews this view right
here so so if i move around quality be a
lot better i also want to lighten the
scene up so i'm going to go here to
solid mode just who i can see what's
going on i'm going to click around the
camera or maybe around here and i'm
going to shift a a plane RX 45
and we're going to give it a new
material of a mission or is it at there
it is leave the color white and it
changes to 20 so now if we go into
rendered mode we can start seeing what
this thing looks like
for a tea cool okay so I this one over
here this object doesn't have a material
so if you right click on it you can't
see if it's clicked because we're in
rendered mode but you know we have a
selective because it just changed to
nothing over here in the material so if
you hit new we can go ahead and change
that color T or that surface to you
haven't even attempted to really I
pronounce that song I'm not going to and
let's see here we could do I want to
take this color right back here are not
color the plane right click it see the
eye and also if we go to the world we
can see how things can really just
adjusting things can really affect the
appearance of your overall scene come
back here and also quickly duplicating
the emission plane so if we go back to
solid shift D X and then maybe taking
both of these shift D Y and then our X
and just flip them around go back into
rendered
now these are all pretty bright so if I
select them let me switch back to solid
here you can change the strength here 10
wondered can also change the best
positions by hitting gee I'm just kind
of putting out there all right now I
want to select on this and then we can
start experimenting with I how this
ultimately looks and I'm going to switch
the perspective view so hit five on the
number anyway those lights aren't
getting in our way all right so
roughness if you take that down all the
way to zero you can see it makes
everything really smooth and remember
this fac value if it's at zero it's
going to go a hundred percent to fuse
but if you go all the way up it's going
to go to one hundred percent die anti
tropic haha someone's gonna call me out
on that so as you can see it
significantly affects the appearance of
of everything so real quick let me go
back here I'll right click on this one
and the roughness that's a little bit
more realistic
alright I'd pause that just to make sure
I want to do the next step correctly so
I let's go to solid right click it make
sure this is selected go to our
modifiers for the mirror we're done
modeling it so we can hit apply so now
it's no longer mirror it's one big one
solid mesh so add modifier and solidify
because before we saw it was like paper
thin so now if we go back into rendered
and we have the thickness here we can
control off thick this thing is and you
can see I think right there would be
fine right there alright alright so now
this thing is way too glossy looking so
if you right click it I come over here
to materials
yeah I want to make sure our final view
that we get everything kind of it I in
the same shot and i'm going to play with
these colors may be right around here
roughness we want to turn up for sure in
this color I think right around there is
decent so we have a little bit of you
know it's not solid as it was before and
then real quickly I I'm going to do a
little some more detail over here so I
with this object selected let's hit tab
and go hit five on the number pad to get
through our different view hit 74 top
view I'm going to hit ctrl R right or
left click put one real close right
around there and then another one
control are there it is and put it right
there I'm going to zoom up alt right
click that middle one and then rotate
around I'm going to hit s to scale that
in
alright so now if i hit rendered you see
there's just like a little lip around
there all right and i think it did want
to do the same thing for the edge along
here so let me go to solid control are
and as long as we can do on this side
actually know why i'm not going to do
that I think it would end up screwing
things up so I think this is good to go
for now ok so let's go back up um get
out of edit mode go to rendered will hit
five
alright I'm going to right click on
we're just about done i'm still
experimenting with stuff yeah we want
this to be down just a little bit
alright so far so good um I just
right-click the back of this plane I
don't want that too how much that would
be a lot bigger so s5 that way when
we're wanting to see what we want to
work with this we have them that's not
cut off up there all right
let's see here let's go to ruled
yeah I think what I'll do is leave that
back there if I just
yeah that's good so I'm going to end the
modeling and the texturing part right
here so I think we did enough to wear
tomorrow we can come in and get our
final renders of this and then begin to
design kind of you know what we want to
go here in the center area for the the
animation all right so go ahead and make
sure you save your file and tomorrow
look for that next tutorial all right I
will see you then goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
