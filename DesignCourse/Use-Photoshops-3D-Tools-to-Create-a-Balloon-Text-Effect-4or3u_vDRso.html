comm today we're going to look at
creating a 3d balloon type of effect
using Photoshop CCS 3d tools so this is
going to be a real quick basic beginner
type of tutorial when it comes to 3d and
in the future I'm definitely going to
get a little bit more in depth but for
now we can create a really cool
captivating sort of image just using the
very basic 3d functions so basically if
you need access to the final project
files for any reason I they're available
for free in the description below this
video so also check out design course
comm if you haven't yet and subscribe
here on YouTube alright let's get
started alright so let's go to file new
and we'll just name this balloons I'm
going to use a width of eight sixty by
five or six hundred which works well
with my resolution I for recording and
then everything else can remain the same
here and hit ctrl or command one to go
100% view and we'll fill in the
background color with a light to a pink
like that alright so now we want to take
the pen or the type tool rather and just
type in balloons you can use whatever
text do you want and I want to change
this color here just a color around here
you can use whatever color you want as
well it's not really important so ctrl T
with that move tool hold shift and
left-click and drag that out so I'm
using a font called a wrist
extra full or filled and I'll link to
that in the description of this video
alright so now what we want to do is
right click and convert to shape alright
so we take this direct selection tool
now you see we can actually work with
these a little bit I so what I want to
do is take each one like that and then
you can hit control T and rotate it
slightly and reposition it like that and
then select the direct selection tool
again hit apply and you could do this
for each one of these
or just every other alright so I'm just
making slight variations and I'll take
the s at the end
Yeah right there okay all right so if
you control eh get rid of those the
outline so now what we want to do is go
to 3d and a new 3d extrusion from
selected layer all right so now things
have changed I the move tool no longer I
works as it normally does because now
we're working with a 3d object so over
here we have this 3d panel and then the
second icon show all 3d are actually the
third one this is where we can adjust
the material so if we click that we can
make this shiny and being you know make
all those adjustments but I forgot first
we need to go over here and double click
on it and shape presets the one that
kind of works well for our intended
purpose for making a balloon shape is
this one right here all right so let's
close that out we'll go back over here
to the materials so the materials this
is where you can really control how this
thing reacts and it looks down the
actual surface so I the shine you can
increase that the reflection that really
gives it a interesting sort of feel the
roughness so this is a lot more glossy
err on this end bump a pasady and
refraction we're going to leave there
and also you can do other cool stuff too
like environment if you hit load texture
and you just load up any like image of
like an outside scene it will kind of
show reflections based on that I but I'm
just going to keep it simple for now
just like this alright and then what I
want to do is go over here to layers and
if I right click this and hit render it
will start rendering the actual scene
once you have everything you know
basically how you wanted so mines that's
what 14% 20% I'll just pause this until
it's done alright and this is it
basically rendered and by the way I
really didn't explain you know where
these light sources coming from back in
the 3d view you have the ability ability
to edit an actual light texture and so
this is a kind of the default one I but
yeah that's for another tutorial this is
meant to be kind of a quick beginners
intro to 3d so basically now what we can
do is right click and let's see here
rasterize two 3ds and now it becomes
just something that we can edit like any
other normal photoshop layer and now i
just another added effect to make this
look kind of cool what we can do is let
me zoom in here and i'm just going to
take the lasso tool and go around a few
of these letters hold shift
to add to these selections I think I'm
just going to take three of the layers
alright and then what I'm going to do is
hit ctrl C and then hit the Delete key
and then ctrl V to paste right in so now
those three letters are are on all the
same layer basically so now I am going
to link also to these cloud textures so
if you take the brush tool I and load
the cloud textures in and I'm going to
link to every site that has a link to a
bunch of different resources for
downloading these custom brushes these
cloud brushes so once you load them up
you'll see you know a bunch of them here
underneath the default brushes that come
with Photoshop and I have a bunch of
fire ones and so that's what you're
seeing here so let me screw up here and
so this number beneath it that means
like the highest eye the size of the
actual brush and so in terms of pixels
so if you bring it over here you can
kind of see what it might look like I
actually those are clouds this is okay
so basically take your foreground color
and make it white and then in between
these two layers
control-shift-n for a new layer rename
it to cloud hit enter and now if you do
this you kind of make a cool effect that
kind of makes it look like they're
ascending into iCloud's so I don't want
that I'm going to back up real quick and
make this the size a little bit smaller
I can't want to make them look like like
a lot bigger than actual clouds and also
if you want you can reverse these layers
so take this one put it down here
alright that looks kind of cool you just
play with it by you know just control Z
right undo to really get a cool effect
so let me continue on maybe choose a
different variation of a cloud and maybe
just one more
that's pretty subtle and so if I take
the eraser tool get rid of these ones
down here
oh no I added that on to the wrong layer
didn't I oh well let me back up real
quick yeah got it actually I select the
right layer don't I put one up there and
it's probably good idea put them on
their old layers as well so let me come
back down you can always just drop down
to size
take one more drill shift in for a new
layer and that one works pretty well all
right and then if you wanted to of
course you can take this background you
can create a gradient out of it let me
see here make the preset transparent or
solid to transparent foreground
transparent pixel basically if we get
the background color maybe go a little
bit darker
control-shift-n for a new layer can
either do this I like that better makes
a cloud stand out a little bit more
alright and that is it very simple I I'm
actually really interested in getting a
little bit more involved in the
Photoshop 3d stuff and I because there's
so much to it
that most people just don't know about
so in the future I'll be doing more of
these probably a lot more complex and
interesting so but as it stands on this
looks pretty cool so hopefully you
learned something and I check out design
course comm if you haven't yet and
subscribe here on YouTube alright
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
