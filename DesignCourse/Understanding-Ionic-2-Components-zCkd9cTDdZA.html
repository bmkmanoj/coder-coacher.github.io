techcom today we're going to look at
ionic two components and really that's
what makes ion two ionic two now there's
about 30 of them so instead of showing
you how to do and implement each one of
them I'm going to show you something
more important which is how to
understand the API and the documentation
that comes with it along with the
components so that means we're going to
look at just a few of them I'll show you
how to read the documentation and then
that way going forward you'll be able to
very easily implement these components
on your own with your own projects based
on your own project needs all right so
this is the second lesson or second clip
that's a part of the ionic series which
is free at cross-sector comm so check
that out if you haven't and let's go
ahead and get started
okay so first to demonstrate how these
components work we want to make sure
that you have a new project created with
the ionic CLI now if you're following
along with this from the free ionic
course then you already have a project
set up from the previous lesson you can
just skip this step now if not you can
refer to this video on how to install
the ionic CLI from the previous clip
that's a part of this course and then
what you need to do is simply run this
command in the console to start a new
project which would be ionic start first
project the blank template and v2 for
ionic to hit enter and let it run
through and install and because I
already did this I'm not going to run it
and I also have a project called first
project after it's done CD first project
and then ionic serve - L for LabVIEW
alright so we'll let this run through
momentarily it will launch a browser at
default port 8100 as seen here and it
will serve our beginner project here too
to demonstrate how components work
alright and there we go now earlier I
did kind of just wipe clean the
templates that's so yours isn't going to
say blank for now it's going to be
whatever ionic installs by default so
for the next step what we want to do is
look at the documentation for ionic 2
and you can access that at an eclaim
work comm forward slash Docs and on the
left sidebar you see we have components
right here now you can see if you go
through there's quite a lengthy list of
components that we can use and there's
about 28 in all and really there's just
two types of components here
those are composed of just HTML and CSS
and they're really just for aesthetics
in the UI and we'll refer to those as
template components and there's about 20
of those and then there's also those
that are interactive and include dynamic
functionality so we'll call these
dynamic components and there's about
eight of those now in both of the cases
the documentation provides you with
information on how to implement the
component in the template through custom
HTML elements and attributes that are
designated for that particular component
now so the purpose of simplicity let's
first take a look at a template
component now out of the 20 template
components that I mentioned that don't
have any Associated controller with them
just three of them have no API
documentation as well so to give you an
example one of those three is cards the
other two together to our grid in button
so let's look at cards right here now
when I mean that just these three have
no a P I document ation you'll see if we
scroll through this there's no link here
to an api page whereas if we click on
something like toast for example we see
for more information check out the API
Docs so cards is one of those three that
simply does not have an API it's really
easy to integrate so there's not much
options associated with it so if we
scroll down it'll show us just basic
usage of how to use this particular
variant
component right here so I'm just going
to copy this and I'm going to go back to
my code editor and I have my first
project open here so we're gonna go to
source we'll go to pages and we'll go to
home HTML and I'm just going to paste in
what that meant in here and of course
the card title we can customize to
whatever we want and then also I'm going
to copy and paste from the written
tutorial this sentence right here so
we'll save it and there we go
very very simple to integrate this type
of component so the same sort of thing
aligns up with the grid in the button
component so what about the other 17
template type components well let's take
a look at for instance the button
component here in the ionic
documentation so we have buttons and you
can see for more information check out
the API Doc's let's go ahead and click
on that and you'll notice if we come
down we have what are called input
properties for this particular component
so we have an attribute and a type and
then details which just gives us a basic
description of what this type of input
property does if we add it to our button
component so just as an example let's go
back to our code editor and we'll add a
button right just at the bottom of the
ion card content and we'll put in button
and notice in order to reference it this
is called ion button so we put in ion -
button and let's add in a few of those
properties so one of the such property
was coming down here we have block so
it's a boolean value which is true or
false and this is the button that fills
its parent container with a border of
radius all right so
add that block equals true and then
let's go ahead and we'll give it just
default we'll save it and we'll go back
to our browser and we can see it fills
it all the way and we know this works
because if we remove this save it and go
back it doesn't so let's go ahead and
we'll redo that and of course you can
add multiple input properties so let's
go ahead real quickly it's going to
refer to it but I do have it outside so
there's one called outline equals true
and color equals danger save it and go
back and there we go we can very quickly
customize these components based on the
input properties that we see in the API
documentation so you can see we added
color and it can specify primary
secondary or danger and all these others
here okay now let's go back to the main
Docs and let's take a look at another
template component and that is called
the fab which is floating action buttons
now of course it gives you an example of
how these are used and how you can
integrate them let's go to the API Docs
for this and this one this time adds
something called attributes now these
are simply HTML attributes that you can
add to the HTML element itself and they
don't accept any values such as true or
false we simply add many for it to work
so let's go ahead and experiment with
that one real quick and we'll hat go
ahead and add or change rather instead
of add I on - button - I on - fab and in
here just to put a simple plus sign
let's save this and we can see this is
it by default without adding any type of
attributes
you can see at the sides it's currently
at and then if we add the mini
attributes save it we can see it's
considerably smaller and that's how easy
it is to add attributes based on the API
Docs which several of the components for
the tempura components and also the
dynamic components do have attributes
that you can add like this okay let's
take a look at one more component that's
a part of this section that we're
referring to as template components and
that is the Select so let me go back
real quick take a look at components go
down to select and click on the API
Doc's right here now if we scroll down
we'll see we have another section called
instance members now some of the
components also have this so what is
this and how exactly do we use this
well the Select drop-down when clicked
brings up what's called the Select
interface and this open method here
allows us to open that without having to
click on the actual select button and we
can make it open up through any other
means through our code if we wish like
say for example on a click event on a
different button so just demonstrate how
this would work and how you would
implement this instance member let's go
back to our HTML and I'm going to
completely remove everything and I'm
going to paste in the example code from
the tutorial the written tutorial that
I'm following along with on this
tutorial so we have what's happening
here just died all very simple stuff we
have just you can not pay attention to
these has nothing to do with what we're
doing
same thing for with the label we have
right here I on select and then we're
using two-way data binding for the ng
model toppings while true and then also
we have this right here
tops and that allows us to reference
this element here by a button on a click
event
and that's going to open up a method
called open it and we're passing tops to
it so what we want to happen is let's go
ahead and save this real quick go back
to our lab when we click this and by the
way it doesn't work because we don't
have that method defined currently we
want this to happen and we would use the
open instance method or member rather so
let's go ahead back to our code let's go
to our home ts file and just inside here
we'll create open it we'll pass along
top to it and we'll put tops dot open
and that is the instance map member that
we saw in the API documentation let's go
back click it and there we go now
finally on this ionic API dot page for
our select component we also have
instead of just input properties which
we already covered we have something
called output events so this allows us
to use event binding such as an on click
on an output event to call a method so
for instance let's take a look at a on
cancel let's say we wanted something to
happen when a user clicks cancel I or
they select anywhere outside of that
select interface so if we click open you
know if we want to capture what happens
after somebody clicks cancel or clicked
outside of it then let's maybe perhaps
print something to the console alright
so going back it's called I on cancel
let's go back to our HTML we'll go ahead
and write here inside of the eye on
select put in I on cancel with
parentheses which is event binding
equals we'll call a method called cancel
we'll save it
we'll create it cancel and we'll say
console.log cancelled will save go back
let's go ahead and open up our console
by the way all that stuff is showing up
has been refreshed
we'll open and then click cancel and
there we go right there so that will
allow us to do any number of things in
our code if somebody happens to click
cancel so now let's take a look at these
dynamic components as I'm refering to
them and there's around eight of them
and what makes them unique is the fact
that they're accompanied by controllers
and we use those with dependency
injection in our component in order to
do certain things with those components
so let's take a look at the alert
component right here and first before we
proceed let's go back to our HTML and
let's replace everything we have here
with this simple code right here all we
do is have a button which is I on button
and we have a click event and it's going
to open up a method called open it so
let's save it go back and this is what
we have so far all right back in the
documentation let's click on the API
Docs for alerts and you'll see we have
alert controller this is the first thing
we have to import in our component here
in angular 2 so let's go to home ts and
going to type in import this is called
alert controller from ionic let's save
and then we have to use dependency
injection in a constructor so we can
access it so private alert ctrl for
control and alert controller all right
let's save let's go back to the
documentation
let's scroll down you see it has usage
to show us how to use this but more
importantly let's look at the instance
members because remember a lot of them
have this and it's important to be able
to know how to read this so we have an
instance member called create and it
accepts an argument called ops here and
here's the parameter of options and the
type is alert options okay so let's go
down here and we'll see that alert
options is defined here and these are
all the properties and the types along
with the descriptions that it accepts so
it accepts a title of subtitle a message
CSS class if you want to append a CSS
class that you can style it yourself
inputs buttons etc so let's go ahead and
add title and subtitle to this so what
we'll do we're going to get rid of this
here remember this is the method that
we're going to be calling when that
buttons click to show up and alert well
type in let alert equals this alert ctrl
dot create so remember the instance
member was create this is where we're
referencing that so now we'll open up in
parentheses and squiggly braces now this
is where we put in the properties that
are defined from the alert options so
title my alert most name it whatever you
want and then also subtitle my subtitle
alright there's also another one called
buttons and it's an array so if we come
down here we have inputs which is an
array and this is an array of inputs for
the alert C input options and the same
thing over here for buttons an array of
buttons for the alert C input button
options here's the input options for
inputs and then here's the button
options which is mentioned right here so
this is an array and it will accept all
these properties for the button a text
handler CSS class and a roll
let's go ahead and add that let's go
back so this one we reference the
property name which is buttons and then
we open it up in brackets and also the
squiggly braces and it accepts a text
let's make this one okay and it's an
array so we can have multiple so we'll
separate these by a comma we'll paste
and we'll make this one note let's go
ahead and save that we'll go back and
before this will work by the way I
forgot one thing at the end here we have
to add alert dot present so we'll go
back real quick we'll open it and there
we go
my alert my subtitle okay and nope
alright so I know that was a rather
quick crash course with ionic components
but going forward whenever you need to
implement any of those other components
you should be able to do so with
relative ease alright so the next lesson
is going to be based around ionic native
I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
