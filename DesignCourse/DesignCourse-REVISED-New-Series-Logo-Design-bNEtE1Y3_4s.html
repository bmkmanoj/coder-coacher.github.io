today I'm going to be designing a logo
for an upcoming design course calm
series called revised so revised will
start pretty shortly and I'm going to
put out a video either weekly or once
every two weeks and each episode is
going to be based around redesigning a
logo for an established website so the
website needs to meet two different
criteria first it has to be active and
have traffic and second it has to have a
logo that is in desperate need of a
redesign so I'll redesign it in the
series and then I'll contact the website
owner I with a free copy of whatever I
redesign and then in the next weeks
following episode I'll state whether or
not that website owner decided to use it
or not so it would be a fun series and
just die another way to put out videos
that pertain to logo design which I know
a lot of you like all right so I'm going
to get started here with that revised
logo in adobe illustrator check out
design course comp if you haven't yet
and subscribe here on YouTube to get
started alright so I'm in Adobe
Illustrator going to go file new just
call this revised and i'm going to use
860 x 600 which works well my current
resolution for recording and i'm going
to leave RGB here and everything else
the same gonna get control one to get to
a hundred percent and all right so let's
get our type out so the name of this of
course is designed course revised so the
actual name then we're going to be
focused on is the name of this little
show revised so i'm just going to type
that in and all caps right there so
there's a fault font i have his married
pro I when I was designing this
beforehand I came across one that I like
very simple it's almost like this except
it's thinner and it's called stark light
or wait a second no that's certainly not
it oh because it's sterk light that's
why there we go alright as you see very
simple I and so when I was trying to
come up with concepts for this
potentially I wanted to be simple I
wanted to be based on a word mark only
not a separate symbol or anything like
that so but I did want to create some
type of sort of just very simple clever
play off of one of the letters so when
you think of revising something
especially a logo or redesigning
something there's several different
avenues you could take so of course you
have the typical recycle sort of arrows
or whatever that could be implemented
although that's something that's a
little bit overdone and so I began just
just to look at these letters and I
thought to myself okay well we have the
V here and whatever comes to revising
anything in general this isn't just
computer graphics this is anything you
know you get out I a pen and paper or
pencil and you just start sketching you
know you revise it and so that's the
idea I had here for this V and this will
act as the end of a pencil and the way I
just quickly did it is to first control
shift and the letter O to convert to
outlines and very simply just take the
pen tool and coming up right around here
doesn't matter really to precisely where
it is and create the center portion and
that might be a little bit too high for
my liking
all right right around there and then to
illustrate a little bit more create a
highlight let me shift come right around
here and then up like that all right so
let me want to adjust this a little bit
all right right there it's a little bit
thicker will work better all right and
to see what this looks like reversed all
but first I'm going to take this real
quick take both of those holding shift
go to window Pathfinder and exclude that
front shape that way it is transparent
in the center also take these over here
first I'm going to right click and
ungroup the text take both of those in
merge those shapes so now it's all in
one shape and then finally we can
control G to group those all right
pretty pretty simple I so now I want to
do is take this and control C and ctrl F
scale this down both of these when you
shift and alt move this one over here
take the rectangle tool go to layers put
this guy down there and make this white
alright so now I want to maybe make one
slight adjustment on this and that is
making this bottom portion come to an
actual point all right so oops if i take
this point right here and hit ctrl h so
we could see our selections and delete
it you can then take this and drop it
down and just adjust it real quickly all
right also something that's kind of
interesting here is that I don't know
why or how that got in there okay must
have something to do with the eye when I
joined those up
you fix that real quick there we go all
right now this comes down a little bit
further the pencil obviously because the
tip is longer and so right-click and
ungroup these and I move it up right
around there is pretty good and then
take the rectangular tool ctrl shift in
0 to divide the objects below they're
much better so now take that and we can
get our view there now it comes to a
specific point which is perfect and then
also I could paste the DC letter mark
logo in which of course will be
showcased along with it
what I would ordinarily do is get that
lined up with guides and such I'm just
going to eyeball it for now but yeah
very simple i'm just going to delete
that portion over here just so I could
have seen what it looked like and that
will be the name and the logo design of
this upcoming series so yeah look out
for that for one of the daily video
tutorials coming up it will also be
something that I regularly do and that
should be pretty fun all right I check
out design course com if you haven't yet
subscribed here on YouTube all right
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
