today I'm just going to be showing off a
new drawing tablet that I got which is
the Wacom Cintiq 22 HD and this is
actually the first tablet I've had if
you don't count the week prior to this
where I got a welcome in to us I decided
to return that though and purchased this
and I justified it because sometimes I
am an impulsive buyer I justified it
though by selling a bass guitar and also
I'm going to be selling in 88 key MIDI
controller so and I also justified it by
the idea that I am going to venture the
doing tutorials in courses using tablets
in adobe illustrator and photoshop so i
basically this is a walk on Cintiq and
there is I a bunch of what are called
Express keys on the right and left
there's it's basically eight of them and
then this Center button over here if you
can see it I allows you to specify what
this strip in the back will be where you
can use your finger and so right now
let's movie to adjust this so if I want
it to be able to scroll up I can very
easily scroll up and in and out of the
document that way and then it also
allows you to do some other things but
if I come up here it basically gives you
an eye an overlay of information of
everything that's going on with your
keys and what they're set to so pretty
cool I basically the way you set it up
it was very easy
I just sets up I hooks up to the back of
your computer and a monitor port and I
our DVI and I have two graphics cards
which are SL ID so I actually have four
monitors if you include this which
essentially this is a monitor and it
looks just as good as my other monitor
as well I so when I got it I you know I
was a little skeptical about you know
whether or not you know it would be much
more superior then in in two O's or a
standard tablet which just you know one
that just lays on your desk and you you
draw on it but you're not able to see
your hand now you are able to use if you
hover away from your the tablet that's
on the desk like with an in to us or a
bamboo you are able to see where you're
you know the cursor is at without
touching but the one thing that's
missing is being able to see your hand
and so I found you know after having
used in in to us and then at this came I
I found that being able to see your hand
is much much better
I then obviously not so the pen
sensitivity and the pressure is a really
really good as it's 2,048 i pressure
level or essentially whatever that's
called or referred to as and then here i
was experimenting ecially here in Adobe
Illustrator and I followed a few
tutorials I and basically the one thing
that gives you an advantage over just
using your your mouse it's for like
illustration and I you know doing
cartoon concepts or characters or
anything with fluid lines because it has
that pressure that pen sensitivity so
I'll be doing courses our tutorials very
soon here and for Adobe Illustrator and
then Adobe Photoshop I that's an
entirely different beast and of course
you still have the same eye pen
sensitivity in the pressure levels there
but you also have a lot more in terms of
brushes that you can experiment with I I
have a ton here as you can see I
downloaded a bunch of I just been
experimenting I like if I want clouds
you can do so very cool very fun stuff
and so what I've been focusing on lately
is I digital painting environments and I
have to say it is difficult it's one of
those things you know you think you can
you know you're already I'm already very
experienced and Photoshop I am you think
maybe after watching a couple tutorials
you'll be able to do it on your own it's
completely not the case it kind of
reminds me of when I went I I was
starting off doing web designs
and that was well over like almost like
12 13 years ago and you're just not
going to be able to do awesome designs
after watching a couple tutorials so
I've been busting my ass trying to
really learn digital map painting and
environment painting I which I hope to
eventually be able to get good enough to
share with you guys through tutorials
and so yeah like this guy this stuff is
just absolutely awesome this is this guy
Andrew Wollin or or Andrzej really
awesome stuff eventually I'd like to get
to this skill level but anyhow I thought
I would just share that as an update
with you guys I and so eventually you're
going to see tutorials with really
awesome outcomes hopefully in terms of
projects and yeah look out for a new
video coming within a day or two with
the design course calm design challenge
15 and I'm not exactly sure yet what
that's going to based on you guys can
leave some comments if you have ideas
otherwise we'll just come up with my own
alright I subscribe here on youtube if
you haven't yet and check out design
course calm alright goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
