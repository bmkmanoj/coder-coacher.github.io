calm today is january thirty first with
the last day of the month and we have 32
videos for you already this year and
today we are going to finish the mega
tutorial iphone breathalyzer project by
basically finishing up the HTML and CSS
and a little JavaScript alright so as
always check out design course calm the
project files are available for free in
the video description here in YouTube
and also subscribe here on youtube if
you haven't yet alright let's get
started alright so the first thing we
want to do I is get this working when
you click it so I we're going to use
jQuery which is based on JavaScript and
so just to get that up real quick let's
bring that back up i download jquery we
don't you can die the download it or you
can use the hosted version which is down
here and so that's what I'm going to do
I'm going to use the min one right here
it's smaller and file size so just go to
jquery calm / download i'll link it as
well and you can just put in this code
once you have that copied will put it
right here and it has to go inside the
head tag and then also will just copy
that or paste that again real quick and
change the source to j s /script Jas and
then save it and then we have to create
a new folder called JSO over here new
folder j/s and now it is in there
there's no files in it so we have to
create a new file and I'll file save
that as script j/s alright so now we are
ready to roll okay so basically remember
when it comes to a CSS and also with
javascript and jquery you access these
items by their ID or their class and
also by their actual HTML elements if
you wish so if you wish to target
something specific like that toggle
button you have to use the ID associated
with it I let me real quick open that up
real quick and get that back showing
okay so when it comes to this button
well we have to know what that idea is
so that we can look for the cliq so that
is right there the ID is toggle switch
alright so basically to get started
whenever you're working with jquery you
the opening the first line i always put
is document dot ready function and close
that one and then we have brackets here
and i just push that down a few lines
get myself some work some room to work
and then just close it with these three
characters alright so here's where
everything will go inside this I down
here so what we want to do is the way
you reference an ID or an element is you
start with the number sign or the cache
line parenthesis then quotes and then
the ID in this case is toggle dash
switch and then a period after the
parenthesis and now you have basically a
ton of different ways we want to look
for a click so keep putting click
function get rid of this one it created
at the end and then we hit enter a few
times and we close it up properly and
the reason we add these three is because
you know as in here we have this opening
parenthesis and then this closing one
same thing with this with the function
right there we close it right there
alright so basically this says right
here if the toggle switch any element
that has that ID if that is clicked then
execute this inside here so what we want
to happen is something to drop down
which is we go back we have to reference
the ID which is nav so jQuery has what's
called toggle so let's reference that
first and that's nav toggle and close
the parenthesis and my child is like
yelling downstairs alright so let's see
what happens here make sure you've saved
that will refresh this and of course
nothing happens because that's life and
the issue is i did not have this saved i
just told you guys a save and I didn't
say to myself so make sure you control s
that and refresh and now it toggles down
now this right here it's a little bit
too close so obviously it's like way too
close so we want to fix that real quick
if we hit ctrl shift I it opened up off
screen click that little magnifying
glass going to see what we're working
with and is ul ID equals nav so we're
going to reference that in CSS real
quick so let's get out our CSS custom
and ul nav we want to adjust this though
only for the 767 media query I'm
margin-top I'll try 20 pixels and save
that go back your refresh and click
alright that's a lot better and also
real quick I'm kind of want to make this
so that when you hover over you'll see a
black outline kinda or black background
and so we'll do that here with CSS as
well so all we have to do is take you
well nav take that and then just put
coolin hover get that stuff out of there
back around Dash color the color code
for black and that's three zeros and we
will refresh to see what this thing
looks like again and right off the bat
there's no padding to the left and that
looks kind of
bad so what we want to do is go ahead
and take let's see it would be a will
put yeah right here will change this to
I don't know I'd say let's start five
pixels and go back all right so that
looks a little bit better now also this
image right here it's overlapping this
and that just looks stupid so we need to
do a z-index on this I basically
containing element which is ul nav again
so we'll go back here to custom find UL
nav up here and let's see here z-index
will put two and then display block just
to make sure that works there and
refresh and of course it is not working
one second and that is because I had to
add in header Z and X 3 it just added
that so that works so now I the way this
works is you can see it toggles on and
off as it should now there's a problem
though ok so if we left it like this and
then for example I you know increase the
screen or the width rather it works fine
right well what happens when you do that
the damn menu goes away so normally you
won't have to worry about this issue too
much but there may be a situation on a
desktop for example somebody's you know
they're scaling in and they happen to
click down and they click down again and
they wanted to see something wider so
you got to address this and I I never
did a toggle menu before custom at least
and I had a pain trying to figure that
out trying to fix this correctly so I
figured it out so it can require some
extra jquery with their scripts here so
um
basically this next part you know if
you've never touched javascript or
jQuery you're going to be just like what
is going on but that's fine I we're
going to type out J query window on
resize so basically it's saying you know
if they resize the window then do this
all right and we'll close that up like
normal here all right and then we have a
bunch of stuff in the middle and so
basically if the window is resized as a
matter if it's pulled in or out
something's going to happen right here
so we put if window width is greater
than 767 then do this all right so
basically it's saying if someone's
resizing and we're going to put another
if in there if the window width happens
to be greater than 767 do this and we
will focus on that and basically we're
going to put another half so if jquery
nav oops no number now which is the ID
is parenthesis quotes colon visible
and then we put our nav nav show okay
and then we're going to also come out
here after this portion to put else so
it's saying you know if the window
that's being resized is greater than 7
67 and I got to get off Facebook here
stuff in the background all right is
anyhow I it's saying if the window size
is greater than 767 then saying if nav
is visible meaning if somebody is trying
to I oh if this little explanation ! is
very important basically means opposite
of visible so it's saying if it's
invisible or if it's not seen somebody
you know clicked it and collapsed it
kind of like this like they had it wrong
one here oh it's going slow because my
hard drive i think all right fix that ok
so it's paying basically if somebody
clicks this and then they click it again
that means that it's hidden so that's
what this my line means right here and
so if it's greater than 7 67 and it's
still hit and guess what we want to show
it again because it was hiding it before
so hopefully understand that and then we
have to put this else statement over
here which is tied to this so it's
saying if it's not greater than 7 67 do
whatever is in here and here's what we
put now tied okay so let's see if this
works there might be some more CSS that
we have to do so let's just start out
like we normally would refresh it bring
it in all right so far so good we click
on it click on it again and there we go
that code helped bring it back you just
want to make sure it kind of works on
every instance oh that's the one thing
so if we refresh this we have it open
and we try to scale it
just kind of turn it off which I don't
think that's a big deal so basically
that is it for the the menu up here so
it function it functions and it works so
now what we want to do is just some very
just two quick things going to add some
hover I CSS on these I here and these
over here or not these but this so
basically I will just make this black as
well because you know we have on the
mobile version it's hovering black keep
things can slap oops to keep things
consistent we want to make it hover up
here black as well so let's go back into
our CSS and I believe that is just
simply got to find you right here and
we'll put background color and make sure
we put hover colon hover save it come
back refresh bingham there we go and you
know you could probably go with maybe
even a lighter version of this these
colors right here and I'll stick out
more it's up to you no big deal you know
how to do it now and then we'll just
make this get slightly lighter so let's
going near Photoshop we will take that
button double click on it make it just a
little bit lighter you can see how it
lightens up copy that color code go back
to CSS and it was called CTA button it
was a class just in case you wanted to
have multiple buttons for some reason in
the future hi let me put hover here and
we'll put background color and save it
so go back and we got it hovering and of
course you know there I there are
different css3 transitions you can use
even where you can fade it in the hover
or not the color rather there's a bunch
of stuff you can do but that's pretty
simple for now and there you go that is
the end of the mega tutorial I think
that was like nine day
straight focusing on this project I real
quick i'm just going to close the pause
i'm going to open up our video we
created two so we can watch that here
that is let's watch that again unsure if
you're unfit to drive after a couple
drinks well into this device and we'll
let you know if you're I just realized
you probably can hear the audio that's
not cool with its compact design Baxter
yeah you know what well first thing is
still playing watch it available now so
yeah you learned you know be a ton for
this tutorial so if you went through you
know the first video to this last one
especially as a beginner that's pretty
awesome you probably learned a lot
hopefully and hopefully give you good
information to learn from I so yeah I'm
going to be doing these make it tutorial
type things throughout the year I'm
going to have to because I'm really
trying to do this video a day thing and
sticking to it so yeah I'm not even sure
what tomorrow's the video is going to be
yet I but you know that's how it is
especially with all these crazy kids and
my own business or freelance designer as
well but I'm not going to sit here and
ramble on so you know if you liked the
tutorials and like the whole daily video
thing subscribe here on YouTube like us
on Facebook and Twitter if you want and
check out design course calm i'm
actually just starting to work on the
first page course and that is going to
be a visual identity design course which
really ties in with logo design I let me
get out to the course preview type thing
I created just just to show you here
real quick okay so i have like this
massive document have to zoom in here a
lot so you can see what this will be
about so you know i'm going to become
out the visual identity course basically
this is just the outline of what I'm
creating I course introduction you know
basically it's introducing a course
obviously and then going to go over
basically you know the rough ideas or
getting specific into the ideas of what
visual identity is I'm gonna actually be
we're not going to be designing things
in this portion this is all just going
to give you a very solid foundation of
understanding about what visual identity
of visual identity is and how it relates
to a brand and how the logo design works
in there there's a lot of confusion you
know think people think they know what a
brand is but they don't really know
specifically like if you ask them to so
i will get into the use of colors the
use of topography i will take a look at
what corporate identity guidelines are
and if you don't think you need to know
this i mean basically that's the
difference between just you know a lazy
designer and then somebody who really
knows their stuff so I you increase your
value as a designer when you understand
all this stuff and so we also look at
the different types of logos and then we
get to the part where we really start to
get into projects and designing things
for for fictional companies or real
companies i think i'm going to have a
couple logo design clients may be one
where it will actually be a real visual
identity project and so you can see will
be just a project brief brainstorming
sketching we're designing the logo
always use illustrator for that and then
the visual identity presentation and
photoshop which is taken kind of you
take the logo you present also with it I
just like a business card any type of
the other visual aesthetics that are
presented to the client for a full
visual identity and we're going to do
three of these projects so that way you
get an idea about you know how to really
form the idea of solid concepts that are
unique I and also for a variety of
different projects so you do three of
these course conclusion and then this is
going to be cool this is going to be
optional as an add-on in terms of you
know I'm not sure how much I'm going to
price it but basically I'm going to
assign a student a fictional project
brief I which year to construct a visual
identity and then submit it to
II so the course instructor which is
going to be me I may require visions
depends on what you turn in but once
complete the student is granted a design
course calm visual identity
certification so that would be something
i'm thinking of will be physically
mailed but also available like where you
will have your name this is optional of
course on the design course calm visual
identity designers index so project
brief fictional project brief and
basically that is that so basically i
will be your teacher in a sense if you
choose to do the course certification
and then everything up here is just
going to be I kind of separate you don't
have to you don't have to do this stuff
down here you don't have to you know
enter yourself into that all right so
look for that I'm not sure I can't
really give a timeframe hopefully within
a month definitely within a month or two
all right so I until tomorrow I will see
you all right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
