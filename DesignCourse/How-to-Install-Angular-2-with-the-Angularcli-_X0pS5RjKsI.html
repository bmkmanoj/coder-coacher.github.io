Etro calm and today we're going to look
at the fastest way of getting up and
running with an angular 2 project and
we'll do that through the angular client
so if we go over to CLI
angular geo we'll see we have this get
started page and in a nutshell the
angular client allows you to start new
projects as well as generate components
routes services and pipes which if of
course you have no clue what angular 2
is yet we're going to get into those
things in later videos very shortly and
it also allows you to serve your
application and test it so let's go
ahead and click on get started which
redirects us to the github page and
first for the prerequisites you're gonna
have to make sure that you have node 4
or higher installed along with NPM 3 or
higher installed all right so if you
have something earlier than that you're
gonna have to upgrade and I can get a
little bit tricky but as long as you
google it you'll get through it
ok so we want to do now is focus on
installation now I've already installed
angular CLI through the NPM so i if you
do npm install - g and angular CLI
you'll only have to do that once and
I've already done that of course so once
you get to that step or after it we can
go ahead and create a new project by
utilizing the angular client so the very
default starting point of course is ng
and then the command new and then your
project name so let's go ahead and do
that I'm gonna use git bash here and I'm
just going to type in mg new and we'll
call this angular - fastest all right
you see it son created the project
folder as you can see we have source we
have app we have the app component dot
CSS already created dot HTML created the
module you can see here that we've
created we also have our main TS
and I'm gonna go ahead and fast-forward
and pop or pause this just because it
could take a little bit of time all
right and there we go
has it installed in one of the great
things about just running that single ng
new command is the fact that it also
will simulate or run the NPM start after
it so if we open it up in our source
code editor we'll see that we already
have the node modules started so all we
have to do is type in ng serve which was
the equivalent equivalent here of the
meat inside oh I forgot to CD into that
folder angular - that I type in fastest
yeah there we go
ng serve and that's the equivalent of
course to the NPM start command and then
we head on over right here to this URL
and there we go app works all right so
now it's looking for changes and it will
refresh for us once we make this changes
okay so if you watch these three videos
in succession you'll see that there's
you know basically three ways to get
started with an angular 2 project and
the angular client has a great advantage
to it in that it can speed up or it does
speed up the development workflow
because you can use as you would see in
future videos the generate command to
automatically generate routes and
components and pipes and etc so that we
don't have to manually import to all of
these different commands into other
files as you would see but we're still
going to cover that manual process
because it's important to understand how
those things work at a fundamental level
all right so hopefully you'll stick
around because now in the neck
few videos we're going to actually get
started with learning angular 2 and how
it all works I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
