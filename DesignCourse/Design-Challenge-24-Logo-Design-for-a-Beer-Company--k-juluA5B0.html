course comm welcome to this week's
design challenge number 24 and this
challenge you're tasked with designing
this not the beer bottle but the logo
that goes on the beer bottle instead for
a fictional company and don't worry I'll
provide you with a file I so why I
figured it'd be fun to combine my two
favorite things in life alcohol and logo
design so let's switch over to the
monitor and I'll go over all the details
and the roles but before we do that make
sure you subscribe here on youtube and
check out design course comm alright so
here is the contest thread and very
simple I the requirements there's not
much here just design a logo for a
fictional beer company and place it on
the bottle graphic that's linked in the
requirements so you're free to name the
company whatever you like and use this
beer bottle template if you click on it
it's just going to download a file and
open that up in Photoshop submission
deadline of course is Sunday May 31st at
12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and
then here's just some inspiration here
when you open up that graphic this is
what you're going to be presented with
and I basically if you take a look at
the layers over here it'll say label
here and this is a smart object layer so
if you double click it it will open it
up in a new window and this is where you
put your design so if you wanted to have
kind of like a black wraparound right
here then that's what you would you
could just leave this layer here this
black layer although you don't have to
you could go ahead and hide it save it
ctrl S or command S on Mac and you can
see just right there probably best to
leave some sort of wrapper there and you
can of course I change it to a different
color if you wish by just going over
here color overlay you know making it
like I don't know this color I'm not
sure what that's gonna look like either
way has a real interesting effect with
these these filters and such so yeah I
have fun with it make sure when you save
this just gonna file save for web
you could probably leave it at the size
it is all the
it's probably little bit big for the
forum but it doesn't really matter you
can party just leave it at the size it
is alright so I'm looking forward to
this emissions checkout design course
calm and subscribe here on YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
