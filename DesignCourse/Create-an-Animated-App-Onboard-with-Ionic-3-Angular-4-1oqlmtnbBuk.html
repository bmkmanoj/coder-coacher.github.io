Gary Simon of course Tetro calm and
today we're going to take a look at how
to do kind of like a tutorial slash
onboarding process using ionic 3 and
angular 4 so in front of me here is I
the project that we're going to be doing
from scratch here
so let me just show you real quickly it
looks like your typical you know sort of
you know the apni they just installed it
or whatever and let's go through these
different slides so you can see that
there's some cool animation taking place
based on the swipe direction um and so
we're going to use angular animation to
achieve that and I yeah basically you're
going to be showing you everything from
scratch about how to do something like
this this right here the skip button of
course works it's going to like where
your your user interface would go for
the main app so yeah let's go ahead and
get started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're going to find a bunch
of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access with a box of buying me
like expect each month that did now also
it probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe
here on YouTube and be sure to make sure
the notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it okay so
pre-requisites
you're going to need no js' with npm or
the node package manager installed so to
know whether or not you have that
installed we at the command-line just
type in npm - v and also node - v and if
those go unrecognized and you have to
visit node j esta or go to download
section and then install nodejs and by
default it will include this npm up here
it'll be checked off at the very end of
the installation dialog so now i once
you have that installed reload your
command line and you can run these
commands will be there and then next we
have to install the ionic CLI or command
line interface I'll just call it CLI for
now but based on the acronym and to do
that we're going to run NPM install - G
ionic
at latest I'm not going to actually run
this but you know if you don't have it
installed then go ahead and run his
command let it go for a bit and pause
and then come back
alright so now once you have those three
things installed the ionic CLI node and
NPM then we're going to use the ionic
CLI to start the actual project so
wherever you save your projects at go
there and type in ionic start and then
next is the project name I'm just going
to call this onboarding and then we're
going to use the blank template so I'm
going to go ahead and actually I think
this yeah just take just a little bit
time so I'll pause and come right back
alright when it's done it's going to
prompt to you link this app to your
ionic dashboard to use tools like onic
view I'm going to hit Y and I this is
your first time running that there may
be some extra setup to get that working
correctly all right so I'm going to go
ahead and clear this we're going to CD
into the project name folder onboarding
and I before we serve up the serve
command we're going to go ahead and use
the ionic CLI to generate a page so G
for generate page and then the name of
the page will be just main and we're not
actually going to use this page at all
it's just going to serve as kind of like
a placeholder for the fictional you know
use the main user interface after the
slides or the the onboarding process so
next what we're going to do is just run
ionic serve - L for lab and when you run
this it'll compile it real quickly it's
also going to watch for any file changes
as we develop and it will launch a
browser momentarily and there we go
exciting stuff all right so the next
step let's actually build out the slides
and this is made really easy by using
ion - slides and individual ion slide
elements within it so we're going to use
the I visual studio code for my code
editor you can use whatever you want
though alright and here we are in the
prot
a quarter of onboarding right here we're
going to go to source and then we're
going to go to pages home and home dot
HTML now this is also the the main page
that we are we just generated as well so
in here I'm going to hit ctrl B by the
way and get rid of that sidebar what
we're going to do is just get rid of
pretty much everything with exception to
I own content okay now inside of here to
create slides like I said very very
simple I on slides we're also going to
add pager and when you add pager it's
going to add a little like a dot based
or a circle based navigation at the very
bottom otherwise if you don't want those
for whatever reason just get rid of
pager we're going to include it though
all right so now inside of here this is
where we use I on slide singular so I on
- slide I'm just going to put one here
for now of course we're going to change
this up and change this to two and three
so if we save this and go back to our
browser you'll see that we have by the
way I haven't changed my platform here
to yet make sure it's on Android you can
use iOS if you wish and here you go very
simple this the sliding is a little bit
finicky with your mouse but it works
much better when you're on your phone
but yeah very simple you can also click
down here to change between these okay
so that's how that works obviously
extremely extremely simple so let's go
ahead and actually add the HTML we're
going to be using here for this first I
on slide initially so what we're going
to do is put in real quick a div class
of diag for dialog or whatever we're
going to reference that momentarily in
the sass and then we're going to put
style equals background:url assets IMG
white BG SVG
and no repeat now the reason I'm doing
this in line and not through the class
itself is because for some reason with
my Android phone it would not show the
SVG I when I was doing it in the SAS
file
I tried almost every different type of
path I can imagine and then I put it in
line right here just to test and it
worked so I'm not exactly sure why so
that's why that's in line now by the way
if you want access to this white BG SVG
file that I created then go to the
written version of this tutorial at
course cetera comm it'll be linked here
in YouTube I and I have a download link
just to show you right here so download
the project file just right click and
Save Link As and then your one going to
want to save it let me hit control B to
get the sidebar up within assets you
have to create a folder called IMG and
it goes right in here this is where
white BG go so I'm going to do that real
quickly
alright so I just got that in there
ready to go alright so let's go back
down here and let's continue on with our
HTML so right here we're going to close
this div control B by the way and inside
of here we're going to have a let's see
here and I yeah an ion icon element so I
on - icon iOS will be iOS - analytics
this is what's going to give us our
little icon that's featured at the top
for material design
it'll be MD analytics these are just the
icon names color equals primary and then
close that out and then next we're going
to put in just an empty div and a little
bit later on we're going to attach
something to this div that's why I
created in the first place but for now
yeah because we're going to add
animation to it but for now it's gonna
be blank so then we're going to put in
our HT you just put track your routine
and then also a paragraph element
and I'm going to copy and paste
off-screen here based on the written
tutorial because I don't feel like
typing uttal out there we go and so that
is the very first slide so what you can
do is take all the guts of this right
here in between I on slide copy it paste
it right here for two and three and then
make custom adjustments as needed so off
screen I have those custom adjustments
already made so I'm just going to paste
those in from this tutorial the only
thing that changes here by the way is
simply the icon name of iOS trophy and
MD trophy as well as just a text here so
nothing really too unique is occurring
so I'm going to do the third one real
quick and then at the end just after I
on slide we're going to have a button
and so this button on click which is
angular event binding equals skip so
we're going to call it skip method will
define later on I'm going to give an ID
of skip as well so it can reference it
in CSS and then we're using tribulation
on a property it doesn't yet exist
called skip message and we only doing
this because I want to show you how you
can change the actual skip message once
they reach the end of your slides
otherwise you could just hard code to
skip in there if you wanted to okay so
that looks good so let's save that and
this is what it looks like without any
styling taking place so I yeah pretty
ugly so let's go ahead and focus on
styling this thing up so I what we're
going to do first is hop into real
quickly control B we're going to go to
source app and app dot sass right here
so this is where your global settings go
for your I your layout and such so the
very first thing I do I'm going to do is
we're going to paste in an import
statement to get a font called railway
from Google web fonts next we're going
to reference I on I content I on content
rather i content was that
in background color we just make it a
light gray so a background color is ef
ef ef and then important and then also
font-family just going to set the
railway alright cool i next we're going
to go over to source theme down here and
variable that's ass and we're just going
to change the primary variable right
here i to this color right there which
kind of just like a purple so we'll save
that and then we're going to spend the
rest of the time in our home sass file
alright so let's get rid of this and
let's reference the first class that we
created which is a
diag so we're going to put in position
absolute z index is one a width of 100%
and this by the way is a container for
the SVG graphic i let's the top here
will be 0 and height i had to play
around with this this to get this
correct so I'm really kind of curious
like how this works out on different
phones I only test it online so you may
have to adjust it or change things up a
bit
so I let's look and see what we have
going on so far yeah pretty ugly it's
all messed up but we're just starting
out here so let's also put an eye on
icon margin top is going to be 40% font
size is 7 a.m. our h2 element we're just
going to put in margin top of 80% and
font way to bold and font size of 1 a.m.
let's check things out there we go it's
coming along a lot better it's also
reference our paragraph element so the
width we don't want to go 100% so we'll
make it 80 display:block margin:0 auto
to center it and then font size or make
it a little bit smaller 0.9 TM
alright let's take that alright getting
pretty good here
alright and then just about done almost
so down here we're going to reference a
class called Swiper pagination bullet
active so you may be wondering by the
way let me just put in our background
color here c400 F F that's our purple so
when we save this it changes it to our
main color up here so you may be
wondering where did I find that class
well if you hit ctrl shift I and we
click on this little button here in
Chrome we can select the individual
element right there and this is where I
got this and that's a way we can change
you know find these classes so we can
make custom adjustments to it to the CSS
all right and then also I I wanted to
push up this section it's a little bit
too close to the bottom so I wanted to
push it up and I did the same thing I
found which class I need to adjust and
that's Swiper pagination bottom 12%
important so now you save it and it
moves right up oops
all right and then there's one more rule
set we have to define which is the skip
button so position is going to be
absolute bottom is going to be 20 pixels
from the bottom of the viewport width is
100% I also have a background of none
text-align is going to be center
cursor:pointer I don't think we really
have to add this it's just for the
browser and then z-index push it up make
sure it's on the top of five so now we
don't yet see it because there's no text
there we have to define that that
property alright so now let's go ahead
and focus on making that skip button
present and actually work when you click
it so six will be we're going to go to
home TS
and the first thing we need to do is
import our main page that we generated
with the CLI which is residing right
here so we imported at the top all right
so right here we need to adjust there we
go
right there and we're also going to head
on over to our app module ts so whenever
you generate yeah which the SEL I would
do this for us but we have to do it
manually we also have to import it here
in our app module and so this is the
correct URL for there and then also we
have to add it this rate as decorate
declarations and also in entry
components so we'll save that go back
alright and next what we want to do is
reference that property called skip msg
it's a string and we're going to set it
to skip initially and then we're going
to create our skip method that we
referenced on click so this nav control
we're going to push this new page upon
them clicking that skip button so we
save it and now once it reloads its
building takes a little bit longer
whenever you're saving like one of the
component files you change something so
we can see skip and we click it and it
takes us to our main navigation page all
right so we actually have to add I think
I put that in the wrong area oops let's
go ahead and fix that real quick on that
HTML it needs to go outside of I on
slides sorry about that so let's save
and now it stays there sweet all right
okay so continuing on I let's say for
instance you know once a user gets to
the last page like right here we only
have three of course we want to change
this skip to
else well let's do that real quickly so
we go to home TS and what we want to do
is first we have to import a view child
and slides so to do that we import view
child here from the angular core
actually that's a little bit redundant
so you just add it up top after
component so now we get rid of this one
and then also slides so again a little
bit redundant right there alright so now
we can go ahead and save this and next
thing we have to do is in the HTML we
have to attach an input method and so
what that looks like is we go to our
pager and right there right after pager
we put an I on slide did change alright
so this is an event that happens and
when it changes we're going to call a
method called slide changed like that so
whenever the slide changes we're going
to call this right there so save that go
back to our home ts and we'll define
that down here so I before we can do
that we have to define the view child
right here this gives us access or our
component access to what's happening in
the template basically so we're calling
it slides and we'll reference that
shortly so now we create that slide
change method right here and we're going
to say if this dot slides this again
this is a reference to this right here
dot is end
so we're saying if the we've reached the
last slide then we're going to change
the skip message so this dots skip msg
equals so it's going to go from skip to
all right I got it
whatever you want so I now we go back
now watch this right down here make this
a little bit bigger for us
all right changed all right I got it
sweet all right awesome so now let's go
ahead and focus on integrating animation
now as it stands if we look at this this
is good I mean this is you know I
this is something that you could say
well you know this is finished
I like it it's well-designed etc etc but
if you want to add a little bit
something extra I we can integrate
animation so that when this is swiped
these will move over and it will animate
and it almost look like they're being
drugged it's actually a really cool
effect and I'm sure you saw it already
at the beginning of the video on my
phone so let's go ahead and do that so
the very first thing we have to do to
integrate animation is import the
animations library and we do that
through NPM in a console but first you
need to go to your package adjacent file
and take note of what the core angular
core is and for me that's four point one
point three that's what's currently
being installed I with the CLI for ionic
now actually the current version is four
point two point something else so I you
need to note this right here and I'll
tell you why in a second so let's go up
to our console and I'm going to get out
a new one real quickly so I'm going to
right click I'm using commander by the
way that CMD ER for my console up here
in Windows and hit new console we're
going to go to CD code and onboarding
and then we're going to use npm install
angular animations at and then your
version number based on that package so
Jason so four point one point three and
we'll save it as a dependency so if we
put for instance like angular animations
at latest it would install a different
animations package maybe perhaps a newer
one like four
- and for me that presented issues and
errored so you want it to be the same
package version just you know as the
core library essentially okay so after
that let's go back to our code close
this out and now we need to do is go to
our apt module at TS and again this is
all specific to angular not necessary I
on ik angular for changed the way you
work with animations and so it's
separate it's outside of the angular
core library now and so we have to
import this line right here browser
animations module from angular platform
browser animations and then we add this
as an import so put a comma and there we
go okay so now we're going to go ahead
and add animation to the actual slides
so the first thing we need to do is go
to the component that contains the
animations that we want to add and right
here we're going to put a comma and add
a bunch of animation specific function
so trigger transition style state
animate and keyframes this is all pretty
much standard for animation using
angular alright and then next we're
going to define animations and of course
in angular that goes in the component
decorator section right here so also
real quick just to note you may be
wondering why aren't we just going to
use CSS based animations well the reason
being is when this slides load for
instance like this whole page loads I
everything gets rendered at the same
time so it doesn't really allow a CSS
alone doesn't allow us to add event
based animations so we're going to use
angular animations so we're going to put
in animations open up an array and this
is where we define our first animation
which when you're starting off with
animations in angular you start off with
the trigger function which we imported
and then the first argument of the
trigger function is the name so we're
going to call this bounce kind of
kind of bounces whatever name of what
you want and then we're going to open up
an array and inside of here we are going
to start off with state so that's
another animation function being
imported and the next argument is the
name or the type of state so we're going
to say any state by using the wild-card
and then we're going to use this style
function those I little pop-ups are
annoying I'm going to turn that off real
quickly if I go to file where my
preferences and settings I'm just going
to
oops
there we go we'll save that close this
okay so now I inside of here and the
style just going to make transform
translate Y or X rather zero all right
and then after this we're going to add
in a comma and we're going to create a
transition so the transition the first
one is going to go from any state to
right swipe and it's just a custom name
that I made by the way and then we're
going to call the animate function first
argument is the duration and animation
type in a delay if you want but I'm just
going to make it last about seven
hundred milliseconds and ease out and
then we're going to use keyframe based
animation so we use the keyframes
function and inside of here we use just
separate style functions so inside of
here we're going to have transform
translate X we're going to start off at
the zero position and then the offset is
zero the offset just allows you to
determine at what point during this
seven hundred milliseconds or how long
you know this will last all right so
after that we put in a comma oops not a
period we're going to copy this
and make sure I get this right yeah that
looks good okay and then paste that
three times so in the middle if they're
swiping to the right they're going
through logically to the right then
we're going to translate X on a negative
axis of about 65 pixels and then this is
just going to go back to zero now this
offset here will change to 0.3 and then
this is 1 at the very end pretty simple
stuff okay so now we're going to do
another one of these so we're going to
copy and we're going to change one thing
or two things rather this name here is
going to be less swiped so if they're
going back to the beginning then we're
going to change this here from negative
to positive and that changes the the
animation type so that it's more
consistent otherwise if you just use
this alone for any method or any
direction of swipe it actually would
jitter around a lot because when you're
swiping left for instance I this value
works against other way just trust me it
looks like crap so all right so I will
save this not done yet now in the actual
class component down here we have to
define a property we're going to call
call it state type of string and we're
just going to make it equal anything
other than right swipe or left swipe so
I'm just going to call it X maybe a
better way of doing this but that's what
works for me and then we're going to
create a method slide moved will add
this in the template momentarily I'm
going to say if this slide slides now
we're going to use a new method so we
used is end already but there's also
another one called get active index so
each one of these slides that's defined
in our HTML so like I on slide right
here this one as well has an index and
it starts at 0 so this is 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 all
right so we want to get you know which
slide they're currently at
and then we're going to compare it we're
going to say if it's greater than or
equal to this slides dot get previous
index and that allows us to get
obviously the previous index so we have
two active verse the previous so this
will allow us to determine based on
whether or not this value is equal to or
greater than I we can Beit we can
determine if a person swiping left or
right all right so then so if that's
greater then we're going to set this dot
state to right swipe all right and
that's going to activate this transition
right here so we're going from any state
to right swipe then it's going to
animate based on this information here
all right so oops sorry about that
coming down we're going to say else this
state equals left swipe awesome all
right we're going to create one final I
method here we'll be done working pretty
much in this I component file we're
going to call it animation done and
we're going to set it to this state
equals x so I'm resetting it from I
right swipe or left swipe and basically
when the animation is completed or the
swipe is completed then we're setting
this state to something else
otherwise it won't repeat I this right
swipe or left side if it equals left
swipe or right slaver already and that
happens when you're reaching the end or
the beginning of your the swiping or the
slides rather so this is something add
to adding in order to fix that so now
let's go ahead and call slide moved and
animation done in the template at home
so up here where we have our our n
slides with our I on slide did change
let's go ahead and copy this paste it
and we're going to change this here to
slide drag so that's another input event
that we can call when the ion
EXOR this slide is actually being
dragged so then we're going to call
slide moved alright so again if we look
back it's live moved we'll see what
we're doing here we're just detecting
which direction it's moving and calling
this state right swipe or less white
based on the animation then we have to
come down and attach actual animation to
the elements that we want to move so for
me if we're looking back at this here I
want this to animate and I want this
text right here to animate so these we
have remember that empty div that we
added that is wrapped around this we're
going to attach the animation on that
and this okay so let's go back and the
way we attach animation of course this
is based on you know how angular handles
things we're going to put in brackets
with a t' and the trigger name is bounce
equals state so the state again that's
defined in our component and then we
also and we only have to do it just for
this icon here we have to do it
somewhere where animation has been
attached we're going to call at and this
is through event binding so we use
parenthesis at bounce dot done so
they're saying once that animation is
done then we're going to call a method
of animation done which we just defined
and we don't even have to pass in the
event so right there is good alright so
right here let's just copy that and
we're going to paste that right here
we're also going to paste it again on
this icon for the second slide and this
div and then also I this icon oops
and this div alright sweet I think
that's it so
go ahead save now let's see if this
works see that there we go
and now notice it goes back it's calling
left swipe at this point so that way
that way very very cool all right so
