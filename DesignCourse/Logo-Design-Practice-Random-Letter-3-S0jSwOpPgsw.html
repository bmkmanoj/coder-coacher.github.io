today I'm going to be doing the random
letter logo design practice technique
where I pick a random letter with the
help of a website and then immediately
whatever comes to mind
that begins with that letter I choose a
noun so it's just a good exercise to
help you really try to think outside of
the box the goal is to take that letter
and then whatever noun it is and create
a unique symbol that portrays both of
them inside of what's called a letter
mark logo alright so check out design
course comm if you haven't yet and
subscribe here on YouTube alright so
here we are and all you just click this
generate another random letter and it
will show up here and I will think of or
speak the first now and that's begins
with a letter that comes to mind here we
go G grape all right yeah I was just
drinking some grape Gatorade so that's
probably why that came to mind so anyhow
alright let me yeah and I wrist extended
artwork alright so I got to come up with
the idea of grape and symbolize it with
into G okay so I got to kind of think
here a little bit so the one thing that
immediately sticks out to me is you know
a grape is something that's circular and
so is this portion of the G all right my
my daughter just interrupted me she does
it all the time and yeah so yeah this
outer portion here is circular but I
just have to figure out a way I it would
be almost too easy if it came like it
without oh and and I came up with some
type of a circular shaped thing but we
have this here so I what I'm gonna do is
just I replicate that and I'm just gonna
go down my font list just to see if
anything immediately sticks out to me as
to
feeling I don't know grayish because I
really don't have an idea right at the
moment so I one thing I want to do is
I'll get up the browser here and let me
go to images it's always a good idea to
get referenced in images based on what
you're thinking about I mean I know what
a damn grape looks like of course but I
just helps to see great so they get new
oh yeah there have your green or your
red / purple what can I say I mean it's
just an oval shape with a thing hanging
off a stem so let's see here kind of
like this station medium it's a free
font because it has almost the full
portion of the grape all right so I'm
gonna use this just as some inspiration
here so I'm gonna create a custom one
with the ellipse tool and just hold
shift and alt and get this guy get rid
of the fill and give it a stroke and
we'll turn that sucker up quite a bit
right around there and I loops and what
we want to do is yeah there we go is
this
yeah we're an RGB yeah all right anyhow
okay so I think it may have just come up
with an idea a bit of an idea at least I
so let's think here if I add an anchor
point just adding one of these points
right here and I will just say you're
writing around here and maybe here oh
and then add one why are you between
them so three points and hit delete okay
created a opening there it's also
changed the cap here to that
okay let's think here may have to adjust
this but we'll see I'm just
experimenting here okay so I just select
this point right here change to the pen
tool all right let's see what this looks
like
so I I'm deleting this one let's move
this over and you know if normally a
grape looks like it's gonna just sit and
straight up with the stem coming out
trying to think of how I can do this
whoa the hell happened there
alright are you thinking what the hell
is going on here I don't even know
what's going on alright let's see here
I'll remove this one
hmm want to try something real quick get
rid of the stroke we'll make we'll use
purple I think and we'll position it
beneath
I'm gonna do something over here so if I
come over to appearance you know we can
add multiple strokes on the same path so
just come over here and hit add new
stroke we want it to go beneath the
current stroke right around here and
wait where did it go
damn it add new stroke first let me
change it to white and right now it's on
top of this stroke so out there it was
delete this one drag it to the trashcan
and increase this size move right around
there okay
I mean maybe just work with that yeah
I'll leave it that size and maybe add a
highlight white one right here actually
let me use that real quick and you know
what we'll do like this take that just
replicate it oh great my mouse is about
to die one second alright and what I'll
do is I mm yeah give that no fill give
it a stroke white turn this thing up for
the stroke and come over here with the
add Anchor Point tool and one right
there and then maybe right here and then
delete these points real quick yeah we
can leave those and then change the
stroke to this there we go that way it's
perfect all right
I can always scale it down just a little
bit actually let me go
alright delete that delete those alright
alright so it's kind of looking great
bish let's hear but not quite so need to
think here still just trying to play
around with this and visualize it a
little bit and see if there's any
changes that I can make that will help
this effect so click on nut stroke take
it down
maybe quite a bit
how about I take this and oops this
right here
however okay so let me real quickly try
to do something take this point this
this this and this delete them and the
reason that's overlapping is because
this one has a duplicated replicated
rather than this issues occurring there
we go
so now we just have well if I can get it
and get out the layers here I must have
deleted that one damn it
step forward clear
all right so that path okay so real
quickly let me take I'm gonna try that
again damnit appearance we want to just
get rid of this there there it goes so
now we still have this thing so what we
can do
see what I'm trying to emulate here as
best as I can is this little tale from
the G I wanted to make it look like it's
stem almost from the grape so I took all
just temporarily take all this outline
the strokes get it to a small size oops
actually something's not working out
correctly expand appearance
something's not working out one second
okay that's because it didn't have all
the DM layer selected when I did this
object path expand appearance I mean no
outlet stroke rather there we go
so if I scale this down just to see what
this looks like you know the question is
does that look like grape so and also is
it discernible enough to look like a G
definitely I would say on this level
that's why I've if it's like this though
it kind of you lose the grape aspect it
looks more like a G of course because
it's a standard G but if you tilt it a
little bit it does seem to have the
desired effect we see you know I
actually kind of think I want to stick
with this so to further rape not that
that's funny or anything
let's see your rapes not funny although
George Carlin did say rape can be funny
just depends on the context and it
depends on the joke okay so anyhow let
me come over here a character get that
squished in real quick
let me expand the appearance of all this
stuff not this one now leave rape over
there
together do it again real quick killing
stroke okay so I take this and
yeah yeah it's that was definitely you
you can read great from it so I would
say in that idea it is pretty effective
let me bring this down here I great G
I like it cool stuff so that is my grape
all right
so I do these routinely maybe once every
two weeks or so so yeah check out design
course comm if you haven't yet subscribe
here on YouTube and very shortly I'm
gonna be having design course premium
ready to go and that's a service that
has full video courses along with design
course mentor in which I train you how
to become a better designer all right
I'll see you tomorrow with a new video
all right good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
