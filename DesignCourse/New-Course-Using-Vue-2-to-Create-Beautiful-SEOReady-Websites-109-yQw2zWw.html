full-stack developer for the last two
decades and I've worked with some of the
top companies including LinkedIn in
Pluralsight in this course I'm going to
show you how to use the power of view
j/s to create modern web layouts that
are fully SEO friendly without having to
dive into any complex coding like

personal portfolio website in Adobe

to make it a reality in the browser with
UJS in this course you're going to learn

prototypes in adobe experience design
