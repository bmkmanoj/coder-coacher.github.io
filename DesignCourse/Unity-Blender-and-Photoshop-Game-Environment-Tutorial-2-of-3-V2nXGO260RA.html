calm today we're going to move into part
two of the unity room tutorial I'm not
sure what else to call it I but yeah
today we're going to be focusing on
Photoshop in actually designing the
textures all right so if you need access
to the project files are available for
free in the description below this video
and also if you haven't yet subscribe
here on YouTube all rights get started
alright so in Photoshop let's go ahead
to file open and we will open up our to
UV PNG files alright so the first one
we're going to work with the wall UV
layout oops alright and what we want to
do is first we'll just kind of fill this
in with a gray color the background so
this layer 0 right here is our actual UV
so what we want to save is most call
this UV and we'll create a new layer
ctrl shift + n and also by the way when
you open up I or go to file new and if
you have your background content set the
transparent as I always do when you open
up a file like that it may have a
background that's white so that's why
all right so anyhow I create a new layer
ctrl shift in n and we'll name it
background and we will fill this in with
a color now just a mid gray color right
around there just like that ok so
obviously when we specify 25% when we
export that UV layout from blender we
can see that you know it's not too I I
guess you could say there's not a lot of
contrast we can still basically see
what's going on also it's also very
large or only at twenty-five percent I
this is it at one hundred percent but
I'm just going to go back and just go to
I fit on screen here alright so what we
want to do now is actually import a
texture so I've used cg textures calm in
the past and I'm going to do it now and
basically if you go to cg textures calm
we have all these different texture
categories that we can go for if you
click on metal and we click on there and
we click on this right here I'm going to
be using this image one right here and
as you can see it's kind of split up
into two different panels and it kind of
just has the same basic shape as our ruv
so for our balls basically so you can
login create a quick account it's free
and if you want something like a really
massive size you have to become a
premium member but we don't need that I
so remember our documents 2048 x 2048
and this extends beyond that so that's
just fine and I so click that it will
download it now you can see I've already
downloaded at once once you have that
downloaded go ahead and open it up in
photo just like that and we're going to
take these rectangular marquee tool and
just select around here and just to
right around there on that crease and we
don't want any of the grass or anything
in there so hit ctrl-c to copy close
that out and what we want to do is
basically create a layer kind of for
each one of these sections all right so
obviously some of these UVs do overlap
but that's really not too big of a
problem it'll make our time go quicker
if we were to try to do every single one
of those so what we want to do is I go
ahead and take the this tool right here
the magic wand tool left click I guess I
we could start I'm going to start right
here in the middle just because it seems
like it's the biggest one and I'm going
to go ahead and hit ctrl shift and n for
a new layer hit ok and what I'm going to
do is just fill it in with our
background color same color is back here
and then I'm going to hit ctrl shift end
for a new layer and make it a clipping
mask
alright so now anything that goes inside
this layer will only be visible in the
area in which we filled so we can hit
ctrl D our command D to deselect and
then we'll have this I right here so
remember rarely copied the initial in
the metal texture so if the juices hit
control V paste that in and now we're
going to have to do some work in terms
of scaling it down so we're going to hit
ctrl T shift and alt and obviously the
height needs to be at least the same
height as the area we filled in and we
just kind of want to get some of our the
portions where it shows the panels
connecting pretty much in line with the
very right and left side so i'll show
you how we'll do that i'm going to zoom
up here and i'm just going to move this
over I may hit ctrl T real quick and fix
that by just rotating it slightly so
right there looks pretty good and now if
we wanted to make another panel I like
right here what we're gonna have to do
is duplicate that so ctrl shift D and
now I've set a shortcut for that if you
don't have that shortcut set up you just
go to edit preferences shortcuts and set
that up or you can just right-click and
duplicate layer for now on I'm just
going to use the shortcut and now what
I'm going to do is go ahead and flip
this horizontal well actually we don't
have to flip it horizontally we can just
move this over here just like that and
then just so we can see the other side
over here I could just take this with
the rectangular marquee tool select
happening somewhere in the middle hit
delete and then take the eraser tool
with a soft feather brush right around
there about 90 pixels hold your left
mouse button drag down hold shift so you
can go down perfect angle so now it
looks like it's an actual you know
single panel that is the width of this
area
alright so now what we want to do is go
back to a UV layout click on there
create a new layer ctrl shift n give it
our background color control D to
deselect and now to make things a little
bit quicker we can just duplicate these
layers ctrl shift + D move them up here
right click create clipping mask and now
you can see we have this situation going
where it's basically pretty much correct
I at least on this side so obviously if
we were to do this and just keep on
doing that for every single one of these
it really wouldn't look right because it
would just look like it's you know there
wouldn't be any variance there when it
would all look like a pattern so that's
the issue on going to direct address
when it comes to the portion after I
replicate all these into each one of
these rectangles so for now I'm not
going to worry about that what I want to
do is just make sure that we can see
both sides of the actual panel and
replicate it for all the rest of these
so I've paused and kind of fix this one
over here you don't always have to
another way to create variants though is
to go to edit transform flip horizontal
on this top layer over here and you can
either use this side although you can
see it's basically this being flipped or
you can just come over here too I
deleted that that's why I'll never mind
no big deal I'm just going to bring this
back over here now that's flipped and
i'm going to show you just one more time
before i pause it and then just do them
all myself because that would be really
boring to watch every single one of
these so we just select the layer will
fill it in after creating a new layer
oops control shift then paste that in or
fill it in rather
and we'll take I you can use either or
i'm just going to use the bottom ones
duplicate those move them up top right
click create clipping mask and get these
moved into the place so we basically
have two layers to worry about we have
this one I that's this layer this one
over here is the other one so we just
move this over actually outside let me
see here there we go that's this one and
then this one can move like right there
and that's all it's going to be composed
of four doing it for the rest of these
panels alright so keep on doing that
process and then you can come back and
then we'll start on making well
basically it's going to consist of
primarily using this clone stamp tool
just to change these textures around on
each one of these so I'm going to go
ahead and pause alright so I've done it
to all these and we can see basically
not they all look a lot alike so there's
several different ways that we can
really just adjust these high to make
them look different so the first way is
just to use well actually i would say
before using the clone stamp tool we
could use flip so a lot of these if we
just take the layer will just want to
deal aunt random layers you created go
to edit transform flip vertical we've
now kind of moved some things around so
if we just take I any just random number
of these as you see I'm just holding
ctrl and left clicking some of these
edit transform flip vertical now we've
changed them up some of these least all
right so now let's go ahead and we'll
start from left to right so for this one
we don't have to really make any
adjustments I for this one and also to
select a layer if you don't have auto
select layer all you have to do is just
hit cold control or command and then
left click so it automatically selects
that layer alright so I'm
work with this layer right here and we
can see the certain areas where it has
kind of like a circle all throughout so
if you want to change things up oh it to
use is the clone stamp tool and for some
reason it's not showing me that size of
244 maybe you have to well we'll just
see okay there we go if you hold the Alt
key and then left click like up here for
example that means it's going to replace
whatever whatever is up here right there
alright so if I left-click once you see
we've just gotten rid of that little
eyeball part but it's not an eyeball but
that's one going to call it so I as you
can see it won't really affect other
layers because we're on a clipping mask
it's only going to affect what's inside
this portion so if i wanted to do that
again for example let's say we just want
to take right around here all left click
oops one second okay I was on the wrong
layer i have to be above there we go I
alt left click may be right around there
alright so let's move to the next one
right here alright so we see a
duplication right here and here that
area so if i take the move tool alt left
click right on it we have it so i have
to do is take this clone stamp tool
maybe just come down here and then click
right there alright so pretty easy next
one i would say is this these two so
take my move tool I'll alt left click or
control left click I mean control left
click I'm sorry I we select that take
our clone stamp tool maybe come up
around right around here all right
I'm just looking to see if there's any
other areas that look like it's kind of
just duplicated right there obviously so
select that layer down here as well all
right this over here is real messed up
so let's because it's basically flipping
on itself right and left so we select
that we can change this up a lot let me
come right here
see I just you know real quickly doing
that can change the look real quickly
all right so I'm going to do that for
the rest of these and you can do on your
own and I'm going to pause this all
right so I only made a couple more
adjustments around here just so nothing
looks blatantly you know screwed up so I
that is basically it I for this these
panels now what I wanted to do is add a
couple windows so we're going to go back
to cg textures for this and let me
navigate to the right section here we
have windows we have all sorts of
different windows that we can use I'm
going to click on this one and then just
try this one out alright so go ahead and
download the I this I think the 1600 x
1200 seven would be just fine so if you
download that and open that up in
Photoshop what we want to do is just
take one of these with the rectangular
marquee tool and just drag a rectangle
around so we get the black as well just
for one of them you can use any of them
you want alright so once you've done
that we'll go back into our main
document and we're going to add it just
on a couple because then I want every
single one of them to have one mainly to
save some work so I I guess we'll go
ahead and control left click on this one
this one will have one alright hit ctrl
shift end for a new layer make it a
clipping mask ctrl-v to paste now it's
not going to show up because I might
show up over here in the middle just
drag it over ctrl T shift and alt and
just kind of try to Center it up in this
individual panel alright I'm going to go
image
adjustments brightness and contrast just
turn it up a little bit it ok and then I
want to roughen off the edges just a tad
bit using the eraser tool and using one
of these brushes that go use 90
just going around it making a peer as
though you know it's like old and stuff
because these I that the exact edges
don't look entirely correct that we
can't cut out basically just something
like that all right so that's it 100
percent now going to take that control a
and ctrl-c to copy it and then we'll
just choose another one to put that in
so how about this one right here so
select that that top layer ctrl shift n
make that a clipping mask hit enter and
then paste it in with control V deselect
auto suck layer and we'll put that right
here and then just to make it a little
bit different from that window we can
play around maybe with the clone stamp
tool the size we got to take down quite
a bit and I all left click maybe just
over here yeah that's fine this one will
be a little bit of a cleaner window we
can go also go to edit transform flip
horizontal alright cool and also maybe
Center that up a little bit better all
right so that's basically going to be
only windows that we have for this and
now we wanting to do is go ahead and
move on to our floor area so we want to
open back up the other document that we
had which is right here and I'm just
going to copy these areas again and
first I'm going to fill in the
background color here beneath this UV
layer so we can actually see the floor
and we're going to go ahead in at the
top on top just go ahead and paste in
and yeah let's go ahead and move that
down beneath the UV layer so we could
see alright so it's a good thing that
the texture is big enough so that we
don't get any of these seams in here so
what we'll do is just I
take this here and moving in right
around there and what we want to do for
the I the floor I believe this is the
floor wine hopefully and we want to make
it look like it's kind of just like
roughened on the edges a little bit
darker so the way we can do that is
first I'm going to duplicate this layer
just so we have a copy of this to work
for this one so I'm going to just hide
that one and then I'm going to go ahead
and take the elliptical marquee tool by
left-clicking and dragging out and then
just somewhere in the center hit shift
and alt and then just scale it up just a
little bit larger than what the UV is
showing and then control I oops no no
control shift and I will invert that
selection so we can hit delete just so
we have an area that's pretty close to
the UV sighs alright so what we want to
do at this point is basically create a
new control shift n clipping mask on
this layer then what we want to do is
take the brush tool and we'll use that
brush right down here I think it's a
default Barash like right here and will
increase the scale and I'm going to see
you know if 174 looks like it will work
well and just make our foreground color
a little bit darker of a grey and and we
will adjust this to the blend mode it's
not going to look just like this
and you just kind of want to vary it a
little bit all right and then we'll go
ahead and take the blend mode so if we
just like left click it and then left
click it again we can see it's selected
now we can use our arrow keys the down
arrow key select move then do that and
then we can see what you know what this
kind of looks like I like that actually
the overlay because it's not too
noticeable but it does show a little bit
of I it being darker around its edges
all right so basically now what we want
to do is in this by the way is what it
looks like without that UV layer on
there all right so now let's go ahead
and get this back and view over here and
position that layer just around here and
this is going to be the ceiling maybe
I'll come up where it's less gritty I
guess you could call it all right we'll
do the same thing there real quick so
we'll take our lip t'kul marquee tool
shift the nault by left-clicking and
dragging all right there looks pretty
good hopefully I don't cut off on the
view vs and then I will go ahead control
shift I to invert the selection delete
control D to deselect and then create a
new layer make that a clipping mask as
you can see i kind of just going to
eyeball ready explain it enough so
hopefully you get the drift and we'll
take and do the same thing right here
for this layer so
just going around all right and then
change it to overlay there all right so
the two different looking things the
floor looks a little bit more scuff than
the ceiling which makes sense obviously
and I just for the fun of it I didn't do
this in the presentation or the preview
of it but just because I want to
experiment you don't have to do this by
the way you could be done I was planning
on ending this section airing tutorial
right here between you know both of
these and the floor but i'm going to add
something i'm going to take the brush
tool and I'm going to use one of my
blood spatter brush and let's see here
now I'm just going to experiment with
this because I want to see I don't know
I'm demented I just want to see what it
looks like if we put some blood on the
floor or something alright so yeah let's
make that small or maybe not that small
yeah okay well I think it yeah we'll
click twice here changed ooh no no no no
I'm going to back up there I put that on
the UV layer that's a big no no I'm just
going to create a new layer up here and
do that and then change the blend mode
and maybe we're on the air color burn
seems to work well and then maybe also
do it over here I'm one of these let me
just choose this one come at the top
create a new layer choose a different
one it's one that looks like it's like
dripping down I think
and by the way I'll try to remember to
link to these in the description of this
video but if you I if I don't all you
have to do is just go to google and type
in blood Photoshop blood spatter brushes
it's basically i'll be linking you
whatever shows up there try this one
take that scale down a lot okay not that
small and then I changes to color burn I
think I like darken for that one better
all right cool all right now that is it
all right so i basically tomorrow we're
going to step into unity and bring
everything together that's going to be
the exciting part all right so I'm gear
Simon of design course calm subscribe
here if you haven't yet at YouTube
alright so I'll see you tomorrow
