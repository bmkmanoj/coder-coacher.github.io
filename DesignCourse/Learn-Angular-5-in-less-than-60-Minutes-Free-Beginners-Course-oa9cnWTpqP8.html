installing angular
you're going to need a couple
prerequisites and that is no js' with
the node package manager otherwise known
as the NPM now the reason we need this
is because we're going to use it to
install the angular command-line
interface or CLI to help us get started
installing a new angular 5 project
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it all right so I'm
gonna switch to the desktop and open up
your command line or console I'm using a
console emulator called commander this
is for Windows I you can just go to
google and type it it's free and I'm
going to first check to see whether or
not we have no js' installed note - V
yes obviously I do but if either of
these commands go unrecognized for you
then head on over to node J S org and
click on downloads and then download the
suitable installer based on your
operating system install it all the way
through the default options which will
include the node package manager and
then reload your console and then rerun
these and you'll find that they provide
you with version numbers okay so now
we're going to install angular 5 like I
mentioned through the command line
interface alright so what we'll do is
first we have to install it so NPM
install at angular four slash CLI and
then add the - g for global flag and
that will install it on your machine as
a whole so if you hit enter it will
install it and I already had it
installed so I don't need to do that and
once it's done fit when it's done I'm
installing just type in mg - V alright
and that will give you the current
version number right here okay so to get
started to create a new project by the
way before I get there if you just type
in ng it's going to give you a ton of
options that you can use so
we're gonna start a new project now ng
new oh by the way make sure you hop into
your code folder if you have one alright
ng new I'm gonna call this ng 5 for the
name of the project I'm also going to
specify a style flag equals s CSS for
SAS and then also we want routing to be
integrated and setup for us by default
so as we do this it will run through for
a little bit and I'm just gonna pause
until it's finishes really it doesn't
take more than 30 to 60 seconds alright
so now it's finished now all we have to
do is CD or hop into it so CD and then
the folder name and g5 and now we can
run ng surf and it will take just a
little bit of time while it builds out
the project and notice it says localhost
4200 is where the dev server will be
accessible and I will bring up a new
browser window to get there and there we
have it that is our angular 5 app that
is now set up and ready to go in the
browser and you can also open up your
code editor I'm going to off-screen real
quick open up the new folder alright and
here we go we have the project structure
all set up and in the next lesson or the
next section of this course we're going
to go ahead and take an in-depth look at
what angular 5 components are
hey everyone Gary Simon of course Seto
and today we're gonna take a look at
what angular 5 components are now you
can think of components as just being
the basic building blocks of your
angular 5 application so if I switch
over to the desktop we have our new
angular 5 project open I'm using Visual
Studio code and for the most part you're
going to be working within the source
app folder when you're developing your
angular 5 application now by default the
angular command-line interface when it
generates this project will create a
single component for you and that is an
app component ts4 typescript so when
you're thinking about components you can
really think of them as being structured
in three different sections so first up
here we have our imports right now we're
only importing one which is just a
component from the angular core library
and then in here is the component
decorator and this allows you to specify
different properties that help define
the structure of your component so we
have a selector which shows a prutte
we'll get to that first in a second we
also have a template URL this allows you
to define where the actual HTML template
will be located and then style URL this
is again because we defined we set up
our project to work with sass we have
our s CSS extension and then finally the
third section is just the export class
component this is where all of the logic
resides for your angular 5 application
alright so how do we actually create a
new component well you can use the
angular CLI which makes that quick and
easy
so we're gonna go back here and right
now we have our ng serve command running
we want to leave this up so we don't
have to keep on running that command so
I'm going to open up a new console
all right and the way we generate a new
component is very simple so what we'll
do is type in ng generate and what is it
that we want to generate well a
component and we're gonna name it home
all right I'll just take a couple
seconds and it tells you which files it
creates and also if it updates anything
all right let's go ahead and generate
one more for our project ng we can also
use a shorthand syntax G for generate C
for component and then this time we'll
name this one about alright great so
let's go back and we can now see we have
two new folders in here and these are
based on the name that you specified
when using the CLI and each one has a
component file it has a SAS file and an
HTML template alright so let's talk
about nesting a component so we now have
two additional components so let's look
at how we can nest our home component
into the base app component down here so
what we want to do is open up our app
component HTML now notice all of this
HTML right here this coincides with what
is currently showing up right here so we
want to remove all of that all right
we're going to leave the router outlet
at the bottom just for now and I'll tell
you what that is a little bit later on
what we want to do is put in an
unordered list we're going to put kind
of like a very simple navigation right
here router linked is a directive that
you use that will allow you to basically
change the actual component so we'll say
home we'll get to that by the way in the
routing lesson I'm going to change this
to about and this will be about
alright so the way we actually nest a
component if I come over here real
quickly and we go to about and we look
at the about component will see the
selector is app - about so the way we
nest it is if we go back to our app
component we simply put in app - home
just like that and you'll see the same
pattern if we go to our app component
this is called a prutte well there's
also an index.html and we can see a
bruit right here alright so let's go
ahead back and just save whatever we
need to save here alright great so that
is the very basics of how components
work and how they're structured and how
you can nest them in the next section
we're going to take a look at template
and styling in our angular 5 app
hey everyone Garry Simon of course Etro
let's take a look at angular 5
templating and styling so going back
let's open up our home home component
typescript file right here I'm gonna hit
control B here on Visual Studio code
just to get rid of that sidebar okay so
when it comes to defining a template
we'll see by default we have the
template URL property and the value is
associated with our home component HTML
and this simply allows you to designate
an external template file which helps
kind of keep things you know separated
and organized so you don't have all of
your HTML stuck in your component file
however you do have the option for
instance if you have a really small
amount of template code well you can
just change this here to template and we
could put in multi-line HTML if we use
backticks which is usually to the left
of the number one key and inside of here
we can then put for instance this is my
HTML and if we save it and go back to
our project we'll see it says this is my
HTML but we're not going to do that I
did want to show you that possibility so
I'm going to backup all right now when
it comes to styling you'll see that we
have the same sort of ability but we'll
get to that in a second I want to
actually write some HTML for a basic app
that we're going to be working on here
in our home component HTML file so to do
that I'm gonna put in a div class
container color - dark and by the way
this is all going to be custom CSS I'm
not using any type of front-end
framework like bootstrap or anything and
don't worry there's not too much HTML
here at all so just hang with me we have
a div class of call and then a P element
and this will be at a bucket list item
so our app once again is gonna be based
it based on just saving bucket list
goals or something like that
all right and then this one is going to
say your bucket list all right and then
we'll have another div class of
container this is going to be color
light and in this column we're going to
put in a P class of SM for small text
use this form below to add a new bucket
list goal what do you want to do with
your life okay now after that we're
going to have a form a very simple form
ijeo and this will be just a form
element here with an input type of text
a class of txt a name of item and a
placeholder of life goal next we'll have
one more input type is a submit a class
of BTN for button and a value of add
item and then finally down here we're
just about finished we'll put in AP
class of life - container and inside of
here just temporarily I'm going to
hard-code a single life goal or bucket
list cool I want to climb a mountain
okay in the future we will make this
dynamic okay so we'll go ahead and save
that and what we want to do now is talk
a little bit about the CSS so we're
going to talk about styling here so of
course we have the same sort of setup
here we have style URLs where we can
define the CSS files that are associated
with this component now once again you
can write inline CSS just by changing
this value to styles we leave the
brackets we put in back
so we'll put one here and here and then
we can define our CSS as needed like P
font weight is bold and then div color
is gray and so if we save this you'll
see the new result we have our grade
text and all that once again though we
don't want that we want to keep things
nice and separated so let's hop into
this sass file you can see there's
nothing here by default alright so we're
going to go ahead and before we get to
this home component right here I do want
to step into there is another file
called styles and this is where you can
add global styles that will apply to
pretty much all of your templates so in
here I'm going to paste just a few quick
rule sets
okay so first I'm importing a Google
font called railway with weights of 300
and 700 next in the body I'm just
changing the background getting it some
padding a font family of railway and
color making the font light we have an
unordered list which we created earlier
and just some basic rule sets change the
padding a margin and then just just
other you know very simple type of CSS
rule sets right here so save that and
then go back to your home component sass
file and we have some more roll sets
that I'm not going to type out by hand I
will just quickly overview these all
right so first up here we have a
container we're actually using the new
display the CSS grid for defining our
layout which is an improvement over CSS
flexbox and this is another property
that's associated with the grid and this
helps to just basically do define our I
our layout so also we have our call we
have our color dark and light our inputs
we're styling these just to make them
look better and then finally our what's
called life container div so if I save
this and go back to the
browser will see that this does not work
because I forgot to change back this
property style URL plural there we go
now if we save will go back and there we
go
all right great so now going forward in
the next section we're going to take a
look at property and event binding along
with interpolation I'll see you then
hey everyone Gary Simon of course Etro
and in the previous lesson we set up a
template with some basic styling and
let's go see if we can actually make it
function so if I show you the result in
the browser we can see right now nothing
is going to work so the way that we can
start to make this more interactive is
through interpolation property binding
and event binding so let's talk about
what interpolation is first so let's go
back to our project and let's go to our
or have our home component file right
here so interpolation is used I for the
purpose of whenever you need to
communicate properties that are defined
here in our component class then we use
interpolation and the template to
display those values or those properties
so just to give you a demonstration will
come just right up here and we're going
to create a property called item count
it's going to be a number and we're
going to set it to 4 initially alright
so we'll save that and we'll go to our
app our home component HTML and notice
where it says your bucket list let's
change this or add to it rather a
parenthesis and then inside of it we're
going to use interpolation to display
the item count value so an interpolation
works by designating double curly
brackets like that and then the name of
the property alright very simple so
let's save that and there we go we can
see it now says for of course we're
gonna change this to be dynamic a little
bit later all right so let's also talk
about property binding so let's say for
some reason that we want to use the
component class right here in this
section to control the value of our add
item button text so if we go back we
could see that it says add item let's
say for some reason we want to control
the actual value property so the way we
can do that we'll set up a new property
called be
and text a type string and we'll set it
to add an item right now says add item
save that we'll go back to our home
component HTML and right here where it
says value we can use interpolation BTN
text so we'll save that we go back we
can see that works now property binding
works very similarly so we see we have a
property here called value well what we
can actually do is change this and wrap
it in brackets which is how you define a
property binding and then we don't have
to have the squiggly brackets anymore so
we save that and we'll see that the
result is the same
okay so let's also talk about two-way
data-binding
because this right here when it comes to
both property binding and interpolation
it's only one direction it's going from
the component to the template but we can
also create what's called two-way
data-binding
so going back to our project here what
if we wanted to use our input text field
right here to both retrieve and set its
value from a component class well we can
use what's called the ng model to create
that two-way data-binding so in order
for this to work and have access to ng
model we have to import the forms module
okay so to do that we're going to come
to our app module TS right here and
we're going to add the following line
just going to put this here at the top
so import forms module from the angular
forms library and then we added to the
imports property here or array rather so
we'll save that and we'll go back to our
home component file and we're going to
add in a another property call
goal text and we're gonna set it to a
string and initially my first life goal
alright so this is where it's going to
go from the component to the component
HTML template so now we'll go to our
HTML and where it says right here we're
going to add one thing at the very end
and the way you set up the two-way
data-binding
is by specifying a bracket and then
inside of the brackets are the
parentheses ng-model
equals gold text now let's also just
temporarily underneath it a lot of BR
and a span and we're going to put in the
gold text through interpolation so let's
save that okay now we can see we have my
first life goal this is coming from the
one direction in terms of going from the
component to this HTML template and then
we can also see it's doing the same
thing down here now if I start editing
this text we can now see it's working in
the reverse direction because this right
here is coming from the component class
yet it's being set based on the value
right here and so that's how two-way
data-binding works now let's also talk
about event binding so we know how to
capture user input as we just
demonstrated right here and communicate
it to our class so how can we make our
add an item button actually work and
save the user submitted data somewhere
so that's where event binding comes in
we can use event binding to capture a
variety of user initiated events to
initiate logic in our component class so
angular 5 does support a lot of
different types of events but we're
going to use a click event so let's come
over here and we can get rid of this by
the way and when it comes to our input
submit button we're going to add a click
event so when it comes to click events
you define them by wrapping em in
parenthesis so we've put in a clique
which is a type of vet event and then
we'll call a method called add item we
don't actually have to pass in any type
of value here within the argument
because this is already being saved in
our component class all right so let's
go ahead and save this and go back to
our component and we're going to define
a array it's going to be goals equals
array all right now when it comes to
this ng on a knit this is a life cycle
hook which is initiated when the app
loads or the component itself loads so
any code in here will get ran when the
component is loaded so we're gonna say
this dot first item count we're gonna
make that dynamic this dot goals dot
length all right so we can also just I
get rid of this and then we're going to
create our add item method down here so
we're gonna say this stock goals dot
push this goal text and then this dot
gÃ¼ell text we're going to clear out the
input after it's submitted and then this
dot item count equals this stuff gules
dot length okay
so we'll save that and let's go back to
our project here all right my first life
goal now you can see it says zero
because we have this default one added
now you can see it keeps on counting as
we add new items now it's not getting
shown here because we haven't actually
coded for that so what we want to do is
use what's called ng for to iterate
through this array in the template okay
so let's go back to our template and
where it says I want to climb a mountain
we'll get rid of that
and just after the class we're gonna put
in asterik ng 4 equals let goal of goals
then we simply reference goal through
interpolation so we'll save that alright
so let's go ahead and add an item and
awesome ok so now you can play around
with this if you want obviously not much
functionality at this point but going
forward we're going to take now a look
at animation in angular 5 and see what
it would take to animate these in and
out alright I'll see you then
hey everyone Gary Simon of course cetera
let's go ahead and take a look at
angular 5 animation by continuing on
with the project that we've been working
on throughout this course so it would be
really cool for instance if we could
animate each one of these items as they
get added so if I add a new life goal we
can see there's no animation that really
takes place so to get started with
angular animation in angular 5 we have
to go to our console and we have to
install or import the angular animations
library so npm install angular
animations will see that latest and then
we'll save it as a div that development
dependency so this will take just a
little bit of time okay now if this
issue happens with you where it says
operation not permitted what we can do
is open up a new commander window or
your console run it as administrator ng5
npm install angular animations at latest
and we'll save it alright great it
worked this time so let's go ahead and
go back to our project and we have to go
to the app module because we just
installed it however we need to add it
to our module here so the way we do that
is we add a import so it's import
browser animations module from the
angular platform browser animations
library and then we take this and we add
it as an import all right so we'll save
that now we want to actually import the
animation to the given component from
which we want to add the animations to
so we go to our home component and up
here just under our first import we're
going to import a number of animation
specific functions so we're gonna import
trigger style transition animate
keyframes query and stagger from animate
their angular sorry animations okay so
next the area in which you define your
animations resides within the component
decorator as another property called
animations so we're going to comma here
animations and then our animations go
within here okay
so the first animation specific function
that we use to setup an animation is
called trigger so we put in trigger and
the first argument accepts the name of
the animation we're going to call this
goals next we put in an array alright so
this is where a number of different
animation specific functions will reside
ok so let's go ahead and next we're
going to specify a transition and we're
gonna say in the first argument any by
wildcard to any so this transition will
get activated when pretty much any state
goes to any state and then and here in
the second argument we open up another
array and we're going to use query so
query is another animation specific
function where we can say in the first
argument when something enters the dom
then we'll say style the opacity will be
0 and then we'll put in optional true
right here and sometimes the animations
will fail if you don't add this optional
true all right and then we're gonna put
in another one another query but the
same thing enter and we're going to
stagger and stagger basically is a
function that allows you to take a
number of elements in the Dom like our
list for instance and the delay that you
set up which in our case is 300
milliseconds will place a delay on when
each subsequent Dom element will start
to animate so it creates a staggering
animation of sorts as the name would
imply
so after here in the first argument we
put a comma and then we open up an array
and this by the way is getting really
annoying so I'm gonna change that real
quick I'm gonna go with preferences and
settings all right okay so now I'm gonna
go back get me increase my size okay so
in here we're going to use the animate
function and we'll say at 0.6 seconds
ease in and then we're going to use
keyframes animations which this is not
required I'm kind of throwing everything
at you right now
just to show you the full capabilities
inside of keyframes it accepts a number
of style functions so the first one will
be style of opacity 0 transform will be
translate Y at negative 75% so they're
gonna come from the top and then we're
gonna put offset 0 so that's its
starting position so let's go ahead copy
this and we'll paste it twice and we'll
just change these values up this will be
0.5 so this is going to happen at at the
middle of this 0.6 seconds duration for
animation this will be actually 0.3
rather and this will be 1 this is at the
end of the animation this app acity will
be 1 and I just realized I didn't have a
closing parenthesis there this one for
translate Y it's actually gonna go
further by 35 pixels from its default
position and then right here it will be
0 okay that looks pretty good right
there for me we also want to add after
this point where we have our
all of these closing brackets and
parentheses we're going to add an
optional true right here so I'm going to
copy this and we're going to put it
right here all right so let's go ahead
and save that that was I know this is
probably very confusing at this point
but I you'll see kind of how it's all is
just deconstructed once we take a look
at the result
so my first life goal oh that's right
half next to actually have to add it to
our template so the second step of
course once we define the animations
we're going to apply the animations in
the template so real quickly we're going
to come to our home component and where
it says div class container Lite we're
going to add at goals and that's the
name of the animation trigger goals dot
length all right we have an issue here
yep let's fix that there we go
okay so real quickly just so we have
some initial values to work with for our
goals array let's come back here and I'm
going to just paste in three different
values so my first life goal I want to
climb a mountain go ice-skating so if we
save it we go back there we go let me
refresh that one more time
and there you go that is a stagger
animation along with multi-step
animation through the keyframes property
and as you can see looks really cool
let's try adding another one and of
course if we leave a blank we're not
doing any type of checks right now but
there you go
all right so let's also make this remove
actual elements when we click on them on
these little ghouls so to do that we're
gonna use
once again click event binding so what
we'll do is right
where we have let go of ghouls right
after we're going to put in on click
remove item we're going to pass in an
index of called I so we have to update
this let I equal index alright so we'll
save that
oops let make sure and then put a
closing quote there we're going to go
back to our home component and now we
have to define that remove item method
and we'll put in here RI and we'll
simply say that this goals dot splice
this is all just typical JavaScript I
and one alright so then in order for it
to actually animate back out we have to
add a another query and this time don't
worry it'll be a bit easier to work with
so we're gonna put a comma after this
we're gonna copy this one alright and
this is going to be leave so when
anything leaves the dom then we can
change just these values you're going to
reverse them basically so this is going
to be 1 this will be 0 because it's
starting at position 0 and then we have
our opacity is same here this changes to
0 and then this right here gets changed
to negative 75 % so we're just flipping
everything essentially so we'll save
that all right so let's click on one and
there you go awesome stuff so as you can
see the animation library and
capabilities of angular 5 are really
really powerful and while we just kind
of scratch the surface I did kind of
throw everything at you in terms of the
potential capabilities of animation so
of course a lot of them could be a lot
more simple than what we just did so I
definitely suggest experimenting with
alright so in the next lesson we're
going to take a look at the angular 5
router
hey everyone Gary Simon of course tetro
in this lesson we're gonna take a look
at the angular 5 router alright so in a
project right now we do have two
different components so we have the home
component and about component now if I
get out the inspector in the console and
I click on about you'll see that the
errors so let's actually make this work
so that it will transition between
what's displayed here in the home
component template and then also what's
displayed here in this section when
about is clicked ok so when we started
this project with the CLI or the
command-line interface tool we added the
- - routing flag and this sets up this
file right here a prowling module so the
first thing we have to do is import the
components that we want to set up
routing for so in our case we have two
different components we have home
component so we're importing home
component from home home component and
we don't have to add the dot ts
extension it will do that for us and
then also our about component from
aboutabout component alright next this
is where inside of this little array
here is where we set up our paths so
let's open this up and we're going to
put in an object with the first property
being path and this is going to be the
home path so we're not putting anything
inside of the value and then the
component is home component very very
easy so now we can add a comma here I'll
just copy this and paste that this one
is going to be the path we'll be in the
actual address bar the URL it's gonna be
about and this will be about component
okay very very simple so now if we
actually look at the project we're gonna
see two of them well the reason that is
is because we have to go back to our
home or rather our app component HTML
and we can get rid of this selector
right here so now if we save this we'll
go back
and yay it works awesome okay
so let's also talk about what it takes
to set in fetch angular 5 route
parameters so while we don't need any
type of query parameters for our
particular project we're going to create
one just so that I can show you how you
can work in parameters to your URLs and
retrieve the values if you need to so
let's visit our app routing module file
once again and wait for our path for
about we're gonna add /id alright so
this ID here is what's called a route
parameter so you can't of course for
instance create multiple route
parameters called whatever and etc but
we're just gonna do one for this purpose
so let's save that and let's go back to
our app component file here we're going
to just put in kinda hard code of value
this would normally come obviously
perhaps something from like a database
value for a specific item or entry but
we're just gonna hard code it for now
okay so now if we save this and we go
we'll see of course that it will work
but how do we actually retrieve this
value right here in the component class
all right well let's go ahead back real
quick we'll go to our about component
alright we haven't worked in here yet
but what we want to do is add in just
one single import and that will be
activated route from the angular router
library alright so this will give us
access to the route parameters so next
we have to create an instance of
activated route and we do that through
what's called dependency injection and
that happens within the constructor
right here so the way you do that is
private will name it route and then
activated route then inside of here and
the constructor and this gets called
when the component is loaded we're going
to say this dot route dot params dot
subscribe we're going to take the
response and we're simply going to
console.log the response dot ID because
that's the name of the route ID that we
defined in the out routing module all
right so now if we go ahead and save
this we can now see it says inner
console he control shift I here in
chrome go to console you'll see it says
48 so now we can actually fetch the
route parameters in our component class
and ordinarily you would set a property
up here and then bind the property to
this value and then go do something like
for instance you would query an API to
get a specific item from a database all
right so let's also talk about another
topic which is component based router
navigation so sometimes you may need to
change the router outlet component based
on logic occurring in a component class
for instance so in this case let's
import router from the angular router
library at the top alright now once
again we have to create an instance of
router through dependency injection so
I'm going to simply copy and paste that
real quick private router set to router
and then we're going to create a custom
method send me home and we'll say this
dot router dot navigate and it accepts
here an array will say just empty and
this is really corresponding to the path
right here so we want them to go to the
home come home component so we'll set it
to the path right there alright so let's
save this and then next we open up the
about component template and I'm just
going to real quickly paste in a value
right here so all that's happening is
this is what I'm all about we're
creating a link here
and I click event method we're saying
send me home and it says take me back
that's all it is so let's save alright
if I click this there we go
alright so that was just a very quick
rundown of angular 5 router I really
what we cover will help you get by in
most instances when it comes to you know
working with the angular 5 router ok so
in the next section we're going to talk
about angular 5 services
hey all Gary Simon from corset row let's
take a look at angular 5 Services now so
far we've created two different
components and sometimes you need to
access code across multiple components
so instead of creating or rewriting the
same code in each component you can use
a service file to share that data now
service files are generally used for
making HTTP calls or for sharing data
between components so that's what we're
gonna do we're gonna say we want to take
our goals array that we've been working
on to the project and share it between
both the home and about component all
right so to get started we're gonna hop
over here to our console and we're going
to type in NG generate and what do we
want to generate well a service and
we're gonna call it data of course you
could use ng GS data for shorthand
syntax alright so now let's go ahead and
work within this data service file so
it's added just here and it actually
looks pretty similar to a regular
component file except instead of this
being designated as a component with a
component decorator
it's an injectable with an injectable
decorator right here so the one of the
best ways to share data between
components is to use the rxjs behavior
subject library so we're going to update
it to import behavior subject from rxjs
behavior subject alright next in our
class we're going to say we're going to
create a private property called goals
and this is going to be a new behavior
subject of type ne and we're gonna set
the initial value here to the initial
goal and then another silly oops
another silly life goal okay
so this is where from now on we are
actually going to set the default value
of that ghouls array will update the
other component later so then we're
going to say we're going to create
another property called ghoul is equal
to this goals from above as observable
next we're going to create a custom
method which will be accessible from our
other components called change goal
we're going to pass in the actual goal
and this goals thought next is goal and
that's it so before we can actually use
this service we have to import it into
the app module file so we're going to
import our data service from data
service and then we add it to the
providers array right here and then save
so let's go ahead to our home component
and we'll import it at the top just like
that and then we have to create an
instant instance of it through your
dependency injection so the way we do
that is in the constructor we also want
to change this we don't need to set this
here anymore
make that empty and so we're creating an
instance called underscore data to data
service and then on ng on an it just
underneath our item count we're going to
add this data and now we have access to
that goal where we subscribe the
response to this duck goals equals
response next we're also going to say
this data change goal this duck goals
and then underneath here we're going to
in our add item
take this and paste it here and then
also we'll paste that here as well
alright so every time an item is added
or removed we're going to change and
update that goal property okay
so let's save this and then we'll go
back I'm going to copy this real quickly
because we're also going to import this
into the about component because we want
access to that goals I array as well so
once again let me go back here we'll
copy this alright and then on ng on an
it we use this a data a gold I subscribe
just as before let's also define the
goals up here of any alright so now
let's go to our template and let's say
for some reason we want to use you know
in our about template we want to show
that goal so I'll just put in an
unordered list Li of ng for let go of
goals basically the same code as before
and the other template and we'll save so
now we can see it's now pulling from
that service file the initial goal and
another silly life goal oh and by the
way this should be updated as well I
think I forgot to do that and let's go
back real quick that's in our home
component so the item count needs to be
updated to this duxelles length well
take this put that right there and save
there we go just had an issue of the
order alright we'll add an item to it my
first life goal now if we go to about
there you go we don't have the style
set up quite right here but there they
are right here you can also see if we go
to home we click on one we'll go back
here and now it is updated in this
component as well so that's how you use
and share data between different
components using a service file of
course service files can be used for
much more than that in a lot of
different use cases but that's the
general gist of how they work basically
create a service file you import it into
your components and those components
will now have access to the properties
and the methods that are defined in that
service file alright so in the next
lesson we're going to conclude this
course by taking a look at angular 5
deployment
hey everyone Gary Simon of course etro
we're going to wrap everything up by
talking about angular 5 deployment so in
our little project here which you know
there's not a ton of functionality but
you really use it to learn quite a bit
about angular 5 we have something it's
really simple and it's ready to go so
how do we actually get this live
somewhere instead of just being on a
local development server well the first
thing we have to do is we act we have to
create a build and you do that through
the angular command line interface tool
so we're gonna go back to our console
and we're simply going to run to ng
build command now this will usually take
you know anywhere between 5 and 20
seconds and I just want to show you
something really important when we're
running these build commands so we can
see that I'm going to bring this up over
here it creates a dist folder when you
run that command and inside of here we
have a number of files and most notably
we could see this vendor dot bundled at
Jas and it's 3.1 megabytes so if you add
all these up it's close to three and a
half Meg's just for this build you don't
want to run the build command without
the production flag so we run ng build -
- prod and you're going to see the
massive difference in terms of the file
sizes and that's because when you add
production it runs a number of different
optimizations which makes the app
significantly smaller and faster and
just this command takes a little bit
more time by the way just to run because
it's doing more things behind the scene
but we'll see you know I'd say bring up
this it removes that dist folder
initially and then it will add it back
ok and now we'll see look at that the
biggest file file now is only 352 Meg's
this 160 so really there's about an 89%
reduction for this particular project
when you're running the production so at
this point
now that we have a distribution created
for our app now we can deploy it so if
your app doesn't have or doesn't rely on
any type of back-end server like I which
is our case then you have a number of
options you can take all the files here
in this discord
like these right here and you can simply
upload them to a server but just note if
you're uploading them to a subfolder
like your comm forward slash whatever
then you need to run the following build
command you would run ng build
production and then we use the base H
ref and right in here is where the URL
goes so that's where important otherwise
it won't be able to find the files
correctly for it to run properly now
another really quick way of deploying
your app is through what's called github
pages so there's a CLI tool command line
interface tool that you can use that
will help you with that so we're going
to put in an NPM install - g for global
angular - CLI - gh-pages so if you hit
enter that will save or install on your
computer I already have it installed so
I don't need to run it and you're also
going to need to get and you can
download that right here and what you
want to do is set up a github repo so to
do that simply create a github account
create a new repo we're gonna call this
ng v create repo right here and it tells
you the steps of what you need to do we
don't have to run get an it or get a
dream me let's just come over here and
I'll show you those steps real quick get
add all get commit first commit and then
get remote add actually we just paste
this line right here
all right and then finally get push you
origin/master you'll see if i refresh
this our project now shows up and then
we also have to rerun our ng build
command because the github pages is
actually a subfolder so ng build
production base href equals HTTP this is
going to be your username right here -
design course on github github github do
forward slash and then the repo name and
mine is ng5 so we'll run that alright
and once that's done we simply run
angular CLI gh-pages if it's successful
we'll see that it says momentarily yep
successfully published and now we can
access it at that URL so now I'll just
type in design course and github Daioh
and this will be ng5 there we go and now
you can even visit this in your own
browser and we will have our app alright
so hopefully you learned a lot about you
know quickly deploying your app of
course you may have other interests like
deploying your app to AWS or Heroku a
juror there's several others but right
now I'm not going to cover that just
because I wanted this course to be real
16 and simple and short alright so
always you can use Google to find those
things as well I did it myself so I hope
you learn quite a bit throughout this
course I definitely check out my site my
udemy profile subscribe my youtube
channel etc because I am pumping out
content especially regarding angular
being that angular 5 just released left
and right all right I'm Gary Simon I'll
talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
