just a little bit so some people can get
in here otherwise it's really not worth
doing this live probably not the
greatest idea to do this on a Friday
night although if you're a computer nerd
like me of course you're probably just
sitting here doing nothing anyway so
Prasad you asked in the chat how long
will it go on again I'm not gonna start
hearing like in a minute probably and
there's only about seven entries really
pathetic these used to be really popular
especially when I started the site a few
months ago but I well about a year ago
rat rather only seven entries this time
so all right it says 24 currently
watching momentarily I will switch to
the desktop
I'm and this is just a basically a
review because I we had a design
challenge at corsetry calm to design a
logo for a fictional service and we had
seven entries and so I'm going to rate
and critique these entries live Saudi
Arabia that's pretty wild for us us
people
most people who think of Saudi Arabia
just think of like people's heads
getting cut off and stuff but I I'm sure
that's not really the case
I hate all governments including the
United States alright cool so it's been
almost three minutes now should probably
get started because people you know most
people who watch this aren't going to be
watching live they'll be watching it
after the fact so you're gonna sit here
watch me talk and looking at this stupid
blank right yeah this thumb down here so
all right I'm gonna go ahead and get
started all right so let me go ahead and
cut to the main monitor okay so I every
now and then I will look back to the
live chat that's happening and
especially at the end just to answer any
questions if you guys have any or
whatever okay so I this challenge was to
design a symbol for a crypto currency
service just I'm not going to go over
all these details but basically the
requirements were to combine the ideas
of currency which is money and messaging
into a single simple symbol that's it
so upload a 500 by 500 concept upload
only one concept so again submit with
good design principles of mine I went
over all this stuff so use good white
space color contrast hierarchy and
simplicity and then I had some just
brief thumbnails down here okay so also
something unique last time I already had
these judge too but I have a little
rating system down here I'm gonna rate
them as I do the critiques down here
with my little admin panel so I'm gonna
start with the oldest first so this is
the the first one that we received
unfortunately when I look at this one
from Tim I don't really understand
what's happening so I definitely get
you know the zero ones and one zeros I I
understand that that is a hint at
digital currency and just the idea well
not currency but digital but the I guess
perhaps currency comes in with this see
perhaps I'm not really sure and I'm also
not really sure what the the actual form
is so unfortunately you know when it
comes to simplicity I'm gonna have to
rate you lower because there's actually
you know kind of a lot happening here
you have one zero zero one one up here
big one big o and then this see with
this coming up it's actually pretty
complex relevancy again I understand the
digital aspect but I don't see anything
else except for this C I so I'm gonna
have to rate that pretty low to the
uniqueness I'm just gonna leave that in
the middle because I don't mean
understand what's happening versatility
this is not actually very versatile
simply for the fact that these tiny zero
ones if we you know we scaled this down
real small guess what we can see the big
one and oh but we can't see that stuff
anymore so that's a big no-no so
versatility is going to suffer quite a
bit color in contrast this is actually
the strongest suit you know of this
particular entry because I there's a lot
of contrast here essentially and I do
like the I you know the this yellow
color on this darker background doesn't
look quite black so we'll give you a 8
on that one alright oops
well let me see down there alright so
I'm just gonna hit judge there and you
will receive an email
all right so Eric so you wanted to
combine the simplest forms of both of
the elements required currency I'm
messaging you so I just turned an
envelope into a coin Bank alright so
looking at this let me scale this up
just a bit I this is actually a pretty
solid entry I'm again I'm going to go
through just these five different
criteria here in terms of simplicity
it's not the most simple because we do
have you know a lot of lines that we can
see here but however I can it definitely
does look simple simple in terms of form
color you know you have highlights and
they're just your they're straight solid
highlights you also have their you know
just a few points where there are
shadows like down here again
everything's solid simple lines I like
it so simplicity with what maybe a six
or a seven
relevancy definitely relevant we have a
currency with the coin here and then we
have messaging with the envelope very
good uniqueness I I would say it's
pretty unique I also put it into the
idea of a coin Bank right here and
they're integrated pretty well so I'll
put that with a seven versatility again
we could scale this down and still
understand pretty much what's happening
at a small size it would also work well
in black and white so versatility will
put up a eight color in contrast looking
at this I have no problems with it in
terms of color and contrast so again
good solid entry here coming down here
from David alright so today with a
simple logo combining the Euro symbol
and a messaging bubble alright so it
took a lesson from the last time and
made the colors contrast okay so one of
the biggest problems and one of the the
areas IRA didn't really understand was
this the fact that this is left open
right here maybe that's to try to align
with this euro symbol but if you didn't
know otherwise that this was a messaging
service could you just look at like when
I don't think most people who look at it
would say hey that's this is a messaging
bubble I mean you do have this down here
but it's still well I think would have
been a more simple and better approach
which is to make this circle right here
the messaging circle bubble fill it in
with a solid color you know maybe a
darker one like this purple
and then you know it would just all be
one solid shape and then inside you
would have your euro symbol symbol or
whatever and I make that white space or
negative space it would be white
essentially also I'm not really sure
about using the Euro symbol because
that's not digital currency it's I it's
fiat government currency like the US
dollar but anyhow so let me write this
real quick sorry I have a sore throat
simplicity we'll leave it a five
relevancy
a little bit down because this is a just
a gyro symbol uniqueness mm we'll leave
it a five versatility probably work
pretty well in color and contrast kind
of contrast actually isn't too bad so
we'll put a six or a seven
alright I'm so looking at this further
all right Tyler
I really have just a few more let me get
a drink okay all right so the digital
currency wolf all right
the biggest problem with this there is
no hint at messaging at all so if we go
all the way back up to the requirements
see that it says right here and
messaging into a single simple symbol so
there's no hint at messaging down here
unfortunately
outside of that let me just go through
each of these so simplicity it's
actually kind of complex I mean you have
these tiny little stroke coming down
here you have a lot of different lines
and other such things taking place so
I'm gonna put this at for relevancy
that's gonna suffer a lot like it too
simply because it's not relevant in that
there's no messaging aspect which was
one of the core requirements uniqueness
and that's gonna have to suffer
versatility not very versatile because
guess what you know the difference
between this darker shade of yellow or
orange and this right here is very
minimal so there's no contrast at all
and so if this were scaled down a lot
you mean
be able to barely see even further I
can't go further than this scaling down
unfortunately but if it was scaled down
a lot more you may not even be able to
see what this symbol is in the middle so
it's not very versatile color and
contrast again the contrast issue were
created right here not very good so
that's going to suffer as well next here
this is actually not a too bad of a
entry although they did combine multiple
entries in the single upload which was
against my wishes but I just looking at
between these two if I had to pick I
would probably choose this one this one
over here I'm in fact if i zoom up just
a little bit I'm not a fan of the
gradients and the soft transitions
between two different colors it just
kind of complex makes things a little
bit more complex over here it's a little
bit more simplified we have height
simple highlights right here and shadows
right here this is all well and fine
however you've mixed styles by adding
gradients soft gradients that come down
from here like with this shadow area so
to make things consistent I would have
stuck with just you know this very flat
solid color approach which generally
always works better when it comes to
logo so you don't want to have a lot of
different varying colors and shades of
colors outside of that I would say it's
pretty unique as I in terms of a concept
you know you have a messenger as like a
pigeon of some sort combined with the
idea of currency so it's simplicity
again if we're just looking at this one
over here which is my more favorite one
I'm gonna leave it in the middle just
because these it gets pretty complex
right here relevancy you know we're
gonna try up to seven or eight
uniqueness will leave you know that's
pretty unique seven versatility six
color and contrast I will leave a five
so thanks for that and we only have two
more just about done one moment
okay so Sasuke and I think that's how
you pronounce your name I try to make a
coin in an envelope as a coin is usually
used as simple for cryptocurrencies just
reading this so um okay so the thing
that really sticks out as a negative my
opinion is how thin this stroke is on
everything also there's some other
issues like if I would get real close up
you know this is extending beyond that's
just kind of sloppy you want to make
sure that doesn't happen I don't like
how this intersects here you know this
the stroke that intersects right here
and just above beyond it creates for a
little bit of a clash and style what
would be better is if you took the
stroke and really thickened it up by
almost like a thousand percent almost
you know really thickened it up
especially when you're going to present
it as such a large size as you have here
because if you scale this down and if I
were to scale down a lot further like it
might be like an icon it's good it's not
going to be very solid shapes gonna be
just tiny little like one pixel shape
that deep that's defining this actual
icon so not ideal in that realm at least
sorry I'm trying to zoom in and out so
simplicity pretty simple I relevancy
pretty relevant uniqueness probably for
maybe a three because this is what
immediately maybe comes to mind
versatility again that's gonna suffer
quite a bit because I again if this is
real small size that's can it's not
going to present well color and contrast
will do five and then finally we have
our last entry I'm sorry
we have Mota's okay so I'm gonna start
with just simplicity because I think
that's the biggest issue here if we're
to look at this and this is actually not
very simple because we have all because
I understand what the idea was here like
behind maybe like
TV scanlines or just this idea of
digital Distortion
I understand that's a play on digital
currency but there's a lot happening in
certain areas like in this this this
little money symbol here you have your
literally tiny like offsets for that
distortion effect now if you scale this
down a lot you're gonna lose a lot of
that detail and it will simply become
blurry and you never want that you want
more simple solid identifiable shapes in
your logo all right so that's going to
be one issue we really push it down to
maybe like a three on our 3d 10 scale or
one to ten scale relevancy you know I
could see this messaging symbol right
here but it doesn't seem like it was it
just it seems a little bit squashed all
of a sudden it didn't seem like it
should it should just be another round
messaging blip with this coming down but
I I can kind of see what's happening
here I'm gonna leave it at five
uniqueness you know I do like the idea
of trying to do the distortion but I
just don't think it was pulled off very
well but looking at uniqueness alone I
will pull that up to like a six
versatility again it won't be too
versatile for the reasons that I
mentioned and then color in contrast you
know it's actually not that bad I'm
gonna leave that out of six or put it at
six and there we go so now if I simply
just refresh this page that's the end of
all of our results and I sort this by
highest rating will see that our highest
rating came out to Eric at 76% and then
from there and we're on we're at 56%
what the hell happened
looks like my rating did not hold for
this guy maybe I think I forgot to hit
put our judge rather so they go but
they're on if you're if you're watching
who this is phys graphics you probably
already saw what I was writing it anyway
so I'm not going to rate it in terms of
the winner not all not always is the
person
the highest rating going to win I
because somebody with a lower rating
percentage usually they won a couple
other times but looking between you know
the two top entries and I think this
party would have been the second place
entry actually for the reasons mentioned
right here with this the gradient right
here in the the mixing of styles making
it kind of inconsistent it would be
second place to this so that means Eric
is the winner so I liked it a lot
happening here that is correct in terms
of an effective logo logo symbolism or
icon I so just had a lot of factors
working for it as we can all see here
all right so I'll hit you up with your
free month or of course tetro pro
membership so again there wasn't very
many entries this time around so that's
kind of been a theme with these last two
I just started these back up and there's
only five entries last time and then
seven entries this time if you look at
the older ones from months back like
back in the end of 2016 we have 30
entries 41 entries 32 entries 73 entries
129 entries I don't know these just used
to be a little bit more popular back
then so I'm not sure if I'm going to do
another one maybe I'll just close this
all the way down either way we'll see
what happens here just looking at the
chat real quick before I head out
yeah I'm just not sure if I'm going to
do another challenge
I took the time to build this challenge
system in my on my site but I again it's
kind of not worth the time and effort
I'm just gonna get seven and five
entries here
oh well I'll fit I'll figure that out if
I if I do want to do that also just to
keep you up to date about what's
happening with the site just earlier
tonight I did release another tutorial
on just some I mean like my last
tutorial based around specific ionic
Cordova plugins and also the making of
an upcoming ever having the integer
Android app it's an upcoming course I
plan to do once I get back from this
little mini mini vacation you know this
is this app is just kind of like a
parity app and if you go to corsets or
commie check out this page you see this
ridiculous trailer that I put up it's
kind of just poking fun at a certain
demographic that tries to make
everything privilege based sighs I made
a privilege card app so to check out
this video though in its acting an
actual app that you can use if you go to
the App Store or the Google Play Store
and I'm thinking about doing a course
for it about how I build it it's a
really solid well designed app that'll
teach people a lot of stuff it's using
ionic 3 and angular 4 I go into just a
little bit of details about how it was
made but I'm thinking about doing the
next paid course for corset row being
based on this app but yeah that's
basically it
alright so I probably really chose a
poor time to do a live stream either way
here's the thing if I do stop doing the
design challenges I'm gonna replace it
with something else I really like the
idea of doing YouTube live but probably
not in the context of I well definitely
don't be doing YouTube live on a Friday
night
you know there's something like 17
people watching usually the last one
that did I did in a better time there's
like 75 people here so I definitely
wanted to think about how I can
integrate live for something that's
relevant based on a you know development
or coding of some sort design etc so
that is it yeah
so check out remember course cetera comm
for other stuff and just stay tuned I'm
definitely really focused on the site
the site just yesterday actually or the
day before hit 100,000 users in the last
30 days which is a milestone that I had
had so things looking well for this site
and I definitely wanted to start growing
expanding so yeah I'm going to sign off
now and I will talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
