Gary Simon of course cetera comm today
we're going to take a few popular
technologies such as material design
which is more of a concept and bootstrap
for which just finally released the 4.0
and angular and we're gonna like I said
combine all of those and get them all
working together so with the help of
something called MD bootstrap comm we're
going to integrate it into an angular
project for the front end aesthetics
essentially alright so right here if you
go to MD bootstrap comm you'll see that
we have a variety of ways to work with
this I guess you could say kind of like
a I wouldn't call it a framework but
does this package so we have jQuery we
have angular which we're going to use we
also have you know you can use it with
react view and brand flow alright so I
to get started you know if I click on
learn more on angular quickly this site
is that I found it kind of it loads a
little bit slow and I you could if we
click download you can see that
momentarily it's going to give us a
little pop-up and it's going to mention
not a pop up on a new page I we could do
a direct download which we're not going
to do or you could do github and NPM so
you could simply clone the github repo
if you click on just github link right
here or you could use NPM in this way
that's the way that we're going to do it
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're going to find a bunch
of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost of why me
like at 6
each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it so first before we
begin you want to make sure that we have
no js' installed so to do that you open
up your console your command line and
node V okay I have it you may not if you
don't just go to node J esta or go to
the download section download the
installer for your OS and then install
it with default options and then relay
your console or command line alright
very simple as you see alright so once
we have access to the node package
manager or NPM let's go ahead and oh
yeah first we're going to install a
brand new angular project angular 5 so
you're going to need the angular CLI or
the command-line interface to do that so
I'm just going to install NPM install -
g4 global at angular CLI alright so the
CLI of course will allow us to you know
get a brand-new fresh install of angular
going all right now once that is
complete we can then use it and you
access the CLI through ng so ng we're
going to issue the new command and then
we name it we'll call this MDBs
I already have that installed so I'm
just going to need mine too you don't
have to add that and then we're also
going to add the style flag to designate
and/or specify the fact that we want to
use sass pre compiling or pre processing
so it's going to be s CSS here alright
so we'll go ahead and hit enter and I'll
let that run through all right so it's
installed and ready to go for me so next
thing we're gonna hop into it's OCD MDBs
and next we have to install for
different packages with NPM so I'm going
to type them all out first and I'll
describe what this happening so NPM I
for install we're gonna save it as a
dependency and then we're going to say
angular bootstrap - MD also chart J s at
version 2.5 point 0 and then
font awesome and then finally hammer J s
all right so I'm gonna hit enter for
that to start to install those and
basically the angular bootstrap MD is
the package for MD bootstrap for an
angular chart Jas is a charting library
that bootstrap or the MD bootstrap
rather uses for charts
Fon awesome is for icons that the MD
bootstrap uses and then hammer J s
enables touch for certain elements on
mobile devices alright so now let's go
ahead and open up our code editor if you
use a Visual Studio code like most
people do these days I just hit code in
period and then it'll load it right up
as we need it to
so let's don't save that okay so in here
the very first step we're gonna go to
source app in our app module file and in
here we're going to paste oh by the way
real quickly when it comes to most of my
tutorials in terms of video there's a
written version and so sometimes I will
paste in coding and so just to make it
easier on yourself if you view the
description here below the video you'll
find the written version you could
scroll to the code section where that's
at alright so I that's what I'm gonna do
real quick here so the first thing I'm
going to copy and paste is just right
here and by the way I'm going to
increase with control and the plus sign
here just so you can see everything a
little bit better control B gets rid of
the sidebar so where I import in here
this no errors schema right here from
the angular core library and that just
tells the compiler not to error based on
unknown elements which are used by md
bootstrap and then finally also we're
importing md bootstrap module and this
here we installed through MPM alright so
the next step here is to add in
reference both of these here in the ng
model decorator so first we're going to
add an in the imports the MD be
bootstrap right there and we'll say for
root and then next we're gonna add a new
property called schemas and we put in
this right here I'll just copy and paste
that oops right there
and then period or a comma rather all
right so that's that either for that
file next we have to open up the angular
CLI adjacent file so that's right down
here in root and we need to add or edit
rather for this styles and the scripts
property and so again this is probably
worth I taking a look at the written
tutorial because there's three lines
that we're gonna paste above here so we
have real quickly our our font awesome
sass right here the bootstrap sass file
and then also our MDB and then also we
have just a to two lines to pace in for
scripts so let's open this up and inside
of here we have our chart j s and also
hammer j s as well and so if you know
you're not gonna need charts you don't
even need to include that so let's go
ahead and save that and let's also open
up our TS config dot JSON file which is
also in the root and just at the very
that's the wrong file I got the lint
file let's see there we go this file now
just at the very bottom here after this
closing bracket or curly brace rather
we're going to paste one line which is
right here so again this is all in the
written version of the tutorial so let's
go ahead and save that and that's all it
is for the setup so now we can go back
to our console let me clear this out and
let's we're on ng serve open which will
open up a browser window for us at
localhost 4200 so it's gonna take just a
tad at a time and momentarily alright
just load it up off screen here
in just a second it's gonna load up the
actual starter template that angular the
CLI provides us all right there we go so
if you control shift I
there should be no errors in your the
console here so right off the bat you
know that this is working when you see
this type of type here because usually I
think it's like a serif font of some
sort but now we know that bootstrap is
integrated just by looking at this alone
ok so now let's talk about integrating
let's say for example one of the first
elements of any website layout or app is
a navigation of some sort so because
we're dealing with three different
technologies like bootstrap for material
design and angular 5 I'm not going to be
covering each in much detail with this
tutorial instead I'm just gonna pick out
a few pieces from the MD bootstrap
angular document page to tation page to
help you get a quick feel for how you
can start using the documentation to
build a layout based on your needs so if
you want to know more about bootstrap 4
I already created a free crash course
just a couple weeks ago because it just
released right back then I'll try to
remember to link that here in the
description and also of course I have a
free angular 5 course as well so let's
say for instance I we want to add an add
a vacation so I'm gonna bring up this
real quick and this is the the angular
as you can see in the title here the
documentation specifically for angular
so what's really cool is I this is
pretty much how the documentation is
structure you have all your different
sections down here and on the right hand
side for instance for this specific
element like a navigation you have all
these options I so we click on one it
will scroll to show you you know all
these possible options without
navigations using bootstrap so let's go
ahead and just die I'm gonna copy this
top one right here and we'll say we want
to have a navigation like this so right
out-of-the-box we can have one so let's
go back to our
code editor and we're gonna open up
let's go ahead and close this stuff we
don't need it we'll open up our app
component HTML control a and delete all
that and then just paste all that in so
let's go ahead and save this so go back
tada
works perfectly and also notice it is
responsive works right out of the box
okay
so let's I makes an assumption obviously
you're probably gonna want to make
adjustments and custom adjustments to
this so let's say for instance I we want
to change the background color or like
we don't want that pink that was there
well I there's a color sections inside
of the documentation which are gonna let
load alright so this is based on
material design colors here and because
it as you can see the palette so let's
say we want to change it to blue right
here alright well let's go back and
notice right here we have at the very
very first line we have fixed top first
of all I don't want it to be fixed so
we're gonna get rid of that notice right
here says BG pink well change that to
blue very very very simple also
container inside is set to false let's
change that to true and save this and go
back real quickly and there we go the
container inside by the way makes it so
that there's a container where it's
centered for the navigation when it's
not it's completely fluid and this left
portion would be over here and this over
here will be to the right so obviously
very simple stuff and it helps to
understand bootstrap for for some of
this to make sense this is almost
straight out of the bootstrap for
documentation anyway for this type of
navigation so if you're interested in
making further adjustments and
refinements to this just check out the
bootstrap for documentation very very
very simple so let's also add a section
underneath this
so I material design or empty bootstrap
offers an area called features section
alright so basically this is an example
right here of a feature section which is
a really common element on landing pages
and they have a bunch of versions they
have four different versions so let's
use this one this one looks pretty nice
I say Version three so we'll just copy
this alright and we'll say go back here
real quick come back to the bottom and
we'll go ahead real quickly and just cut
this portion we want to leave main and
the div container and then paste all
that stuff in so if we save then we go
back there we go very simple so what if
you want to make some adjustments and
customizations to this section for
instance it looks like there's not a lot
of padding between the elements are here
well again this is where it's handy to
understand some bootstrap four basic
concepts so if we real quickly we just
add a few different classes so if we
come up here to our section features
portion right here right after feature
box I we could put in padding top
because we want to add padding to the
top and we'll say a size of five so if
you wanted to add margin which is you
know this is the spacing inside of the
element then you would add m/t and then
there's a numbers I believe it's one
through five or one through six in terms
of how much padding or sizing we can
also add this right or it says grid row
this has pb3 let's change that to five
so now if we save and go back we'll see
we just spaced out things a lot more and
actually I think I may have added that
in the wrong section
try that
I want to space things out before
beneath here so if this happens
control-shift i we use this little
selector right here and we find which
element or which section needs to have
padding to the top
alright so oh it this says right here is
rows features small p2 alright so let's
find that real quickly there's one that
says ah okay so I can go ahead and just
leave those both a3 and then p2 we
change to p5 so now we'll save go back
and now it's pushed it down adequately
alright awesome okay so after that let's
say for instance we want to add atom h
animation alright so again I'm just
going through a few sections of these so
you can understand the documentation so
I there's an animation section and let
me go ahead and bring that up separately
alright so in this animation section I
it's really cool we could take a look at
this logo I we have the all these
different types of animations like
flippers like we can flip it or sliding
entrances it's going to show you exactly
you know what each of these does alright
so basic usage it'll show you how to I
do this so step one is to add a class of
animated onto the element that you want
to animate and then you can add one of
the following classes which are all
demonstrated above for you so let's just
use this one right here by the way as
you can see you can also do animations
on scroll it really easy to understand
stuff so I'm gonna just take animated
and bounce we're gonna add it to the
image that we have so the image is right
here it already has a class so I'm just
gonna paste it right there animated and
bounce so now we go back real quick and
i refresh there we go
dead simple stuff so let's add one final
section here just for a little bit more
I muscle memory and so this we're gonna
add a team section so let's choose we'll
say the team version two right here
alright so by the way when I click copy
it was not working for me that's why I'm
sitting here copying this manually so
let's just copy that and again I get our
code editor here okay so just underneath
that closing section we're gonna paste
this one so we'll save it go back to a
browser and there we go
now notice I if we look at the team
section here and we we see this layout
compared to this layout our layout
doesn't look as good why is that well
that's because we can see this is called
an MDB Pro component so even though they
give you the HTML if you don't have
access to the pro component which is a
paid feature then you're not gonna get
this nice sort of styling so you can
either buy the pro this MTB Pro or you
could manually adjust the CSS yourself
and make it look however you want so in
our case that let's just go ahead and do
that so to do that what you would do is
first again use your inspector and I
would say for instance we want to change
the title which we could see as an h4
and so we know this is going to be an h4
and this is going to be h4 and also we
want to change these ugly-looking social
media icons are these buttons down here
so we can see they if you look in the
HTML enough they have they all share a
similar class and that is I I believe it
would be BTN floating
and so now what we can do is we can go
to our SAS real quickly control B so
let's go to our app component s CSS file
and now we'll just write a couple rule
sets for each one of those so first for
the h4 element I let's make it bold and
also margin top which we could added the
class of the MT but I'll just do it here
and then also BTN floating will say
padding five pixels 10 pixels background
will make white in margin will be 10
pixels and 3 pixels that's top bottom
right left so now we save it we'll go
back and let me find where the hell I
was alright so now it's it's it's spaced
out a little bit better and these are
definitely a big improvement from what
they were all right so that's the same
thing actually with here this was a pro
feature section but it honestly I think
it looks pretty good
in and of itself you could probably
stand to have these a little bit bigger
which you could easily you know figure
out what the the inspector then adjust
the CSS from there all right so I mean
once again if I show you this I we can
see it's fully responsive it will work
well on mobile you can also use
responsive CSS classes for adjusting the
margin that we added but I didn't add
that you could just check it take a look
at the the bootstrap documentation for
that and there we go so as you can see
dead simple to get started
I say yeah hopefully you know if you
have any questions be sure to comment
