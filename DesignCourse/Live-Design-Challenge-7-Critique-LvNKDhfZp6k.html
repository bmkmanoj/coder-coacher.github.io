testing audio I don't do this very much
so
test test test test it's real
professional stuff we got going here
cool I'm just gonna wait a little bit
for some people to join in and we will
start this by the way what does the
thumbnail show you guys does it say I
for me it's showing some old-ass
thumbnail that says logo designed for
flabby hopefully that's just on my end
it should say design challenge 7 live
critique and that the stream will begin
in a few minutes hopefully that's what
it says
what is it actually showing you guys
right now all right cool
yeah I'm gonna switch off to her it
shows my mug here in a second I'm just
gonna wait for a second for more people
to show up all right cool yeah the red
dot that's what you should see all right
screw it let's go ahead it's my first
time using the software so hopefully it
works well you should now see me and I
yeah the lives this live streams could
be for the design challenge that I had
two weeks ago in which people were
tasked with designing an app onboarding
screens so I have the submissions up
here I'm gonna switch to the desktop
momentarily and start that so yeah let
me go ahead and do that we're going to
cut here all right so now hopefully you
see my browser do you see it scrolling
just I'm just looking at the chat right
now make sure people can see this
there's a little thumbnail of my sorry
ass here all right well I'm just gonna
go ahead and get started
so just to recap real quickly the
challenge description was basically to
design an app onboarding screen that
would be based on an app that's for
rating alcoholic beverages because that
I I'm an alcoholic somewhat it used to
be pretty bad but I kind of limit to
just maybe once or twice a week now
actually if you look at old thumbnails
of my videos like a long time ago I'm
like all bloated and because that
was such a an alcoholic but anyhow let
me continue on with this I so yeah the
slide title you'll find the best alcohol
description users like you rate the
alcohol that they're drinking this makes
it easy to find the good stuff and so
yeah it was really simple just one slide
screen of an app of an app onboarding
process and so of course
with good design purple principles in
mind you know good white space good
color good contrast good visual
hierarchy now
this submission here this this design
challenge only had five entries in two
weeks now just to show you how you know
I guess to say unpopular that was back
in the past when I did this maybe like
half a year ago and even further beyond
and I was getting like 30 entries and 41
entries I think that's because it's just
been so long so hopefully that will
increase for the next challenge and the
fact that you know we'll see if this
becomes a success you know me doing this
live design challenge or whatever
alright so here are the entries down
here and this is just showing by you
know the very first or way is it the
latest yeah the newest century so I'm
just gonna go in that order
I already did rate them but just ignore
the rating for now
and then we'll get to choosing a and
picking a winner so basically I looking
up here I'm not going to try to
pronounce your name I'm just gonna call
you pal alright I looking at this one
this is actually a really solid entry
and make sure you guys see this large
enough it looks like you can um so this
is like almost one of the only entries
that stuck to the actual rules like you
we only want one actual app on board a
screen a couple people did several and
that's fine that's no big deal
but in terms of you know going over
simplicity relevancy uniqueness
well simplicity does this particular
entry have simplicity go for it well I
would argue yes there's not a lot of
crazy clutter and all these graphical
effects that are unnecessary like drop
shadows blurs and lens flares or
anything so it gets simplicity really
well in all manners not just I looking
at it from you know a far-off
perspective but you know looking at the
type very simple types and serif works
well as well as the description down
here he also creates separation by using
not just completely 100% white
description text down here i but you can
still see it so the contrast is good the
color is good they complement each other
well this little icon here hopefully it
was custom designed that works as well
it has style
with a little snot smiley face and then
finally down here we have the get
started button it gets a little bit
hidden but that's only because the
background as well is this yellow color
which obviously you're holding a phone
that's not an issue so a very good entry
here so go on to the next one
this one's from David and this one as
well let me get scaled down the browser
a bit yeah this one as well as I I
really like the layout of it in the fact
they did something really interesting
and that was very relevant and that is
having like the beer suds or suds or
whatever you call them down here at the
bottom also the little Suttles coming up
here I'm not sure if you could see it
but they're just there and they're faint
enough to where it doesn't contrast a
lot with what's happening in the
foreground in the content the icon very
good very simple the star means it's
important something that you like and
then a very simple but effective
representation of the actual alcohol or
wine glass right here I they're only
just one like two tiny little things
that I thought were just a tad bit off
and that is if we take a look at find
the best alcohol here that's that's
perfect I but in relation to the
description they seem like they're
they're the same exact size almost the
fact that he's mixing serif with
sans-serif that's not that big of a deal
but I just think it would be a little
bit more effective if the description
was slightly smaller or this was
slightly bigger for the heading the
second thing is this get started kind of
gets lost its call to action button
being that it's the same color as this I
you know the beer color here really
though that's small details I it's
really effective I like it a lot looking
down here Antonio so this is one where
the individual I they submitted three
different app on board screens and kind
of got confused that could have been my
fault with the description up there
because a couple other people did the
same thing not a big deal unfortunately
what I did want was a title and a
description and unfortunately I put them
on two different slides and so but I'm
just going to ignore that just focus on
this one
here on soup at the same time I don't
wanna ignore it because I kind of do
want to compare them just to illustrate
a few different points about consistency
so focusing on just like the the
symbolism the icon right here if we
compare them to the other two for
instance we'll see that there it kind of
does lack consistency in terms of first
color we can see this icon in middle is
just completely outlined in a thick
stroke of black yeah we don't see that
here at all in these other two so that
creates an issue issue of visual
inconsistencies and you don't want that
also we can see that we have this the
circular area and right here these two
are just plain circles that's perfectly
fine but they also opted to add some
other icons right here on the side so if
you were to swipe between these apple
onboarding screens again it's just kind
of inconsistent in terms of application
I saw outside of that they are simple
they work well again another issue of
inconsistency is we have you know a
certain stroke weight right here but
then this these thumbs up and thumbs
down there you could considerably less
in terms of stroke width again it a
seems like small minor details but you
know even these small details have only
just a few pixels can throw off the
consistency of a design outside of that
I the only other thing or critique that
I would have about this is that this
skip button the skip text is just up a
little bit it's not centered vertically
in that button again small critique
otherwise good stuff I and if you were
confused about that and my apologies
we're not making it more clear all right
next one we have Tim all right so now
this is probably the most unique
approach to this this project here I we
can see that we have a real unique type
of font I it's it's I wouldn't say it's
a bad choice of a type of font it's just
unique you could still read it and it
does give it a certain sense of style so
you know you don't always have to use
you know sans-serif Arial railway or
whatever or Helvetica so
the one issue that really stuck with me
and point put I saw right off the bat
was this icon where you have the
magnifying glass kind of zooming up on
this pitcher of beer but there's just so
much detail in here that I kind of get
lost about you know what am I looking at
we have these real big thick strokes
right here then we have this tiny little
bit of white that's showing in I it's
like a little slither so that adds into
issues of versatility so if you see it's
smaller it's just gonna look like this
weird you know I guess there's a few
pixels of white so my suggestion would
be to really I take it down a notch in
terms of complexity only so just a tiny
portion of it you don't have to add in
all these details it kind of gets mixed
up outside of that again search for the
alcohol that you like it would've been
nice to have that description down here
again not that big of a deal I one issue
though I will say about the next and
skip down here is that the very last
slide in this section where it says
finish there's really not there's an
issue of what's called visual hierarchy
here there's really not a separation
between Saver instance this text right
here this description text and this
finish button they kind of just look the
same there's no priority place that on
this so you would really want to make
sure that that finish button is sticking
out and is emphasized all right but
other than that good job and I do really
I do like the approach to it just a
small couple things and maybe you guys
were those two individuals were confused
or three here's the third one who did
multiple screens no big deal though um
so down here this is Roberto alright so
looking at this side they opted going
for a black or a near black background
which is fine um yeah again it would
have been nice to have the description
over here no big deal but in terms of
looking at this icon right here this
beer icon we could let me see if I can
like really zoom up like crazy
once that can I lose my place here yeah
I you can see that the the stroke on the
actual
your icon by the way is it's black I
think but you can barely see it and so
that becomes an issue when we look over
at this handle where you can really
can't really see the handle too well at
least on my particular monitor in terms
of simplicity definitely works well it
is simple terms a relevancy yeah its
beer not necessarily anything there
though that hints at finding beer and so
that's one you know just minor critique
and so yeah of course that
call-to-action button down here that
sticks out pretty well I and if I were
to look at any of the other slides like
four screens like this one over here
where it has the stars that's an example
of bad contrast because you have the
stars which are really light and then
you have this medium gray or light gray
background you you can't even see the
stars really so you want contrast so if
you have a dark background you want to
use really light values on anything
that's on top of it that needs to be
seen or vice versus vice-versa for that
alright so I that was it that was my
whole five submissions that we received
so you know looking at this if I had to
narrow it down between say two like the
top two out of the five it would
definitely be let me sort by highest
rating come back down it would
definitely be between this entry here
from David and then also my pal buddy
right here in this one so as you can see
the ratings there at both that an 82%
and that really doesn't mean anything
yeah they're both rated high but in
terms of who ultimately wins as I ignore
that I just try to really look at you
know the fact that they were 82% there's
very little in my mind in terms of
effective design that separates them
alright so having said that looking at
this between these two entries I'm going
with I wish I had like a drumroll a
little key that I could press but I'm
not that advanced yet hi I'm gonna go
with Powell right here and the reason is
is because the two issues that I
mentioned here the main issue I would
say would be just a call to action get
started button where it doesn't stick
out enough because of the the color I
think if the color was of this actual
button background was something that
really contrasted well and stuck out a
lot more I probably would have chosen it
so I'm sorry but either way pal I will
hit you up with your free one month of
course set you're a pro you get access
to all of my stuff let me cut to my main
mug over here and yeah that is it so I
hopefully I see there's like 72 people
watching hopefully you guys I I know
probably all of you watching this
probably you didn't partake in the
actual design challenge but maybe once I
release the next one in a day or two or
three you guys will be more interested
in joining so obviously there is a
winner for each one but I think the real
value even if you don't win is you know
you're getting my opinion whatever that
means I'm you know how you can improve
your designs going forward alright so
I'm just gonna check out the chat
because I wasn't really wasn't looking
at anything you guys said see if there's
any questions that you guys have no I'm
just not that popular I guess well
there's a dude on slack he is I'm okay
yeah in terms of ID tutorials and
courses going forward right now man I'm
so busy I'm working I'm working with
LinkedIn learning which bought lynda.com
and I do courses for I'm doing a course
for them and I also do courses I've done
courses for the past two years for a
plural site and there's like two
deadlines within the next week that I
have to get done so there's not gonna be
much coming up within the next week but
after that I yeah I'm gonna be going
full-on again my site corsetry by the
way has been kicking ass yesterday was a
big milestone I got five
thousand visitors in one day from Google
so that's kind of exciting which
accounts for like 98% of my traffic as
it is so yeah there'll be another design
challenge if you guys want to you know
make a suggestion in terms of what you
would like to see I you know just check
out the challenges pages see what we've
had in the past if I switch back over
here
so like logo design related challenges
I've done that that's a pretty popular
print design like business cards like I
don't want to do anything very
time-consuming like a full web design or
something that would just be too much
people mark and I want to really try to
work too much in terms of dedicating
time to submissions for this so app
login screen trying to look at this or
there was a hundred twenty nine inches
in this one so yeah the logos ones are
pretty popular so yeah like I said next
three days or so I will go ahead and do
another one and you'll receive a
notification you just make sure you
subscribe to the YouTube channel what
happened to Viv's well Viv's i we
decided to part ways from the
partnership he got real into other stuff
when we originally went into our
partnership he by the way visits slide
nerd that was my original partner at
corsetry comm he was you when we
originally started the partnership he
was really into android development and
his youtube channel he kind of lost
focus of that and just didn't want to
mess with it anymore and i he started
focusing on other stuff like chatbots
and all this stuff and this partnership
just didn't make sense at that point so
yeah we just kind of ended that
partnership
oh yeah um if pal is here the winner
make sure you remind me I'm not the
greatest at issuing I I'm actually just
to make sure I will do it I will give
him the free access once I end this
stream so yeah because sometimes people
have wanting to pass and I just closed
it and forget about it and they're like
dude where the hell is my prize isn't
like alright alright guys I think
I'm gonna go ahead and end it yeah look
out for the next one hopefully
participation increases the next time
and I will see you later now how do I
stop this damn thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
