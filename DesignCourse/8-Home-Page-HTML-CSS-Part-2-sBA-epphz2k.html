course calm and in this video we're
going to tackle this portion right here
the heading the subheading the right and
left arrow along with this white
container here and these four images and
then the video after we'll go ahead and
tackle this section down here along with
possibly this area too alright so I
basically the first thing I want to do
before we get into HTML and CSS is go
ahead and save the images that we need
so I this of course is HTML and CSS and
then over here we have these arrows
which we want to create a sprite so will
I take both of these and let's get them
ready to save so I'm just going to real
quickly just duplicate these and then
hit ctrl e actually I'll undo that and
just hit rasterize layers that way
they're flattened I and I'm just going
to take one of these here we'll take the
left one right here and hit ctrl a and
then ctrl C we'll go to file new and
then here I what we want to do is
basically duplicate this width here so
that would be 74 and the height will
leave the same and we'll just paste that
right in there control V and then we
will duplicate that layer and go to edit
transform flip horizontal and that is
fit correctly so now what we want to do
is save this for web save it as a PNG 24
transparency selected and we will call
this left right arrow all right so that
takes care of that and
let's go ahead and delete those two
layers real quick and show these and now
I want to save this these four logos on
I'm just going to include them all on
the same area so on the same image
rather like a copy merged ctrl n ok and
then paste this in and then save it and
we'll save this one as a PNG 8 and then
just go ahead and we'll call this logos
- 1 and that will be it for now I
although at the end we're going to take
this and stack these on a row of 2 so
we'll have this right here and then
we'll take these two and put these
beneath and that will be suitable for
the cellphone versions and you'll see
why so let's go ahead here to our editor
and this is where we left off basically
so if we go over here to the browser
real quick we'll see this is where we
left off I see if we extend this in it's
responsive and by the way bootstrap 3
they release their their customizer so
you don't have to deal with some of
these steps that we had to take in the
previous lessons anymore I'm but anyhow
I so let's go ahead and go back here to
our editor and get started with some of
our HTML so I'm gonna go right here just
after the row div class row up there and
I'm going to create a new row close it
up and then I'm going to do a div class
equals call - 12 and call short for
column and the way the bootstrap grid
system works I is it's based on a 12
grid column system and so what that
basically means is if we go over here
real quick to our Photoshop template and
we show the columns we'll see we have
twelve columns here so the initial HTML
we're tackling is just part right here
at these two items and these are
basically twelve columns wide and
they're going to be even though it's
only right here in these two I we're
going to make it 12 and then we're just
going to Center the text and you'll see
more specifically how these these this
grid system works when we get to this
section down here but for now we're just
going to set twelve columns and so let's
go back here and then inside of that
we're going to have an h1 tag class
equals text - Center which is a
predefined bootstrap which just makes
the text center ID equals we're just
going to call this blue - title and we
design superior logos and close it and
then underneath we have the subheading B
class equals text - Center I'm going to
call this lead to and then ID equals
subheading and stand above your
competition your business is worth it
and then close it up all right so let's
go ahead and save that and let's go
ahead and check this out just to see
what this looks like initially and we
see it is centered now but we needed to
be white and we need it to be with our
font and we need the correct size so we
need to address those things in CSS now
all right so let's go over here
open up our custom CSS file and
we'll do h1 blue - title and we want
color font weight font size
we'll try 6:00 p.m. and then subheading
color is white font size we'll try a 2.5
p.m. now let's just go check and see
what that looks like
alright that's much better alright now
let's go ahead and take the we design
superior logos and make sure that's
using our font so let me go here to our
editor and select the bootstrap the CSS
file do a search for h1 and you'll find
a choice here down here on line 421 and
this we want to change to source sans
Pro hit save and then we'll see that it
updates here now here's one issue so
when we scale this in we'll see four
tablets here it's a little bit too big
and then same thing with this and then
for cell phones we'll see it's like way
huge so if we loaded this up on a cell
phone we would see this covering our
entire screen so we need to adjust that
some CSS so let's go ahead here to our
editor take our custom and for our
tablets here what we want to do is
specify one for blue title heading and
we'll put in font size YUM actually I'm
going to adjust that into three and I'm
going to copy that and make this one
five and then also our subheading font
size one point ATM to refresh alright so
that's a lot better for actual tablets
and this we may adjust a little bit
further in the future once we can more
specifically see it I'm going to do a
video where we actually show it on a
cell phone but for now that it is good
okay so let's go ahead and continue on
and we'll do the arrows here and do the
HTML for this section alright so now
what we want to do is in our editor
we'll go back to index dot HTML and
under here is where we're going to
create a new div class equals row oops
alright and so let's revert real quick
to Photoshop and look at our grid system
so we can see that in the center of the
first column we have this arrow and then
also this container spans basically ten
columns and then this one here is
another column and it adds up
obviously to twelve so now we have to
reflect that in our HTML so let's go
ahead and continue div class it goes
called dash 1 and this is all obviously
predefined in bootstrap they have call 1
all the way to 12 and inside here we're
going to put P class equals left - right
hidden - SM and the hidden - SM CSS tag
is basically makes it so that these
arrows will be hidden when we're on the
small devices like cell phones and
basically if we look at our design or
rather if we come over here and we scale
this into the size of a cell phone I
there's not going to be enough room to
show the logos and both of the arrows so
that's what that tag does and you'll see
how this works - so let's go back here
and continue on and ID equals left -
arrow and we'll just call this previous
gallery all right and then under here
we'll have dip class equals call - 10 ID
equals logo - gallery and inside of that
we will have two image tags image source
equals images - let's see what we have
the names here logos - one dot PNG class
equals image - responsive and ID equals
gallery - image alright so the class of
image responsive when added to the image
tag it basically makes the image
responsive obviously but in what that
means is it was scale to the width of
whatever the browser is and we'll see
this in real time so one second no what
I want to do though is add another one
we're going to call this images / small
- logos - one and
we're gonna give this the ID of gallery
- image - small and we're going to hide
this by default initially and you'll see
how this works once we get to the CSS
and so now I'm just going to copy this
up here and then paste it right there
and this is all going to be the same
except the ID is going to be right arrow
and we'll change this to next gallery
all right so if we were to view this
let's see what this looks like
alright so things are kind of working
kind of not so now what we have to do is
use CSS to get this working so let's go
to the editor here one thing I want to
do first is add one more class that I
forgot text - hide right - both of these
and that will hide the tech as we can
see here the text no longer shows up so
now let's do the CSS and so the first
one will be P - left that's right and
we'll do display block width is 36
pixels which is the width of one of
those arrows the height is 72 and then
we're going to have text-align:center
cursor:pointer which is the cursor that
makes it look like you're hovering over
a link and then margin we're gonna try
78 from the top auto and then down here
we have the actual IDs so P left - arrow
background:url images left - right -
arrow PNG 0-0 and I will copy this right
- arrow and this one will be the same
except we're just going to move it over
36 pixels so that it only shows each one
so that's that's basically how sprites
work if you're unfamiliar so we go over
here we can now see they both show up
even though they're on they're actually
the same image all right so now what we
want to do is handle this middle
container here which will hold this
image so what I want to do is we'll go
over here and in our CSS first we
reference this as gallery - image or
rather first this one right here is logo
- gallery so real quick let's go ahead
and add logo - gallery and we want to
make the background white and we want to
give it a minimum height so let's choose
300 pixels so if we view this this
section now becomes actually we're in
extend that just a little bit more 300
wasn't quite enough so try 50 okay
and now we want to Center this up and
get rid of this broken image here so
let's go ahead and it was we have
gallery - IMG so let's add that and that
is give us some margin here from the top
portant and display:block and the second
one is gallery - OMG - small and this is
going to be 30 pixels from the top and
display:none alright so now we have this
pretty much centered here now we have to
add some CSS for the area where this
gets smaller so that we can show the
secondary image so let's go ahead and
back into Photoshop and create that real
quick so let's see here now I want to
make the dimensions here we're going to
adjust those but first I'm going to hit
ctrl + ctrl C to copy this go to canvas
size adjust this to pixels and we're
gonna make the width 468 which is
basically half the size almost and the
height 324 and then just hit proceed
well move this one here to the top and
let's go ahead and fill this in with a
background color white create a new
layer real quick and I'm gonna move this
here get rid of that edge right there
and then paste this one down here oops
there we go
and I don't want like to emblem logos
right here next to each other I want to
kind of spread it out so I'm going to
delete coffee that first and then delete
it move this over here and then paste
this one right here and that looks
pretty good so I'm going to save for web
and I'm just going to call this logos -
one - small all right so now again our
CSS what we want to do is when we have
the max width here at 767 we want to
hide now that this is basically all the
CSS remembers for basically cell phones
or small devices so we want to hide
gallery - IMG so display:none so that's
what's gonna do is going to take this ID
right here and then hide it and this
idea of course is for this image right
here so if we were to view this refresh
it and then just drag it in all of a
sudden it hides once we get to the
tablet versions all right so now what we
want to do is show the other one so
let's go ahead back to our CSS now let's
make sure we have the right image here
yeah I had that backwards so logos - one
- small that's the new image we created
I and so this was called gallery - IMG -
small so we'll go ahead and copy this
and then display:block and hopefully
that will work so it's refresh and now
we see that it doesn't get scaled down
so terribly having them all on the same
horizontal path alright I that works
pretty good so in the next video we are
going to tackle this section up here
along with this section right here and
then after that we'll do another video
where we tackle these and perhaps also
this as well and hopefully we will be
able to finish this up here pretty soon
all right I'm Gary Simon and thanks for
