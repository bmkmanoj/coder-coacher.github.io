announce a new series that I'm going to
be focusing on called the digital asset
designer so what does it mean to be a
digital asset designer well just
speaking for personal experience a few
years ago I created a product called
wise banner now a wise banner is just a
collection of Photoshop actions and
templates that allow designers in
marketers alike to rapidly produce
banners for the purpose of advertising
and marketing now doesn't sound very
exciting but fast forward a few years
later if made of around $30,000 just
selling that one product and it's all
mainly been passive income I spent a
couple months creating it and I
advertised it on a few different message
boards and then that was it I haven't
really touched it since I so that's what
it means to be a digital asset designer
so a digital asset who could be
considered any number of things it could
be a Photoshop mock-up template it could
be themes for content management systems
like WordPress or Joomla etc it could be
icons it could be Photoshop actions it
could be a lot of different things so
that's what this series is about I'm
gonna show you how to create these
different types of assets and also how
to go about selling them so you can
start boosting your income so with that
said the very first course that's a part
of this series I'm going to be releasing
tomorrow and it's a three hour course on
creating Photoshop mock-up templates and
throughout this course going to showing
you a bunch of different projects and
different types of mock-up templates
such as a t-shirt mock-up a corporate
identity mock-up template a tattoo
mock-up a mogul mobile mock-up where
people can present their mock-up app
designs and more and aside from that I'm
also gonna show you again how to sell
them alright so make sure you look out
for that tomorrow of course it's going
to be dirt cheap and there's going to be
a sell that accompany is it so I really
hope you know a lot of you who are
designers or maybe not even designers
you're aspiring designers check it out
because it's one thing to be a designer
and you're working
with clients which is a great way to
earn a living but it's always a great
idea to not place all of your eggs in
one basket it's great to be able to make
money on the side somehow and if you're
really good at it like some people it
can become your primary source of income
all right so look out for the
announcement video and the launch of
that new course tomorrow alright see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
