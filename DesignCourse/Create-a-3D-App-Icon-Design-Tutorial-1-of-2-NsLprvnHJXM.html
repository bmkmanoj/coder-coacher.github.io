today I'm going to show you how to
design a 3d iOS or even Android app icon
alright so to make it truly 3d we're
going to use a 100% free 3d application
it's open source called blender alright
so you can download blender at
blender.org it's a very small download
it's only like 50 or 60 Meg's download
it installs very quick and you can
launch it within the next couple minutes
if you download it now so I will walk
you through as a beginner just how to do
this real quickly and so the process
we're going to use is going to involve
using a vector graphic importing it into
blender and then making some adjustments
making it 3d very quickly extruding it
and applying cool sort of material and
getting a lighting setup and then
rendering it and then tomorrow we'll
step into Adobe Photoshop in order to
complete it and make some adjustments
and get it into an actual icon shape
alright so if you haven't yet check out
these on course comm and subscribe here
on YouTube alright let's get started
alright so the very first step that you
need to consider is depending on
whatever type of object that you want to
show in your or use for your icon it it
needs to be vector so what is vector so
basically Adobe Illustrator here is
probably the most of popular vector
application then you have other
alternatives like Inkscape and a few
others and basically what makes us
different compared to say Photoshop is
this is true vector and these are paths
and vector basically means these paths
it's like it's like a mathematical
equation so you can scale these things
up to any size imaginable without loss
of quality and so your object needs to
be vector so that's the very first
requirement for this process so I'm
gonna be using the design course DC a
letter mark and I've provided that I for
free in the project file so you can go
ahead and download that at design course
comm for this video and once you have it
open here in Adobe Illustrator I you can
also skip this
because I'm also providing the SVG
because it'd be in order to import it
into blender and needs to be not an AI
file it needs to be a SVG file scalable
vector graphics so basically if you go
to file and save as and you change the
save as type to SVG not compressed and
then hit save I've already saved mine
but you'll see a let me just hit to here
just so I I'll screw anything up so if
we hit save this options window comes up
SVG 1.1 and everything else can pretty
much remain the same here and then just
hit OK so you know your object that
doesn't have to be a logo it can be
anything any type of design so once you
have that saved as an SVG that's when we
step into blender now if you've never
used blender before I real quickly as I
do with every blender tutorial I'll do a
quick very quick introduction about how
to use or get around in in the interface
so basically I to select objects you
right-click them not left so so right
click to select multiple objects which
we're not going to have to hold shift
and right click to move around to
viewport you hold your middle or third
mouse button to zoom up you use your
scroll wheel and to pan you hold shift
and middle or the third mouse button
very simple all right so I'm gonna go
file new just to reload it so we're
looking at the same exact scene I'm
going to hit delete on the keyboard and
hit enter alright so now what we want to
do is import that DC I or whatever it's
whatever you named your is your SVG so
you go to file and you go to import and
then you specify SVG right here alright
so I'm gonna select DC logo and once you
import it's like well where the hell the
damn thing go well it's actually really
small and it's right there so you have
to use your mouse scroll wheel to zoom
up and depending on you know whatever
object you used I do this is
basically where you can manipulate it so
if you move this up and down or on these
different various accesses or you hit
scale or you hit rotate are you'll see
it rotates around this central area
right there so to fix it and make sure
it's in the center of the object all you
have to do is come over here to set
origin origin to geometry all right all
right so I'm gonna scale this up by
holding hitting s not holding just
hitting ass on the keyboard and then
just dragging my mouse and then left
clicking right around there and I'm
gonna left click and drag this panel out
so we can see more of these options and
I'm gonna come over here to this tab
right here the curve in right now this
is considered a curve because it's still
from SVG and it's not an actual 3d
object yet I so what we want to do is
come down here to the modification area
and for extrude we want to you can
left-click and drag this or you can just
left click it and put in a value so I'm
just gonna left click and drag it a
little bit I think it around point zero
zero four will work pretty well all
right and that's all I'm going to change
you can add you can do different things
you can offset it which makes it thicker
you can give it depth which will kind of
turn a little like round out all these
edges or inset it I this is good for now
even though it's kind of hard to see
currently alright so now what we want to
do is we want to take this and make it
an actual 3d object so when we do that
we won't be able to modify this stuff
anymore though so make sure you have it
all your settings correct hit alt and C
on your keyboard and then select mesh
from curve and men at level block so
right there so now what we can do is if
you wanted to make a change for some
reason to this you hit tab to go into
edit mode and if I hit a you'll see all
these crazy vs. but I just want to
maintain it keep everything simple and
so we're not going to have to go into
edit mode and edit anything all right so
now what I want to do is add a plane or
basically a full or for it to sit on so
it can cast shadows so shift a on your
keyboard
we're just gonna add so I'm gonna use
the keyboard shortcut much faster and
select plane right here and then hit s
for scale and you could scale it up
manually like this or you can enter a
number value to multiply based on the
original size and it's gonna hit like 50
and then enter all right so I right now
we can get a look at what this looks
like I by just changing this area right
here so the viewport right now is set to
solid okay if you go to rendered it's
gonna show you what this thing looks
like when it actually goes to render and
it's not pretty so what we need to do is
first I'm going to adjust some settings
here so what I want to do is go over
here to this render tab and I want to
change blender render to cycles render
alright it looks a little bit better and
so I always use cycles and never use a
blender render it's one that's default
li.selected I but I always just switched
to cycles and I also always switch from
device from CPU to GPU compute it makes
it render like a thousand percent faster
and basically a CPU muses your CPU a GPU
uses your graphics card if you have one
if you don't see this option just go to
file user preferences and system tab
come down here and select CUDA and
you'll see your graphics cards I have
two of them right here alright and then
you'll see this option just like that
alright and then down here for sampling
it looks grainy because there's only ten
samples on our previews tab so right now
we haven't rendered it we're just
previewing it by going to render tab so
if you want to turn that up to from ten
to a 200 you'll get a better result I
when you go to finally render at trial
one I'm gonna try 1000 near the end when
we're ready to do that and I'm also
gonna come down here real quick and by
the way everything that I'm doing I
pretty much do for every every project I
do in blender so it's something that you
can basically repeat I also if you do
have that graphics card option up there
and you're using it you can come down
here to performance and change the tiles
and this is only applicable to when you
actually go to render it so you may be
confused if you never use this before
but if you're using a GPU you just best
set the tiles at 256 by 256 yeah all
right so everything's good to go right
here and now what we want to do is apply
a material to our area right here our
object a 3d object so I switch back to
solid make sure you have this selected
and not the background or the floor
rather and what we want to do is come
over here to the material section and we
want to click on use nodes and again you
have to make sure you're on cycles
render for this stuff to show up and
what I want to do is make this kind of
like a chrome material so you can change
that by changing the surface by default
it's at diffuse and if we come up here
to the top we see this option right here
which is basically Chrome and when we're
messing around with these settings we
can preview it by going to rendered
right here all right so it still looks
the same as it did before that's because
it's completely black so what I want to
do I'm gonna change the color here to
white all right now it doesn't look
white that's because we have to make
some adjustments over here I but I also
want to change a couple set this one
setting right here for the roughness and
I think I'll do that afterwards just to
illustrate why I'm changing it so what
we want to do now is come to the world
tab and we want to change what we're
actually if you just change the color
from this gray as you can see
everything's gray I up to something
lighter you can see it drastically
changes the appearance of everything all
right so I'm going to use I experimented
a little bit with this so I'm gonna
click on use nodes and you can see we
have surface and we have a background by
default selected I we can change this an
experiment by changing this section
right over here sorry this right here if
you click on the right side of the color
we want to change this
to a sky texture alright so right there
and I'm gonna change the turbidity what
the hell is that - five alright and I
want to change this right here to freak
them or whatever and what it did
basically I experimented with this to
come up with something as kind of
vibrant and these options right here
worked out well so in the end experiment
with all these see how it affects your
your render here so this is really cool
I like how it kind of just sticks out I
so now what I want to do is I know you
can still just by the way when you're in
rendered mode you can select objects but
it just doesn't show you when you're
selecting them or how we're it selected
so right now I know I'm selected on this
right here we can also drag this down
this is kind of like the Photoshop
layers area alright cuz it select it on
curve if we break click over here we'll
see that we have the plane selected so
it's good to materials and click on new
and by default again it's on that
diffuse and so we want to change this
here we want to make this like a dark
blue color alright so first drag us over
here and then drag this the brightness
down quite a bit
I'd say roughly right around there
alright so we lost some of the
reflections because the floor is pretty
dark and it's kind of reflecting a sky
up on top of it so what I want to do now
is add a an emission plane so it's just
a plane like this except the material
we're going to give is called emission
so let's go over here and look let's
first set up our camera so if we hit 0
on the keyboard from the number pad
we'll see it changes us to this area
this is the camera now the camera is
wherever is going to be rendered so when
we come over here to the render time
we're ready to run into this and hit
render it's going to render exactly what
we see here so if we hit n as a nose and
we see right here locked camera to view
we want to select that and then
and again to hide that and now let's go
ahead and set up how we want to position
this or what we want it to look like
basically alright so I'm going to come
over here I'm going to right-click on
the curve object right here and we can
rotate this a little bit just to make it
more interesting so if I hit R on the
keyboard we can now rotate it in
different ways I you can also rotate it
only on a specific axis I could see it
down here says Zed Y and X if we hit I Y
for instance now it will only rotate on
that axis if we hit R or if I left click
to set it and then if we are again we
hit X we can rotate it that way and I'm
going to zoom out one time on this and I
think right around there is good and now
what I want to do is add that emission
plane so I'm going to go switch from
render to solid view I'm going to hit
zero to get out of the camera view and
we see what the camera is and in
relation to this object I'm going to
come out over here maybe right around
here and I'm left clicking to set this
origin point basically it doesn't really
matter too much you know about where
it's at well we can always adjust this
origin point and what the origin point
is is wherever the app the object here
you're about to add is going to get
added so shift a plane then hit our X
and then 45 for 45 degrees and then it's
obviously not facing our object so we
want it to face it so we can move it
around here hit R and then Z Z and then
just move it to face our object we can
move it up and we can move it closer in
right around there maybe move it up
higher and then come over here to the
material section hit new
then change diffuse to emission and we
want this to this emission to be pretty
strong so I'm going to hit zero real
quick we're gonna keep this object
selected over here so hit zero on the
number pad and let's change this to the
rendered we can see nothing has really
changed too much that's because the
strength is only set at one so if we
change this say for example 250 all
right now it got a little bit brighter
let's try 300 and now we could see it
got even more bright alright so I like
the look of this you can always you know
try to get a different angle if you wish
I'm gonna keep mine right around there I
think that will work well alright so now
we're ready to go ahead and guy go ahead
and render this so if we come back here
to the render tab we have some things to
worry about over here like the
resolution so 1920 by 1080 is default
resolution and this right here that's
this percentage value if you have it on
50% it's only going to do 50% of x and y
so it's act that's not actually gonna be
1920 by 1080 it's gonna be half of that
if you take it up to a hundred now it's
going to render a 1920 by 1080 image so
one consideration that's real important
at this point is if you want to have an
app icon that is a high resolution you
want to probably make this even even
higher version basically resolution
rather so because the reason it is say
for example if you want to upload a 1024
by 1024 app icon you want to make sure
that this image is real big and in that
you can place it so that you can place
it into the app layer that we're going
to create in the next video so I I'm
going to assume that we only want a 512
by 512 icon and that way we can keep
this resolution and it will speed up
rendering times a little bit so I rent
remember down here for samples try a
thousand and also it depends if your is
in CPU that may take
a while so just experiment the lower the
value for render is the faster it would
be but the knot is nice quality that it
will be so just something to remember I
once you're ready to do that just go
ahead and hit render alright so what
it's going to do is get it's gonna go
through here quite a bit and it's also
should note real quickly you can see
these little pixels they're light little
pixels that are rendering and that can
happen when we're dealing with emission
planes and like chrome type materials if
you don't want to have to deal with that
you can come over I'm just gonna hit
escape real quick that's how you stop
the render you can come down here to the
samples down here and you can change
this clamp direction and in direction
right here I to something like point
nine eight so if you do that for both of
them we'll see that we if we come back
up to render they're no longer there I
now the downside to this is you don't
get all of the crazy reflections in the
detail but I it still looks pretty good
so what I'm gonna do is let this render
out here and actually know what I am
gonna go back I'm sorry I'm gonna go
back here and I'm just gonna hit zero
I'm gonna go back to the default
just because I'm gonna be scaling this
down a little bit so I think those
little tiny pixels won't be a problem so
now I'm gonna go ahead and render those
again and I'm going to pause and once
it's ready I will see what this looks
like
alright alright so this is the finished
if I render and it took I probably I
don't know a couple minutes but you
probably also noticed that I changed the
rotation of this a little bit all I did
was I I took the object the curve I hit
R in Z and just turned it a little bit
so that this point was facing me I think
I'll make the final image a little bit
more interesting so once you have it
rendered and you're happy with it go
ahead and hit f3 and that will allow you
to save it so f3 and I'm just going to
call this show icon and save as image
alright so that is basically it for
today's tutorial and tomorrow we're
going to get this finished up by
importing it into Photoshop and get it
encased into an actual iOS app icon with
the rounded corners and we're also going
to play around with a couple of other
adjustments in terms of the color
contrast and a lighting effect alright
