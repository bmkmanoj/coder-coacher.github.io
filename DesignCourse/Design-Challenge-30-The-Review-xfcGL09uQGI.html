challenge number 30
my voice crack can sound like a little
girl submit your site or portfolio so we
got a lot of entries this time around so
I'm gonna go through these really
quickly so unfortunately I can't
dedicate too much time to these all
right so let's begin right here all
right
I assume this is probably the home link
so let's check this out see what's going
on unfortunately I cannot read this this
looks like a Spanish Oh too soon I don't
know anyhow just checking out the
portfolio one thing that seems strange
is I how this is only one column but
there's so much space on the right and
left I guess it's not a huge deal but
ideally you'd have at least maybe these
a little bit smaller thumbnails maybe
have three of them on each row but not a
big deal but looking at this yeah seems
you have one two three four five six
seven a basic examples here from your
portfolio I've but if you click these
specific all right there's a lot there
in that category there's some three here
and they fall under multiple categories
obviously you just try to need to get
more work basically unfortunately I
can't really could take it beyond that I
just because I don't know what anything
says but yeah I would try to get more
portfolio examples here that way you can
help try to give potential clients a lot
more to go off of instead of just you
know eight or seven or whatever examples
but thanks for submitting just check out
the next one here all right this is a
carbon made site okay so basically not
bad at least your speech hearing your
work here initially which is always a
good thing because potential clients
really don't care about anything else
for the most part so we have 3d
manipulations here we have 2d and then
we have of course down here
illustrations
so looking at this there's a pretty good
work here I browse through you know each
of the submissions earlier most of them
at least before recording and yeah this
is a pretty good work here for
manipulations this doesn't seem like
there's too much happening here I maybe
try to get a little bit more work in
this category and these are pretty good
I this is pretty good right here
this is pretty good as well I probably
would get rid of maybe this one this one
I would get rid of me possibly this one
but try to focus on try to get a little
bit higher quality I like this one so
that's good that you've kind of ordered
the better once at the top and of course
contact easy to reach you which is good
alright so thanks for that
submission okay so this one's a nice
sight I think one thing that I would
have preferred maybe just too high maybe
I take this background image and make it
just a tad bit darker so you can read
this not too much darker than what it
currently is but just a little bit and
that way this stuff stands out a little
bit more and a little bit easier to read
not a huge deal though
I like the effects the squirrel
activated CSS animations and such that's
good looking at the portfolio I concept
these I like this overlay as well
concept space blog here what happens
when you click these okay so it's just a
you know that's not bad problem is
there's only six things here so
obviously you know you'll want to try to
get more but this is nice I think it's
one of these one page site so it's not
bad good stuff thanks for that I I think
we already got that one or did we not oh
yeah okay the hell am i oh okay I think
this is the one that just did okay there
we go lost my space there alright so
looking at this
this is pretty cool kind of CSS
animations or SVG's okay what I am
alright
all right that's pretty cool and looking
out at the portfolio here this looks
pretty decent just from the thumbnail
yeah these are pretty good decent mount
of work so there's not too much here
that I say that could be improved
I assuming this is yours and
everything's custom that's good stuff
cool thanks for that submission let's
see yeah that's good next one the logo
pond all right these are all pretty good
I noticed some of these are from
actually a decent amount of them are
from the design challenges obviously
ideally they would be from rural clients
but if you don't have them you know what
can you do but looking at this overall
there's definitely a talent here in
terms of logo design so good stuff good
stuff ultimately you do want to get a
site up as quickly as possible though
your own dot-com or dotnet or dot IO or
whatever and that's something I'm gonna
suggest to everybody who's not hosted on
their own comm all right mostly 3ds
stuff I checked this out earlier really
good 3d stuff I like it good stuff going
on here but like I said try to get your
own site up I if you can like this x10
host yeah not good you want to get your
own site up clients will take you more
seriously they're going to ultimately I
it's going to increase the amount of you
know potential clients that you have to
actually become paid clients alright so
looking at this it wasn't immediate of
immediately obvious to me that this was
a slider when I first came here I just
because it shows this and not really
sure this is kind of hidden at the
bottom so you don't really know so I
would try to probably speed those up a
little bit more quickly if you're going
to have a slider like this I so you may
even want to consider removing this
entirely and just you know having what
you have here like right here be the
homepage like at the very start of
Paige that way people can easily access
what they want to see looking at this
some of this work looks pretty good and
it's a variety of work see this photo
restoration I not bad not bad
you got a contact form social good stuff
just a minor grip at the top thanks for
that submission
all right Wix comm definitely want to
get off it there again you know a.com
you can find homes for $1 sometimes if
you look at the rate registrar's per
year and then the hosting you can get
very very cheap hosting for like just a
few dollars a month so definitely try to
get your own com or.net or whatever
alright but having said that looking at
this let's see here so okay did about
you skills not bad alright so we have
the work is listed down here there's
about five or six or wait there's our
show other product designs or yeah
because when it comes to the work you
obviously want to have a good variety
but of course if you're relatively new
it's kind of hard to get that going
initially but yeah keep on adding to
this as much as possible and I iMovie
instead of saying say hi maybe hire me
if you're trying to actually get clients
alright good stuff thanks for submission
submitting alright so let's come down
here this is a behance
I I notice I may be all of these are
possibly from the challenges so
obviously parties just starting out yeah
not too much I can critique it's this
isn't your own website and I've already
could take these I think from previous
challenges so yeah just try to get your
own home or net your own hosting and
keep on getting I work posted as much as
possible alright coming down here okay
let's see
you know ideally this might point to a
site or something okay not bad
again there's my for example so your
average potential client would look like
at that and say that's not enough here
for me to go off of so the big thing
that you need to do is try to as much as
possible get more work added so hustle
hustle hustle thanks for that
another Behance and we just have five
projects here again there's not too much
that I can really say or critique about
this this is pretty cool though a lot of
work obviously went into this good stuff
yeah I mean could tell you have talent
here you just need to get some more
examples in order to really get
potential clients even though these are
pretty elaborate though so good stuff
good stuff alright alright so university
project okay alright using parallax cool
stuff going on there on scroll I like
this part one part I don't like is this
part because if you're gonna show this
is negative like this stuff right here
saying that you're not good or whatever
I would completely just get rid of this
entirely I that way you're not showing
you know potential clients that you're
not the greatest at organizing or you
know you're not the greatest at UX
design I want to put that at all I would
remove that and then look at this I
Burger King project okay note that's
cool
wait where'd that go Oh back okay cool
yeah I like the hover
and obviously assuming you know you may
not be advertising your site yet but
obviously you don't have empty
categories so if you have to ever remove
that other than that I like the site a
lot good stuff all right keep on going
all right so let development in design
my work this is where we're currently at
personal projects the screeners what
happens when I do this
cool it loads the actual site up so
that's good extend framework cool let's
offline all right not bad then there's
about me
pretty interesting unique sort of layout
it's not bad
got your social stuff oops over here not
bad I would try probably add a couple
more examples in the portfolio another
project that's what I'd say I this one
was pretty cool I saw this earlier
although this does take a little bit of
time but understandably so because you
have all this crazy insane stuff here
which is pretty cool but at that initial
loading phase initially it took a little
bit more time when I first visited the
site but this is pretty cool very
graphical this is pretty decent
information here all right so we got
customers some pretty big-name customers
that's good
this parts cool as well a lot of
information very good
cool stuff cool yeah it's not too much
for me to critique here I mean assuming
everything that you've done is pretty
his custom that's pretty cool good stuff
thanks for submitting all right a
Behance all right so we have logo in
word marks yeah just need a little bit
more added to that obviously not bad
yeah pretty pretty good work overall
yep I would just like to see a little
bit more work because we only have about
how many projects just six um
but yeah good stuff obviously try to get
your own comm as soon as possible or
dotnet or diode or whatever alright
let's see here check this one out
this one wasn't enough contrast I would
just prefer to see this white just
however everything white probably a lot
easier to see this stuff is kind of hard
to read as well because it blends in
with the background even though there is
a kind of a drop shadow but I'd like to
see a better view of you know these
projects that you worked on
perhaps in a thumbnail maybe just have
three large thumbnails with the preview
and the name and then you can link them
to a separate page outlines all these
details right here hi okay these aren't
okay I guess this is a place where you
previously worked I like to see how it
laid out a little bit better though
alright 3d set I would probably try to
get rid of some of these site examples
right here and here they look quite
outdated so I probably remove that I
would remove those and try to replace
this with something that's a little bit
more up-to-date you know make it a
little bit these stand out a little bit
better better cuz I as a navigation and
you can't really tell you need better
spacing to be with these things right
here but thanks for this emission
alright let me go back there we go
alright so let's see how this verse
checking the who that's this is kind of
hard to see unfortunately because of
this branding background I would get rid
of that because it's hard to see where
they begin and then these thumbnails
yeah if you're gonna have these
categories ideally you have more than
one example again same issue with that
in the background see I would just try
to get that issue with those pages
worked out and of course try to get more
examples as well no all right otherwise
good stuff all right what is this okay
so let's see here
polio
I probably try to frame these somehow so
they're not just blended in with the
background maybe just in case I mean
like a few pixel border I would probably
try to condense these into one just one
thumbnail and I'd show all of them at
once once you click them otherwise it
gets a little bit repetitive otherwise I
mean this parts pretty good too the way
you have these set up I would try to set
these ones possibly up like that as well
all right see the contact work in Skype
good stuff all right thanks for the
submission another one it's hosted on a
different domain try to get your own
definitely look at this an okay amount
of work yeah not bad yeah I probably
just try to get rid of the pro site
thing get your own domain and probably
try to add just a few more examples see
it the contact working ideal you doubt
also have a contact form that they can
fill out right on a page because people
are lazy you want to believe it alright
so thanks for that
alright see here all right look at this
can I click on any of it nope was a
YouTube channel link that's kind of
hidden I would try to make that stand
out so my work alright there's a decent
amount here so that's good
contact us there we go good stuff
I'd definitely try to get on your domain
as well all right okay so I pixel
factory not bad I would probably try to
link the portfolio pretty prominently
sundown somewhere down here all right I
just had to pause because my phone was
ringing so looking at this yep just need
a decent amount of eye that's the ear
let's see let me go back real quick yeah
it seems like just a little bit more
detail here or more projects I I would
scale up the size of these thumbnails as
well alright thanks for that
alright paint with green alright okay
graphics now any of the results after
this one or including this one I have
not seen so this would be our first time
looking at these all right
you know I'm trying to this one's pretty
good yeah not bad
Gamze web design yeah I definitely try
to get more examples here perhaps a
little bit more updated in terms of the
design as well
oops alright so thanks for that
submission looking here behance alright
alright decent amount of uh well there's
seven here yep this is good design this
is pretty cool-looking I like that
well we're all not bad nice good stuff
keep on doing what you're doing nothing
really to critique negatively at least
another behance yeah unfortunately
there's just not a lot here so you're
get definitely going to need to keep on
working on adding impressive projects as
the other other ones we're these two
were a little bit obviously not much
going on so yeah definitely try to get
more going on there and also try to get
your own domain as well checking out
this one alright I don't really like
that all it is is just this picture here
so definitely try to rework this and
something else or have more examples
alright so
you're not too sure if I'm a fan of this
liar the way it is but I would
definitely try to work on I probably
remove something like this and just try
to work on your quality a little bit
more and work on that homepage as well
I've probably add more information here
as well and a way to email you well
right here I guess but you want
something that people can fill out a
form and for your contact basically so
thanks for that next one up I'd probably
yeah I want to rework I would wear
rework this big time this is kind of
just big buttons on as a homepage so I
would definitely work this into
something much more modern for this
homepage so let's just check out logo
concepts I definitely want to have more
than three obviously but I understand
you know if you're just the beginning or
starting out you may not I probably even
include YouTube banners as a section I
would just call it graphics and include
them inside that it's probably the same
thing with avatars sure alright thanks
for that let's see here all right
it seems like that's the only thing you
may have I would definitely try to work
with if you're gonna have a furlough
designed definitely have more examples
of the logo design and definitely work
on I really trying to follow the latest
logo design trends graphic design
alright well there's decent work here
decent amount so that's good alright
thanks for your entry all right another
Wix I try to get away from Wix you know
wait that's not even mmm
we looked at everything for the okay
well unfortunately that didn't work
let's move on to the next one alright I
work on trying to make these a little
bit different these thumbnails just that
way it's the it doesn't look so
redundant in a way so let's take it a
little go show case it's not bad in
terms of the logos it's not bad either
yep I would just probably work on the
thumbnails and try to add more obviously
just more work keep producing producing
producing and get your own domain yeah
I'm not really sure if I would include
this
yeah I would ultimately try to get I
mean do you oh you should always have a
Facebook page but not rely on rely on it
as it being your sole site for you know
your personal branding I so yeah I would
definitely get ya your own site sorry I
was reading this and I tried to really
focus on creating modern design because
I saw some design in here that seemed a
little bit outdated just in terms with a
lot of excessive effects like I well I
thought initially this was a lens flare
that's why I said that but it's not but
yeah thanks for the submission another
wick site you can use what the hell
Mike's design swipe graphics and this is
swipe graphics white graphic design Oh
what the hell is going on it's like at
the same URL but you guys are different
people and these URLs are not working
hmm oh well alright so this text right
here I can't even see it
I'm not sure I would really have that at
it anyways
looking at this
I have no clue what is going on here
typical injuries occur in every okay
well I'm not gonna read the whole thing
it's only six examples definitely I want
to have how definitely want to add more
obviously sketches oh that's not bad
watercolor actually it's more than six I
didn't realize these were categories so
or some of them are at least and let's
say check out your contact yeah I try to
get it form in here along with your
email LinkedIn Instagram that's fine but
try to get a form as well because people
are lazy thanks for submitting all right
another Wix example fortunately this one
worked well I see there's a decent
amount of work here so that's good about
probably try to restructure this page a
little bit better have a picture
yourself I mean if you're really trying
to get clients and such I'll contact us
this this is fine the work there seems
to be quite a bit of work here so I
would try to maybe categorize them into
you know like identity and logo design
and then web design if you have that and
graphic and graphic and illustration so
thanks for that let's see here
another Behance all right seems like to
be a pretty decent amount of work this
looks good
yep this is pretty good unfortunately
you don't have your own site so I can't
really provide a very elaborate or even
less than elaborate review for that all
right so here's weina okay although I
would add a slash right here for this
well that's just a minor gripe all right
so 19 let's see here
this isn't good because this is
overlapping that would fix that all
right and again this is overlapping
major nono work yeah you have to have
more than two things so I would
definitely work on adding more and work
on those issues as well with the
overlapping the dreaded 99designs lopez
aren't too bad but I would definitely
not rely on 99designs for our portfolio
I would definitely get my own site up
all right
another Wix site
oh yeah I definitely get your own domain
I mean your own hosting alright that's
pretty cool the way that happened
alright so I like this the way the
portfolio is laid out here seems to be
pretty decent I work here and that's
gonna yeah interesting how that shows up
although where is navigation I guess
there isn't one huh yeah we're gonna try
to get like a formal navigation and your
own hosting as well that's gonna be a
big one
alright check this out Instagram
definitely eventually want to get your
own domain possible which it should be
because they were dirt cheap
along with hosting this looks like 3d
work possibly yep that looks cool
whatever it is in 3d well it seems like
he's specialized in 3d so okay there's a
lot more that's good good stuff there's
a good amount of work here so that's
good I I would just definitely get your
own domain so that you can i really be
able to customize it and tailor it and
get your own brand going so that's what
I would focus on cuz you already have
the work so let's see here
alright Oh broken images not good yeah
well my critique is that you need to fix
that for sure
portfolio I let me know what this
portion portion is it feels like hey I
should be able to click or do something
in their logos okay well here's all the
work I would try to get some of these on
the home page
yeah I'm definitely trying to fix those
issues alright so looking at this yeah
not much happening here Bill Cosby and
let's see your design projects you know
just let's see yeah I like this example
this is probably the best a lot of the
other stuff is looking a little bit on
the you know this side that can be
definitely be improved this is good
I would weed out some of these though
probably get rid of this one for sure
I'm definitely get rid of this example
possibly this example as well possibly
some of those probably this as well I
get rid of and just stick to the really
really good stuff and try to produce
more of it and get your own calm or.net
or whatever you're on hosting all right
here's one okay so let's go to logos
yeah I would definitely I probably get
rid of this one it looks a little bit
amateurish this as well probably this as
well and really just focus on you know
let's see what else is going on here
alright this is a little bit better in
terms of that category yeah some of
these probably need a little bit of work
so keep plugging away though keep
reducing thanks for the submission and
let's see here
alright logos
all right a lot of work here not too bad
seems pretty good good stuff the hell
why Zinta loading it must be an issue or
something
anyhow I pretty good work here but of
course as I've mentioned with other ones
try to get your own comm going or.net or
die over do it whatever this one hard to
see this my design work and it's really
smashed up against here I try to push
that down looking at this yeah you're
gonna try to definitely focus on getting
a little bit better and increasing the
quality I'm some of this stuff here that
I see
yeah I would do this sort of thing you
know the showcasing of the projects but
really focus on I only showing really
good projects and in obviously
increasing the amount that you have
available here and definitely get rid of
the Wix comm it's gonna make it hard to
get clients not hard necessarily but
it's gonna be easier with your own
branded comm alright so here's one for
example they have their own comm so
media seems more professional right out
of the gate it's a project proposal
folio
yeah I definitely try to increase the
amount of work you have and maybe try to
weed out a few of them that aren't as
good as the other ones thanks for that
all right
I'm just looking at this run down this
is a little bit hard to read just for
potential old clients that would be an
issue now if you're only going to show
you two banners let me see
okay YouTube banners in high quality
graphics okay well I guess that would be
relevant done
all right all right yeah I mean again if
this is what your site's going to be
dedicated to I let's see here for free
YouTube channel or just want to know I
wonder what the payoff of with it was
like why are you doing it for free
oh okay so you're trying to sell
additional things in current after that
okay cool stuff all right well cool
thanks for that let me go back up here
Swift designs all right
work definitely want these to be
clickable just because they're so small
people will definitely want to see them
larger so this is a one page site it
looks like so yeah definitely increase
the amount of work that you have and
make these clickable if possible
definitely do that otherwise the work
itself looks pretty decent alright so
let's see another Behance
just browsing at these thumbnails
because I'm not gonna click on every
single one of them I would definitely
try to focus only on showing your best
work I this I would say it's better than
this that's for sure so I would get rid
of that one and probably a few of the
other ones because you have a decent
amount of work here but you don't want
to show all your work you only want to
show the best so that's what I would
focus on alright not too sure if I'd
like the header up here and let's gray
everything's kind of just gray and bland
I guess he could say so I'd work on that
and I would probably consistent with the
other oh wait yeah there's an issue
there HTML wise because we are you
definitely don't want to a horizontal
scroll happening there definitely don't
want that so and I'd also read out some
of the ones that aren't as good as the
other so I would only choose you know
your absolute best work and that's it so
yeah definitely
alright and then fix this issue all
right Stu thanks everyone for submitting
designs yeah that was a longer review
sorry I was kind of monotone during that
whole process it kind of tired
but I thanks for submitting and please
