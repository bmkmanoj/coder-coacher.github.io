comm today we have a new tutorial in
blender for you and that is going to be
creating the lightbulb scene that you
just saw so this is going to run for
days and today we're going to focus on
just building and modeling the basic
light bulb shape alright so as always
check out design course comm if you
haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube alright let's get started
alright so real quick for the new people
- blender eye to select objects you just
right-click it not left to select
multiple objects you just hold shift and
right click and then to move around in
3d space you just hold your middle mouse
button I to zoom up use your scroll
wheel and then to pan you hold shift and
that middle mouse button our 3rd mouse
button whatever you want to call it and
that's really the only overview of the
interface I'm going to go over it's
really not necessary to try to really
try to you know teach every tiny little
thing so I'm a big fan of just getting
in and just doing actual projects to
learn okay so I I went to file new just
to reload everything so we're on the
same page and I'm gonna hit delete and
we're going to add and for now on you
just got to add up here mesh or just
shift a mesh we're going to make a UV
sphere I these settings over here are
defaults we're just gonna leave them
there and this is going to serve as the
actual top you know the glass portion of
the light bulb so what I want to do is
hit the number 5 on your number pad and
that takes us from perspective to
orthographic mode and we're also going
to hit one to give us the front view and
you're gonna zoom up here a little bit
and we're gonna go to our edit mode that
oh and yeah we're going to go to edit
mode so you can do this manually down
here or just hit tap okay so now in edit
mode we can actually transform this
thing and play with it a little bit
an object mode of course you can just
select objects you can't really deform
it too much all right so back in edit
mode a hitting tab before we do anything
let's go over here and add no yeah add
modifier we want to add a subdivision
surface that will basically just make
everything real smooth and so for the
subdivisions I for your render this
isn't going to affect us until we
actually go render else leave it at
three for our view which is right now
you know what we see we turn this up we
can see that it gets smoother so it can
affect the performance of your computer
I'm just going to put it on three for
mine and also down here we want to turn
on smooth shading all right so now what
we want to do is kind of create the
portion of the light bulb that just kind
of flows down like that and it's very
simple basically we'll take this row
right here first hit a that D selects or
selects all if you basically keep on
clicking it and now what we want to do
is hit the letter B as in boy and then
just select those now we can just drag
this down and maybe it's right around
here and if you want to select oh you
know what I'm gonna back up what
happened was if I leave it there
I always forget this this is what
happens that's not what we want
obviously so I'm gonna hit one to get
back to front and I'm gonna hit ctrl Z
to undo and then turn on this this lets
me select everything behind it so sorry
alright so drag this down here right
around here and if you want to select
individual edge loops these things like
a single row you just hold alt and right
click and you can begin to play with
this that's just a little bit and you
could hit s to scale just drag it in
slightly and maybe hit a and then B so
like these
have it come down a little bit more
that's pretty much a shape of the actual
bulb and I'm gonna leave mmm I'm gonna a
and B again front view just bring this
up a little bit all right
okay so right off the bat I was just
kind of want to get out the materials
and get everything set up here so first
what I want to do we're in object mode
so I tabbed out of edit I we're gonna go
into add a floor here so shift a mesh
and plane hit s like 30 something really
large so that basically multiplies it by
30 from its default size and I'm gonna
come over here and just this is
something I do for every project I just
changed my render settings
we're gonna go to cycles render up here
first for my device I'm going to be
using GPU compute that makes it render a
lot faster let's see I know I wanted to
be 1280 by 720 and 100 over here that
will come into play when we actually
render it later on let's see we'll go to
sampling all right so let me just show
you something real quick especially for
the new people if we change this view to
render right now we're solid if we go to
rendered I you really can't tell too
much here on this particular view but
ten samples is very low and it'll make
it look grainy so when we render it's
actually I'm probably gonna use 1500 or
so but when it comes to the preview
which is what we're previewing now it's
not the actual render this is currently
10 so I changed mine to a hundred
usually alright so you know if it's
really making your computer slow just
take it down all right so let's see here
I'm gonna come over here to the world
setting and just temporarily just make
this a little bit brighter all right and
I'm gonna go back to solid here we're
gonna take this light bulb portion and
we're gonna go to the material section
and we're going to add a new material
alright so the next parts gonna be a
little bit confusing especially if
you're new but don't worry it's it's not
a big deal I will hold your hand
basically let's take this and drag down
so that splits the view and what I want
to do is change this view down here to
the node editor all right so these are
nodes here in basically when I created a
new material this is what we're looking
at so you can either use this over here
to set your materials or you can use the
node editor which allows you for more
flexibility although it's scary-looking
especially if you're new so I we're
gonna set and try to make this look like
the actual glass light bulb right now
alright so let me get this more into
view here okay so by default we'll just
put on render just to see what we have
going here just basic it's clay
basically so what we want to do is get
rid of this diffuse alright so it makes
it go black shift a and now we're going
to add what's called a mix shader' and
all mixed shader does is just allow you
to put in multiple shaders so now we're
going to add another shader here and
this is going to be a glass and we'll
connect this to this shader right there
so now you can see it's already looking
like a glass type situation there shift
a input and we're going to put
transparent what am i doing here there
we go all right so right there and then
we're going to connect this to the
bottom alright so this right here this
value basically if you take it to the
left it's going to make it completely
glass take it to the right it's going to
make it completely transparent
i bay so this allows you a lot of
control basically and so I'm gonna leave
mine at 0.34 and that seemed to work
when I went through this tutorial pretty
pretty good I from the end result over
here let's see here yeah that's
basically our material for the glass we
can just call this glass there you go
okay so now I'm going to go ahead and
hide or join these two windows or either
seats right click hit join area and we
can join this one down alright so so far
so good pretty simple so now what we
want to do is actually add the part that
you screw in alright so let us go here
back to solid and we're gonna leave the
origin point right there usually if you
left-click that's going to change that
it's not a big deal if you did move it
so shift a we're gonna go to mesh also
make sure you're in object mode and not
edit mode otherwise it will add it to
that current object so we're gonna add
mesh and we're going to add a cylinder
because that's the basic shape of that
little corkscrew type of plugging in
area
alright scale it down by holding s and
just bringing it in I don't have an
exact value for you I I'm gonna
right-click on the plane and just drop
it down temporarily pretty far down and
alright so let's take this and just
temporarily just maybe like right around
there is good and what I want to do is
go ahead and to the object modifiers add
a subdivision surface and it distorts it
big time and that is expected I'm gonna
take mine up to 3 on both the view in
the render tab alright so this is where
we actually get some work done so
basically the reason it's doing is it
because we only have two edge loops I
and so to add the
you just hit ctrl R and you'll see this
pink thing there and you can add on both
you know these ways or this way and
basically we want to add it by left
clicking and then dragging up to around
here and then ctrl R again left click
drag it down to around there all right
all right had to pause for a second
basically now we want to create the this
the loops that go around here that you
screw on so ctrl R and left-click and
bring it up to around here do another
one actually gonna back up and hit ctrl
Z and then just hit R to rotate this
slightly kind of just like that by
hitting are now ctrl R again o R again
just try to line it up roughly how I'm
doing it oops and I want to put it over
there there we go and right there
alright so now what we need to do is hit
ctrl R in between each one of these and
then hit s and I think 1.3 works pretty
well so that will just increase it by
one point three percent so our one point
three you know whatever the current size
all right I'll stop talking all right
just so do the same thing in the middle
of that one
at one point three control R s one point
three
s 1.3 control-r
s 1.3 control-r this is gonna be a last
one s 1.2 maybe and then hit one so
we're looking directly in the front view
zoom up here a little bit and we're
gonna take the bottom row about the
bottom edge loop so that just alt
right-click we're going to scale it in a
little bit actually
s yeah just a little bit and then bring
it down kind of like right around there
and hit s a movie scale in all right and
then you because usually at the bottom
of a light bulb is a black kind of piece
all right so now we need to see you know
kind of what this thing looks like also
I want to delete the face here in the
middle so you just switch to face mode
we were in vertex there I right-click it
and then just hit delete faces so now
that's kind of open here all right so
now if we go to rendered view of course
it looks like clay so let's get our
material out here to try to make this
look metal in a sense and this may not I
have to really just see what this looks
like I when it has the metal material
and then I probably will make some
adjustments to this all right so this is
going to be a little bit more complex of
a node and I found this I'll link to it
in the description of the video this
material that seemed to like really work
for the intended effect that was going
for so let's go ahead and we'll switch
to solid we'll
drag down this and we'll go back to our
node editor down here okay and we're in
edit mode up here so tab into object
mode and we'll go ahead and just put
just hit new and that way it gives us a
starting point down here
okay so just right away I'm gonna hit
delete on that material alright so let's
get started this is going to be a little
bit complex as I said so it's Adamek
shader so shift a shader mix shader' my
kids are being loud down there I swear
every video I'm talking about how llama
kids are shift a lot another one I this
will be a glossy connect it to the top
right there and just hit shift D to
duplicate that so we're gonna have to
glossy shaders I know like why would you
do that but apparently it works well the
color of this one is going to be like a
grey and also just so we can kind of see
what this thing looks like we can go to
rendered so that's what it looks like so
far based on our current settings I so
we're gonna add what's called a mix so
if we go down to color and hit mix RGB
we'll put that one right there and
connect it to the color input all right
and so now we see we have two different
colors that we can specify and the ones
that I found that looks pretty good
is right around here in the hex code if
you want that at seven eight 77 you
don't have to be specific it's not that
big of a deal the color - I think we're
just gonna leave it like kind of right
around where it was alright so I also
now let's make sure we have the other
values correct here this down here for
the roughness is zero point one one zero
and the roughness up here or for this
mix shader' right here is 0.5 so we want
to change that to 0.33 for the roughness
over here is going to stay at no
we're gonna put 0.22 and I'm looking off
screen because I screenshotted what I
had before by the way all right and then
shift a we're going to add a RGB to
black and white so let me find that
right here and basically oops no this
goes into the FAQ up here shift a to add
a noise texture
alright so texture noise texture add it
to the color and just to show you real
quick if hit control you can like and in
left click you can break those
connections I if we connected it here to
well actually on a server that I
wouldn't even work yeah
nevermind I was gonna try to like show
you something but nevermind alright
alright so now I we have that and for
this scale we have to adjust this this
is going to be 30 you can kind of see I
what looks like it looks just like a
noise texture basically as the name
suggests for the detail yeah we're gonna
leave that too and for the distortion
we're gonna put at five all right and
then we're going to add texture map
we're ever yet I always forget where
these damn things are I'm still a newbie
here mapping vector mapping okay and
we'll connect it right here
no we won't there we go
nothing changes yet and then we're gonna
hit texture coordinate input texture
coordinate down here all right so what
we want to adjust on this is the Y and
so this is the scale of like how these
things appear so if you change it from 1
to 20
you can just barely see how it kind of
changes that a little bit I'm looking
here to see if there's anything else I
need to change 30 and there's something
I screwed up right here this is supposed
to not go to color 1 this is supposed to
go to this value right here all right
and now when it comes to this looking
more realistic that's gonna be based on
our lighting setup so for now I'm just
gonna leave this as it is all right
and I'm going to take this oops take
these two just right click join area
down here okay all right so now I'm
gonna add some lights here some emission
planes so I'm gonna go to solid shift a
mesh plane
I actually I don't want it to go right
there so I hit three on my number pad
maybe one over here for the front and
then just left click twice it's going to
be right around the camera shift a mesh
plane all right so we can rotate it to
kind of face this thing I'm gonna scale
it up I like s and to R to rotate it and
rotate it on the Zed access our Z so
it's kind of like facing it a little bit
alright and we're here in the materials
hit new we'll call this just light and
then for the surface it's going to be
emission strength I'm gonna try 20 all
right so if we get up in here and change
this to rendered
we could see that now this looks a lot
better and we can actually see that it
looks kind of realistic in terms of the
glass portion all right so now I'm gonna
click on this just by right clicking and
when you're in your rendered mode you
can't really see what you're clicking
but if you just hit g4 move and then Z
just push this thing up right around
there and just left-click to get it to
stay all right so so far so good I I'm
gonna end it there because we're already
at 25 minutes and I so yeah tomorrow
we're gonna focus on and also this scale
is not right I mean I need to work with
this a little bit more but we'll do that
tomorrow all right so yeah basically
we'll go ahead and work on getting this
thing looking a lot better we're gonna
create some of the inner stuff that you
see in here let me know what it's called
I and then making this part black and
then we'll get ready and set the scene
up kind of cool all right and Garris I'm
designing course comm and check it out I
don't yet have any paid courses but I am
releasing a video every day of the year
and I think this is almost like my like
number 50 already but yeah subscribe
here on YouTube for sure alright I'll
see you tomorrow
