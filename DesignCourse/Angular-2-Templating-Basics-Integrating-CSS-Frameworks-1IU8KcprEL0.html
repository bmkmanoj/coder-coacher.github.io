calm and today we're going to take a
look at the basics of angular 2
templating and also how to integrate
various CSS frameworks such as
Foundation and bootstrap
all right so let's switch over to our
command prompt make sure you're in your
projects folder and by the way if you
haven't seen my video previous to this
where I show you how to create a new
angular 2 project through the angular
client you might want to check that out
first just to make sure you have
everything needed installed so I'm going
to type in ng new will call this
templates and before hit enter we're
going to take a look at something I have
a covered yet so let's go over to the
browser and we'll go to the github
angular client page I'm going to hit
ctrl F to type in and find
pre-processors processors rather not
processors and right here we have CSS
preprocessor integration so it supports
a since s CSS lesson stylist and so if
we come down here we'll see we have ng
new your project name and the option to
specify a preprocessor such as dash dash
style equals sass so that's what we're
going to do I'm going to put a dash dash
style equals s CSS and then hit enter so
now because this takes a little bit of
time I'm just going to go ahead and
pause it and then I'll come right back
all right it's done now let's go ahead
and switch back I'm going to hit CD and
templates and then ng serve now this is
going to go ahead and compile and I'll
go whole ad over to the browser and
specify localhost 4200 just make sure
everything is good to go and it is the
new tab up and app works we're all good
to go all right so now I'm going to go
ahead over to my code editor I'm going
to open up that folder templates and
select folder all right and here we are
the first thing I want to do is look at
source folder and here you'll notice we
have Styles dot s CSS and usually when
you create an angular 2
object from the client like that by
default without specifying a
preprocessor it will be Styles dot CSS
but now we can write sass in here and it
will compile down ok so let's go ahead
inside our app folder and go to app
component HTM not nope sorry TS rather
and the areas that we want to focus on
are the templates and styles mount by
default when you create an angular 2
project to the client it uses the
template you are URL to link to an
external HTML file where your template
or your view would go same thing with
your style URLs as well and this is
specific to the tags and the codes and
IDs and classes that you add in this
HTML file here now I'm going to go ahead
and comment these out real quick to show
you how we can do inline CSS and HTML so
actually what we'll do is just take this
one down add it right here so the
property changes from template URL to
simply template and then in single
quotes if we have a single line of HTML
we can specify something like P high
what is up and close it and then save it
and we'll come over here hi what is up
very very simple now if you want to add
multiple lines of HTML you have to
change these single quotes here to
backticks which is accessible to the key
to the left of the number one at the top
of your keyboard so we'll change that
there and now and I'll add another
element maybe a ul
item number one and we could save this
and we'll see this should now reflect
the HTML that we just specified
now what about CSS basically it's the
same concept so the property name for
that let's put a comma here after that
back to is styles and we wrap it around
brackets and single quotes here and then
we can specify so I'm CSS that
references the HTML that we have above
here so we'll put in P font - weight
bold and then maybe ul Li and we'll
specify oops we need to close this over
here with a curly bracket or brace and
specify something like text - decoration
underline I just want to do something so
we know that it works so we'll save this
and there we go alright so inline HTML
and CSS when exactly would you want to
utilize that as opposed to just linking
to a separate HTML and CSS file well if
you ever run into a situation where your
component has very little HTML and CSS
that's when it makes sense to use the
inline option otherwise if you have a
lot of HTML and CSS and you don't want
it cluttering your component view then
you can go ahead and place that into a
different HTML file and use the template
URL option as well as well as the style
URLs option as well and whenever you can
get away with adding it into your
component decorator inline you should do
that because it is actually a bit faster
because it does reduce the time needed
because it's right in the file as
opposed to making a request from another
file to grab the HTML or CSS alright so
let's go ahead and get rid of all this
and we'll bring back our template URL
right there let's save it
to make sure everything is back to where
it was with app works okay so now let's
say for example you want to integrate a
CSS frameworks such as bootstrap or
foundation because you're used to using
the grid or some of the other predefined
elements for the CSS well there's a
couple ways you can do that there's a
quick method and then if there's a
method that you can utilize that takes a
little bit more time but it does host it
on your project and on your server as
opposed to linking to a CDN so let's
look at the first option which is the
CDN option so I'm going to go ahead and
take a look at
and we're going to specify get bootstrap
comm and we're going to click on
download bootstrap and we'll see we have
the bootstrap CDN so we want the one
that's latest compiled and minified CSS
so we'll grab this HTML here and copy it
we'll go back to our project and in
index.html we're going to specify or
paste rather what we just copied so
we're going to save this and if we go
back to our project here you can see
that it now updated from that serif font
which is default without CSS to this
sans-serif font which means that
bootstrap is now loaded ok so that's the
very quick method of integrating the
bootstrap CDN and the same thing applies
to foundation all you have to do is
Google Foundation and are not NPM but
rather foundation CDN and you'll find
one that's hosted and you can do the
same exact thing and you'll have access
to coding with foundation ok so let's go
ahead and undo that I'm going to save
that just to get rid of that and when
you'll notice we go back here it will
change back to our serif font and let's
say for example you wanted to include
bootstrap as a part of your project so
the way you'd want to do this is first
let's go back to our browser here and
click right here I'm not sure if you
hear that that's my phone that's ringing
on silent next to me hopefully you can't
and we want to hit ctrl F here on this
github angular client page and just type
in bootstrap now we'll see we have a
global library installation section so
for bootstrap to install it we do it
from NPM so NPM install bootstrap at
next so let's go back here to our
command prompt Petrille C to get out of
the ng serve I'm going to type an NPM
install bootstrap at next so I'm going
to go ahead and just pause this because
it can take just a tab at a time and
I'll come back alright so it is done now
it's added it into our node modules
folder so let's go back to our project
and we don't have to include anything
here however we have to write down here
in angular CLI Jason and so what we
specify that specify something in our
styles and also our scripts so if we go
back to that page that we are just at
you can see it tells you what needs
loaded here inside of the scripts tag so
let's go ahead and copy that we'll paste
that inside of scripts we'll save it and
then we also go back here and there's
one more that we need to add and that's
just on top of the existing Styles dot
in our case it's going to be s CSS we
add this right here so let's go back and
then we save it now ng serve doesn't
watch this file so we have to go ahead
real quickly I was already out of it so
ng serve wait just a couple seconds
let's go over here to our browser and
we'll see it should update here there we
go with app works and now it is
integrated control shift I everything is
working so the same the same there's a
similar process for foundation so I'm
not going to cover doing the foundation
CDN I already told you how to do that
very very simple however let's also take
a look at what it takes to integrate
foundation into the project itself as we
just did with bootstrap so real quickly
I'm going to go ahead over to our
project and I'm going to back up a
couple times back to where we were
before and save it and then we're going
to go back to our command line and a
ctrl C to get out of here and I'm going
to type in NPM install foundation -
sites - - save and once again I'm going
to go ahead and just pause this while it
goes through in installs alright and its
installed so let's go back to our
project
for foundation to work we don't have a
page or anywhere on the existing angular
client page that will let us know how
that works so we have to add it manually
and basically if you look up in the node
modules folder you'll find the
foundation - sites folder that we just
had installed and you'll have to find
which of the CSS versions you want to
use such as the flex grid or the regular
grid etc so just to show you I know what
it is offhand
so in our Styles we'll want to specify
I'm looking off the side because already
have link saved over here right here the
link happens to be no modules foundation
- site
dist and then Foundation - flex I like
using the flex grid and then also here
for scripts we add in a reference to two
scripts which is jQuery and then also
foundation - slides dist in foundation
mange s so let's go ahead and save that
come back here and you serve I'm going
to come back here see if it's loaded or
it's finished loading yet over here and
there we go you can see the font changed
slightly and just to make sure it's
consistent with foundation and it's
integrated we can go ahead over to our
app component HTML and specify some
specific foundation HTML so div class
equals row I'll come on Gary what are
you doing there we go and then inside of
here we can put all right and Row is a
specific class - foundation and we'll
know it works because it won't be
smashed right up against the side of the
browser the ctrl shift I real quickly
see everything is integrated
and if we click on this real quick oops
to get clicked on that let me bring this
down actually if we just click on this
and row we'll see we have row the CSS is
loading from the foundation that we just
installed alright so that is it for this
lesson specifically so hopefully you
learned a lot about just basic
templating and trust me there's a lot
more such as interpolation and pipes and
all that and we're going to get to all
that very shortly so look out for the
