so today I'm going to talk about a real
important topic and that is taking you
know something like view jsr react or
angular and making them search
engine-friendly so in the context of
view Jas by default the default behavior
when you create your app and you upload
it is that no search engine crawlers
will be able to actually see the content
therefore it's not gonna rank in Google
for crap alright so there's two
solutions for this first is what's
called SSR server-side rendering and
then second is pre rendering all right
so in the case of pre rendering which is
what we're going to look at it
definitely makes more sense to utilize
the pre-rendering option if your project
meets the following criteria first there
can't be like a ton of pages in routes
because it will take forever when you
run the npm run build command in order
to compile all of it I second it can't
really be extremely dynamic and rely on
user generated content and also the
content really can't change frequently
so in the context of like a simple
website that you just want to rank and
maybe it's for a personal service of
some sort where you know you're not
going to be updating a ton and it's
relatively simple but you want to be
able to use all the awesome features of
UGS for the front end then pre-rendering
makes sense all right so you'll
understand exactly how this all works as
we start to build this out from scratch
so first two things I just want to
mention first I there's a written
version of this tutorial that you find
at the site the first links here in the
description I'm in the very first line
you can access that in case you want to
the access to all the code of course is
free and then second I'm planning on
using the same exact process to build
out a full project as a part of a course
that I'm going to be releasing probably
within a week to ten days from the
upload date of this video so make sure
you check that out that will also be
linked here all right so let's go ahead
and get started so let me close this out
real quickly
oh but real quick before we
make sure you check out my site course
cetera comm where you're gonna find a
bunch of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost of buying me
like a six pack each month that's it now
also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on alright let's get back to it the very
first thing we want to do is we're going
to use the the view command line
interface or the CLI to start a new
project so first I'm not going to cover
how to install the view CLI if you don't
have it just Google it's very very
simple you're just going to need the
node package manager so view in it and
we're gonna use a a template called web
pack - simple and then we're gonna name
it view - static alright so this is
gonna take just a second and it's gonna
ask us some questions I'm just gonna hit
enter
yes or enter enter enter enter use SAS
and if you want staff support go ahead
and hit Y otherwise I'm gonna hit n
because I'm not gonna be doing any
actual designing here all right so now
we want to CD into it and then we're
gonna run NPM install alright so
basically if you're confused as to what
pre-rendering is I basically what it's
gonna do is you're gonna run a command
called NPM run build and when it does
that it's going to go through web pack
and it's going to be essentially
pre-render it's gonna take all of our
content that's a part of our view
components in our templates and bake it
right into the HTML all right so that
way you upload the contents of the
distribution folder and there you go it
works right out of the gate with all the
awesome view features but these search
engine spiders can in their BOTS cannot
access the content in order to make it
rank all right so this just finished and
now we're going to install the actual
pre-render plugin alright so npm install
all right pre-render SP a plugin we're
also going to install another one called
HTML web pack
plug in and then when I save them both
as as dev dependencies right here all
right so it just finished here let me
clear this out and now what I want to do
is go ahead and also use NPM to install
the view router because we're going to
be setting up routes in order to
demonstrate this plugin and we're gonna
save it just as a regular project
dependency alright great so once that's
all done I'm gonna put in code period
and that's just is gonna launch my
Visual Studio code editor it's free by
the way and here we go alright so we
have our view static project opened up
and the first thing we want to do is
work within our web pack config j/s file
alright so let me increase the size of
this just a bit so you can see it and we
want to add variables for both of the
plugins that we just installed all right
so I'm gonna paste these right here and
by the way I'm simply copying and
pasting the code here because I don't
want to say here and type all this out
from the written tutorial so it has as
you can see all this information that I
was just going through here alright so
next on line 10 we have to change the
public path property from dist just to a
forward slash otherwise when it goes
when we run the NPM run dev command it's
not going to work correctly so next down
here under plugins we're going to be
adding two plugins but which are
basically both of which we just
installed and notice it's all contained
within an if process note inviting
equals production all right so right
here I'm gonna go ahead and just copy
the first one alright so we're gonna say
right here alright so I'm pasting it
right here just beneath this web pack
define plug-in we have our HTML web PAP
plug-in that we already installed
it's simply specifying a template of
index state HTML and then telling where
to place it now so the reason we're
adding this is because the web pack
simple template that we use to generate
this project with the view CLI it does
not include it default in the web
output next we're going to add the pre
renderer plug-in just after it right
here alright so this is where all the
magic occurs essentially so what we're
saying is I we're finding the path of
the distribution folder and then right
here is where we list out all of the
routes that we want to pre render so
you'll have to obviously hand code these
in based on the requirements of your
your website or your app or whatever all
right so we're just gonna have to and
just I you know the basic forward slash
and then also in about under here with
this object here with options we're
gonna add to this in a little bit but
we're gonna keep it like this for now
all right so next we have to create the
routes so this stuff isn't specific to
you know that the pre renderer this is
just we just need to set up the routes
we don't have it set up so the first
thing we'll do is create a folder inside
a source called routes or a router
rather and inside of here we'll create
index j s so we're gonna just paste from
the written tutorial real quickly a very
basic routes file this is actually what
you get when you use a view create
command with the view CLI and very
simple you know we're just importing the
about component and the home component
these two don't yet exist we'll create
them shortly and then we're just
defining a route so we're binding the
the component of home to the name of
home and that will be at the path of
just the route path and then same thing
with about just forward slash about
about component simple all right so
let's save that and next we're gonna go
and create the about top view in home
dot view in the source folder so just
click on a file here in source or source
itself create about dot view and also
home that view and if you wanted to put
these inside of a components directory
instead you could do that alright so the
very first one will say in the home dot
view
just gonna make a template it's not
going to have any logic although it
could but we're not and we're gonna say
div class of home we'll just put in h1
of home and then this is my lovely home
page how awesome so this section right
here is what we want to see when we view
the source when we go ahead to run this
at the very end that way we'll know that
the search engine spiders will be able
to crawl it so let's save that next
we're inside of about dot view I'm going
to do the same thing so about and there
we go div class about about about me
point one two three I decided to put an
unordered list here simply just to
create some different HTML but look at
whatever alright so we'll save that and
then next we want to open up the main
j/s file right here and then we have to
import the router so real quickly let me
just paste in the imports just two lines
which is view router and then also the
router file and second we want to paste
in view dot use router and then right
here simply reference it in the second
argument here router alright let's save
that and then we also need to modify the
app dot view real quickly right here
alright because right now it doesn't
have the router embed right here or a
navigation or whatever so what we'll do
is I'm just going to delete everything
from our unordered list to our h2 and
then I'm just going to quickly paste in
from the written tutorial this stuff
right here so we just have paragraph
router linked home about and then the
router view again all basic stuff when
it comes to routing nothing really
specific to this tutorial all right so
next one tiny little thing that we need
to do is we're gonna go to our
index.html and remove this line number
nine right here the script source equals
distribution build is because when our
plugins run through this it overwrites
this but it will add its own script and
so if you don't remove this you end up
with two script includes and this one
breaks because
that I location of the file doesn't
exist all right so after you're done
doing that I we could theoretically run
this but you wouldn't have any titles
I like page titles in the title HTML
element and of course if you're
concerned about SEL you're gonna want to
do that so before we run this - give it
a test let's go ahead and do that real
quick so let's go back to our web pack
config j/s and here's the options by the
way you can take a look at all the
options that are available by taking a
look at the pre renderer SP a plug-in
website and you'll see it shows all the
options right here and in terms of what
they do this part right here the pros
post process HTML section will provide
you with more information about what we
were about to do right here so what I'm
going to going to do real quick is
simply copy from the written tutorial
paste in right here and options this
section right here so what's happening
is is very simple the only part that you
really need to mind is just the titles
object right here and we have okay first
a path and then the title that we want
to be associated with that path so next
we have an about path so we're going to
say my awesome about page so if this
works when we view the source it will
show the title element in HTML with my
awesome about page when we refresh it
all right so that's basically it
if we did this right then we can now
open up our console find it real quick
and run NPM run build all right so
hopefully this goes without a hitch and
if you get up you're right here see you
see the dist folder has now been created
it's not done yet
all right so now it's done and it's
telling us what files have been created
and we can see them right here so we
have our about directory that's great
index dot HTML alright let's go ahead
and give this an actual try so the way
we need to do is to serve it up on a web
server or a server of some sort so we're
gonna CD into the dist folder and then
we're going to run HTTP server now if
you don't have the HTTP server package
installed globally all you have to do is
type in NPM install HTTP - server and
then - G in that one stalling so once
that's installed hit enter and then
we'll go to our browser real quick
localhost 808 oh all right so this works
we could see we have our ugly HTML right
here and if I hit ctrl shift I with any
luck we have a fav icon that's not
showing up at and not really worried
about that but there should be no other
errors now whether or not this works is
based on this section right here in the
elements so if we open up our div ID app
normally without this pre-render or
plugin it would be empty but now we can
see we have our h1 element and the main
element with for a home component there
we go its h1 home and this is my lovely
home page the search engine spiders
would be able to see this and correctly
index it for the purpose of ranking now
how about about oh by the way we can see
we have my home page up here alright
about it doesn't change when you click
from here but if you refreshed at this
URL
we'll see it does say my awesome home or
my awesome about page so now open up our
elements here and there we go we have
our unordered list and our about so now
at this point all you would do is just
upload the dist folder to a server
somewhere and it would work and so you
would have the benefit of having a few
j/s app and your search engine friendly
content alright guys so hopefully you
enjoyed that again check out the links
here I'm if you're watching this a day
or two or you know a week after I have
upload this I mean I have it ready yet
but I do have a full course that's
planned
we're going to show you this process
except billing out I like a full app
we're gonna touch on every subject
identity design effective layout design
animations etc alright so make sure to
subscribe here if you haven't yet and
I'll talk to you guys real soon alright
