one so I wanted to do a sneak peek video
so this is based on a tutorial that i'll
be releasing either tomorrow or the next
day and it's based on using firebase for
angular authentication and it handles
multiple social providers which you can
easily add more as well as custom email
login and sign up so as you can see I
worked in some really cool animation so
i'll be showing you how to do that along
with error reporting and everything you
basically see here I so right here is a
log ins I'm showing you and it's
checking the credentials of course based
on whatever firebase has in the database
of course this works here in this
example and as you can see i also have a
join now and i made it very simple and
i'll be making this completely available
as well at github so that if you're
perhaps making your own project that
requires authentication you can just
download and integrate this so all right
look out for the tutorial again it'll be
fully written as well as a video
tutorial either tomorrow or the next day
alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
