cetera comm and today we're gonna take a
look at another very fundamental aspect
of angular to development and that is
through property binding and event
binding and these two things allow our
views and our components to communicate
with each other so let's go ahead and
get started gonna switch over to my
desktop I'm at the angular QuickStart at
github repository and I'm gonna come
down here I'm going to take this and
copy it then I'm gonna head on over to
my git bash here I'm in my project
examples folder you can use our go
wherever you want and I'm gonna right
click and paste that in and we're going
to name this simply bindings alright and
we'll go ahead and CD into bindings oops
Bing as I said and then NPM install now
because that takes a little bit of time
I'm going to pause this but first if you
just saw that and you're new to this
series maybe you're accessing this from
Google or YouTube I cover how to install
I angular to project through github in a
previous video in this series to just
look that up if you're confused
what just happened so I'm gonna go ahead
pause and I'll come right back okay so
it's done let's switch back over and
let's type in NPM start and momentarily
your browser should be popping up with
our local host showing our project
alright there it is now let's go to our
code editor and I'm in the project
folder called bindings here in Visual
Studio code and we're going to open up
app and app component TS okay
so the first thing we're going to take a
look at is property binding and this
allows us to send information or data
usually in the form of properties or
methods to the view so let's go ahead
and do that real quickly we'll get
started is I'm going to open up app
component here and I'm going to define a
property name of image URL
equals and we'll open us up in
semicolons I'm going to go ahead and
good images stock Google to grab some
type of image here we'll just type an
angular logo alright and let's go ahead
and see here just use this one so I'm
going to view image and then just copy
this PNG file here and it doesn't have
to be this one it could be anything else
and we'll paste this in okay so the way
this works I'm going to before I get to
that just give yourself some space here
in this template property and I'm gonna
specify an image and the way that's
normally would work is we put in image
source equals and we would simply put in
the URL that we just pasted but
sometimes you want your images to be
dynamic based on the logic that's
occurring here and the component so to
do that what we have to do instead we'll
take this let's just paste that here and
we want to wrap in our attribute source
with brackets alright and inside of here
we reference the property name of image
URL all right so let's hit save and
let's go back to our browser and let me
close these two and there you go it
behaves exactly the same but obviously
in this case the second one it is
dynamic based on coding that's happening
here alright so let's go ahead and
delete this and continue on let's also
show you another way of achieving the
same thing so let's just copy and paste
that and in here we'll just have a
regular source and we'll use
interpolation to define the image URL so
let's save that now as you see it's
refreshed and it shows the exact same
thing now generally speaking you can use
this however prefer to use this
interpolation method when we're dealing
with content that's
in between tags when we're dealing with
a tribute I prefer to use this type of
method which is property binding alright
so let me show you one more
I was about to delete that I'm gonna
show you one more way of property
binding and it's just a difference in
syntax we simply specify bind
- SRC and then you'll see if we save
this we have the same thing looks like
we have an error real quickly one moment
yep that's why you need to get rid of
these braces right here and save and
there we go okay great okay let's try
one more thing with property binding
what if for example instead of passing
through just a property we try passing
through a method well let's go ahead and
try that so let's switch over to our
code editor and over here for this
example let's put in a text box so we'll
specify input and we'll put data binding
or property binding rather around value
equals my method okay
so let's go ahead and define the method
my method so we'll make it something
simple my method and inside here let's
just put some basic logic and we'll
hard-coded in if 1 is less than 2
we'll return hey and then else will
return yo very very simple method so
let's go ahead and save and let's check
out what's happens here all right so
we'll see it has specified hey and
you'll see
if one is less than 2 then it will
return pay okay
so that right there is how property
binding works again it's one way it goes
from the app component here up to the
view now when it concerns event binding
we're sending information usually based
on user input of some sort whether it be
a click a hover or and somebody type
something on their keyboard and sending
it from the view or the Dom to the
component so let's go ahead and take a
look at how that works okay I'm just
going to get rid of these two properties
here and what we're going to do is use
image sources zoom you're going to use
this current one right here and we're
going to attach to it event binding on a
click event so if somebody clicks on the
image then we're going to fire something
or something's going to happen so we'll
just put wrap this in parentheses which
is how event binding works so instead of
the brackets for property binding event
binding is wrapped around these
parentheses equals and here's where we
can reference a method of some sort so
let's just you reuse my method and let's
come down here and let's get rid of the
innards here and let's go ahead and
simply just console.log something so
console dot log and we'll just go ahead
and put in I was clicked let's save it
and we'll go back all right now let's
take control shift I go to the developer
tools go to console tab and let's click
it and there we go we could see right
down here
I was clicked okay now let's say for
example we wanted to pass back more
information that has to do with that
click well we can do it by passing
through an event so we simply specify
event right here in the argument of the
method and we reference it here event
and we'll specify a type of any and then
we can console.log event let's go ahead
and save this let's go back and now
let's click it and we can see we have
this object here and it contains a lot
of information that we can then use in
the component so we could see we have
the target image we have a bunch of
information here most of this of which
you would never use but there's a lot of
information that you can use here ok so
now let's go ahead and show you a
different thing that's pretty much
common when it comes to your apps let's
say for example you want to trigger some
type of code that happens based on a
hover or a mouse over or a mouse out
let's go ahead and take this and this
one unfortunately we don't have a mouse
over event type that we can specify in
the parenthesis what we can use is on -
mouse over so let's put my method - we
can get rid of the event here let's copy
this will make this my method - and
we'll console.log you hovered let's save
it well have two images this time skip
control shift I now let's go ahead and
hover over the second one and there we
go
okay what about Mouse out well all you
have to do is change this to Mouse out
and we'll say you hovered off
exclamation point and save it
and then come over here and let's hover
over nothing's gonna happen however once
we hover off we'll see you hover it off
alright so now let's try something
different what about keystrokes well the
best way to illustrate this concept is
by putting in in a text field so input
and for the event binding will specify
the parentheses key up equals and we'll
just make one a method called user input
and we'll pass along the information
through the event and then we'll specify
down here user input event and this time
it's going to be a string and inside of
here before we get to that section let's
declare a property up here that's going
to be my type equals empty and we'll
specify this will reference it my type
equals event dot target dot value now
just down here let's say for example we
wanted to create just a paragraph tag
that mimics whatever it is or displays
the type that's being typed into the the
box well let's put in our P tags and
through interpolation we'll specify my
type and save it so let's go back now we
see this tech box text box down here
let's go ahead and start typing
now notice right over here and the left
of the screen it works very quickly and
accurately alright and that is basically
how at a very fundamental level event
binding and property binding works so in
the next lesson we're going to take a
look at class binding and style binding
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
