hey everyone Gary Simon here of course
etro now at the very beginning of the
year I really wanted to focus hardcore
on my business which was corset row at
corset or calm and also the Associated
YouTube channel here and so I wanted to
do a video where I recapped everything
from the beginning of this year to this
point which is essentially the end of
the year and so we're going to set this
up in such a way that I broke it up into
four different sections first we're
going I'm going to show you the
different traffic numbers for my website
and then also I'll discuss what I did to
do that in terms of content I'll talk
about how I monetize this and where that
is led and then finally you know how I
did everything that I did and that way
it'll give you ideas when you're trying
to think about you know what you can do
in 2018 to emulate what I've done at
least in terms of growing an
internet-based business all right so I
have this document prepared here and
this is if you follow along before by
the way if you take a look at the
playlist associated with this video
you'll see the other trafficker these I
had these update videos I did and I the
last one I did it'll always a May
so you'll it'll be it should be
interesting to see how you know since
the end in May how things have done you
know compared to then so basically this
right here I've gained uary stats and
this is from the very first video I did
and so this means you know from January
1st to the 31st this is how many
sessions users these two differ in that
you know a user can have multiple
sessions on your site and then
ultimately pageviews and pages per
session I'm not going to go over
everything here in detail but I do want
to just compare real quick just take
just keep your eye on sessions or users
and you'll see how through each month
they've increased quite a bit so we went
from I was just take a look at users so
15,000 users in January 24,000 in
February so you know a 9,000
user increase so 23 to 30 4 in March 45
almost in April so you can see a trend
of about 10,000 per month and then it
jumped up decently here in May I had
quite a bit of an increase so 44 to 67
and now this is where I ended it I
didn't have any more of these updates
until now essentially seven plus months
later and so here is the last 30 days
stats so let's just take a look form to
compare this with May
quite a bit of an increase in the last
30 days compared to the 30 days
beginning in May so the users have gone
from 67,000 to 161,000 the pageviews
jumped up dramatically as well and of
course if we were to compare like our
users 161,000 all the way to 15,000 back
in January huge increase it's about
almost a thousand percent increase so
let's take a look at these different
Google traffic stats because that's
basically we're close to a hundred
percent of my traffic comes from that
reaches my site and the pages on my site
they come from Google and people doing
searches so this right here is the
Google traffic from January 1st to May
30th and then this right here is the
same thing except it's from January 1st
to December 15th so we went from around
165 users you know from Google right
here per day up to 3.6 thousand and this
part ends right around or begins right
around here I think and as you can see
the growth continued on throughout the
year fortunately so yesterday or not
last week rather we had a lot of I hit
my all-time highs in terms of traffic
and this given day was 10,000 636
visitors page views I'm same thing I
steadily just a steady increase of page
views
out January 1st to May 30th and then we
could see that the same thing kept on
pretty much keeping up this huge spike
here is because I one of my articles got
ended up on Hacker News but anyhow yeah
I'm gone from 11000 back in May to
24,000 pageviews
alright so at this point what does all
of the does this really mean yeah it's
it's fun to have a lot of traffic you're
helping people in terms of the content
that's on your site but but ultimately
for me if you can do that but also do it
full-time that was always the goal and I
was not full-time and I haven't been you
know you need to make money obviously to
pay the bills save some hopefully and
let me just show you real quickly the
way we get to this of course in a way we
get the traffic well before I get to
that I just talked about the content
itself
I wrote in' since the beginning of
january 108 written tutorials with 13
courses 8 of which are free and 4 are
their premium courses and we have a
little bit more than app but I wasn't
including 2016 stats so one of the
things again I'll get to this because
this kind of ties in in terms of
monetization and how I did it yeah you
may be wondering why would you make 8
free courses and I'll get to that in a
second monetization so how do I make
money from any of this stuff well we
have Adsense so let me just show you I'm
gonna bring up my site real quick
alright so these are my tutorial pages
is the the tutorial sections where a lot
of the traffic comes from some of the
free courses get a ton of traffic to on
there the actual course page but if I go
to tutorials we'll see I have you know
nine pages there's 12 two tours on you
20 of these and pretty much every single
one I wrote myself so if I click on any
one of these you'll see the ads show up
so this is Google Adsense this is Google
Adsense and there's one more that shows
up here right just after this section we
could also see this little bar that
comes
it's called fancy bar that's a form of
an ad I get paid for
so all that traffic of course is
potentially seeing and sometimes
clicking on those ads and so that's how
you make money that way YouTube ads
program so of course you're watching
here on YouTube you get this annoying
ads the trade-off of course is that
you're watching free content and then
all the courses that I release on course
cetera I also add on udemy and sometimes
Skillshare although that's not a big
moneymaker at all and then also the core
Center Pro memberships Pro memberships
which our subscription base for nine
dollars a month that makes me money as
well so to put this in perspective at
the beginning of the year in terms of
the money I was making again because the
site was released I be I think like mid
2016 I'm more towards the tail and it
was making like four hundred bucks a
month or so not much at all in terms of
you know back in January I have since
been able to increase that multiple
times so the point of which now I could
pay my mortgage I could pay the bills I
can save some money so now I can
officially go full time if I wanted to
have one more course I'm going to do for
another network and so in 2018 that's
when I'm officially considering myself
full-time that is the goal so now you
may be wondering how did I grow you know
the traffic essentially by a thousand
percent or so from January first up to
this point so it really boils down to
two different things first is content
production so for me and this really
just applies to any industry or niche by
the way it doesn't have to be tutorials
where you're teaching people how to do
something it could be literally about
anything in terms of this strategy
content production so if I go let me go
back to my site just do it helps to see
things sometimes this is all content
whether it be the tutorials are the
latest courses if there's a page that
somebody can land on
this is what you call your content in
terms of the content strategy for me is
to write free tutorials and it's also
and I can see all that the type so
there's a lot of work here involved
obviously and I also create a video so
I've an Associated video for this given
topic like an angular 5 electron
tutorial there's also a YouTube video
here sorry
and we could see that I you know you do
this I had 108 of these a lot of work
obviously but that's not enough in and
of itself so you could go out there and
you could write 108 pieces of content
articles two tours whatever but not have
the same success or results that I have
in terms of traffic numbers and that's
because you have to be mindful of
marketing all right so what do I mean by
traditional channels right here well
okay
you have an Associated Facebook maybe a
Twitter a YouTube account I of course
you're going to mention and send a link
out to every new piece of content that
you have that's a given that alone
usually it's not enough to really help
you rank in Google because again Google
is where 95 probably percent of my
traffic comes from you know there's ten
thousand or ten almost eleven thousand
visitors per day coming from you to
Google rather that's not enough you also
really need to be mindful of creating
you know quality content in the hopes
that other web sites will willingly link
to those specific pieces of content and
this is all in the realm of search
engine optimization and this is these
are called generating backlinks or
building backlinks or producing content
that will willingly try to create an
environment where people want to mention
and show and share with others
what you have done all right so that's
goal number one that's the one way you
build those backlinks that way another
way you do is unique viral content
something that's relevant and now this
is extremely difficult creating and
coming up with something that you think
has a potential that could really be
spread sorry a lot throughout I you know
the the different larger media networks
and larger web sites so I did that a few
times successfully and I really think it
was probably one of the ways that I was
able to start building so much traffic
and so let me just show you real quickly
what I mean by this content and I've
gone over this in the past I on these
videos with these reports so if I go to
tutorials here and these weren't
necessary there's tutorials that ranked
all right let me just search here I'm
gonna type in troll all right so it says
hi trilling my kids with Google home and
how you can - this is a video that got
about a hundred and fifteen thousand
views and and most of those came within
two days it was linked on mirrored SEO
UK Daily Mail Co UK I think maybe
Huffington Post SEO UK for her some
reason to co-taught UK's really picked
it up and a bunch of others like
Mashable comm picked it up and when that
happens when Google sees like the other
Googlebot to crawl the sites and your
pages frequently when they see these
other big sites linking to your sites it
tells Google that you must be a trusted
site that they could send and rank
higher for each of the keywords in the
search engine result positions okay I
did this another one how to make an app
to troll your friends that worked well I
let's see what else there is a few other
ones that essentially had large legit
sites linking to pages on my sites and
that is the name of the game essentially
it is content production being
consistent with it every few days of
course
for me it was about every three or four
days although sometimes you know I went
ten days without producing any content
for some reason forget why also either
other days where other weeks were you
know I did content almost every day it
had averaged out to her every three or
four days and also trying to keep the
content quality up you know so you be
mindful if your your your production
quality or if you're just doing written
stuff that you know it's written well
and obviously people are just gaining
value from it outside of that marketing
so just creating the content is not
enough like I mentioned before you
really need to focus on thinking outside
of the box every now and then to try to
create relevant and unique content that
will really have the propensity to be
shared by larger sites and this will
really help kind of jumpstart the the
process of Google being able to trust
you more and more which ultimately leads
to more traffic which ultimately leads
to making money obviously if you're
monetizing it well alright so 2018 I I'm
not going to mention what my goals are
for that I killed my goals here for 2017
fortunately at the began vignette the
beginning of this year I actually had I
think all I wanted to do was make I
don't know I think maybe around 2,000
visitors a day well I have like almost
11,000 now so 2018 I'm gonna do a new
video at the beginning of the year or
discussing what my goals are we'll see
if I reach those all right guys so I'll
be back on creating content real soon I
think I'm coming down with the flu right
now which sucks but I'll see you soon
all right goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
