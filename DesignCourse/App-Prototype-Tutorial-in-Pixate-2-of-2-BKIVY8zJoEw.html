exporting these assets so we'll start
with this screen over here initially so
we'll work ourselves kind of just by
getting this initial content up here and
then the background at the end so what
we'll do is the strawberry right here
these two right here we're going to
merge those so just ctrl e also the
shadow wait one second let's see if we
nope okay so this shadow we're gonna
duplicate that so that we can take this
shadow and this strawberry emerge all
that on to one layer and then we'll hide
that will bring back the lettuce and
these other three layers select all
those take control II and merge those as
well so they're all on one layer okay
and we'll take it doesn't matter which
let's right-click we'll go ahead and
export as and we'll make sure we have
PNG specified with transparency enabled
and then export we'll go ahead and
specify a new folder called assets and
we'll call this here strawberry
wait is that strawberry no it was
lettuce okay all right and then we'll do
the same thing with the let's see here
yeah shadow right there export as and
we'll choose we'll name this one
strawberry all right so then we'll come
here with the logo
select that layer and we'll choose logo
this one over here is going to be menu
yeah that'll work and I'll choose menu
all right and let's go ahead and hide
some of these actually yeah
both these will merge these down there
we go now we can right click and quick
export as PNG and we'll choose this one
we'll call BG alright so just a few more
things over here now when it comes to
this right here there's certain things
that you can achieve like it when it
comes to rectangles or squares you can
in you can make those in pixate by
default so we're not going to include
like this header right or this little
header bar right here or this dark blue
desaturated color right here we're not
gonna include that as a part of the
image so what we'll do is just take this
and by the way this is kind of annoying
me I think the line height here is not
ideal so let me go ahead and adjust that
let's see here 48 60 that's better
there we go okay so what we want to do
is take these layers this one this one
and then this group as well and ctrl e
alright and then we can right click and
just export as and export all and then
we'll choose this one will be most calls
lettuce info I'm not gonna do one
separately for the strawberry it's just
I don't really care about specifying
different you know details for that
alright but then finally all we have is
just this over here so we'll take this
over here and I'm just going to control
left click that'll select everything
although let me see if it selects
outside nope we're good
just go to edit copy merged create a new
document and paste it in and then save
for web it's ctrl shift alt + S + P and
g8 will work just fine for this save
that and this one will be called nav
and wait one second make sure I'm in I
don't think I'm in the right directory
there we go post assets here all right
that's it so that's all of the assets
that we need to include in order to get
everything working now I'm not gonna
save this because I flattened a bunch of
layers so I can always just bring it up
again
there we go and good to go okay
um so now now the fun begins and
actually you know piecing together this
app inside of pixate so let's get this
out here all right so I going to move
this over a bit computers being a little
bit slow because I'm recording so we
need to switch to this tab over here
which is our assets and then we want to
get open our assets folder that we were
just using so these are the assets right
here we're just looking just going to
take all these drag them in here and
there they are so now we can begin to
piece this thing together so we'll take
the speed G and it should fit right in
here
all right and you can use your keyboard
arrow keys to get that lined up as you
need to we'll go ahead and come back
over here we can create a layer right
here and position this this will be the
top bar that we created I switch back
real quick to Photoshop and we'll find
this layer right here double click on it
copy the color code and then come back
and take this color code and just paste
that in hit enter all right and I think
there's a little bit larger somewhere
right around there
and then we'll go get our logo and put
that sucker right here
all right and then also the menu right
around there those so it's pretty
much in the correct area okay all right
so we need to create a new layer right
here and we're going to need to make it
the size of basically the document and
get rid of the fill and we're going to
call this two by double clicking we can
rename it to just let us slide all right
and then inside of it is where we're
going to put our food items so we'll go
ahead and get lettuce and we'll get this
right around it more in the center and
read around there is pretty good now
because I already did this I'm going to
tweak this a little bit to match my
values exactly from before so I'm
putting 281 here and then 125 here all
right perfect and then I'm going to
create a new layer and we're going to
create the bottom container which I
believe comes up right around here one
second and let's switch back to
photoshop to get that color copy that
and paste that in now the size of this
let's see here 480 width of course I'm
going to use 359 for the height and
that's what I had previously all right
get that move back to the bottom all
right and then inside of that we're
going to place our image for the content
which was lettuce info
perfect so now we're going to go back
there I'm going to take this lettuce
info and we want to put it inside of
this new layer seven the new layer seven
is simply going to be renamed to lettuce
info and we'll drag this inside of there
oops and for some reason it's I'm just
giving me a hard time you see there we
go
all right so now lettuce infos inside of
our less info PNG is inside of the less
info up there all right and that's
important because when we go to make
transformations or animations on this
this will automatically follow okay so
now I dis over here
I wouldn't know not that the lettuce
slide we have to put some of our things
inside here so we have little lettuce
that goes inside of there apparently you
can't have a selected there you go also
the this right here also goes inside of
the lettuce slide alright so we have
lettuce and lettuce slide and now what
we want to do real quickly is take this
move it down only shift just to the very
bottom right there and you'll see a red
little line kind of as a guide layer and
I now we're ready to code some logic
into this and get it working just with
this first slide here we're also going
to once we have everything working we're
going to rep or duplicate it and put
things a second slide over here but for
now we need to get this working so first
thing if you have iOS and you're using
this on iOS it allows you to have an
emulator an iOS emulator show up on the
right side of the screen
unfortunately on Windows so I don't have
that they don't have that worked into
the Windows version but regardless of
the version that you have you can use it
with your phone like a live you know
settings so that's what I'm going to be
doing and that's what we want to do at
this point point to see it being you
know once we start to try to
make the interactions and animations
applying to our objects to make sure
they actually work there is a lot of
back and forth sometimes troubleshooting
to try to get things work especially
when you're new to the hub the software
so if you look over here we have devices
we have two different phones I have my
wife's iPhone 6 and then my note 5 as
well and so you'll want to download on
your app the pixate app are on your
phone rather the pixate app and once you
have that and so when you load up the
app you'll see it says I has like a
studio here you can just for me connect
using IP address this is my IP address
it kind of just shows up it gives you
that information right here if you hit
the I and then basically you just hit
connect and you'll see your name there
and then food Z right there all right so
now we can see it's working
nothing works though if we touch nothing
at all so that's what we want to start
coding now all right so let me turn off
my camera there real quick all right so
the first thing we're gonna work with
the first object is this because that's
probably the first thing people are
going to click on or touch or whatever
so when we click on it we need to apply
an interaction so that's going to be a
tap so we take this drag it on here and
now we have interactions is tap then we
have to make it move so we'll drag this
over here oops one second make sure we
have the right thing selected there we
go oh you know what because lettuce
slides at the top it's not letting us I
work with that it's applying it to this
I let it slide over here let me real
quickly just get rid of that sorry about
that
we'll take the let's see here
I'm just gonna drag this out temporarily
this lettuce to the top now with it
selected tap and move okay so for move
what we want to do is where it says
based on its gonna be based on its self
so lettuce based on the tap that's all
you can choose because it's the only
interaction we have and animates we're
gonna leave with duration to find value
and for the condition I just for now
we're gonna leave that blank but we're
gonna put the top it's gonna be from 137
points from the top so it's going to
move up because currently if you look at
the top position which is right here
it's 281 so it's gonna go from 281 to
137 so 137 all right
so now if you were to play this and
watching your phone it would I if you
tapped on it it would just slide up
alright and I did just verify that on my
phone so it does work but that's not
exactly what we wanted to do so now what
we want to do is I I'm gonna change this
over real quick to ease in alright I
don't know why it's not showing me the
values but you know whatever no big deal
and we're going to over here put in a
condition so we're gonna put in lettuce
info dot top equals 853 all right so
let's just subscribe what's happening
here so lettuce info is referring to
this container right here which is a
group all right that's the ID is lettuce
info and what's saying if we come back
here real quick is i if lettuce info top
is equal to 853 as in if it's currently
in this position then go ahead and move
it up we're gonna add another condition
which is by default if this is an if
this will be an else and the else is
what's going to allow us to make it move
back down to the original port portion
down here i so what we'll do is put in
281 here alright so
he's in there we go okay now if you were
to try to play this it wouldn't work yet
because we need to add some logic and
over here on this container down here so
basically with this we need to add just
an animation on it so the animation is
going to be a let's see here a move all
right and it's going to be based on the
lettuce dot PNG right here and it's
based on the tap and for the if value
it's gonna be if the lettuce if snow the
lettuce PNG which is the name of the ID
for they that object equals to 81 then
make this 500 points from the top add an
else and the else we'll put this back to
853 at the bottom oops 853 just hit
enter okay oh also over here I have to
specify 500 all right
testing it on my phone works exactly as
I wanted to so just to show you real
quickly
all right so now that we have that done
we can go ahead and try to get the other
slides in but I did forget one second
that I did also want to add a scale onto
this object also so basically let's see
here it's fine this real quick so we
have a move but we also want to have a
scale added to this so what we'll do is
take the scale right here drag it on and
for scale those settings will be based
on its self here tap we'll need that the
same and we're gonna make this lettuce
info dot top equals 853 alright and this
is going to be scaling it down to 0.8 of
itself for X&amp;amp;Y
add the condition for the else and the
else will be simply bring it back up to
1 right there
all right so I won't show you on the
film but I'm just going to confirm by
testing this perfect
all right so scales down just a little
bit it gives you a nice effect basically
okay alright so now we're going to
duplicate several of these layers
alright so the first one is going to be
the background so that's the BG I will
want this one and the next one will be
we don't want to do the logo or menu but
we do want to have lettuce info also
that'll be replicated and then also
lettuce needs to be put placed back
inside of this group by the way all
right
and yeah so we'll take these two right
here and just select this duplicate
layer all right and I can take real
quick I of my left my right keyboard
arrow and just move these over right
there to the edge and I'm going to take
the BG as well and duplicate that and
start moving that over
let me move this over here and moving
this over as well right there perfect
all right so this over here however
we're going to change this to the
strawberry unfortunately it would be
great if we could just specify the
source of the image but we can't so
we're gonna have to kind of redo this
stuff's so I'm going to delete this and
we're gonna go back to our assets here
and we're gonna take the strawberry and
place it inside and we want this also to
align up to these correct values so 281
was what it was all right I'm going to
make this match as well there we go and
now kind of have to add these
interactions again so we have tap here
and then we also have move in the scale
so move here and also scale okay for the
move again this is going to be based on
itself so it's going to be strawberry
tap this value here is going to be
lettuce hi let's see your info
underscore copy because that's the name
of this one down here and top equals 853
top of this will be oops one second 137
points so 137 enter condition we'll move
it back up to 281 okay and also scale
based on itself strawberry this is going
to be 0.8 0.8 as well
condition up here same thing 8:53 else
one okay so now we would need to make
sure these assets are also inside of
this slide right here so I'm going to
get this put that in there these both as
well are in there so that needs to be
there that's good so now we click on
slide and we have to add a scroll on to
it so we take the scroll add it to slide
and also change
let's see where it's at paging mode to
paging and this will work if we switch
back and forth but I forgot one last
thing we have to change this here some
of the values here so this has to change
from lettuce PNG to strawberry PNG
alright and that should be good notes in
one second just forgot right there this
has to be changed to strawberry right
there alright that's good the scale
wasn't working that's because I didn't
put top right here all right and hit
enter let me take a look on my phone
real quick perfect so now all that works
the final thing we have to do is just
add in the nav over here so we have this
nav we're gonna add it right over here
just like that alright and what we want
to do is with that selected we're gonna
give it two different interactions a
drag and a tap so slide this drag just
lie the tap alright and so it says move
with drag it's gonna be based on nav and
let's just go ahead I'm going to name
that
to NAV all right so it's based on nav
drag position and horizontal all right
so for the min position I'm going to put
in 480 all right
so now over here we take this menu let's
drag this up and for the menu we're
going to give it a tap interaction so we
drag this on to the tap all right and
also click back on to here and give it a
move animation so for the move animation
the values that we specify here is based
on menu the tap and what we put is for
the left we'll shoot it over to 140
points will choose spring I'm gonna
change some of these as well to spring
just because it's a busy very
interesting animation so here it'll do
spring ok so I'm off screen real quick
just going to test this out and I was a
little bit off on this location here and
so I've changed this value from I think
it was 130 or something like that or 140
to 180 all right all right so I'm going
to turn on my camera just to show you
the full product here the finished
result
all right cool stuff all right so I hope
you enjoyed that I learned a lot about
this new application that I think is
great pixate so yeah make sure you
subscribe here if you enjoy this
tutorial and I'll see you next time
all right goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
