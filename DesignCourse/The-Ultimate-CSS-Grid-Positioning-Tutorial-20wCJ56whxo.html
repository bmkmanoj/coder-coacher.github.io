hey everyone Gary Simon here of course
etro and I am an idiot because I just
recorded this tutorial and I we ran out
of disk space and it said free some up
first and then hit resume but I hit
cancel instead so I had a twenty five
minute tutorial that I just completely
deleted voluntarily by myself so we're
gonna redo it okay here I go I'm gonna
try to make it better this time first if
you've been wondering where the hell I
been
I've just finished up my last course
requirement I'm still gonna be pumping
out videos left and right make sure you
subscribe here and so yeah we're gonna
focus on positioning using the CSS grid
today and it is awesome it is simple and
it solves a lot of problems and there's
no hacks it just works so that before we
begin I'm gonna set up just a very quick
little dev environment so that we can
have automatic browser reloading when we
save files it'll make it easier on me
when I teach you so
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it
now also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on all right let's get back to it first
make sure you have no js' you can check
it out if you note v in the command line
if that does not show up make sure
you're gonna know dead nodejs dot org
download it install it default options
reload your browser or I mean your
command line and then you'll have it so
let's go ahead and make a directory CSS
aligned now let's call it grid align
grid
align and after it makes it let's go
jump into it with grid align all right
so MPM an it to create a package.json
file we use the live flag to answer yes
to all those and then our just an or
enter rather and then let's go ahead and
install gulp and browser sync and we'll
save it as a dev dependency in the
package.json file and of course gulp is
just a JavaScript task runner it's very
popular and it's going to run this
browser sync task once we tell it
momentarily so I'm just gonna wait for
this to install and come back oh and
also I use visual visual studio code
it's a free code editor made in electron
by Microsoft it's a very popular a lot
of people use it I like it and
momentarily I'm going to type in code
and a period which will launch the
visual studio code app for me in the
directory so that's handy alright so
let's go ahead and do the obvious stuff
index.html we're going to need that so
we're gonna write our HTML you don't
have to do this part let me just do this
real quick
oops wrong way these are settings here
that I have disabled but I want to
re-enable them real quickly so that I
can type exclamation point hit enter and
there's our HTML boy oh boy a Laprade
real quickly we see these things kind of
just I make life a little bit harder
when I'm recording alright so let me get
that down okay let's call this CSS grid
and then we're going to I'm just gonna
copy and paste this include our CSS main
dot CSS file by the way if you check the
description here on YouTube or any other
network there's a written version of
this tutorial so you can see all the
code then if I happen to copy and paste
something okay
so let's save this let's go ahead and
create a CSS folder with a CSS file of
main CSS empty for now and then finally
a gulp file j/s gulp file j/s okay so
this is probably the last time I'm going
to copy and paste something so from the
written version of this tutorial find
this little section and paste that in
we're just importing our you know golf
and browser sync that we installed here
and then we created a task called sync
where we start a browser and then we
also watch for any HTML file or CSS file
in the CSS folder and if they're changed
or saved then we reload the browser very
very simple stuff so let's go back to
our command
I will type golf and sink alright so off
the on the side of my screen we have our
blank empty
let's see HTML file here so oh by the
way I'm going to sprit split screen this
so we can see what's happening in the
code editor as we code alright cool so
the very first topic I'll discuss is how
to Center something both horizontally
and vertically and just we'll talk about
one item alright so let's get rid of
this let's go to index.html
alright so for the HTML it can be very
simple we're gonna say div class equals
container inside of here we'll say h1
sorry
we'll say my content and then we'll also
put a paragraph I'll say my paragraph
content right here okay whatever okay so
when it comes to the grid the CSS grid
you have to have a great container of
some sort so one of your elements in the
HTML has to be the container for the
grid rows and columns I when it comes to
the body tag is the very first tag that
can be a grid container and that's what
we're gonna use so our very first or one
and only grid item is this div class
container right here all right so let's
go ahead and think about that and real
quickly okay I lied this is last time
I'm gonna pay something I'm just gonna
have some body HTML margin:0 height
hundred percent change the font whatever
not a big deal so let's go ahead and
define the actual grid container which
is the body tag display grid simple
awesome now how many rows do we have we
have one right so let's go ahead and
define that grid template rows and we'll
say Auto we have one row you can specify
multiple rows by putting other values in
here but we obviously don't have that
now and so how do we let's just first
let's save this and if I control shift
ID to be an inspector we'll see that we
do have a grid container see the little
dashed line the outline that
grid bro awesome okay so how do we line
this thing to the center well first
before I get to that I want to more
easily allow ourselves to visualize what
this container looks like so let's go
ahead and put container background light
gray okay so this is what the grid
container looks like it's the other grid
item rather it takes up the whole thing
so let's go ahead and try this we're
gonna put in justify items and center
ooh look at that all right so let's put
a line items as well and make that
Center would you look at that this looks
just too messed up for me so let me real
quickly put in border-radius ten pixels
and then padding one am not armed all
right there we go so that's how you
absolutely position a single row a
single piece of content in the browser
dead freakin simple it's awesome all
right so let's go ahead and focus on
another use case let's say for instance
we want to we wanted to Center multiple
items so we only have one grid item here
let's go ahead and copy this paste it a
couple more times
there we go I don't know why all it
shifts those over all right so let's
also real quickly give these IDs so item
one is here
and we'll say two and three okay cool
all right so right now they're all
centered but they're stacked on top of
each other in rows what if we only want
to have one row but three columns all
right so this is where you need to
adjust right here not adjust but add a
columns property so grid template
columns we're going to say auto auto
auto right because we have three of them
now if we save this there we loop wrong
one there we go now a better way and a
quicker easier less verbose way of
saying auto auto auto which is very
repetitive we can say repeat it's a
function so in the first argument is the
number of times we want to repeat this
value here Auto
same thing all right awesome okay so
right now we've dealt with or so far
we've only dealt with aligning all grid
items in the grid container so whatever
we set justify items and align items too
and by the way these are aligning on the
the column and row axis or in other
words horizontal and vertically I it's
been applying whatever whatever value
here it applies to all them what have we
wanted to align differently each one of
these individual items well okay so
that's where first we have to have some
way of communicating the names of these
rows or these columns as well the
easiest way to do that there's really
there's two different ways right now
each one of these these auto auto auto
they have what are called implicit names
the means it's implied already we don't
have to state it and they're numbers so
the the first auto or the first column
is 1 the next is 2 next is 3 and then we
can reference those in the actual the
IDS of 1 2 item 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 with the grid
columns
star and grid roasts are great column
end and row column and it's I personally
don't like it I like using this second
method which I'm going to show you here
we're gonna use or define rather a grid
template areas property and we're going
to say the first column is item one and
then the next will be item two item
three you can call these whatever they
just happen to be the same names as the
IDS that has nothing to do with it in
HTML so now we've named each one of
these okay and the way we will go about
referencing them now is to create item
one and then the way you tie these up or
you assign this name to a for instance
this one right here
well we create a rule set for the ID
that's on this HTML and we say grid area
item one alright so now let's remove
this because these properties won't work
together we'll say instead of justify
items we're going to say because we want
to do one justify self and any it
accepts the same for potential values as
well as these ones up here that we had
they all accept the same potential
values which are start/end Center and
stretch alright so we'll say end and if
we save this real quickly I did
something wrong I think I did grid area
yeah something's wrong one moment this
is ID of item one justify self is n let
me try a line self
okay there we go that makes a little bit
more sense sorry about that I need to
scale this down the browser a little bit
because we're working on a lower res and
we could see now that based on let me
put the start here if we change this to
start it's gonna it's gonna push all the
way up to here yep there we go
so I justify self is saying push it to
the end over here if we change this to
start we'll see it'll go to the very
left awesome
so now let's experiment with this a
little bit further me back up it's gonna
be NN start we'll copy this and then
paste it two times two and three and
then two and three we match these up
respectively again the idea is to have
nothing to do with these names and let's
try making this one start so I'll be
over here now they're touching each
other because this is end and this is
start and then which also change this
one to align itself and that align it to
the very bottom sweet and then finally
this wine was just try Center in both of
these there we go
so that is alignment in a nutshell like
I said it's these four properties two of
them you know justify self is for
aligning a specific grid item and
justify items is placed in the grid
container and that while lying there
that will line all those items and then
same thing with align self
and aligned items they all accept like I
said the same four values so let's go
ahead and I really believe in muscle
memory so let's try to get some more
experience with this I'm going to delete
everything right here except for that
initially CSS and then also delete all
this stuff let's say we wanted to create
like a a two row layout where there's a
bunch of content up here and then a
footer so how would we absolutely align
a footer to the very bottom in this
context and we're gonna build on this
too we're gonna add a sidebar and stuff
but let's just art with this for now div
class we'll say we'll call content here
is
my content and then we'll say footer oh
geez I did the same thing last time
voter footer will say this is my footer
bar okay cool
get rid of that and say very simple HTML
we're working with here okay so now
let's go ahead again our Greek container
is gonna be the body again so grid or
display rather display grid and we're
going to also want to put margin:0 and
then we're going to say grid template
rows okay how many rows do we have again
two alright so the first one we want to
take up all of this available space so
we're gonna put Auto and then the second
row we don't want it to be very tall
we're just gonna say fixed value of 50
pixels alright so if I save this there
we go
this is so easy so I control should I
let's look at this there's the top row
here's the bottom row okay
now next I do want to use grid template
areas to name them and again we don't
have to do this it's still going to work
up here we'll call it content and this
is going to be footer but we're gonna
need this momentarily so let's just save
this again nothing's going to change we
simply just named these two rows right
here so let's also reference our content
and we tie it up how grid area property
with the name content and let's Center
this thing so justify self is Center and
then align self is Center as well tada
freakin awesome now let's go ahead I'm
just going to copy this
we also have our footer the name is
footer as right here and then just so we
can see the whole thing
let's just put background color light
grey and give it some padding of 10
pixels there we go
stays there stays put awesome okay so
let's try adding a sidebar to this thing
like over here how would we do that well
we first need the markup so we'll use in
a side element we'll use an unordered
list for a menu you're going nowhere
home shift alt and down arrow key will
replicate the line I only want it four
times we'll just name this about
services and contact okay so it saved
that now it's going to mess up because
we don't have the proper row and column
structure now because now we have two
columns are gonna have a column here for
the sidebar and then the column here
which is going to hold the my content in
footer so let's see if you can figure
this out grid template columns will say
like 20% of the left of the browser and
then auto alright this stays the same
but this has to change though so we'll
change this to sidebar because what do
we want in terms of the column structure
it's a sidebar right there and then our
content we also have to adjust this we
can just say we can repeat footer if we
want the footer to go all the way across
so we'll save it all right so it's a
little hard to visualize because if we
don't have a background here so let's
reference that aside no just one e and
then we'll say grid area sidebar because
that's the name we gave it and then
background color gray
look at that
now how would we for instance what have
we wanted this Aybar to come all the way
down here we don't want it to just end
on the top well
you literally have to change just like
one line it's so simple
sidebar sidebar BAM
so so so so so easy so as you can see
when it comes to alignment it is super
simple I with the CSS grid I that's the
way it should have been for the last 20
freaking years right so yeah hopefully
you learned a lot it even becomes a lot
funner when you work with media queries
let me just do a quick example let's get
a media query going down here and we'll
say media screen and max-width 39.9 blah
blah blah this is basically saying
smartphone size so anything inside of
here will be applied to a viewport
that's consistent with like a smartphone
and let's say for instance for some
wacky reason we wanted to change the
order or structure of we wanted to flip
these we wanted the the footer up here
and the content down here how do you do
that it's dead simple it's copy the body
rule set we're going to get rid of all
this stuff because we don't need that to
be redefined and it's literally as
simple as this footer can go here and
then content and go here save it
look at that we can watch the transition
between these before you know as we go
from around 40 EMS to that so as you can
see super flexible super awesome I
hopefully you learned a lot so yeah make
sure if you like this to check out
course tetro comm and also subscribe
here I'll be seeing you a lot more
frequently all right good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
