calm today we're going to be doing the
review for the design challenge number
12 GUI toggle switch in design but first
before I continue on with a quick
reviews check out design course calm /
premium it's going to be able to help
you ultimately become a awesome designer
through three different products which
are going to expand shortly first one is
mentor just one-on-one design training
with me visual identity design course of
his ID which helps you design like a
company's brand identity their visual
identity and also wise manner which is a
photo shop banner maker so pretty soon
I'm going to be extending this to
website design as well and some quick
photoshop and illustrator fundamentals
course and also a third one or fourth
one will be mobile app design so check
that out alright so let's get started
here so essentially we're looking for
toggle switch designs and these are just
some examples that I gave and on/off
states and so let's see what you guys
came up with and by the way I didn't
really check any of these out before
doing this so I'm going to be winging it
alright so this first entry is from on
Nolan and he's going for a minimalist
design and this is it I cool that you
showed it in the settings kind of show
how it might look did a couple other
variations I yeah it's very simple I
there's good white space I the only
thing I would say the only thing I would
teak be is maybe I try to make the
emphasis on you know what is I draggable
a little bit more like right now this
kind of competes with it I would maybe
scale down just a tad bit or think of
another way to try to you know in terms
it's in design theory it's called I
visual hierarchy right now it kind of
feels like they're one in the same in a
way in terms of their prior priority in
the design so I other than that I like
it very good all right Soren from two
weeks ago and
ardis very cool I gif animation that we
have here I so yeah let's see this okay
so this is just a different color
variation this one is changing from I on
off like a different color yeah i mean i
like both of them I very simple I think
I yeah this works well I I'm not sure if
I would use like a blue color to depict
the off-state only because no I'm just
trying to it's kind of confusing I'm
like looking both of these at the same
time yeah I just might make the color
for the off state may be a lot more d
saturated just to kind of denote that
it's off like whatever function a
teacher currently is it's you know it's
in an off state we can kind of be able
to tell right away other than that no
everything's good contrast as good
colors good I and in white space and
such so good entry all right Alexander
alright so again this is a little bit
more graphical which is perfect I I like
you know the attention to the details
and you know when it comes to using
those different Photoshop layer styles
effectively this would definitely be an
effective way to use things like drop
shadow or outer glow as you can see
there's an outer glow placed on here but
it makes it look realistic eye gets
inset into here so I like that I know if
maybe the same gripe I have with this
and maybe it's just an issue with me is
the off state is bright and I you know
it's almost sticks out a little bit more
so than the on state so maybe a
different color or different saturation
perhaps but yeah I like that it's a good
entry alright so let's see here if I
were to showcase these I it seems like
there's not a ton of
a difference between the background and
the toggle switches themselves now this
is just a minor thing you can still see
them I but they do kind of get lost and
they might even more so if they were
shown that you know an actual size that
they might be used I you come out here
you can't really it's kind of hard to
see him so I would try to increase the
contrast I either by decreasing or
lightening the background rather um in
that way they would stick out a little
bit more I would also say the same thing
with the the draggable button portion of
the toggle switch I would just make
these inner blue in red portions thicker
so that you could see them a little bit
better all right so yeah other than that
I like it I good usage of the layer
effects just a couple things in terms of
contrast and just visibility alright so
this one we have entirely different type
of entry this is more like a flat design
and so this is from jazz ID 23 I'm so
just looking at this I are you serious
no I don't want to upgrade to Windows
8.1 remind me later alright so anyhow
looking at this it's a tad bit confusing
in terms of I you know how it might be
used I I'm trying to think about this um
so you know this is the on states
currently on and are you supposed to
drag this button over to the right and
then on this date will be off I guess
just kind of confusing because I on the
on state you have this darker blue color
but in the off state you have this
lighter blue color over here and there's
I I don't know it's just kind of
confusing in that regard maybe I'm
overthinking it otherwise in terms of
design I I'm not entirely too sure about
the little corner fold here I think that
made just kind of get in a way I but
either way aside from that color
contrast white space all that is good oh
thanks for the entry alright so here's
another one I be peace and
tana 16 years old all right all right so
this is pretty simple I in terms of
these type of toggle switches okay the
only difference here of course is the
color here is being changed on the text
I what I like it did an approach that I
kind of would prefer over this I is
instead of using the same color here I
would try to come up with a way where
you know you're using something like a
black for instance that way when these
are paired up with each other you can
really tell which button as a whole is
lit up which is on as opposed to this
where we kind of have everything is just
the same and in terms of you know just
glancing at everything first without
even reading it you don't know what is
on or off based on the colors and the
shading and whatever so I would keep
this for the on and then either do maybe
desaturate this off right here or try to
come up with some way to make it very
evident right off the bat you know what
is on and what is off just based on the
design along other than that that's good
all right first time doing a design
challenge okay so I when it comes to
using these like the bevels and the
inner shadows and all this stuff I I
definitely would prefer an approach
that's or an overall aesthetic that's
similar to say for example something
like this I if I were you do disturb TV
I would what I would do I would try to
recreate a design like this from scratch
using your layer styles which this is
all mainly layer styles there's probably
just one maybe two three four different
layers here but there's other five but
there's a lot going on in terms of those
layer phy layer styles so I because as
as it's done here it kind of looks just
a little bit generic and not to be an
ass or anything I but it seems like you
could definitely
get a little bit more out of customizing
and fine-tuning the layer styles if you
want to go through this type of approach
I other than that I do like the colors
used you get to the Finley tell green
you know and is go red is bad you know
or off or stop so you've got that right
so that's good all right i'll continue
on here galaxy 85 all right brain and
brain okay so the idea here is to switch
the brain on or off so you can clearly
tell this is kind of what I was alluding
to in several of the other previous
entries about you know using color I in
contrast to depict about what is on and
what is off so this does that well the
only thing I kind of think takes away
from the design is maybe the the big
drop shadow here and I the outer glow
and maybe the type right here with the
inner inset inner shadow rather but I
but looking to chat these specifically I
yeah in terms of knowing what is on was
off they definitely work so good entry
like Gloria all right so I guess that's
shown on an off state I kind of meant to
like duplicate this and then show the
version where it would be off I haven't
said that does this look like it's a
little bit pixelated right here as if
you scale it up so try to make sure that
you know when you're displaying your
graphics even if it's just for a silly
design competition like this or gore
challenge I that you don't scale up your
raster graphics otherwise the it'll
result in pixilation but yeah because
there's not a second one for me to view
this here it's a little bit difficult
for me to really judge I like the
simplicity of it and there's good white
space and the contrast so you've done
that well mxv design all right so all
right hope it's good enough it's not
good enough no I'm just kidding no I
actually like this I again like I was
alluding to before using color to really
I you know depict which is on in
a quick manner this is very good so I
like to do saturation here you can tell
this is on I like the chrome effect here
too that's done well there's just
basically a 1 pixel inner stroke with a
or outer stroke I with a gradient in the
middle here with two different colors or
three different color Pickers
essentially so yeah I like it good job
no slen alright your second challenge
like a yearly all right yeah and again
this is simple I you can tell what is on
and off I like that so yeah not too much
I have to say about this i think they a
little bit too fat for these this area
for my liking I in terms of height but I
again that's not a really too much of a
big critique there oh that's good
alright so Ram raw all right see I don't
know if these these aren't considered
using a check mark a bullet yeah these
would not be considered I toggle
switches so these would be checkboxes so
I other than that it looks good but I
yeah and below okay here's mine again
ultra-simple I i would probably I mean
you're going to go this route I would
probably ditch there I could see this an
outer glow hear of a doc of a darker
shade I would probably ditch that arm
and it looks like the off and on or just
at a bit too big and crammed in here a
little bit I the on looks good but the
office is kind of on the why it's just
sticking out i can look larger and
there's not much margin or white space
between these elements they kind of just
really stick out a little bit too much
for my liking i rather than that you
know when i have a design that's
submitted that's so simple like this
then and I there's not too much I can
say because it is so simple I but thanks
for the entry alright so macoris alright
one no glow and one with glow alright
alright so this would all right so I i
would probably when it comes to this
gradient that you have applied here
I would probably maybe not make this one
so I so light and then this one so black
at the end maybe try to find a little
bit like more of a middle ground between
this two but in terms of depicting what
is on and what is off without any labels
here you're kind of I I mean just having
it presented you know like it is right
here you're kind of stuck not knowing
what really is on and what really is off
I assuming there might be a glaybels on
the top or something and that way you
would be able to know but I yeah aside
from that we looked at the glow version
I think I definitely like this version a
little bit better the glow is not too
evident here so it kind of just makes it
look blurry in my opinion but other than
that yeah I would again I would go back
up to a couple the other entries that
really use the layer styles well not to
say that this is bad or anything but i
think the gradient could use some work
and i also maybe you know conveying what
exactly is on and off you know just by
looking at the switch here all right and
then my favorite user name Peter we
have my attempt alright so I'm not too
certain what's happening here because I
usually have a toggle switch your
toggling something moving back and forth
I and so essentially this seems like
more like a like a custom graphic check
box almost or an on and off button I
instead of something that's toggling
back and forth in some way shape or form
I so having said that the color almost a
little bit too much contrast especially
against this gray background kind of
clashes right here I but yeah thnkx for
the entry again it's a real simple entry
so I can't really give too much feedback
all right guy wold hi guys news here
blah blah blah well for minimalism okay
so I yeah I wouldn't exactly say this is
to minimalism you have a lot of lot
going on here in terms of this I the
button um so I would assume that you
know the red portion means it's off and
then the green is on so you can kind of
tell I would definitely go with this
though with this you have the the the
very like the one pixel stroke then you
have another like three or four pixel
stroke going around here just a little
bit too cluttered for my in my opinion
you could probably simplify this as well
because there's a lot lot lot going on
there especially if this were to be
viewed at a smaller size I or scale that
down might just get a little bit too
crazy going there so I would eliminate
maybe one or two of those fears in there
and then be effective all right so Cesar
acra all right thank you for the late
last challenge feedback okay here is his
entry so this is so let's see here yeah
i would probably maybe try to work with
this a little bit more to make it a
little bit more evident um just because
i want to look at these I mean yeah you
can tell what's on and off but there's
not too much of a difference and it's
also not really what I would consider a
toggle switch type of designs because
the only thing that's changing here is a
color and there's no movement in the
design between on and off aside from
just brightening up the green so you
have the idea of using color right but
in terms of form I would try to work
with some of the other ideas all right
that is it and what kind of quick I yeah
so I think the thing to remember about
working with toggle switches is really
to use color and form in order to create
very noticeable and instantly
recognizable I depiction of what is
currently if the feature is currently on
or if it's currently off I so this is a
great example this is a pretty good
example I this is
a pretty good example as well this is
just an over top if you know example but
I I think I you know if you watched
everything we saw a pattern develop you
know about what kind of constitutes is
being effective in terms of toggle
switch design and be able to know you
know immediately by looking what is on
and what is off and that's basically
through color and form as we have here
this is a this is a real good entry I
like this one so yeah hopefully that was
helpful for some of you hopefully I
didn't piss anyone off but yeah I be
sure hey guys if you haven't yet trying
