calm today we're not going to do any
design I basically need your help I as
some of you know I've been working
pretty hard on completing a visual
identity design course and I'm going to
be releasing that it's not going to be
free it's not going to be too much money
though on design course calm and so I
have a decent portion of it finished and
I'm looking for feedback basically so
the videos that I'm going to show are
the beginning of the course and they
don't actually get into any design work
they actually go over just general
principles and they're only about about
10 I think to 15 minutes max combined so
it take not very much of your time so
I'm just looking for feedback basically
so if there's any thing that needs
changed in an obvious sense I i will
know it'll be able to make it better and
also for your participation in this I i
will give you the course for free so i'm
going to limit it probably to about 10
people so if you can just leave a
comment here on youtube I and let me
know that you're interested I will send
you a message on YouTube with the link
where you can begin to look at the video
so I for those of you interested and
willing to help thank you very much and
tomorrow we'll get back into design work
and so I'll see you then all right
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
