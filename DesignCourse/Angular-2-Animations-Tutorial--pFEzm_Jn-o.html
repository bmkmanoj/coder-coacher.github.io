and today we're going to take a look at
angular 2 animations and you're really
able to handle just about any type of
animation through any type of property
that you can imagine so you can handle
opacity you can animate position as well
as size all right so let's go ahead and
start off like we always do we're going
to start by creating a new angular 2
project we're going to use the quick
start method up here and github so just
going to scroll down and copy this line
right here and then in the terminal I'm
going to go ahead and specify paste here
by right-clicking and choose a project
title such as my - animations alright
we're going to CD into my animations and
then specify NPM install all right so
because this takes a little bit of time
going to pause like always and I'll come
back ok it is done now so let's go back
here and then specify NPM start and
we'll go to our browser here and it's
going to load up a new window or tab in
this case with localhost 3000 and here
it is it's up and running ok so now what
I want to do is real quickly just get a
copy of foundation running and we're
going to use a CDN and foundation by the
way is a CSS front-end framework we're
not going to use it hardly at all I just
want to create a real quick simple two
column layout and this will help us do
that very easily without writing too
much or any CSS regarding the matter so
I just googled foundation CDN and we'll
use this top one right here so I'm going
to copy that and then open up your code
editor I'm using Visual Studio code and
in our project that we just created from
the command line we're going to head
over to index.html and then just above
the link rel stylesheet we're going to
add another one sheet and href equals
and paste that in there and then save it
and then we reload you'll notice that
the font changes and that means that
angular
not angular my foundation rather is up
and running affecting the CSS okay we're
going to work here in just our single
component so it's open up our app folder
and then go to app component TF as usual
if you've been following along with this
series and the very first thing we need
to do when we're working with animation
is import some additional members from
the angular core so the ones that we're
going to be adding we're just going to
separate by commas and so to make things
a little bit more readable if you wish
you can put these on separate lines so
down here I'm going to also put trigger
state style transition animate and then
keyframes and that should be good let's
go ahead and save this and then we're
going to write as usual inline HTML as
well as CSS and as well as animations
once we get to that point so we're just
going to give ourselves a couple lines
here to work with and I'm going to get
rid of the hello angular and we're going
to put in div class equals row and this
is a foundation specific class and then
inside we're going to create two columns
so div class equals columns and then
we'll copy and paste this one right here
and inside of there on the Left column
we're going to put in a button so I'm
going to put button here and for now I'm
not going to put anything by any type of
attributes inside of it just yet press
me for animation and then close it and
then over here we're going to put a div
ID we're going to make this content and
in a future we will add additional
attributes here and then just look
at me animate and that's closing div
right there so we're gonna have a button
here and once it's pressed we're going
to add some animation on this div right
here so simple enough let's go ahead and
save that and let's put in a comma here
and let's add in our styles so it's
opening up in brackets put in our back
ticks which is the key just to the left
of one this allows us to put multi-line
CSS same thing up here as well and in
the Styles lets go style our button we
just need to give it a larger font size
so button and we're going to put in font
size 1.8 a.m. and then after this let's
also reference to the Content ID so
content and we're going to put in just
padding 30 pixels and then also look at
a background color of 6 e so ee e PPP
okay so let's go ahead and save this and
now let's go ahead and look at our
browser to see what it looks like and
this is basically what you should have
going so far we click it of course
nothing happens alright so let's go back
here and now let's attach a binding to
our button so this is going to be an
event binding and it's going to be based
on a click so we're going to wrap this
around parenthesis equals and we're
going to specify a method called toggle
move and end it with air the quotes and
let's go ahead and define that down here
so this will be toggle move and
and right now since console.log clicked
so we'll save that and make sure is
refreshed and we'll hit control shift I
just to get up our console and clicked
ok so now how do we make this right here
animate based on this being pressed well
to do that what we want to do is go
ahead and in our HTML for div id content
remember this is the div that or the
HTML element that we want to animate so
what we need to do is wrap here in
brackets at and then we have to give
this some type of name that we're going
to reference here and our animations
information over here so let's just name
this focus panel and then Eagles and
then we're going to make it equal state
now this could also be something
arbitrary you can name whatever you wish
however you have to use it correctly
later on in your coding as well alright
so we'll save this and we have to
declare a state down here in our app
component we have to define it so what
we want to do is specify state it's
going to be a type of string equals
inactive now bear with me a little bit
confusing so far you'll see how this all
comes together
now let's specify our animations so down
here we'll put in animations and what we
want to specify is brackets and inside
here all of your animations will be
contained within this object and what we
want to do the way you start off a given
animation is through trigger now
remember we imported trigger up here so
trigger and then for the arguments
we have to specify a name of some sort
in this case it's going to be focused
panel that we used earlier so focus
panel and then we put in a comma and we
open up in brackets this is where we
enter and use state all right state will
define the current essentially the state
that it's in so we'll open this up in
parenthesis and we can give this a name
of inactive notice we reference this
here so we're setting when the app
component loads the current state of
this div right here as being inactive
and in here we define what exactly
inactive means in terms of its Styles so
we put a comma and then we specify style
and then we open it up parenthesis and
curly braces and inside of here this is
where we can put in some CSS properties
a or as well as transformation and
movement properties so let's go ahead
and just put in transform and scale 1:1
means whatever its default size
currently is all right now let's also
put in a comma here and define another
state so state this is going to be
active and we're going to put in a comma
and then specify style parenthesis and
curly braces let's go ahead and just
copy this real quick and then we'll put
1.1 and you can put in any value you
want really you can make you go smaller
or larger okay and then after that we're
going to put in our transition function
which is specified right here so
transition and we're going to put in
inactive to active animate
which is another member that we included
and that's going to be let's say a
hundred milliseconds we're defining the
length and also the type of animation
ease in and then a comma here let's just
copy this and then paste will go from
active to inactive then we can also
define these parameters as we wish right
here so I'll just leave them the same
except this will ease out okay so let's
go ahead and save that and then we will
come down to our app component class and
right now we're just console logging so
what we need to do is change the state
as we need it to be so this is going to
be a toggle so we're going to tie
specify this dot state which is in
reference to this property here equals
parentheses this dot state in active if
inactive then we put a question mark
active inactive so let's go ahead save
that and let's go ahead and look at our
browser and hope it works so let's click
it and there we go so you notice how
it's very smooth and it's basically
toggling this animation so let's take it
a step further and let's add a second
property to animate so in state we can
define let's just say a background color
background color make this EE and then
we'll copy this and let's just set it to
a different color and how about CFD 8dc
so we'll save that and you'll see how it
changes to kind of like a darker blue
similar to this right here it's default
from a mod
the styles that we have defined here
right here the colors that they're using
okay so going further let's say for
example we wanted to show this here once
we load the component here or the
project we want this to animate in
automatically so there's a variety of
reasons why you would ever want to do
that I once your app loads or component
loads you want things to animate in well
this is one such way of achieving that
okay so what we'll do is come up here to
our HTML and on our div ID here this is
what we want to animate in we're going
to add brackets at move panel and this
is where we're going to create a second
trigger called move panel and equals
state and we're just going to reuse this
property here so we'll save this and
then we want to define that second
trigger so we'll come down just after
after this trigger make sure we're
inside animations and we have our two
brackets here we're going to put in a
comma and just to make my life a little
bit easier we'll just copy this and then
paste it and then we'll call this move
panel and this time we're going to use
something different than just state or
inactive or active we're going to use
something called void two and then an
axe asterisk and that basically means if
we're going from the element not being
present currently to being present then
we'll follow or we'll make the animation
that we're about to define occur so
let's go ahead and put in transition so
we've not not going to use a state here
so transition we're going to put void to
all and then we're going to put in
brackets and inside of there we'll put
in style transform and then translate
why because we want it to come from the
top of the browser then down open up the
parentheses and put in negative 100% and
then a comma and then animate for we'll
say 100 milliseconds so let's go ahead
and save that all right and you see how
it came down let me just refresh this
and then there we go and this will also
work as well all right so what if for
example we wanted to apply more complex
multi-step animations well here's how
we'll do that so going back we're going
to change up our transition I just a bit
so inside here we're going to gut this
out and we're going to create an animate
function so animate and then this is
where we specify for the first argument
the duration let's just put 600
milliseconds and then keyframes and
inside of here we put in different steps
that we want to animate so we'll put in
style here and then let's just say we'll
go from app asset e 0 and then transform
from translate Y negative 200 pixels and
then offset is 0
and then put in a comma now you'll see
what offset means here very shortly
let's go ahead and copy this and then
paste it and then paste it so we'll have
three steps here you can have as many as
you wish really so we'll go from opacity
zero to 100% right there so it's one and
then translate why will come down 25
pixels past its default starting point
and then here for translate Y will have
this at zero we'll leave this at one as
well here and for the offset so if our
animate duration is 600 milliseconds
then the offset here we're starting at
zero so essentially zero milliseconds
and over here if we wanted to put say
0.5 that means it'll take 300
milliseconds to go from this step to
this step and then also an additional
300 milliseconds if we go from this step
to this step right here so make sure
this is at one all right so instead of
doing that though let's add 0.75 so
let's go ahead and save this so let's go
ahead and refresh and you'll see now
that we have a multi-step animation
alright so that is it for angular 2
animations and of course you can get
much more complex when you're using
these animations however the purpose of
this whole series really it's just to
create you know a very brief
introduction to all the angular 2 core
concepts so that is it for this series
specifically however in coming days I'm
going to be releasing more advanced or
intermediate to advanced tutorials and
courses so hopefully you follow along
and you participate alright I'll talk to
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
