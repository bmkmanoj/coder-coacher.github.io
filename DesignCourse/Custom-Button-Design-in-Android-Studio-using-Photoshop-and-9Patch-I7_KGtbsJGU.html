channel i am gary simon and today we're
going to be doing this no not clicking a
button but designing the button that I'm
clicking here on this Android phone and
basically this involves stepping first
into Adobe Photoshop to design the
general button and then we're going to
use something called 9-patch to setup
the button and specify the areas that
will expand and then step into Adobe or
known Adobe but Android studio which is
an IDE for programming native Android
apps and just making it a reality so
yeah if you've never used Android studio
before it's free the information
everything you need to know is in the
description here in the YouTube video so
go ahead and download it like I said
it's free the installation can be a
little bit difficult but once you get to
that point you can go ahead and proceed
with the tutorial alright so make sure
you subscribe here and check out these 9
course comm alright let's get started
alright so we're going to go to file new
here in Adobe Photoshop and I'm just
going to call this button design and the
width I'm going to specify 1080 and the
height 1920 and that happens to be the
dimensions of my Galaxy s5 so you don't
necessarily have to use this but
probably just good idea to stick with
what I'm doing so that your outcome is
the same resolution 72 in RGB background
contents and leaving it transparent
though you can leave it at white no big
deal
hit OK and we're going to use the paint
bucket tool just to give ourselves a
background color here for layer 1 and
clicking on the foreground will give us
a color picker and I'm going to go maybe
right around here which is the hex code
CEC ECE
very simple all right so you just left
click so now what we want to do is
design actual button container it's
going to be it's going to consist of
several layers but the outer layer the
biggest one we're going to use a rounded
rectangle so you can see our document
size is pretty big here at 50% so the
radius I'm just using something real
large too
and that way we'll have a completely
rounded side so left and right so I'm
going to start right around here holding
alt while left clicking and dragging a
button roughly around this size and so
imagine uses your phone screen that
you're viewing everything around here
and this is going to be the button size
so a pretty decent sized button alright
so now we need to give it a color right
now so same colors our background so we
can't see it I'm just going to rename
this by double-clicking the text button
background we can rename this well as
well
BG alright double click the right side
of the layer to bring up the layer
styles and this is where you want to
specify our gradient overlay and so
doing that will give us this ugly sort
of white to black gradient and we're
going to reverse it real quick so you
can just click this and that would
reverse it and let's click on the
gradient editor area and we'll double
click on this Butler of that butter this
bottom color picker and this will give
us the option to change the color a
little bit we're going to make it the
top one a little bit darker than the
background so that's b3 b3 b3 hit ok and
the bottom one we're also going to leave
I yeah maybe just slightly not quite as
white there it's somewhere thick ef ef
ef will work it okay hit OK we're not
done yet though we need two more so
we're going to give it an inner shadow
and we're going to change blend oil to
normal and we're going to change the
size to zero and then the distance one
and then this over here we're going to
put it 90 alright so that changes it up
and down and then yep acity we're going
to bring it down just to right around 8%
so you can still see just a faint darker
line and then we're going to do a drop
shadow so turn out on blend mode normal
and it doesn't really matter you
probably could have left it where it was
but it's all about just experimenting i
we want to change the color here to
white
sighs zero it makes it hard there's no
feathering going on I distance one and
yeah well maybe to opacity we want to
bring up to 100% so we can see just a
faint edge right there all right so then
hit okay and we're going to do another
round ellipse inside of it so with it
selected we're just going to left clear
that left click hold alt and drag out
something right around here it doesn't
have to be centered perfectly yet so
we'll select the move tool use our arrow
keys to get that aligned as best as we
can and if you need to it since there
seems to be more height up here we can
use the direct selection tool right here
and hit control H actually there you go
just to get these points back in view
and you can use your arrow key to get
these moved over appropriately all right
so right around there seems about right
okay so now this is going to be the
inside of a button now what we want to
do for this is right-click and copy the
layer style of our initial button we'll
just call this one inner button right
click and then paste the layer style
what that does pace everything we did so
we don't have to redo it but we're still
going to make some changes so double
clicking on it we're going to go to the
gradient overlay and real quick I'm
going to click deselect reverse that way
it'll reverse the gradient direction
click on gradient and we're going to
alter it slightly here I this one yeah
right around there f2 f2 f2 will work
and hit OK and the drop shadow we're
just we're gonna leave I you're going to
deselect inner shadow we don't need that
ready hit OK
and then what we're going to do is this
we're going to use our with it the layer
selected we're gonna use the up-arrow on
our keyboard and just push it up like
that so it's off-center
we're going to right click duplicate
layer hit OK we're gonna select the one
from the bottom the one that we
originally duplicated and use our down
arrow key to shift it down a little bit
and what we're going to do with this one
is get rid of the gradient overlay so
now you can see we could see it and
we're going to double click on the color
now somewhere right around there will
work and hit OK and let's see here
zoom up to see what's happening ok so
we're going to get rid of the drop
shadow on this one and for this drop
shadow we're going to double click it
and we're going to change it up a bit so
we're going to change the color right
around there we'll be fine
we're going to put up the size a little
bit and then also the distance and the
opacity we just want it to look like
this button is a 3d button that's being
raised this is the side of it this
darker portion and then the lights
coming from the top so it's casting a
shadow this way so just like that looks
pretty good right there so hit OK
alright so now we're ready for the text
so we'll take our type tool and whenever
you're select on the shape later my
outline it and then what happens is
you'll see the circular thing around the
cursor you don't want that to happen so
hit ctrl H now you can just click in
there we'll say click me my font size is
real small and plus the same colors so
I'm going to change the color font to
black ctrl T scale it up and it's behind
this layer that's why we can't see it
select move tool hit apply or hit the
space I'm just going to drag this to the
top
and I might hit ctrl T to scale it up
holding shift and all it's like move
till it apply all right so right now
this is what the state of the button
will look like when you're not clicking
or pressing it okay
so let me zoom out here a couple of
times just so we can see it has a
smaller size so pretty simple you want
to adjust this real quick
I'm not too happy about the gradient
situation so let me just bring that back
I think that's a little better make that
darker there you go all right so hit
okay okay and so this is what the
finished product looks like it will look
like when the no one's pressing the
button essentially so now what we need
to do take everything all those layers
with exception to the BG hit ctrl G to
group them we'll just call this default
we're going to duplicate it or you can
hit right click and hit duplicate later
I set up a shortcut for that and hit OK
and we're going to get rid of we're
going to hide the default copy or the
default layer and rename the copy to
pressed so this is what's going to
happen when somebody presses this so
zoom up here or just take control one to
go 100% and we need to get rid of a
couple layers so to select mana
matically instead of having to go
through them you get control and left
click or auto select layer and then you
can just click anything without hitting
ctrl so with that layer selected we're
going to hide it but I think first
instead of hiding it we're going to take
this top portion and the click me layer
by holding shift use our down arrow key
just to put it right on top of it now we
can just delete that one beneath it all
right so that's what it looks like when
you're clicked and we could probably
also make another adjustment so this top
inter button copy layer we could do an
inner shadow so bring that back pasady
we can leave up distance turn up in size
turn up as well
all right then take this down and then
gradient overlay do I want to do that
let me see here
now again I'm just kind of playing
around here trying to see what looks
good and what doesn't there's no right
or wrong here really so what we can do
now with that these two changes made we
can I have both these you can toggle on
and off the visibility of the top layer
so this is what it looks like when it's
not clicked this is what it looks like
when it's being pressed down and I think
that's pretty good for now so as you can
see very simple and so now there's a
couple things that we need to do before
we can really continue on so we have
click me we have the text everything is
ready to go what I want to do now is
group those so holding our shift we can
select both of these hit ctrl G to group
them we'll call these I original then
we're going to duplicate that group and
so we have a copy I'm going to hide this
one and now what we want to do before
what we want to do is not import this
full sized image we actually need to
make an adjustment in terms of I the
width of the button all right so what
we'll do to do that and this is the
reason I saved an original so that we
can make changes in the future
what we can do to make this easier is
we're going to select this default and
hit ctrl E and what that does is it
merges so it merges everything onto one
single layer that you can't really
adjust anymore
same thing with pressed so ctrl E and
that does the same thing now what we
want to do is take the
angular marquee tool' we're going to
come in just to the left eye of where
the horizontal line begins or where
these you know the curved portion ends
and just right around here so coming in
just a little bit right there we're
going to hit the Delete key for the
pressed layer also for that layer so we
deleted them from both the pressed and
the default state we're going to do the
same thing over here I think I may add a
little bit more by holding shift and
left clicking right around there and
then hit delete and moved over to the
other one and hit delete as well okay so
now what we're going to do is take both
of these and with that selection there
select the move tool hold shift and left
click and move it over just to where
it's you could use your arrow key as
well it exactly matches up you don't
want it to overlap and you don't want
any space between then do the same thing
with the other layer move down oops
real quick let me hide the top layer so
we'll move this there and then the same
thing over here so we're bringing this
back move this over
okay hide that layer get a selection
around this one for the default State
hold shift move use your arrow keys to
get that lined up perfect
that's not lined up perfectly in one
second so that happens sometimes let's
move that over we got an issue here it
looks like for some reason I may have
cut off too much on there so one second
alright sorry about that being a pain in
the ass I think I what I did was when I
had this election I was over too far
possibly so we're gonna have to redo it
sorry about that so okay let's make sure
we do this correctly you can leave some
space here to make sure everything's
done correctly come over here there all
right now quickly go through this again
all right that matches up hide this one
move this over
oops make sure you select it on the
right layer that's good and then bring
this back move that over letting shift
left clicking use your arrow that's
lined up and then finally hide this one
select on default move shift and there
we go there all right a lot better so
the reason we're doing this is because
on different I device viewport width
soar whatever you know you can have a
situation where the screen width is only
this size for example and you want it to
be able to scale in you know at a size
that's less than this you know their
original down here out here so I there
there we go so now that the design is
done let me hide this real quick or hide
this one now that our design is done
what we want to do is go ahead and just
save a
and G of just these two images for
pressed and default so with the pressed
button selected control a to select all
control C to copy file new hit ok
control V to paste in and then the same
thing well we're not going to worry
about doing the other one yet we're just
going to work with this one this one
specifically alright so now what we want
to do is save this as a 24-bit PNG s go
to file save for web or just do what I
did ctrl alt shift in s and I will bring
this save for web dialog box up and
change this to PNG 24 with transparency
enabled hit save create a new folder or
put it wherever you want and we'll call
this I button - pre and then hit enter
alright so now we're going to get up
Android studio the directory where you
installed it and you have to install
Android studio just for the part I'm
about to show you and this is where
we're going to work with the nine patch
as its called
so wherever teens have Android studio
installed and mind you it's free go
download it the links in the description
is video I once you get download it and
you note the download directory go to
SDK tools and not draw nine patch batt
double click on that and this will show
up
oops got to leave that window open and
basically we need to drag on to the file
that we just saved onto that area so I'm
going to get my off-screen I'm going to
find that file real quick and so that
files right here the button - buri drag
it on there
alright so now this is split up into two
different windows let me zoom this out
so you have the click Me button here
with with one pixel added to the top
left right and bottom from what we saved
and this program automatically does that
and then you have a preview right here
which shows the button in different
states right now it looks like not how
it's supposed to be so
this is where we draw our line so I'm
going to really make this large so we
can see this here so I'm going to zoom
up down here we're going to add lines or
different 1 pixel black lines this is
something we by the way that we can do
entirely in Photoshop or another
application like GIMP eye but just bear
with me with this so I'm going to add a
tiny line right there now notice when I
added that little dot just by
left-clicking and dragging it added it
started to repeat that area over here
we're going to do the same thing over
here as well alright just like that and
because we want our button to I also and
we want it to be able to extend the
width of the button without any
distortion horizontally we don't have to
worry about it also being vertical
there's a way to do that but it wouldn't
work with our particular case because
the edges are not up and down on the
sides are all round but for what we want
this will work perfect eye we also have
to do this as well here for the left
side the right and the bottom and so the
bottom it doesn't really matter too much
if you just left-click all the way
across it's not going to affect too much
of anything and after you have these
clicked or drawn out rather you can just
pull them and it makes it easier to go
to make adjustments I'm just going to do
the same thing down to the right side
all the way I did it and I'll take it
added it did it one second
yep just like that
let the very left side as well so this
is ultimately what we want right here
this we can make this just one pixel and
each side this is real important I
discovered this when I was messing
around with it the width of these top
lines should both be the same width as
each other so you know this one's like
one pixel right here this one
looks like it's two pixels so I'm going
to zoom up a little bit get over here
there now it's just one pixel because if
one's one or two pixels off and you turn
your phone like landscape mode you'll
notice that click me won't be in the
exact center it might be offset by quite
a noticeable portion even if it's one or
two pixels off so these are as long as
these are even they should be good to go
they're both one pixel all right so now
what we do that now that we're ready
we're going to go to hit file save
9-patch and then we'll call this I will
just call this button not pressed there
we go all right so we can exit out of
there and we're going to go to file open
and we're going to open up button on
button not pressed dot 98 by PNG you
have to leave the dot nine there in
order for it to work when we bring it
into Android studio so now we can see
this tiny black one pixel dots right
here and on the right and left or right
and bottom eye what we want to do now is
is click on the default layer and it's
already we have everything selected
already hit ctrl C and over here control
V and it looks like it pasted exactly
where it needs to go and we really don't
want to get rid of this bottom layer
just because it has the nine patch lines
already there so as long as it sits it
basically let me see here to make sure
this is really even yeah you can use
your select on the layer one which is
the one we just I imported and use your
arrow keys to make sure it's not hiding
any of the nine patch and make sure it's
exactly where the other one is then we
could just say this save for web hit
save and we'll call this button actually
you know what this is the button not
pressed one
oopsie no problem what I'll do is I'm
going to rename this one temporarily to
button not press to this one's going to
be button not pressed I'm going to hide
this don't save it and then just go to
file open them real quick
and this button not pressed - I'm going
to rename to button pressed there all
right so we have button not pressed when
it's not pressed and then who did it put
oh yeah then button pressed right here
so when you have both of those out there
hold ctrl to select both of them
left-click hit control C to copy very
important so we'll come back and we'll
paste that once we have Android studio
open so once you have Android studio
loaded and installed this is the area
that you should see if you don't already
have a project open if you already had a
project open just go to file new project
and you'll be presented with this eye or
this person right here so we're just
going to call this awesome button hit
next and we're going to leave this the
same next leave it a blank activity next
activity name I'm just going to call it
my activity leave it there and hit
finished then it's going to take a
little bit of time for it to build the
project so I'm just going to pause and
this is what you should see alright so
the I if we click on design we could see
what it looks like hello world just
left-click and delete that now what we
need to do is I basically in our
drawable xxhdpi folder we're going to go
ahead and hit control V to paste that
and then hit OK when this copy comes up
that copy dialogue so we have our button
pressed and then button not pressed
graphics inside there we're going to
create a new folder by right-clicking on
res so a directory we're going to call
it drawable and when we're going to put
in a new file called a drawable resource
file but right-clicking it file enables
call this custom button hit enter and
then in here we have to reference our
files so I just paused and I brought
this I weapon website up this is the
official Android website
for developers and this is I'd gives you
all the information about buttons
alright so the reason I brought it up is
because we're going to copy and paste
some code that's down here and it
specifies what you need to do to get a
custom background which is essentially
what this tutorial is about I right now
if you look I up here we have the XML
then the selector and a closing selector
tag you have the same thing right here
what we want to do is copy everything
inside so ctrl C to copy those three and
again this is the web address
developer.android.com visage guys talk
to the blah blah blah you can just pause
and you can get there once you have that
just paste that in and these parts are
red because those files don't exist
these are references to the actual files
that we uploaded so what we want to do
is change this we have to note that it
says state pressed is true so that means
this is going to be the button pressed
and our name is not that our name is
button pressed like that and we don't
include the dot nine PNG we actually
have to create another file which I kind
of forgot about this because there's
also a focused option right here and we
can basically just create a duplicate
file of the button not pressed so the
way we can do that is let me get out
this so button not pressed we check ctrl
C and then ctrl V it'll create a copy
automatically and so what I can do is
just call this um you have to leave that
dot nine in there we'll just call this
button not pressed to so with button not
pressed to copy our selected hit ctrl C
go back here control V hit ok I found
that you can't reference the same file
name up here I gives you an issue with
that so anyhow now we have that a
duplicate I hope at least I hope that's
true
otherwise because that does seem
irritating you have to create an entire
separate file we'll see maybe someone
can look up for me in common YouTube
section anyhow I so yeah button
not pressed - and then this is button
not pressed alright now we have that
done what we want to do is double click
on my activity right here where it says
under widgets button put it in the
middle and then right now we're on
design view if we change the tap to text
we'll see we have our code for the
layout and then right now we just have a
single button so that's all there is so
I'm going to give myself some room
put this on another line we're going to
add another attribute here called
Android background equals @ drawable and
this is a reference to the drawable
custom button name for the XML file that
we created and then you can see that we
have text that's overlaying that so it's
kind of hard to see so button text says
new button just get rid of that so now
we could see it now it doesn't extend
all the way well we can go to design and
then over here with the button selected
for the with a layout width it change
this to fill parent and look at that we
can also switch the phone to landscape
mode and we can see it also works all
right so once that's all ready and you
have that all ready to go and by the way
you can you know you can play around
with the location of this but you know
just for this simple tutorial I'm going
to leave it right here in center and
once you have that ready to go you can
go ahead and save the app first and then
in control s and then you can hit run
now I'm going to connect my phone to my
computer because I'm not going to use an
emulator ok I paused and connected so
we're going to hit this Run button and
it's going to come up oh no no no I
messed up oh man and valid file name
must contain only lowercase letters and
digits why didn't I think that yeah
because these are not lowercase well
it's no big deal
one second
we select this right here and go to
refactor rename we can just I get rid of
the capital P and the capital N and hit
refactor such an amateur mistake what am
i doing
refactor this and the rename all right
and then finally this one as well
refactor rename refactor okay all right
so custom button it also refactored
those that changed us that for us so
that's good
all right so let's go back here we're
going to need to fix that actually no
we're not i we can just close that out
because i found that if you just hit
play and let it run this will pop up
choose the running devices because I
have my galaxy s5 connected and you
could select that now if you don't have
an Android phone to connect you can use
an emulator launch emulator now if you
don't have any your emulator set up
manually you're gonna have to do a
Google search or a youtube search on how
to add emulators to Android studio so
not that big of a deal I basically just
run something that looks like a phone on
your computer so you could preview it so
I choose run choose a running device and
then just hit OK and what will happen is
it will take it a second and then on
your phone you can it will automatically
load up as seen here this the screen
that we need and so some reason it's not
showing it but it's showing on my phone
so yeah that basically is it I in terms
of how to take a custom button design
and Photoshop use what's called nine
patch to make it so that it's something
that will automatically respond
I basically respawn in a sense making it
responsive I in terms of the portrait
mode or landscape more the orientation
of the device without any type of
distortions so 9-patch is real powerful
in that regard and you can use it for so
many other things not just for buttons
you can use it for containing elements
and other things like that or seek bars
and progress bars so yeah that's
something we're definitely getting to
get into more in the future as well all
right so yeah I just restarted the app
and I also had build and clean project
and then restarted the a brought this
back and this showed back up so it's
just some type of weird years issue that
occurred when we had to refactor the
names but yeah but yeah so I look out
for more tutorials I'm going to be
getting more or so into oh you know why
the one thing I didn't do I didn't
change the background of that so if you
just take the eyedropper tool left click
click on this I will get the color code
of CEC ECE
real quick over here it shows background
hit the hex code paste in that color
code and that will give us a better
preview of our image or at least more
consistent with how we designed it and
that's it so yeah I definitely check out
design course comm slash premium where
I'm doing one-on-one design training
helping you become an awesome designer
and all things whether it be web design
logo design identity design or mobile
app design and there's also other
