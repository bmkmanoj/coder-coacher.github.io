today we're going to do a relatively
quick video in Photoshop and we're going
to be using the 3d tools to take a
website mock-up and kind of tilt it and
view it in a 3d space basically all
right so you can do this in several
different ways if you already have the
website launched you can take a
screenshot of the browser that's what
we're going to do but if you just have a
Photoshop mock-up and the site's not yet
built you can use that as well to do the
same thing alright so there's no foot
project files for this so you don't have
to anything you don't have to download
anything so yeah let's go ahead and get
started if you haven't yet check out
design course comm and subscribe here on
YouTube alright let's get started
alright so there's two ways to approach
this if you have the live website
already up like I do I'm just going to
use these on course comm you can alt and
put screen to take a screenshot of the
interface or the layout or whatever and
if you don't have it you have like a
Photoshop mock-up or whatever you can
use that as well so I'm just going to do
the first case here so I'm going to use
two different pages I just the home page
and then just a one that's not live yet
for visual identity course I'm working
on and so what I'm going to do is I want
to see more of the interface so what
I'll do is just scale this up vertically
drag it up I'm also going to move it
off-screen and then I'm just going to
hit alt imprint screen here in Windows
and that will allow me to only get a
screenshot of the current window
selected instead of the whole desktop
alright so file new and then paste that
in and then I'm going to switch over to
the other window this one and do the
same thing and make sure not to resize
the browser window that's kind of
important all right so I've alt
printscreen dand paste that in alright
so what I want to do is get rid of the
browser portion so I'm going to zoom up
here just to make sure with the
rectangular marquee tool left click and
drag all the way down here
just to the left of the scroll area
right there
so hit ctrl C and then ctrl n for a new
document and ctrl V to paste that in so
now we have just the interphase without
the actual document either the browser
rather switch to layer one ctrl C and
then ctrl V to paste that in now we
don't need that anymore so close that
out all right so now what we want to do
with layer 2 selected what we'll do is
go to 3d new 3d extrusion from selected
layer alright so what we can do is if we
use this tool and we left-click we'll
get this area that kind of pops up and
so we can start rotating this thing and
doing all sorts all sorts of different
things so if we come here to the middle
we can left-click and drag to scale it
down I'm going to scale down later like
right around there and then we can also
rotate it by coming over here in this
middle icon right there
and so to rotate around the y-axis drag
left we can see that it's kind of on
this big block that's extruded so if we
go over here to 3d tab and then we come
over to this section double click on
layer 2 we have extrusion depth I'm just
going to take that down to zero so I'm
going to type in 0 and hit enter and we
don't want it to cast shadows and we
don't want it to catch shadows all right
so now we want to rotate this around the
x-axis and so you can see we can kind of
make it look like it's kind of flat or
kind of just at a 45 degree angle or
something just for an interesting
perspective and it can move it over
maybe around here and that's pretty much
all we have to do for the perspective
you can orient yours you know however
you wish so now what we can do is come
over here right click and duplicate that
layer come down to layer 1
control a control C and then we're here
we'll see under textures will see
diffuse we can double click on layer 2
hit OK ctrl V to paste that in you can
hide this bottom one right there and
then ctrl s to save and switch back and
now we have two 3d layers one with the
first homepage and then a second sub
page alright so we can go ahead and get
rid of that background and we can see
that the lighting is kind of I making a
little bit washed out but before I
adjust that what we need to do is let's
move these around a little bit so with
the top layer selected the duplicated
one we can move this up maybe to the
right a little bit maybe just just right
around there alright alright so if we
come over to 3d double click on infinite
light to one right now this light will
only affect this layer because it's on
that specific layer I what we can do is
play around with this light intensity
and we can zoom up here to 100% and
select on let's zoom out real quick now
if we play around with this we can begin
to see come out to a point where
wherever we think is basically
preferable in terms of the lighting for
this so I think this is good enough we
can see the light gray portion over here
for each of these so pretty much as you
would see it in a browser alright so
that was 77% and let me go ahead close
that out go back to layers click over
here come back to 3d infinite light one
change that to 77 as well or if you
wanted to make it a little bit
less you know light because it's behind
this one you can do that I'm just going
to leave mine at 77 all right and now at
this point we can just go ahead to going
to zoom out here a little bit go ahead
to filter our 3d rather and render so
the rendering may take a little bit time
so I'm just going to pause so you have
to sit through this and there's a
basically a time remaining thing down
here so I'm going to go ahead and pause
up alright and one thing I noticed after
that rendered is this top layer was a
little bit I pixelated for some reason
so what I did to fix that if that's the
case for you is just right-click and hit
render so I rendered that and now it's
smoother looking so let me go ahead and
delete this bottom layer one I'm going
to hit ctrl shift n and enter for a new
layer drag it to the bottom I'm going to
fill that in with a basically a
background white color and I did notice
that these kind of did turn out a little
gray I which wasn't consistent to the
actual way call I did when I was in
preview and render before I rendered I
so what you could do is go back and
adjust that intensity a little bit more
or just right-click rasterize the 3d
later and for both of these and I'll do
the same thing here and then what you
could do is simply take yeah we could do
is group them ctrl G and then add an
adjustment layer or just go to window
adjustments if that's not viewable over
here to you and make sure we click on
this to make sure it only affects that
layer and you can turn the brightness up
ever so slightly if you wish all right
and another thing we could do is also
come down here and create a new layer
make it a layer mask right here so it's
a layer mask of this and if you want to
add your own shadow it's very simple you
can just use a soft brush
I've never experimented with the 3d
shadow so that could probably be a
possibility but to do one real simple
isn't that big of an issue I'm going to
make a let's just make black for now
like that and then you can take down the
opacity so it's not so visible like that
I guess
and there we go so obviously you could
take this in a thousand different ways
in terms of how you want to present this
I'm going to try adding another layer
for a shadow real quick
actually I wonder if I could take just a
drop shadow on that layer or is it out
right here
adjust the angle here just try to make
it consistent with the other one
yeah something like that right around
there hit okay and there we go very
simple I so yeah I've never really
messed too much around with photoshop's
3d I've done I think one other tutorial
on it but I it's actually quite capable
more so than you would think
now of course if you wanted to use like
an actual 3d app like blender to do this
same sort of thing you could you could
definitely do so but if you wish to
stick with Photoshop then this is one
good way of creating an eye pretty much
an accurate 3d representation of a
website or mobile back up alright so
that is it for today if you haven't yet
check out these on course comm subscribe
here on YouTube for sure and I'll see
you tomorrow with a new video alright
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
