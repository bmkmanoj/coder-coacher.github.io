today we're gonna step away from coding
stuff and into the world of design and
I'm gonna show you how to create your
very own font alright so this is
something I I tackled four years ago on
the channel and it was a really popular
video in fact it might be one of my most
popular videos if not the most and it's
right here how to design a custom font
the letter R I used Adobe Illustrator to
show people how to design a letter R
however I did not show you are those
people back then how to actually export
it and make it a font file that could be
installed and used on other people's
computers so obviously that's something
that's really important so the font that
we're going to create is actually right
here this oMG bomb and I'm gonna show
you how to use Adobe Illustrator to
design all the letters and all that
stuff I'm also this is one caveat that a
lot of you are not going to like it does
require using another piece of software
that will actually take the paths you
know all the letters that we create and
it converts them to a font that can be
used and it does cost a little bit of
money but fortunately I'm you know back
several years ago when this didn't exist
all the other font creation programs out
there we're really expensive and not
very user-friendly and this is the
opposite of that fortunately so let me
just show you the name of the software
and really it's a plug-in is font self
at font self calm now I should say this
disclaimer if they're not paying me for
this they have no affiliate program
dammit so I can't make money when one of
you guys buys it but I just I recently
purchased and it's very easy to use so
here's the way this works and in the
pricing it's 49 bucks I for illustrator
CC or it's 49 bucks for Photoshop CC if
you want to work in there I'm using the
illustrator CC version and I'm trying to
sell me stuff and I there's there's a
bundle where you can get both
for 79 bucks no choose whatever you wish
but for this tutorial I'm gonna be using
illustrator for designing the actual
fonts okay
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
com where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it alright so let's go
ahead and step into it so after you
purchased it and installed it I'm not
going to call it cover install
installation it's very easy to have a
guide for it we'll go ahead into adobe
illustrator so what we want to do is if
I go to window extensions you will see
fonts elf maker 2.2.1
it's showing up on my other monitor
there we go alright so what we want to
do is and this little menu will see that
we have a font template so we're gonna
open that up now this is really useful
it has all the guides that you would
want to use and need for the development
of your font
alright so these if you go to window and
layers make sure that's checked on
you'll see the different layers they
have for the guides and the characters
we can toggle them on and off although
you want to keep the guides that's for
sure also the characters you can toggle
this off and also if i zoom up a little
bit more holding the Alt key in the
scroll wheel we'll see we also do have
vertical line separations so we we have
a good idea there's a nice area for each
letter to be designed alright so first
it would make sense though before we
continue to describe what's happening
with these these are these guides right
here so in here we have this locked I'm
going to unlock it guides layer and
you'll see just a bunch of duplicates
and this is for all the guides that span
with this document or the
to the document and the very first one
is the descender alright so the
descender is this one if you can see i'm
toggling it on and off it's showing up
and up and off right there up and on on
and off like a me doc so the descender
now this is the portion of a letter that
extends below the baseline of a font so
like a lowercase Q or J the portion that
comes down so that it would reach a
maximum depth of right at this line
right here and this is usually just for
the lowercase letters down here next we
have the baseline all right so the
baseline is just the line with a letter
s' it very simple we also have the x
height all right so this x height right
here this is the height that lower case
letters reach based on the letter X thus
x height very simple we also have cap
height and this is just a height of a
capital letter all right and then also
finally we have the ascender and this is
the height reached from lowercase
letters I whose portions extend beyond
the x height and you can see how this
all plays out if you just look at some
of these letters you'll understand you
know kind of the purpose of each line
all right so let's get started I'm gonna
start with the very most simple basic
letter which is an O all right so it's
simple ellipse that's all it is although
even this one in the in the example
isn't a perfect ellipse so you're not
really you know the the the sky's the
limit in terms of creativity and what
you want to do so I'm gonna go ahead and
just left click hold and choose the
ellipse tool right here now notice it
says your artwork here that's kind of
important you just want to click this
and then any of your paths will go
inside of this artwork layer so I'm just
gonna start in and you're gonna notice
you know as we reuse this one of the
things that's gonna be very important is
alignment and these little eye these
pink / purple alignment guides will help
us quite a bit so I just want to make
sure that we're in the center of this
box although we can
easily move things around after we
created so it's not necessary that
everything's centered perfectly from the
beginning
so I want to create a letter oh and you
know for I these uppercase characters
the only guides that we really need to
concern ourselves with is the baseline
and the cap height and that's this one
that's the cap height and this is the
baseline so there's the only two that we
really need to worry about so I'm just
going to left-click and drag and while
doing so I'm holding the shift and Alt
key alright so I'm just coming up in the
size we don't have to get it perfect
right away it's not a big deal and there
we go so by default I have a stroke
that's been applied there's also a fill
we do not want to fill so just come up
here and just choose none for that all
right and for the stroke we have to ask
ourselves because when it comes to you
know they fought that's very you know a
very good and well desired
well-constructed font you want to make
sure consistency is key and I mean
consistency in a multiple multiple areas
one of those areas would be the
thickness of the characters and the
different lines that make up your
characters so the thickness that I'm
going to choose or trying to go for is
more on the bold side so for when it
comes to stroke I'm just going to bump
this up to around three all right so now
one of the goals here is to try to get
as close as possible to the top of the
letter in the bottom to this base line
and cap height up here so one of the
things that'll make it easier is when we
have a closed path like this or it's and
there's no open areas we can click on
stroke and then we can also click on one
of these so aligned stroke to inside
alright so now it's aligned it to the
inside and I can just I hold shift and
all and scale this up and get it to
reach
as close as possible to the bottom on
top of that grid or the the yeah the
guideline all right so that's a very
obviously very simple letter o although
it's very effective
usually simpler is better alright so
we're going to keep on going here and by
the way we're going to open this up and
we're going to name this one by
double-clicking the name from the lips
to just a capital o and this will come
in handy when we go to actually use font
self to create the font for us so let's
go ahead and now we are going to make it
a little bit more unique but for now I'm
just going to create the basic shapes
for each of the letters we're going to
do here so the next one let's do em and
right away what I want to do before I do
that is we're going to take our
rectangle tool and I'm just gonna left
click and drag the width of our oh right
here
the height doesn't matter but the width
as long as it matches and we're at the
same size we're good to go
so I'm going to come back over here and
I'm gonna put this we're just gonna
start right here although after we're
done we'll Center up and we'll make sure
absolutely certain that it's centered
and by the way we could just get rid or
hide these characters we don't need them
for now
so let me go ahead and actually for it
before I do that I hit ctrl C ctrl F
just move this over just so we're
roughly in the same section and then I
what we can do is for the characters
we'll just oh there we go hide it
alright so now we want this to reach
this cap height we'll take both of them
holding shift there we go
and by the way when I'm moving around if
you're unfamiliar the spacebar lets you
just click and drag the canvas around
and then I'm also using alt in the
scroll wheel quite a bit alright so now
let's create the basic shape of an M and
again a lot of this you know it's
completely subjective
so here's my take on it's just to create
a basic capital M control C control F
will replicate it and if we come down
here we'll see that it turns into a
little rotation type of icon so I'm
going to click and drag it and hold
shift and that'll get us to 45 degrees
while we're turning so now I want to
bring it just so the top of it is
reaching that top and you'll have a
little guide notifier that little purple
thing that comes across and I'm going to
get real close and make sure we get
matched up here on these points as close
as possible all right so I'm going to
just drag this in just a little bit and
then control C and control F will
duplicate it right click we're going to
transform reflect and you'll see this we
want vertical and then hit OK
next we'll just take this and let me
show you by the way it may be a quicker
way of doing this instead of having
reconstructed that what we can do is
take both of these and control C control
F right click transform reflect and then
do the same thing then we can just move
this over wherever we think we want it
to go so we'll say you don't obviously
at one point like for instance if we
wanted to make it real wide then that's
going to throw off the other letters for
instance - oh this has a certain width
and if it's this far in terms of the
width it's going to really throw off the
consistency of the letters so I can take
this control C control F get it centered
up here and then I'll have a good idea
of where I should be putting these
different paths all right so now I just
delete this one this copy drag this in
drag this one in and there we go
all right so control one by the way just
gets you to 100% view so I'm gonna zoom
back up here and we'll say that's good
now mind you at this point we do have a
bunch of different rectangles we will
eventually take all these and combine
them and merge them using the Pathfinder
into a single shape all right so that's
our M but one problem is is it's not
centered up between these these these
vertical lines here so we'll take all of
them and then I'm just going to move
them holding shift to make sure it stays
on the horizontal point that it needs to
and we want to make sure that it ends up
centered as much as possible now usually
it would give me some indication that
I'm in the center and I think I am based
on the width from here and here but I
didn't really see a grid line I've I
mean a one of the alignment lines
showing up but we'll check that in the
future okay so going on we have our o
m and now let's try the B all right so
I'm just going to take this right here
this path and then just copy it because
we already need we already know that
that's the width we're using so ctrl c
ctrl f
all right so this is the height of our B
that we're going to be using and if we
bring back the characters real quick
we'll kind of see you know what a basic
B looks like we can obviously do our own
thing if we wish let me go ahead and
hide that all right so a B is a little
bit more tricky you know first we had
that very simple oh just an ellipse we
have the M a little bit more complex
than yo we add some shapes to manipulate
and work around but again still fairly
easy but Abby's a little bit more
difficult so it's all just a matter of a
muscle memory and figuring out how to
create solid letters here so that really
relies in understanding those tools as
well so a B if you look at it bringing
this back you know it's not an ellipse a
at the side is obviously like a half
circle but then it just comes out or a
certain point or per ship or ssin of it
comes out into a straight line
so the best way to replicate that would
be through a rounded rectangle so we
have this rounded rectangle tool we're
not going to use it just yet though
because I want to take this control C
control F all right so I held shift just
to get it at a percent vertical line and
also generally when it comes to capital
B's I'm they're not in the center
usually this part is smaller than the
lower version that's we're kind of just
how we're used to seeing it so I'm gonna
push this up just a little bit all right
so then I'm going to take our rounded
rectangle tool and again remember our
stroke is three points so that's
consistent and I'm just going to drag
out roughly to the very bottom right
here all right
so at this point I kind of just realized
we don't even need this this rectangle
I'm just gonna hide it for now and now
let's go ahead and not copy this so ctrl
c ctrl f pull it down now what we can do
is take it hold shift and scale it right
to that base line now this obviously
looks horrendous but don't worry we're
gonna make some adjustments that will
make it look a lot better so let's go
ahead and hide this one behind here
alright so the first thing we want to do
is let's see where we're okay we're
pretty much even there is we're going to
click on this and we'll see when we
select it we have this little in the
property section for transform we have
this little more options you could see
these are the corner radiuses alright so
make sure they're not linked we only
want to change that the top left to zero
and by the way this is kind of cool as
well I like this little teardrop effect
that could be something that's a unique
treatment to a font to make it unique
but I gonna change the we're going to go
from a more traditional approach so I'm
going to change this to zero as well all
right and then do the same thing here so
this is zero and this is zero all right
we're getting there
now let's take these in these little
live icons where you can control how
much been there is and so we've taken
both of them in and now it's a much more
I would say better looking consistent
looking B alright so let's see how fat
it is or how much width it actually has
income in comparison to the other ones
that we have so we have our o the O is
if we get this centered up
right there
I'm going to simply take this and take
the opacity down just so we can get an
idea of how much width we have or if we
need to extend this at all alright so
what we could do is just take this one
extend it out a little bit extend that
out
all right and that looks pretty good
right there I just realized I didn't
move that either there we go
all right great so now I can go ahead
and delete that and that's our B for now
all right so we have B om and B so
really I'm created enough for the letter
for the word pom let's see what else
that we can work in here so let's try
doing the letter G so as you're defining
you're probably finding there's certain
tools and tips and techniques that your
you're gonna need to know on that are
handy to know in order to manipulate
these letters how you wish so ctrl c
ctrl F bring that over to G alright so
now let's create a G out of this ellipse
right here alright so this is going to
rely on using just I you know the
Pathfinder a bit and really
experimenting with how we want this to
be structured so this is this is a G
ours isn't going to really look very
much like that so here's that one way we
can approach this so we could take the
pen tool and change this here to a white
fill we don't want a stroke all right
and we're just going to come off and try
to find the center there it is left
click hold shift and then we'll do the
same thing well let's come out here
first do the same thing hold shift so
we've basically created a 45-degree
angle pie right here alright so looking
at this this looks like it's almost
closed up too much but let's go ahead
and just keep on with the theme real
quick I'm gonna take just this path
right here I think it you'll see you
control F move it over and I'm going to
hold shift
we're gonna get this lined up make sure
it's coming in we don't want to stick
out here on the side maybe come here to
the center now that actually doesn't
look bad now of course you can't export
the font with this big white thing
hanging right here so how do you fix
that well that's where you use the
Pathfinder and it's allows you to really
manipulate and work with your paths and
cut them up as needed so if you go to
window Pathfinder it's shown up on my
other monitor there we go we can take we
can use different shape modes and
Pathfinder modes these options here
based on what we want to do so we want
to cut this path out of this path right
here but to do that we want to transform
this from a stroke into an outline or to
a path so we go to object path and
outline stroke so now it's outlined we
can no longer I modify the stroke it's
already baked into the path itself so
now we take these two paths by holding
shift you see that both selected this
top ones way up here and this ones down
here and then we choose minus front
tonight now this is oops now that's no
longer something that we can modify now
it's it's actually empty here all right
so that looks pretty good
for now so I'm just looking at this and
trying to figure out if there's anything
that I want to change or address let's
do a lower case just for the fun of it
real quick so the lower case this is do
this one right here
ctrl C by the way we can go ahead and
outline the stroke ctrl c ctrl f we're
gonna move that down now this time oh
wait that was stupid I'm gonna back up
you don't want to convert this I'm in
yet because we need to make an
adjustment and we want to mean
that stroke with because if I baked that
in by converting it to an outline and I
scaled it down it would then become
maybe like a two point so we don't want
to do that so I'm going to just control
C control F get that Center now we're
going to scale this down until it just
meets this X height and then make sure
it's centered up alright okay so I just
wanted to do one of those lowercase
letters just because I just to show you
how it'll work in the end so now let's
go ahead and I want to take I everything
and get them into their appropriate
layers just for now and then we'll go
ahead and apply some type of unique
treatment we could just use it as it is
exactly you know make it a real simple
type of font usually those are the most
popular but let's try to do something a
little bit more extra and some type of
unique consistent thing across the
letters so to do that before we do that
rather let's take everything that is a
stroke right now and I'm and get it all
converted to outlines outline stroke
this here is an O this here is also a no
but we're going to change this to a
lowercase oops there we go all right the
that's ready to go we have our M we want
to merge these shape so we use the
Pathfinder as well so we'll we'll go
ahead and take actually before we we
merge the shapes I want to apply that
treatment to them so right now I'm just
looking for anything that's a stroke so
these two I believe our strokes still so
I'm gonna select both of them object
path outline stroke okay so we still
have a lot of separate paths composing
of these I some of the letters but
that's I'm not gonna worry about that
now so now let's go ahead and apply some
type of really
eeeek treatment to this type all right
so one thing I was thinking about is you
know on certain 45-degree angled lines
perhaps the ones that are going in this
direction from left to right I'm cutting
out adjacent I I guess you could save
letterforms so what I'm talking about is
if I take this control C control F and I
hold shift and just move it up right to
around where it begins and then make
this white where we got here
I'll make this white here and as I say
there's a stroke there well this might
this might be strokes actually yeah they
are you have to fix that real quick I'm
just gonna take all of them we don't
want him to be strokes we want them to
be just to be filled all right so now
make sure extends beyond just a little
bit and we have to consider do we want
it to be this thick of you know negative
space going in there I on one hand you
you do want it to be thick because you
want these to be visible when they're
small like they're real small font sizes
but you also don't want them to be too
thin if they're too thick though then it
might make it hard to see what the
letter is so you want good readable
readability as well so I'm just going to
come down a little bit all right so I
think that's good you can still see that
this is M and it also looks pretty
interesting especially when the rest of
them have this a treatment applied so
once we have this ready I'm going to
create a copy so ctrl c ctrl ephram's
going to move this over and that way I
can reuse it again so now I'm going to
take just this letter this eye portion
cuz that's the only part that's cutting
into it and this by holding shift and
then I can just do - front all right so
good to go on that letter okay so let's
do this where it would make sense to the
rest of the letters
so I'm going to come over here drag this
guy over here alright so where would it
make sense to do this here well first
let's I copy this so I have two copies
one here and here I'm gonna bring the
size of this down just a bit and we're
going to create more of like a instead
of just a square appearance kind of like
this jagged slanted 45-degree angle
appearance right here so you want to
make sure you get up here that it's
actually going to create a point right
there alright so once we do that just
take these two and - front nothing there
now all right so let's also take this
and let's see what did i do previous to
this with the G I'm just looking here
yeah same thing alright so what we'll do
is take this move this in line with this
section let's bring it up on top all
right that looks cool take this and that
oh it's create a copy before I forget
take this and that in minus front
awesome
so now let's keep on doing that stick
with this theme here
all right so now I for the B let's see
here one thing I want to do is I made
this mistake in the first attempt before
I recorded this video just to see what
it's gonna do I don't like that fact
that this brick here this edge doesn't
meet this point so the only way we can
fix that first let me just move this
over to where that would occur right
there and that looks pretty close moving
right there it's just to move that in
and then we could just take this top and
this is one of those areas where I wish
I didn't convert it to outlines because
it's it's no longer a stroke but we can
still solve this issue first I'm going
to take this right here and I'm going to
lock it temporarily so we can't select
it then I'm going to take the direct
selection tool make sure it's the white
one here and I'm gonna move well
I'll lock that one as well and I'm going
to select everything on this side this
is going to select just all of the
anchor points then I can move this into
place where it looks like it needs to be
alright so let me move this over just a
bit and I'm looking at the edge of that
white portion it's gonna cut out so it
just makes it looks like this flows down
naturally like that alright cool so I
now I'm going to unlock both of those
and then I'm going to take this control
C control F and we're going to put this
one over here and we'll work with that
in a bit alright so then we're going to
take our anchor point and with the
direct selection tool and just move this
up move this one up here and move this
one right here
perfect
all right so now with that in place I
can take this and this and minus front
now the reason that that didn't work is
because I forgot we have this shape
beneath it so what do we do now well
what's this back up take both of these
and we'll merge them three unite and
then we'll take this one and this one
and - run awesome now let's do the same
thing here and here and - front now okay
when you do that I noticed a little
issue yeah you don't want these to
intersect because it'll create this
little jagged point so what we can do is
just move this ever so slightly and
you'll find the area where it looks yeah
that's pretty much perfect right there
so we'll take this this and - front and
there we go how cool is that all right
so we got Oh me and did I really do that
again yeah I didn't get my backup piece
right here control C control F we'll do
that again - Friant all right we're
gonna do this one more time so that's
why I cared let's get this drug over
here
damnit got a zoom up so I'm not rotating
it instead of moving it we're gonna do
it with our oh as well might be a better
way of Tim in this G's okay so coming
down here let's just do it right here on
this side
in these guys sometimes that the guys
are guides guides are activated it'll
throw you off when you're trying to move
these and getting into place that looks
pretty good right there all right take
these and - front now four will say just
just to save time we'll say it's just
the uppercase letters that have these a
treat these treatments and not the lower
case you could do whatever you want
obviously alright so now we have all of
our different paths let's get them on
you know one single path as they need to
be so this one is already a B and it's
on something that's not named correct so
you went this will be capital B we'll go
to our G take this and unite oops
unite rather all right and this is
capital G and then we'll come out take
all these shapes unite them this is an M
now when it comes to paths that are that
have you know that aren't connected like
there's actually a clear separation
you'll see it turns it into a group
where you have two paths and that's fine
it'll still work this oh rename that to
a capital L oops there's the lowercase
damn caps-lock
all right and then this down here is
just the small oh I think we already
have that taken care of make sure this
is centered one last thing you want to
do is just make make sure everything's
centered up where it needs to be I
believe this one is I'm going to make
sure they're reaching the top you didn't
accidentally move them around
unnecessarily yep
that's good so as you can see I mean
dealing with all of the letters
uppercase lowercase these special
characters down here I mean there's a
lot of work that is put into these these
fonts as you can see all right I think I
like this and now the fun part what is
this right here okay let's just get rid
of that and this rectangle that was
hidden alright so now we're ready to use
font self to get this actually working
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
come up here to a window and then our
extensions and font self alright so with
it open I you want to just take one of
the letters now it's do if you had all a
twosie like uppercase you could just run
this but what we're gonna do is just do
this individually you're gonna take like
for instance the capital o and just drag
it over here now there's some type of
issue with my screencast recording
software or something where it's not
allowing me or font self itself it's not
allowing me to drag this on top if you
do this yourself however you should be
able to do it it's also made me have to
do with my multi-monitor setup it only
works when i drag it over to my other
monitor but when you do this it'll have
you just break down here it will have an
option for you to this drop you know the
single character into there so that's
what I'm going to do unfortunately I
just can't show it on screen it's kind
of ridiculous it says any character and
you have to make sure by the way that
you have it selected and then just to
drag it and then it's going to work and
then there
we go we have the letter O and this is
the cool part where we have a live
preview of it so this is the font of
course it's just a standard text at this
point but if you put a capital o you'll
have your oh so Oh exciting alright so
and then we can just keep on doing this
for the rest of them so we select the B
drag it of course it's not gonna work
for me you have to bring it over and
hide it from you guys for some strange
damn reason and then there we go we have
our OB or B Oh body odor
awesome and we'll keep on doing this of
course for the rest of these and I see
if we can do with multi just as a yep so
you can select them all at once and just
get it done in one single swoop alright
so one of the interesting things here
that we found is that the M in o and G
are completely off and that's likely
because I chose to import an upper case
with a lower case alright so what we can
do is go ahead and trash I let's see
here the M delete gif or glyph rather
and then just import this by itself and
hide it from everybody and there we go
alright so now we can just use this
however we want to make a bunch of words
or whatever like OMG bomb awesome okay
so now once you have all your letters
and they're ready to go here I mean this
is so simple export name the font like
my cool font I'll just call this I oMG
bomb and maybe I'll do that
oMG bomb well hit okay it's gonna ask
where to save this originally I named it
slasher and we'll just I'm just going to
say this here save it now we can just I
open the exported font all right now of
course it's gonna fill it in with just
you know random text here and then now
we can install it just as we would any
other font and now if I get a new
document up let's close this close that
out new everything's showing up off my
other monitor I usually work on that one
just yeah a thousand points by 700
points will work fine and then we'll use
the type tool scale this up come up here
to our character panel OMG
oh there it is in there we go
let's even do this real quick
so now we can I use this however II
would however that however we would any
other font you know we can change it
make it different colors come down here
and make it real small to see how it
works in terms of being small and it
still looks pretty good to me
I would use this font and there we go
awesome stuff and so of course if you
you know I you would always want to save
this original documents a Tiki you can
make edits as you need to and keep on
going alright guys hopefully I know that
was quite lengthy hopefully you found a
lot of use in that I definitely check
out you know font self for if you
obviously have an interest in making
fonts I know you know the people's
entire profession or professions are
based on creating fonts and typefaces
and so it's no easy skill to learn but
definitely very fun you can make money
doing it if you get good enough by
selling fonts and even offering them for
free you just have to be creative with
that but yeah I'll talk to you guys soon
with more tutorials see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
