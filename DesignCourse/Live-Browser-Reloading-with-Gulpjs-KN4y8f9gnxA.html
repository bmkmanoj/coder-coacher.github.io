hey everyone Garry Simon of course
cetera comm and today we're going to
tackle live reloading with the gulp task
runner and also integrating and how to
integrate bootstrap foundation Balma and
other CSS frameworks so a common concern
for front-end developers is setting up
live browser reloading when they're
making updates and they're developing
their CSS slash sass HTML Javascript and
other files but fortunately there's a
JavaScript task runner called gulp j/s
and this has been around for a while
I've something I've always kind of
wanted to you know cover so I'm doing it
now and also I'm also doing it because
I've been a little bit stagnant on my
content updating because I've been
learning some new stuff that I will be
covering very shortly so let's get
started the first thing is oh but real
quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera com
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it
prerequisites so you're going to need
nodejs
installed with NPM which simply needs no
package manager before proceeding so you
can check whether or not you have them
installed but I open up your command
line or console and typing node - V and
then NPM - V as well and they should
give you version numbers if you have it
if you don't it'll say it's unrecognized
and you just have to visit nodejs org
visit the downloads page then and
download the Installer that's
appropriate for your operating system
install it and then reload your command
line or console and then you'll have it
running alright so the first thing we're
going to do to get started is to make a
new directory so m'kay Durer here and
I'm just going to call it project 101
then we're going to CD into it alright
and then we're going to run the NPM and
NIT command and this will Jenner
in package.json file which will store
all of our project dependencies all
right so after this we're going to
install gulp and browser sync into our
project so the way to do that is NPM
install gulp package and then browser -
sync and then we want to save it as a
development dependency so we add the - -
save - dev flag right there alright so
you know usually more often than not
you're going to want to utilize the
power of sass or something or some other
preprocessor with CSS when you're
developing a project so if you're using
a framework that's built to work with
sass such as bootstrap foundation or
Balma or if you simply want to use sass
without our framework then you need to
install another package that can compile
the sass files to CSS so if this is the
case then you want to run the following
command after the others have installed
so we run NPM install gulp - sass save
it as a dev dependency and if you're
using a different preprocessor such as
stylist for instance simply google the
name of the preprocessor + gulp and
chances are you're going to find a gulp
specific package for compiling and
handling it alright so next we wanted to
consider installing a front-end CSS
framework so like I said if you're using
one of those several popular front of
frameworks such as bootstrap for
foundation 3 or 6 rather balm on etc
then now it's the time to install it
with the packages so for this tutorial
we'll assume it's boots app for though
the process is pretty much the same for
the other framework so don't let that
deter you
so npm install and at the time of
recording this the latest version of
bootstrap 4 which is still an alpha is
right here
so I'm going to install that and once
that's done I will go ahead and unpause
this all right so I have Visual Studio
code from my editor opened up here into
project 101 folder that we were working
with you should just have a nude modules
folder where we have all the
dependencies installed and then also our
package a JSON file so to get started
the first file we're going to create is
an index.html and I'm going to paste in
some HTML just to get us started here
and by the way if you want to paste that
in as well just view the written version
of this tutorial at corsetry comm the
link is in the YouTube description here
and basically anything to really note is
this line right here where we're linking
a stylesheet CSS or CSS folder forward
slash main dot CSS and this doesn't that
it doesn't exist yet we don't have to
create it's going to be generated
automatically a little bit down the road
next let's go ahead and generate a sass
folder inside of the sass folder we're
going to create a new file called main
dot s CSS you can also use dot s a SS
which is slightly different in terms of
how you write the CSS and what we're
gonna do is just define a variable real
quick my color will just be blue and
then we'll set the body background to my
color variable which is I created up top
oops
there we go so we'll save this and the
reason we've added this you know just
some basic sass here is to make sure
that it works and actually compiles down
to regular CSS later on so you know in
your project this is where you would be
writing your CSS inside of this fuller
as well with other files if necessary so
outside of here we're going to create a
new file called gulp file a s
all right so the very first part of this
file is involves creating variables that
import the packages that we need and
that we installed so the first three
lines here I'm going to increase this
font size just a bit our importing the
gulp package that we installed 3m PM
gulp - sass and browser - sync and
browsing browser sync by the way is what
will allow us to set up browser
reloading automatically alright so the
next portion is going to be creating a
few tasks that will handle compiling the
sass into CSS and browser reloading via
browser sync so the first task that
we're going to create will be gulp task
method the first argument is the name of
the task so we'll name the sass and
inside of here we're going to return
gulp source method and we pass in the
sass files right here now this could be
in the form of an array so we can put
here and then have multiple files and
folders but for now we just have one so
we're just gonna put in a single
reference and that's going to be in the
forward slash sass folder that we
created main dot s CSS now if we had
multiple CSS or sass files in there in
that folder we could just say asterisk
or wildcard all like that so I'm just
gonna leave it at main dot sass just for
now the next part of the statement is to
reference the pipe method so pipe and
we're gonna pass in sass which is
defined up above in this variable and
what that does is it takes any of the
source files found through here and it
will compile them down to CSS after that
we put in another pipe
and these are just sequential steps we
use gulp destination or D est and this
is where we're going to place the
compiled CSS files so we'll put it in
forward slash CSS and then finally a
pipe for browsersync dot stream and this
will reload the browser's once those
other steps have been completed all
right so next after this we're going to
create another task to create a local
server through browser sync and watch
any of our sass in the HTML files so to
do this gulp that task once again we're
going to call this serve we're going to
pass in and the second argument our sass
task and here we're gonna reference
browser sync dot and knit or initialize
and the server will be in our project
root next we're going to use the gulp
watch method and this will say we're
gonna watch any of the files inside the
sass folder main dots scss where this
could be a wild card die a CSS again if
you have multiple files and if any of
them are changed or updated we're gonna
make it run the task up here which is
referenced by its name in the first
argument so it's called sass now I'm
gonna hit shift alt and down here in
Visual Studio code to replicate this and
this time we're also going to want to
reload the browser if we make any
changes to the HTML file so we'll say
ford slash any for wild card HTML and
then we'll remove this real quick and
we'll simply say on change
browsersync stream or reload rather
which will reload the browser all right
and then finally we'll have one more
line and then this will be another task
and it's very simple so we'll set the
default task to the serve task that we
created just above what this means is
when we run gulp at the command line or
console within the project folder it
will automatically call this serve task
by default and so this negates having to
type gulp serve explicitly every time
all right so let's save that and now
let's see if it actually works let's
make sure we save any files here all
right we'll go back to our command line
and now we just have to type gulp all
right awesome looks like it worked it
load on it loaded up on another monitor
I have three of them and there we go I
just paused in split screen with my
browser right here and look a host 3000
again it should automatically load this
for you and then over here we have our
main sass just to show you that it's
working we can change the value from
blue to yellow save it there we go
automatically it tells you live with a
little toast message here that injected
the file at the given file name and that
is it so of course you can also extend
this gulp file jes to include a lot of
other packages for a lot of different
purposes so for instance if you want to
create some minification to run on the
main CSS folder like for instance if we
have a let me get up my menu over here
we can see it generated the CSS folder
with the main CSS we can see it just has
our standard CSS here one thing I forgot
to do was to actually reference
bootstrap which we installed so how do
we do that it's actually really simple
in our sass file at the very top come
down here or up here rather we simply
import for bootstrap at least the URL is
node modules bootstrap which remember we
installed up through NPM and there's a
scss sass folder and then a bootstrap
dot CSS file and we don't have to
specifically reference that extension it
will add a force automatically so this
imports it so watch what happens when we
save this remember without saving it
this is what our main CSS folder looks
like our file rather if we save it we
see automatically our font changed there
and we can see now we have that full
massive framework right there so you
know if this is a serious project where
speed matters then you would definitely
want to extend this gulp file right here
to include you know different packages
that will minify and reduce the size of
this CSS file but yeah that's basically
the gist of how gulp works as a task
runner and specifically in relation to
automatic browser reloading you know
again we can go to our index.html file
and just type my awesome project - there
we go
so there we go hopefully you you learned
a decent amount if you were looking for
this specifically and yeah check out
course cetera comm very shortly we're
going to be having a strong emphasis on
learning distributed databases and
Ledger's and also cryptocurrency
development and exciting stuff like that
alright I'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
