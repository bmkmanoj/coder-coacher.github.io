calm today we're going to focus on part
two of our light ball tutorial and we're
going to basically focus on creating
more of the inner structure of the
actual light bulb all right so as always
check out design course calm and if you
haven't yet subscribed here on YouTube
alright let's get started alright so
this is where we basically left off arm
I want to kind of make an adjustment
here to the size and proportion this
light bulb portion at the top a glass
portion I so we'll see what I can get
away with and it was actually go back to
render mode just hit s input like 1.1
and so that kind of increased the size
that looks a little bit better actually
looks kind of like a lot better actually
so um yeah I think we're just going to
leave it there for now and now let's
make take this bottom portion so let's
go back to solid it's selected make sure
hit tab hit 14 front view on your number
pad and I'm going to put a edge loop
here control our and just kind of put it
up right around there and then hit I alt
and right click to select that bottom
portion hit s and then take it down just
a notch alright so this portion right
here and down is going to be I we're
going to separate it so let's go back to
face mode here hit a and then hit B and
it select all those and then we're going
to hit p and by selection so whenever
you want to like separate an object from
or selection from an object to create
something new that's how you do it it's
p so now if we go back to object mode
and select this we can give it its own
material currently that it will
automatically adopt whatever material
came from so click + over here will call
this bottom of all
and we are going to change this here to
a glossy make the color like black the
roughness 0 so if we come back over here
to rendered and you know what I don't
really like that too much let me see
here because it really did would
probably be some sort of let me go over
here to solid real quick will select
this portion going to tab in edit mode
hit our to add oops I hit T by accident
control are a dead blue edge loop like
right around there and we'll add hit are
again and add another one and click
twice and then select this inner portion
hit oops alt and right click there we go
that one hit s just kind of scale it out
just a tad bit and maybe drop it down
just a little bit all right so if we go
and rendered kind of makes it look like
you know it's actually kind of in it
alright so far so good alright so when
it comes to a light bulb especially the
type that you know there's different
types of shades of light bulbs I guess
you could say some are just real white
you can't see inside of it and then
others are like this and they're bright
as hell if you look at it so you can see
inside there are these to like little
arms and some glass stuff in here and
they're connected with lectures the
portion where you know actually gets
really bright so we're going to try to
make that not try we are going to so
let's go to object mode I will go back
in here to solid and so what we're going
to do this is I'm just going to click
over here somewhere actually I'm gonna
hit 14 front view click right there hit
74 the top view click right around there
and we're going to be in a bit kind of
move that into their that portion
alright so oops
am i doing all right shift a we're going
to add mesh and we're going to add a
cylinder it's like massive so we got a
scale that down to s and make it tiny
and then we're going to hit s &amp;amp; Z and
this is still I think a little bit too
big I guess it's a tiny little piece in
there may be like that now s &amp;amp; Z ok so
when it comes to these little arms or
whatever I don't know what they're going
basically they're not they don't start
out like this they kind of go slightly
inwards and then they go outwards so
that's what we want to do so let's go
ahead I'll go in front view we'll get a
tab to go into the edit mode and I'm
just going to hit s &amp;amp; Z we right around
there so I'm gonna move it up kind of
like move it closer to this just so we
can get a good idea because it's going
to go inside of here obviously I
something come up here and also because
there's two of them and they are exactly
identical we're going to do a what's
called a mirror modifier so I we
basically have to reset the origin point
of this object in order for that to work
correctly I first I'm going to switch to
wireframe mode pull this in here all
right and it basically be right around
here and then we want the other one to
come up like right around here as well I
had to pause that to make sure because
I've only done it one other time before
so the way you do that is you go into
object mode make sure it's selected you
just click right over here in the center
kind of where you want the origin point
to be and then you hit ctrl shift alt
and see all together and that brings up
this little window and you click on
origin to 3d cursor and that will
automatically set
right there so now if we go over here to
the object modifiers and add a mirror
BAM right there so now when we go to
edit mode and we work with this we only
have to work with this and we don't have
to like duplicate that and stuff so
that's kind of good alright so now what
we want to do is start working with this
thing and so get a and then hit wait
we're in now we rinsed edge mode that's
fine so hit a and then be and to select
the top portion let's go into front mode
as well and just drag this in we're
going to hit a to select everything kind
of rotate it alright so just get an idea
the scale that looks pretty good and
it's going to come up to roughly right
around here so we have to extrude the
top so hit a B select that hit e and so
as you can see it kind of makes us go on
to Z is that access so right around here
I think and we could just move it over
slightly hit you again and then push it
over that's pretty good alright so I
then I'm also going to instead of it
make an entirely new object I'm going to
just work with this extrusion over here
to connect in that tiny little like film
at whatever it's called that glows
bright so what we'll do is yeah we're
going to get real close into here is hit
e and then a right around there hit are
and we're going to kind of push this out
a little bit hit s to scale that in and
then we're going to hit e
alright and then push this thing until
they basically meet
yeah okay cool I all right so that's
that so what I want to do now is go back
here to object mode and we're going to
apply this mirror modifier so that
basically means it's not going to be
mirrored anymore and that's that so
we'll just go ahead and apply now if we
go to rendered we can kind of see this
thing inside of there I I basically want
it to be this material so it's still
selected will go here well it will
choose hmm i think it was i don't think
i named it to die no i didn't all right
so it's basically that cool all right so
usually there's also some stuff like
this I guess you could call it a kind of
like a glass thing that kind of just
connects in here we're going to do that
too I'm not going to get extremely
technical with this but I let's see here
yeah let's go here to solid and actually
maybe I'll do wireframe all right so
we're going to add a i think a cube
would work well for this so shift a make
sure you're in object mode and then
we'll just put cube all right scale that
thing down by hitting s will go in front
mode to make sure that it's you know
it's pretty much even with this and we
also go to the side and it is not this
thick obviously so we have to hit s and
why click right around there all right
now let's go into edit mode and we'll
just hit one and let's hit a and then we
will hit B and hit asked to scale it
I was looking at reference images it
seems to be like justice glass piece
that kind of connects in here or
whatever so let me take the top portion
a be all right and you know basically
like i said is pretty much just like
this thing that comes in here i'm not
going to get really technical with all
the stuff in the middle I mean you could
do that if you wanted to but yeah this
is basically it all right so let's go
ahead and real quickly I'm just going to
select it all hitting a and we're going
to add a subdivision surface alright and
we will go ahead and take this top
portion by all and right-clicking it
i'll hit eat extrude it and make sure
it's on the z axis s and then we will
also hit a to extrude hit oops sorry
about that II just extrude and then Z
right around here s oops am i doing okay
Yeah right around there and then hit
again to extrude and we're just going to
click once and it s scale that in and
then e z alright so that's kind of kind
of what it looked like I think at least
it looks like that got off a little bit
although I don't think it's a huge deal
actually yeah it is because i only
selected that portion oops let's go back
real quick so I could just see you had
it only selected that sorry about that
so yeah for some reason my alt on right
click is not working oh well just hold
shift and select them hopefully you know
that issue hit e z s if you take it down
a little bit and then e yeah right
around there control are all right
that's roughly you know kind of what it
looks like all right I think it goes up
high or two though alright so let's see
what this looks like remember it doesn't
have a material yet so let's go to
object mode I let's go to rendered and
there it is alright so we'll play around
here with yeah it's currently selected
it doesn't have a material now I that's
it new and let's choose a mix aider and
we'll take this first one and I'm going
to make it glass and then we'll take the
second one I'm going to try glossy just
to see what this thing looks like
it's kind of hard to see
also let me go back to object modifiers
turn this up now it's kind of an issue
all right
yeah normally there'd be like two things
coming out of here but yeah I guess I'm
lazy alright that looks fine for now
alright so yeah it looks pretty good so
I want to add another the light or
duplicate this rather so I'll just
right-click on it hit shift key and hit
let's see X bring this one over there so
now if we if you can also hit 5 to get a
perspective view that's ultimately what
we're going to render it with all right
and also if we come down over here
there's one big issue when you render
something with glass that's glass a lot
of glass and also lights the issue is is
you would see what are kind of called
fireflies no matter how how you put this
render sample on so the way you can kind
of cut back on that is by changing this
right here for clamp so if we change it
change it to three for example it kind
of you know the the reflections aren't
as intense I guess you could say and
that's a good thing so yeah um so let me
see here this thing is facing the wrong
way so if we just right click it make
sure it's selected there we go and we
hit our Z I just face it
all right okay um zooming up i don't
like that that does not look good right
there so let me make an adjustment oh
maybe that's why i was having issues
that does not look right something like
what am i doing let's see here go to
edit mode yeah that does not look
correct I have to figure that one out
let me see here I'm going to delete that
top one not the face but edges actually
delete the damn vertices oh man I think
I had multiple things selected possibly
trying to figure out why it is doing
that oh yeah that's probably why
ridiculous sorry about that i had this
above it that's why i was creating that
we're looking weird type of issue there
all right sorry about that so
unprofessional i am alright so now just
now play around with the material here
yeah we want this on the lower end
roughness let's see if what happens if
you put zero and we take this up now
and I'm just going to you know see if
there's anything I could change and
sometimes if you add I'm not sure if I'm
going to but if you add a modifier over
here called solidify you can kind of
change the appearance of things I think
I'll just leave it like that and apply
all right so I now that we have that
going I we're going to join everything
here into its own object but first I
don't like how this looks like sticking
out way too much I so let me go back
into tab wireframe hit a hit five to go
an ortho mode will it three to go inside
and hit s and then why make that thing a
lot a lot thinner so i'll take the
bottom edges here ay ay and B and come
up here to the top hitting seven and
then hit s and why
same thing with this one right here and
s why
and it looks a little bit better all
right so I've just come over here and
this is still really bothering me kind
of i think i'm just being a little bit
too picky about this
because solid or wire frame and just get
it to ya object mode hit s &amp;amp; x it just
seems like it's too thick honestly the
fact that they're not in their own are
we going to worry about it let me see
alright that's it that's pretty much
good for now if you wanted to add you
know the actual things that connect up
here you can definitely do that but for
now I think this is pretty good
especially for our purposes so now what
I want to do is we'll go if you hear two
solid and let's select everything so
just hit a to deselect everything hit B
now that will select make sure you
didn't select like you know the light or
the camera or the plane or anything and
then you just hit ctrl + J and that
joins everything up so now we can just
select it as a single whole unit and
yeah let's see here let's go back to
rendered yes I'm going to end it right
here I think tomorrow we're going to
work on finishing it up work with the
the background and we're going to
duplicate this or replicate it rather
several times and ultimately create kind
of like a cool image that we can kind of
create a little bit of a poster out of
in Photoshop so it may be another day or
two we'll see until we finish it up all
right so check out these nine-course
calm and please subscribe here if you
haven't alright bye
