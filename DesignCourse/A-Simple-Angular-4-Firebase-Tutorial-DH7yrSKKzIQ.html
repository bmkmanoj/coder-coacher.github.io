d'être calm let me show you the project
that we're going to create real quickly
which is based on angular 4 in firebase
alright and so here it is that looks
almost 4,200 of randomness ng serve and
this is the very extremely simple app
that we're going to make in this
tutorial so let's say I'm going to click
on anonymous login and so that's using
the anonymous login method of firebase
which is kind of automatically logs you
in without any type of credentials and
as you can see we already have two
little post notes here add another one
just for the heck of it what also I'd
like to do yeah I have a family too okay
hit enter there you go automatically
posting an elf ooh if I were to get up
another browser window and post from
there it would automatically pull right
here as well so there's no refreshing or
anything like that involved all right so
very simple app and also something to
take note if you already have experience
with angular 2 in integrating firebase
it's the same exact process for angular
4 it will still work the only reason I'm
doing this tutorial is because I want to
capitalize on new search traffic because
people are going to be typing very
shortly angular 4 plus you know firebase
so I also change it up slightly just to
give you you know a different look at it
in terms of the project so I'm going to
be linking that order tutorial here in
the YouTube description as well as
another tutorial that will show you how
to upgrade an angular 2 project to
angular 4 if you're watching this at a
point in time where the angular
command-line interface doesn't by
default install an angular 4 project
alright so if you haven't yet make sure
you hit that DM subscribe button down
there and also check out course tetra
comm alright let's get started alright
so here in the console I right now it is
March 19th and the angular four official
release hasn't released yet supposed to
be in three days on the 22nd if you're
watching this before it's released and
also before the angular command-line
interface
yet integrated angular 4 to start a new
project then you're going to have to do
a couple extra steps in order to upgrade
in angular 2 project to an angular 4 so
that's the boat that I'm in I wanted to
get this out as fast as possible so I
didn't wait for you know the command
line interface tool to integrate angular
4 so if you are at a if you are watching
this you know sometimes after it's
released here in a few days and the
angular CLI does start in angular 4
project then just go ahead and run this
command ng new and I'll just name this
here arm what we do and by the way
you're going to have to run this no
matter what even if it is just going to
install an angular 2 project the
difference comes in a little bit later
here so I'm going to pause this until
it's complete alright so it is dining
the CD into it alright and real quickly
how do you know if you installed an
angular 2 or an angular 4 project well
we have to open it up in a code editor
editor so mine's going to be in Visual
Studio code here and we're in the
current project folder going to click on
package JSON and we can see for all of
our dependencies we can see that it's
two point three point one two point
three point one etc so this is an
angular 2 project yours will be four
point zero point whatever if it is true
into the angular four project so if it
does say two here for you then we want
to do a couple things just to upgrade it
to an angular four project so to show
you go ahead to your browser and also
this is going to be linked here in the
description of this YouTube video so you
can quickly access it so I already did a
tutorial on angular for if-else
conditional but I show you how to start
an angular 4 project and also upgrade it
so you can head on over to that and if
you're on Mac then we need to run this
command right here so it's copy all this
or if you're on Windows which I am we're
going to copy all this here all right
then we're going to go back to our
console we're going to paste it in hit
enter and it's just going to upgrade
these to the 4.0 version once it's done
come back here we need to upgrade
typescript as well so let me clear this
paste it and momentarily it will upgrade
it and that's all that's required in
order to get an angular 4 project
running at the present time alright so
after that's done we also in by the way
if you prefer reading and a written
tutorial you can follow along with the
written tutorial for this course and
that's available right here and so I'm
just kind of following along with this
written story outside do the video so
basically what we need to do is up here
first to set up the firebase project now
I already do have an angular 2 based
firebase tutorial where I have all these
let me find if it's yeah I have all the
steps with screenshots in terms of what
you need to do to set up a firebase
account it's all still exactly the same
at least you know as it stands right now
so all you have to do is go to the
firebase console and that's right here
you click on create a new project
specify a title for the project name and
then hit create project I'm not going to
do that because already did it and have
it set up already but then after you do
that all it's going to do is and set me
with this screen you click on add
firebase to your web app and after that
it's going to show you this screen with
your configuration all you need to do is
save these five properties right here
and save them something like notepad
then you want to click on the
authentication tab on the sidebar and
then click on the sign-in tab up here
and we're going to use anonymous so you
want to click on enable anonymous
login when you hover over it you'll be
able to have that option to do that to
toggle it on for this particular
tutorial right here I I have it using
Facebook we're not going to use it for
this one you can use it if you want
there just be slight differences in the
configuration later on down the road for
this app we're creating so if you want
to use and stick with what I'm doing
which is anonymous then skip this screen
this screen this screen this screen up
until you get to here so the next step
here is to click on database and then
the rules tab and paste in this right
here so you're going to replace this
with this and then you'll be able to
save it and we'll be ready to go alright
so sorry I could be jumping around
different tutorials here but I don't
like recovering the same thing so I'll
be linking these tutorials and
everything you need alright so now we
have to install by with NPM angularfire
to and firebase so NPM install
angularfire to firebase and then save it
to the package of Jason alright and once
that is ran let's go ahead and run ng
serve we'll set up a dev server at
localhost 4200 you go there in your
browser and there it is alright so now
let's go to our code editor and in
source app and we want to go to app
module dot ES and we have to import what
we just installed with NPM which is the
angular fire so to do that let's go
ahead and I'm just going to paste in
real quick just in the middle here
import angular fire fire module from
angular fire - okay and then by the way
I'm going to copy and paste this on
doing this on my other monitor where I
have that written tutorial up which
looks like this and we want to copy and
paste this right here to create a
content of firebase config which will
have our API key domain and this is all
the stuff that you saved from the
firebase console when you click on the
add firebase to a web app okay so make
sure you put that in I'm not going to do
it just I mean it's not a big deal if
you see my credentials but
I don't know I just don't want to okay
so after that save it and then the next
step is to go to app component tes right
above it and where the core of the work
will begin so actually no at wall we
need one more thing
I always forget this step we need to add
to our imports this right here which is
angularfire module dot initialize app
and then you pass in the firebase config
property right there now you're ready to
save then you're ready to go to app
component on TS so in here we have one
import I'll just type this out here so
we're going to import angular fire auth
providers auth methods we'll be using
each one of these and then firebase
lists observable and this is what allows
us to take all the information from
firebase database whatever we end up
storing there and using it in our own
app from and then angular fire - all
right so then let's go ahead and save
that we can ignore the component
decorator we're not going to be working
with in this at all next step is to come
here and get rid of title and now we
have to create three different
properties so the first property is
items and firebase lists observable
which we imported above with a type of
any we also want to use name this is
what's going to allow us to check if the
user is logged in or not
and then also message Val and we'll make
this a string type and make it nothing
empty at first so this will be bound to
our text field in the view next we're
going to create a constructor and pass
into it a public AF for angularfire
and then angular fire which we imported
right there all right so now we can use
it within our constructor so this not
items again
that's referenced right here equals AF
database list' so it's a list method and
messages and this is where we're going
to be saving our stuff momentarily
whatever the user enters and then we're
also going to pass along a query of
limit to last 50 so what this basically
means is we're going to limit the amount
of messages it returns to 50 very simple
all right and then one more
this AF dot off we're going to subscribe
to off and inside this dot name equals
auth oops
nope sorry about that if off exists or
in other words if the user is logged in
then this name equals off all right so
you'll see how this kind of comes into
play
well materially once we get to our view
so after the constructor right here
we're going to create two different
methods first is a login method and this
will be called when the user clicks
login so this AF dot auth login method
provider auth providers we're using
anonymous and then method auth methods
is also anonymous all right so where do
I get this information from well you
type in angularfire 2 in Google or
angularfire 2 authentication you come to
this page right here and we could see
this method for anonymous these are the
details you use right here if you're
using the type of the login method of
email and password use this right there
and then social login redirect you have
Twitter there's also one for Facebook
there's github as well so I just thought
I'd throw that in there case you're
confused
alright and then our next and final
method is going to be send and
is what's going to be called when a user
clicks or hits the Enter key and after
they type something in into a text field
all right now inside of it this dot
items remember we define is property up
here and there's a push method on it
message and we'll say de se so that's I
defined right here so this is going to
be the value of whatever it is they type
in that text field so we're pushing it
to firebase and it will save this call
in a write you wouldn't really call it a
variable or a property called message
and message will be based on this
description right here and the
description is basically you know what
they do that's the idea of it at least
alright so this dot MSG Val equals empty
so we're just going to clear the text
field after they hit enter and we'll
save that is it very very simple stuff
here so you can of course expand this
for more functionality if you wish with
other methods like if you wanted people
to be able to delete stuff and all that
so you would just use this items and
then you would do a search for
angularfire two methods to find out the
other stuff that you could do to
manipulate your angularfire stuff now
we're not done yet so let's go to the
app component HTML for the template I'm
simply going to paste this in from the
written tutorial and I'll do a real
quick look at you know what exactly your
description of what's happening here so
the first element here we have our
button click event and when somebody
clicks this event login will be called
once you define right here and then we
also have an NG if so if the name does
not exist or in other words right here
if this is has not being called then
we're going to show the anonymous login
button
this whole element right here
simple and then we have an input type of
text and we have it also another ngf if
name so this will only show if they are
logged in and that's the text field
we have placeholder and then we also
have event binding right here based on a
key up enter so somebody clicks the
Enter key it's going to call send and
send in the event target value which is
how you get to currently enter text of
the input and then we're also using to a
binding on ng model for message Val so
whenever we update this inside of the I
the component class it will update here
and we'll send that so that's how we're
able to clear it and then finally we
also have a paragraph here and we're
using ng for to iterate through let item
of items this is coming from right here
and also in the constructor which loads
when the app loads so this items we're
going to grab all of it from messages
and we use the async pipe and then I'm
just putting in like a quick SVG graphic
right here if you want to know where to
get that by the way I just went here to
icon finder calm typed in pin or you can
type in thumbtack or something I have a
free and no link back required and I I
used one of these I believe either way
once you do find one also one that has
an SVG version this is just PNG only
works one with SVG I will say this click
on it I click on SVG it'll download it
then just rename it to what I have a
save as here as pin and you want to save
it in the folder that's right here
assets and then images I'll go ahead and
create a new folder real quickly and
I'll put my version of the SVG in here
we go
pinned SVG and there we go
and then finally we're using
interpolation on item dot message and
that's the main remember that we save
each of these messages to
and that's it for the HTML additionally
we have CSS here so I'm going to go
ahead and paste in a few rule sets from
the written tutorial I'm not really
going to describe it it's just for
different rule sets just kind of
structuring the basic layout nothing
special is happening here just using a
flexbox layout here for the detailed
container and then the child elements
are the paragraph elements alright all
very standard stuff we'll save that
there's also a global stylesheet located
right here and source I'm going to paste
in that as well and it's just styling
just you know overall stuff very general
simple to understand
I also we're going to go to index.html
and I want to paste in real quickly I
write here these two lines so the first
one is linking to I this foundation
hosted flexgrid minimized version of
foundation 6 and that's just real
quickly to help me structure that basic
layout and then also google api is for
the font-family
railway so we'll save that as well
and after you've ran ng serve go to your
localhost 4200 and as you can see we
just have this simple anonymous login
button we click it and now it shows up
what is it that you do now currently I
have nothing entered into the database
let me drag over real quickly that
firebase console and we'll see that it's
currently empty so let's go ahead and
enter something what is it that I do I'm
a full stack dev at Gary's I'm calm and
enter there we go
immediately this updates
let me ask put this a little bit so I
can show you bring this guy over here
down just a bit and over so now I'm also
into lifting RR look at that awesome
stuff alright so if you guys want to
visit the example which I've also linked
in the description you could play around
with this demo as well and that is it
alright so hopefully you found that
pretty helpful obviously it's a very
simple example but really there's a lot
there because I hope to get up and
running real quickly and it would be up
to you then to add more features and
functionality if you wish so once again
it's the same process of as angular 2
when it comes to integrating firebase
and angular 4 there's not many major
breaking changes with angular 4
fortunately alright so make sure you
subscribe here on youtube if you haven't
yet and check out course cetera com see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
