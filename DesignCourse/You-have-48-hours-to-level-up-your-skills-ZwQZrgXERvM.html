row a happy Black Friday I'm sure you're
excited to see yet another deal being
crammed down your throat but really I
wouldn't do this unless I was doing
something awesome in terms of a deal and
so as you know at course Tetrick on my
site I sell courses and it's based on a
subscription the yearly subscription
price is 80 today and the next day next
48 hours really it'll be twenty nine
dollars so you're saving over 50 bucks
on a year's worth of course access for
all my courses so if you check out
course cetera comm four slash courses
you see everything you get access to
you'll see pro versions and free as well
so there's a lot of stuff here that's
based on angular 2 4 &amp;amp; 5 as well as
ionic 2 &amp;amp; 3 for building hybrid apps and
also just web apps as well and so when
you join up you'll see you could just go
the route of $9 a month and you can
cancel you know within that same month
if you want or Black Friday for the next
48 hours at 29 bucks so yeah definitely
take advantage of this I don't do it
often as you know if you follow this
channel and very shortly I'm going to be
going full-time so there's gonna be a
ton of courses coming out so I think you
know sometime in January perhaps at the
very beginning all of my focus is going
to be on my service here in the channel
I won't be doing courses for other
networks anymore not not on a regular
basis as I happen for the last five
years alright and also we're going to be
covering a brand new topic starting next
week which is going to be electron where
you can create desktop apps for multiple
operating systems using web tech such as
JavaScript
alright so consider joining it's one way
to support the channel or not just keep
on watching all the free content not a
big deal all right I'll see you guys
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
