challenge is to design an app login
screen forget this an anarchist dating
website that's right over a month ago I
developed designed and launched in
anarchists libertarian dating website
and for this challenge I thought it
would be fun to make the task be to
design an app login screen for a mobile
app version of the website so real
quickly I'm going to switch over to the
desktop and I will show you the
challenge page right here and so to
access this we go to course cetera com
click on challenges and we'll see it
right up here at the top and six days
from now and I'm going to scroll down so
for the challenge description love or
lust is in your heart that's right
whether or not you like it and you
download a brand adapt to fill the void
so you tap that at no I mean app
launcher and the first screen you're
presented with is the one that you're
responsible for designing so your
objective to design the login screen for
an app for not a fictional dating
service called an arcade out lava need
to fix that and just to show you real
quick it's linked up here this is the
site we have over 875 real members
already pretty damn cool and we may
launch a mobile app and I thought it'd
be great to give you guys the challenge
of designing the login screen which we
may or may not use I so the requirements
okay listen up very importantly cuz I
know a lot of people they glaze over the
requirements the welcome screen must
include the following elements that it's
the logo you can download it right here
it's in AI file so you can open that up
in adobe illustrator or Photoshop it
must also include a login with facebook
button or the social social login and or
label underneath it typically and a text
field for email a text book for password
a login button and they forgot password
link alright so that's very important
include all of those I please make sure
you present a large enough mock-up jpg
so that we can see the elements if it's
too small I've you're going to get a
little score essentially now you're free
to customize the background however you
wish but make sure it's with good design
in mind it's relevant and there's good
contrast with the foreground elements
and the next part is real important to
keep the design more simple with flat
design in mind as opposed to a lot of
effects like crazy saturated gradients
drop shadows all over the way all over
the place glows bevels etc good luck and
over here we have just some app login
screens that are inspiration these don't
necessarily match the requirements up
here but they're just designed well and
I would happy be happy to see these type
of entries and that is basically it so
go ahead you have six days from now to
submit your entry and the winner will
receive free access to our Android and
app design development course and in the
future we're going to have more prizes
but we're going to be working that out
with various service providers based on
the type of design challenge all right
so I go ahead and submit and I'm looking
forward to reviewing all these all right
I will talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
