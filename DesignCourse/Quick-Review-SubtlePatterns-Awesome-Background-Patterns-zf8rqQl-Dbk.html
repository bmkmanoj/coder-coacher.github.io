today we're going to do a quick review
of a really good resource for designers
called subtle patterns calm alright so
subtle patterns is a list of 380 plus
it's growing currently by the time
recording this there's 380 different
background patterns that you can use in
your designs for a multitude of purposes
including web design print design etc so
I'm just going to do a real quick review
we're going to switch over to the screen
and I'll show you just how you can use
it in a very basic sense alright so here
we are at subtle patterns calm and I see
right away the background here is just
meant to look transparent I or emulate
you know the typical Photoshop
transparency and so I if you hover over
all these different patterns and I think
there's something like over 380
currently at the time of recording this
video you can preview it on the actual
website background which is kind of
handy I so there's all sorts of
different types of backgrounds in a
really cool graphical illustrative type
of backgrounds and then there's textured
back backgrounds as well and if you know
anything about Photoshop you know that
you're not limited or restricted just
using these backgrounds as they stand so
let's take a background like this one
right here gray washed wall all right so
if you click download it will download a
zip file and you open that zip file up
you have the folder name right here and
then you have a a bigger version or
smaller version so if we double-click on
this will open up in Photoshop will see
this is the background size for this
particular pattern which repeats well I
if you wanted to use this in like a real
world scenario with icon on website or
on a div background or something like
that I was just real quickly I'm going
to get up a document here something like
around just for now so it fits within my
current resolution I'm just going to do
8 59 x 600
and at a hundred percent that fits well
within this area and let's say I we have
I don't know maybe like a dark blue sort
of background and let's also say that
you know this is the top of the website
for example and you want to have it kind
of in its own container with content
beneath it all right let's come over
here we'll take this ctrl a ctrl C real
quickly or yeah yeah what we can do is
just go to edit define pattern will call
this gray wash I think that's what it
was called and now that it's a pattern
we can double click on our rectangle and
go to pattern overlay and select from
our list right here and this is the one
that we just selected all right so when
you do that you have several different
ways and methods both destructive and
non-destructive I methods of
manipulating the look of this so you're
not confined to just using it as is so
one such way a non destructive ways by
just messing around with these other
gradient overlay and possibly probably
not the gradient overlay because it
wouldn't be uniform but color overlay
for sure so if we turn on color light
cover the color overlay you'll see that
I you can't see it because the blend
mode is normal but if you take this and
you hit your down arrow key or you just
select them individually you'll see that
we can begin to change the appearance of
this so that's kind of handy and so
depending on which overlay mode you're
using or not using you can see how it
affects the appearance alright so
actually let me go back real quick and
turn that back on hit OK another way is
to right-click and specify rasterize
layer style and then you have these that
you can adjust up here so you can take
your adjustment layers take the
brightness down maybe the contract
up a lot and if you only want it to
affect that layer click on that button
right there and you can also apply all
these other adjustment layers like hue
and saturation as well so let's say for
example we hit color color eyes we
wanted to give it a blue and the
saturation as well you can play with now
maybe something like that then obviously
you can see going from this we can
adjust it make decent amount of
adjustments that way although what you
would probably do because you want to
maintain the exact size because this is
something that repeats is do it over
here and then once you know what you
want it to look like you could go ahead
and apply specifically to this size
since it is a very specific size because
this repeats 350 x 2 59 but anyhow
that's just a quick rundown of how you
can use subtle patterns is calm in order
to get some really cool patterns and
textures for any type of design really
especially it's especially useful
obviously for um let's see here web
design obviously so yeah very cool
designs I like I said there's currently
I think it lists it's somewhere how many
patterns they oh right here yeah 382
patterns awesome stuff there's also a
photoshop plugin as well what you don't
have I which would definitely be handy
