hey everyone Garry Simon of course set
row today I'm going to take a look at
JavaScript animation using something
called pop promotion now a pop motion
which is available at pop motion Daioh
is a very small lightweight but very
powerful and feature pack JavaScript
animation library alright so if I switch
over to the desktop we could see here is
pop motion I oh and it provides you with
just a basic overview you know what this
library will bring to the table in terms
of all the different types of animations
they have an API section a learn section
and the tutorial that I'm about to do
for you it's not going to be exhaustive
it would take an entire course to really
go over all the capabilities of this
library however I'm going to try to do
enough to the point at which you will
have confidence understanding how to
integrate it with your own project
alright so I this is what we're going to
do I
in this tutorial right here so if i
refresh you'll see the animations that
we'll be focusing on
all right so initially we have this
animation where it fades in and we can
also have this sort of spring effect
where the actual form elements come in
and bounce by the way it's really smooth
on my end but it might look jerky on
this video just because of the frame way
frame rate and also we have this
secondary little blip that says full
name please this comes in only after
this animation is finished and you'll
see how we can sorry I have a sore
throat you'll see how we can integrate
that all right so also you can use pop
motion with a lot of the popular
JavaScript front-end frameworks like
react view etc but we're just gonna keep
it simple it was straight up vanilla
JavaScript so
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a
six-pack each month that's it now also
it probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe
here on YouTube and be sure to make sure
the notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it to get started
we're gonna go ahead and make a new
directory m'kay derp we're gonna call
this animation and we'll also hop into
it after creating it okay so the first
thing we want to do is NPM and by the
way this means you need the node package
manager and nodejs
installed so just to check if you have
that note - v NP M - V if not go to
node.js or can download it and reload
your console or command line alright so
the first thing we want to do is create
a package JSON file for our project so
I'm gonna hit the Y flag just to hit YES
on all of these and then we're going to
use NPM to install pop motion and save
it as a dependency in our package JSON
file alright so I'm also using Visual
Studio code which means if installed we
can just type code in a period and it
will open up our code editor in the
current window alright so that is right
here
okay so after this we want to create an
index on HTML file so let's do that real
quick let me also increase the size of
this so you can see everything I'm
typing and from here we want to create
just new a basic boilerplate HTML file
here so if I just type that we'll get up
by the shorthand syntax or the quick
snippet for creating that and also we
can see right here I'm actually not
right there I'm going to paste in a line
real quick we're gonna link a CSS file
so in CSS folder main CSS so let's go
ahead and create that real quick
and also by the way I all the code
there's going to be some code that I may
paste in like small blips like that in
that case just go to my site I order the
link the first link in the description
YouTube has a full written version of
this video tutorial with all of the code
that's already there so that will save
you time so inside of this CSS folder
we're going to create a main CSS and I'm
going this is gonna be one of the points
where I just paste in all the CSS this
is not obviously a CSS tutorial so this
is going to be the point where you
definitely want to visit the written
tutorial and then just scroll down until
you see the CSS right here and paste it
in so that looks like this right here in
the written version of this tutorial so
just copy and paste all that and nothing
special is happening here it's just - I
give ourselves some style to create that
form that we saw at the beginning
alright so also the next thing we need
to do is we need to get a pop motion
actually integrated here so we're going
to once again do this through script
source this is the address of it pop
motion by way it is just Levin KB very
lightweight and if you were using
something like react or angular you
would import pop motion via
import between from pop motion import
tween etc so I now what we want to do is
go ahead and add our initial HTML here I
will actually type this out simply
because it'll help us I it'll help you
understand a little bit better what
we're trying to do what we're going to
be animating itself so I'm just going to
create a div class of container and then
also we'll put in an h1 fill it out in
terms of the form and then P and this
part I'm just going to you can put some
lorem ipsum text if you wish I'm just
going to paste this in right here
alright and then next underneath that
we'll have our actual form and we'll
have a span class of message and this by
the way is going to be hidden by a
default and we will use our pop motion
to show it after the initial animations
come in so input type is text
placeholder is name and then class is
just going to be txt field or FLD now
we'll go ahead and hit ctrl R know what
rather sorry
shift all in the down arrow key if
you're using visual studio code to
replicate that and this one's just going
to say email address all right and then
finally we'll do that one more time and
this one will be a submit the value
will equal enter info and then class is
just going to be BTN all right and so
that is it for our HTML very very very
simple stuff right there so now if we if
a control B to get our sidebar right
click reveal an explorer double click
this is what it should look like
obviously no animation at this point
okay so what do we do if we want to
actually animate this sucker we'll go
ahead and just right here in the control
B to get rid of that sidebar just
underneath our script we're going to put
some JavaScript underneath it now of
course you could link I've through a
source you know another or separate
JavaScript file if you wish but I want
to make things simple and just make it
here on the same page so we can kind of
go quickly back and forth between our
HTML elements all right so the first
thing we need to do is create constants
that will access each element that we
want to animate so the first one that we
want to animate is the container itself
and so our goal is to take that
container fade it in scale it up from
like 0.7 to its original size at 1 and
also maybe move it down on the y-axis
vertically so what we'll do is constant
container equals pop motion dot styler
so pop motion is what we use to
reference any of the specific methods
inside of actual pop motion now if you
were to use something like react or view
or angular or whatever you wouldn't have
to reference pop motion dot whatever all
right so now we'll have inside of here
document dot and this is just right here
is pure JavaScript to use the query
selector to get our class in the name of
the class that we want to animate of
course is container right here all right
we're gonna replicate that so shift alt
down two more times because we want to
animate three different elements
next we're gonna say this one is going
to be called form elements this one will
be called msg pop all right so right
here we also have two for this we're not
going to use pop motion styler we're
simply going to directly reference the
query selector without that this of
course is gonna be inner as you can see
inner will just contain everything
actually oh it's not there let me add
that real quick div class equals inner
I'll try to remember to update the
written version of the tutorial there we
go so everything all the actual content
inside a container is going to be in
another container called inner that will
allow us to animate this stuff
specifically because if we were to use
the container it wouldn't work the way
we wanted to you'll see all right then
finally message pop the eye we're gonna
use the pop motion styler as well and
this is going to be msg this class is
right here just being in class msg okay
all right so next let's say we want to I
focus on that container element and get
that showing up so let me come over here
real quick so let's say we want this to
fade in and kind of scale out so how do
we perform a basic animation or tween
all right so to do that come down here
and we will say pop motion tween and we
open up in parentheses and an object
inside of it so we'll say for the first
property from we open up another object
here and we'll say scale 0.7 so it's
going to start from 0.7 the size of 0.7
essentially which is 70% of its default
size based on however we set it up in
CSS next we're going to put a comma
after this from object and we're going
to put in two and it's structured the
same way scale 1
then after this we're gonna put in
duration we'll say a thousand
milliseconds which of course is equal to
one second after this parenthesis we can
put start and then container dot set so
container dot set right here this is a
reference to our variable right here or
a constant container which references
our container class and it basically
sets these properties to that container
that's what makes it animate that
specific element right here all right so
now let's go ahead and save this but
before we look at this
you may be wondering where did I get all
of these properties from how do I know
they exist well of course if we go to
our documentation which of course is not
up right now one second pop motion and
we take a look at for instance tween
we'll see under the API section they
have all of the different types of
features in animations that you can use
so for tween it tells you exactly what
it does tells you how to import it how
to use it and this is going to give you
if you scroll down more all of the
properties so we see from - the duration
the elapsed obviously there's a lot you
can do with this a lot of really cool
stuff that you can do with you know
really all the animations that they
provide all right so that's just
something handy that you should know ok
so now let's go ahead and refresh there
we go very nice smooth animation awesome
now what if we wanted to animate
multiple properties well let's go back
here we simply separate these through
commas right here so let's say opacity
we want it to fade in from zero so it'll
be hidden and then opacity 1 save it
we'll go back
voila you can see that it now fades in
let's add one more and that will be on
the y-axis so vertically will have it
come down from negative 300 to zero
which is its starting position save it
and refresh yeah good stuff I like it
all right so let's say I focus on
creating its stagger animation so let's
say we want the individual elements here
just like to fill it out this this blip
right here this input this input and
this button we wanted to kind of I do
its own unique animation and we want it
to spring so what do I mean by spring
well if we go back to pop motion it'll
show you right here this spring effect
all right of course we're not going to
be dragging anything in our example but
it shows you what the spring effect is
it kind of just goes back and forth and
into a nice sort of eye animation in the
end where it slows down and it goes back
to the original point so if you want to
know how to do this more go simply go to
pop motion to i/o and hits spring and
also stagger stagger is here somewhere
right here and this is what we're going
to use so we're gonna use stagger along
with I this the other animation ability
of spring alright so it gives you all
the information you can get more
information by clicking on this and
finding out even more all right so let's
go back real quick and the following I
JavaScript that we have is actually
taken from one of the examples at pop
ocean alright so we'll say const stylers
equals array so we're creating an array
here and we're gonna use from form
elements dot children
what is that so we're creating an array
if we see form elements is right here we
define that as inner so it's going to
take an array it's going to create an
array based on all of these HTML
elements right here that are contained
within inner so h1 our paragraph or form
etc so then we're going to map pop
motion dots Tyler next we'll put in an
animations constant which is an array
and it's going to take in our stylers
dot length and we're going to fill pop
motion spring now this is where he
created the spring effect will say from
100 to 0 now if you're confused just
hang with me a second and I'll explain
it
our final line is pop motion dot stagger
animations and so we're gonna stagger
this right here and along with a
duration I that will occur between so
we'll say 100 milliseconds between so
it's gonna be pretty fast and we'll
start it and we'll say V is V dot for
each and then we're going to take X in
the index to stylers dot i and we're
going to set the x property which is the
x position to X which is the result and
so what is happening here is we're first
again creating an array from the form
elements all right so everything inside
of that inner class and then we define
an animation for each array using fill
right here and in this case we're going
to create a spring animation that goes
from 100 to
zero all right so it's going to come in
from the right on the x-axis
a hundred pixels and then it's going to
come to its original starting position
all right so then we use stagger while
passing in the animations in the first
argument and of course the time between
it is the second and that's the the
delay and then the staggering animation
is started with the start method here
which iterates over the animations array
VF for each right here and then it's
going to take the values of X and sets
the X property to the values of 100 and
0 as it integrates over those so it's a
little bit confusing especially if you
you know really haven't messed with too
much JavaScript but let's save this and
refresh and we'll see there we go all
right so what if we wanted to make that
on the y-axis axis not access we'll just
change that to Y for set and you'll see
it now comes down or up rather
cool alright awesome so let's also as a
final part of this tutorial figure out
what it takes to start an animation when
another animation is finished through a
complete callback so what we're gonna do
is create I well first we're going to
make an adjustment I this by default
will automatically run or start this
tween animation well we can just if we
bind it to a constant like Const my
annum and get rid of start we can
reference to my annum some other point
in time in the future input dot start
whenever we want it's actually start so
that's the first step the next step is
we're going to create another animation
and this time it's going to be a
keyframe animation and so what we'll do
is simply copy that whole thing call
this my nm too and we're gonna say
instead of the tween we're gonna try
keyframes and again if you're at all
confused about what that is just check
out the keyframe section of pop motion
Daioh and instead of a from--in - we're
going to put in values which is an array
I'm just gonna get rid of everything
here so we have an array and then it's
an array of objects so the first one
we'll put in my negative 50 opacity 0
oops there we go sorry about that
because we're gonna have a few of these
we might as well just keep this all on
the same line then we put a comma and
then I'll hit shift alt and down three
more times so next we'll put in negative
20 opacity is going to be one and we're
gonna keep that same exact value for two
and three and that way we can make it
stay there stationary and then finally
we'll make it go to zero and opacity
will be zero
so next let's put a comma here and we're
going to put in x this allows you to
control the timing or how long it stays
on each step of the keyframe sequence so
we'll say zero for the first one we'll
say and by the way these all go from
zero to point two and their comma
separated so we'll say point two for the
next one point eight for where it sits
on this one so then point or one as a
total so now let's put in a comma and
then finally to make this work we
reference my annum dot start and inside
of here by the way notice how this I
this this helper shows us exactly you
know the different parameters that this
given method accepts so we're going to
put in update container dot set which is
the same thing as just doing for
instance start and it's a container dot
set but it allows you to optionally
specify update and complete so then
we're gonna put it in complete we'll
have a arrow function and we'll say my
annum to start and message pop dot set
in message pop by the way it's defined
right here so we're making it applied to
that span element right here so this
will start this animation of my annum to
will start once my annum
the first one is complete right here you
could also console.log and we'll do that
too so console.log first annum done all
right
so let's save that and check it out
whoo that was actually not as long as I
thought it would be
let me I yeah I think I meant for that
to be three seconds there we go that was
a little bit too fast awesome
yeah Sophie a cultural shift I will see
you first and I'm done will refresh done
and it starts okay so hopefully you
learned quite a bit I and you'll have
some confidence going forward I may do
another tutorial where I integrate it
into something like angular and that way
you have more possibilities in terms of
creating these really cool animation
sequences that pop motion allows for
