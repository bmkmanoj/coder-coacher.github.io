today we're going to be focusing on the
third part of the unity room tutorial
and we're going to be actually in unity
and actually make this a rap reality at
this point it's actually pretty quick
and easy all right so if you need access
to the project files are available for
free at design course calm and if you
haven't yet subscribe here on YouTube
all right to get started alright so we
ended yesterday with the these textures
right here and what we want to do now
obviously save them I didn't have you
save I'm hopefully you you took it upon
yourself to save these things and we can
save them as Photoshop document so you
can save this and we're going to call
this wall dash diffuse and then come
back and also over here ctrl shift and
say or s which basically is a shortcut
for saving as so do that we'll call this
no floor ceiling dash diffuse and I'm
going to hide this and get rid of that
all right so now what we want to do is
load up unity now i have my previous
project kind of open here i want to go
to new file a new project and i'm going
to include a character controller i'm
also going to include the skyboxes
actually no not i don't need the
skyboxes I think that's all I need is
just a character controller hopefully if
not we can always import it later so I'm
going to hit create and wait for this to
load up
all right okay so if you've never used
unity before it's a lot like blender in
some ways this portion at least what we
want to do is basically import our 3d
objects the meshes that we created in
blender all right so I basically if you
right click import new asset I'm going
to go to my project directory and we
have our room dot blend so we'll go
ahead and import that and we can drag
this to the stage alright cool stuff so
if we didn't do that part where we
flipped the normals while we want to be
able to see this correctly we would only
be able to see the outside but once we
put that character controller in all
these walls would be invisible all right
so basically I if I guess I'm just to
show you what this looks like but just
by default will go ahead to stand or
assets and the character controller that
we imported when we created the project
so just take this first person and and I
well we'll drag them there and he's kind
of below everything so we can move them
up over this way okay where are you man
get over here oh wow okay we're going to
have to scale this up so if you just
take that and hit II know our sorry
that's the shortcut for scale take this
one in the middle and just scale is
thing up a lot then hit W which is move
and then to move this over here alright
so now I let's get our character
controller over here somewhere yeah
there is move it up and I think I don't
scale that down to you can also scale
the character controller down so so
we'll go ahead and hit our w alright and
if you want to move around in the
viewport I which something I didn't
really go over I it's a little bit
different than blender so you can just
hold alt and left-click and that gets
you around here mouse will of course is
the same thing as blender
I Japan same thing shift in third mouse
button and then just right clicking will
get you be able to look around in your
media area basically all right so now if
we were to go ahead and hit play we
would just fall through the floor and
it's all the way up there we can see so
to fix that we can take our floor come
over here and all by the way when you
just click this it's going to select
everything that was imported all the
individual objects and of course we have
three we have the logo the wall and then
the floor and ceiling I then I if you
click left click one more time it'll
lets you select the individual I you
know mesh I guess you can say so select
the floor and ceiling there add
component type in Collider up here for
the search and choose mesh Collider we
want to do the same thing to the walls
because if we bump up against it right
now if I ought to show you will fall out
so we will fix that by selecting nose
add component mesh Collider so now if we
hit play we can see that there's no
texture here well one way we can improve
that is going to game object create
other and point light alright so this
will give us some light to basically
work with Soviet play now it feels like
I'm very claustrophobic because this is
tiny still so let's go ahead and scale
this up the whole object so we're going
to hit are now right around there it
might be too big we'll see though and
also you want to make sure when you come
when it comes to placing this that he is
I not through the floor so okay to pace
of life but not below because you'll
just fall below and let's also rotate
the camera angle right now it's looking
out that way so if you hit
II we can rotate them to be looking just
in that general direction all right
that's much better so everything still
kind of looks bad because we don't have
any textures applied so let's go ahead
and import our actual textures so if we
click on materials will basically you
can import anything anywhere it depends
on where you're currently selected I so
what I want to do is just right click
import asset and then we will choose
wall diffuse right click import asset
floor and ceiling diffuse as well all
right so let's go ahead and just click
on our walls right there so you left
click twice and will drag on to that the
wall diffuse which will left-click drag
and put it right over here where it says
none texture alright so by default if we
want to go ahead and hit play now now
remember as I mentioned before some of
the UVs are overlapping so that's why
even though we only put it in one spot
we can see it's in multiple all right so
it doesn't look like anything shining
you know it kind of looks a little bit
bland but it looks a lot better than a
bit without it obviously so let's go
ahead and add a or going to change this
rather and we're going to change it to
bump diffuse so when we change it to
that we have an option to specify a
normal map so we don't have a normal map
though so we can create one in Photoshop
so let's switch back to photoshop choose
this right here we're going to go ahead
and hit ctrl a edit copy merged and that
basically allows us to copy everything
on all layers instead of there's the
layer that's currently selected we'll go
ahead and hit file at new hit OK ctrl-v
to paste image adjustments and
desaturate and what we want to do
is if you haven't yet from my previous
tutorial you want to install a free
plug-in from nvidia and that is down
here filter and video tools normal map
filter so this will create normal maps I
i'll go ahead and link that so that you
can get that installed and reload
photoshop so you can get to this point
so normal map filter just going to leave
the scale at around 15 everything else
you can leave the same hit okay alright
and then we'll go ahead and save this as
Walt remove diffuse and just change this
to normal alright we're going to do the
same thing with the ceiling as well just
because we're here so we'll take
everything edit copy merged control n
enter control V image adjustments
desaturate and then go ahead to filter
normal map filter hit OK save oops no
not for web just ctrl s floor-to-ceiling
call this normal PSD now we'll go back
into unity and we will import both of
those files so we take wall normal you
know what I don't know why they don't
allow you to specify multiple files like
if I hold shift or control i can't
select multiple so that's kind of
annoying maybe there's something else
you have to do that I don't know about
it alright so well normal floor ceiling
normal let's select on the wall and
let's drag on oops scroll down and drag
on wall normal when you do that you have
to hit fix now and then when we hit play
we could see now it has some like depth
to it and you know what I probably
should not have included this blood
there because that doesn't really look
too real so let me go back real quick
that's irritating i was telling myself i
probably should not have included that
so I'm going to take this deselect here
control and just hide it edit copy
merged go back here too well normal just
hide that paste that in image
adjustments and desaturate filter normal
hit OK ctrl s to save fortunately it
doesn't auto update here so i have to
get rid of that while normal import wall
norm normal now and then it will
automatically update there now that
looks better much better okay alright
cool so now let's go ahead and get the
ceiling up what we want to do is take
this right here this material which is
basically this and duplicate that so
ctrl D and what I want to do is go ahead
and sorry some type of error popped up
off-screen let me it fixed now on that
sorry I didn't fix that so when we
looked at it there now that's much
better ok now we want to take I this
material this new duplicated one and
apply it right there and if we just hit
play for the heck of it this is what
that looks like is completely messed up
so what we need to do is fix those so
I'm going to take floor ceiling put it
right there and then also for ceiling
right here hitfix hit play
all right of course we did kind of leave
that in the I'm not going to bother
fixing that one though all right so now
what we want to do is for this wall and
ceiling we want these two really kind of
just glow the windows right now that
they don't doesn't look like there's
light outside so the way we do that is
we switch to a self-illumination texture
so bump diffuse and when we do that
everything gets real bright including
the windows but we don't have an
illumination texture applied so it just
kind of makes everything really bright
when you don't have one applied so we're
going to go ahead and create one and
it's real simple we will go ahead and
take this and move back Control Alt + Z
will move you back several steps
wherever you need to be to get here and
what we'll do is simply take the
rectangular marquee tool select inside
of our window roughly right around there
come over here hit shift select inside
of there alright I'm going to hold all
and use my scroll wheel to zoom out
control shift I to select everything
else and then just hit delete and then
hit ctrl D and then that is our simple
illumination filter so what we'll do is
I actually you know what I want to do um
yea sorry I'm going to back up what I
want to do is copy all this and I will
delete this and then paste it again so
it's on its own layer and then what I
want to do is simply drop down the
opacity quite a bit and see what that
does so I'm going to go ahead and save
as we'll call this wall dash I ll a PSD
well go ahead unity import that and
we'll see if that does anything
hopefully it does
alright let's go ahead and hit play all
right so it looks like those are
definitely a lot more bright I'm going
to experiment real quick and what
happens if we just get rid of all those
and just hit save file save or ctrl s go
back delete this illumination import
okay so you can see how much darker not
having anything really gets you I think
I'm going to leave it like that we'll
use lights here to fix that I how dark
it is currently alright so now what we
want to do is really start to play
around I with the lighting and trying to
get everything kind of working here so
we have this light over here if I hit W
we can move it over let's come up here
near the top somewhere all right and
over here we have our properties for the
light the range if you increase this by
left-clicking and dragging really makes
things brighter I kind of want
everything to have kind of like a at any
afternoon sunny type of tint to it so we
can change the color right here you
don't want to go too much because then
it looks a little bit weird you can also
change the intensity and you don't want
to do too much on the intensity side
either so if we get in here we hit play
alright that's pretty cool everything
looks you know a lot better now at this
point the logo is too big so I'm going
to scale that down e are screwing that
up
Center him up all right and what I also
want to do is kind of make some
adjustments here in terms of the quality
so if we go to edit project settings
quality by default anti-aliasing is
turned off it's disabled depending on
you know your computer specs you may
want to leave it off or I'm just going
to turn mine up to 8 and that
immediately just mix for cleaner lines
everywhere and equality is a lot better
all right okay so let's go ahead and add
some more lights here so I'm going to
take this light duplicate it ctrl D and
I'm going to come on top I alt and left
clicking shift in third mouse button I'm
going to put one by our windows and
we're going to take that range down a
lot just to right around 3.37 density
may be up around there
alright so if I hit play that's right up
there okay and let's go ahead and
duplicate that a couple times control D
now there's something important to note
if you start adding quite a bit of
lights I some of them like they won't
work so what happens is if you go to
edit render settings and actually it's
not render settings I but real quickly
now that we're here I want to make a
couple changes I we can turn on fog
which is actually pretty interesting and
if we change the fog density you can
really see it begins to fill up quickly
when you move that slide or if we change
that to like point 0.03 give it that
yellowish tint slightly I actually make
that point zero to see what ambient
light does exactly you're right around
there and hit play you can see that we
kind of have just some interesting
results here so I'm going to go ahead
and hit play again to get out there and
also let's go yeah edit project settings
in quality yeah pixel light count if you
put this up from to maybe 28 we can see
that lat that light came back and it's
actually working now eyes and they both
are so if we take them patrol d take
this one maybe move it over here and
then move this one
oh wait and i don't think i duplicated
that one oh well
so having issues uh sometimes my control
key does not work right you have to get
a new mouse here then just one more
hit play
all right looking pretty interesting so
let me I what HAP's I want to take this
down I think in terms of intensity
that's a little bit too dark maybe up
just a little bit more alright so I now
what I want to do is go ahead and work
on this thing right here so by default
it kind of just has this main color of
blue and we can really play around with
these I these different shaders to
experiment with this thing so i'm going
to use reflective and just kind of
experiment with how this looks and so
take my main color back around that
yellow area may be right around there in
the reflection color you can experiment
with that i'm just going to make it
white and let's just hit play so now it
doesn't look all that good I but what we
can do is let's rotate it so to rotate
we have to do just one line of code
basically to make this thing rotate
around indefinitely so what we need to
do is come over here to assets right
click create and see script alright so
what we want to do now is apply that see
script to this object right here so drag
it in right there so now if we hit edit
we can open in this tool called
monodevelop now let me scale this window
down right around there
and oh I edited the shader by accident
let me fix that real quick sorry about
that it's this one that we want to edit
so if we double click on the name this
is where we get this stuff so the void
start void update so we'll add this in
void update and we'll type in transform
rotate and then parentheses 0 a comma 50
times time dot Delta time and then comma
0 now these are your axis is basically
the first is you know we have actually
I'm not sure which one the access is for
this I know this is X so this might be
why over here so I had to actually
search this so I mean I can't really
describe exactly everything that's
happening but that's all it is so I did
I went to Google how to rotate an object
indefinitely unity and I found the
answer just by playing around so I yeah
save that and with any luck this will
now rotate want to hit play oh no we got
to figure that out now you know why
that's happening is because I noticed
that the center point the origin center
point was not in the center of the
object so that's why when it's rotating
it's rotating around a different point
outside let me so I paused and
researched it and you really can't
change the pivot point from within here
so we have to go back here to blender
unfortunately I open that up and we
could see if we have this selected it's
the pivot points out there unfortunately
so if we go to set origin origin to
geometry now it is in the direct center
of this so now if we save this control s
come back here
unfortunately we're going to have to
readjust this situation I think so let
me go ahead and just see fi I know if we
right-click on room I can hit reimport
huh let me it's giving me an error
basically so let me just try to read
sorry my cam software stopped working I
stopped recording I but anyhow I'm going
to delete that actually what I'm going
to do is delete the room everything goes
bye-bye hit import room and we have to
make some adjustments because usually it
doesn't save the actual I let me come
over here curve where are you oh there
you are
and for some reason has it stuck out
there but at least we can see that it's
in the center now so I'm just going to
move it back come back and just make
sure it's kind of centered up here I the
lights are also off unfortunately and
also the player controller will add that
I found to be such a pain in the ass
whenever you have to reimport something
I let's get this back in there oh wait
this is different I'm sorry trying to
look for my main camera the first person
controller was outside there we go we're
not even using that over there make sure
that's on at the top good now if I hit
play we could see things are slightly
off but guess what our thing is now
rotating so that's good so with some of
the quick adjustments basically to these
lights take this one move it over where
it's supposed to be take this one move
it over
alright and now everything's kind of
back to where it should be oh I see a
tiny little X right there interesting
get over here I don't know what that was
anyhow I think you get the point so yeah
I yeah I think I'm just going to end it
there we could probably mess around with
this may be a little bit more changing
this maybe maybe also real quickly add
another light my control key is acting
up again there we go had to pause until
it worked ridiculous and yeah take this
take the range down going to get it in
front here
that way when it rotates it looks like
there's some more light coming into it
and you can party one more but anyhow
yeah that is it very simple room I it's
something just now we can you know
basically get done in an hour
collectively I know it went over three
days but I but yeah of course is a
beginner tutorial and I definitely plan
on doing a lot more elaborate projects
and actual scenes that kind of make
sense in the future alright so I'm Gary
Simon of ds9 course com subscribe here
on youtube if you haven't yet all right
I'll see you tomorrow
