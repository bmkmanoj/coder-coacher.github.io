today we're going to step into blender
to do a two part 2 day video tutorial on
how to create a USB stick kind of
similar to Google's chromecast alright
so basically if you need access to the
project files they're available for free
at youtube and at design course calm and
subscribe here at YouTube if you haven't
yet all rights get started okay so if
you've never used a blender before
basically I to select objects you
right-click by default and to move
around you use your third or middle
mouse button to zoom up use your scroll
wheel and then Japan use hold shift in
that middle or third mouse button
alright so very simple so just so we're
looking at the same thing I'm gonna get
a file new and reload startup file and
I'm going to get rid of this cube
alright so basically the starting point
of the object is kind of like a circular
area and then it comes down into that
USB stick portion so what we want to do
is go to shift hit shift a and we'll
choose mesh circle alright so now what
we want to do is go to edit mode so an
object mode we can move things around
scale them up and rotate but if we go
and hit tab that puts us into edit mode
and that gives us a finer control of how
to manipulate a actual object so what we
want to do is basically extrude this up
so we hit e and you can see we can kind
of just move it around in any any which
way but if we want it to stay on a
specific access like the Z is that axis
we can just hit Z alright maybe just
stop right around there and then hit s4
scale to scale in slightly may be right
around there hit and then Z again right
around there left click and then hit s
to scale that in once more may be right
around that size alright so what we want
to do now is extend this down I i would
say probably starting right about here
so hit a to deselect hit B as in boy too
create this selection just left click
and drag these four works well and then
drag these down I'd say right around
there looks pretty accurate yeah right
around there and then what we want to do
is fill in this top portion with an
actual face so if you right click here
and hit alt oops sorry all right click
right there that will select all those
vertices on that same path hit F now and
that will fill it in all right very
simple alright so now what we want to do
is come over here I'm going to pull this
out we're going to click on this object
modifiers right here and we went sorry
object model fires right here we want to
add the mirror modifier alright so we
want it not to be on X to mirror it but
on the Z or Zed so now it's adding
everything up here as down here alright
so very simple alright so now what we
will also want to add I'm going to go
ahead and apply that by the way oops we
can't add in edit mode so hit tab to go
to object mode hit apply all right we'll
also go ahead and add a subdivision
surface right so this will basically
take everything and smooth it out a lot
so over here we want to i click on
smooth shading as well alright so i'm
going to take the divisions up to 34 the
view in the render and right now it
doesn't look good at all because the
subdivision surface really just kind of
makes everything I just pancake e so we
can go in and fix that by going back
into tab you can see our verses and
everything still remains the same
because we haven't applied the
subdivision surface so what we want to
do is add some edge loops so we hit ctrl
R add one right there hit ctrl R again
left click add one there hit ctrl R
again
I've click add one there and do this
basically around all of the potential
edges and then finally one right here
oops wrong key meditate ctrl z alright
so now if we I come back out we can see
it has definitely more definition I
think we could probably extend this down
a little bit further so if I go back
into edit mode hit a B and then pull it
down here also we can add some edge
loops if we go to 0 8 1 100 second I
forgot about that we have to turn on
this limit selection to visible so what
we have to do is a a B it'll select all
the verses that aren't in view and then
pull that down alright so we can add an
edge loop as well let's see here I let
me just select over here hit ctrl R
control are all right so now that's more
definition kind of looks more like the
actual USB stick from google chromecast
all right I so now what I want to do is
real quickly just add the actual part
that you actually the USB part that you
plug into I guess you call that the mail
or whatever so what we want to do is hit
a shift a will add a mesh cube hit asked
to scale that down just a little bit
pull it over there hit 7 on your number
pad and that gives you the top view that
way we can get things centered up a
little bit
I'm going to hit s and why to scale it
this way it's pretty much in center
right there I'm going to move it out a
little bit further we're going to hit
one and this is the front view although
it's not a front three will get us to
the right side but this is actual front
hit s &amp;amp; z yeah it's sticking out a
little bit too far I think it needs to
be scaled in a little bit on the y axis
if you hit seven and then S&amp;amp;Y move it up
just a tad all right and then what we
want to do is take the I go into edit
mode with this selected so hit tab will
go to face select right click this hit e
and then left click and then hit s to
scale it in now the amount of thickness
is at the top that we want here but over
here is a little bit too much to hit s
and then y and then scale that up right
around there then we want to do is hit s
and then also X oops no no no no sorry
hit II left click and then move it in
there we go alright so now let's go
ahead and just preview what this thing
looks like I just on a very basic level
so what we'll do is change from blender
render to Cycles render and by the way
i'm using blender 2.70 so if you're
using something earlier go ahead and
download the updated version and so now
what we want to do is go ahead into
rendered mode and we'll see everything's
just very bland in grey so let's take
our world
tab and take that color and turn it up a
bit all right and I'm also going to go
over here to the render section and
change the device to GPU compute and
come over here to sampling turn the
samples for rendering up to a thousand
and then for preview which is what we're
previewing now we'll go up to 100 that
just makes everything look a little bit
better although we can't tell right now
at this point alright so let's also get
it plain I over here so let's hoop
switch back here to solid and hit shift
a mesh in plane s for scale and will
scale it up by 20 actually maybe I hit s
too just to go by 40 or so all right and
let's go ahead real quick i'm going to
add a light or an emission plane so i'm
just going to come out here around here
maybe near the camera and shift a plane
and then our for rotate 45 and just
moving around here scale it up maybe by
to push it back just a bit and come over
here to the material is going to hit new
and then change the diffuse to where's
it at emissions around here somewhere
there it is okay and then also take the
strength up till about 10 so now if we
switch to rendered here we have some
light to work with yeah just right
around there and if we right click this
real quick and give it a new material
make it this color we can kind of get
the basic shape we could also right
click on this portion hit new change it
to I think I know where is it at
yeah and is so tropic I don't you know
how to pronounce that I'm so terrible I
and that way it looks like a chrome and
I'm going to end a tutorial right here
just for today and then we'll finish
this up tomorrow I yeah I'm still
dealing with a medical issue I'm just
I'm feeling dizzy and stuff so otherwise
I would finish it today but yeah I got
to spread these out of it for now until
I get this crap figure it out alright so
tomorrow what we'll do is we'll get it
looking like the actual material with a
very light bump kind of plastic dark
plastic material and then also go in
Photoshop and add the actual decal and
such right there alright so I'm Gary
