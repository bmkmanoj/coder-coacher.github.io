design course calm and the design letter
today we're going to take a look at the
gradient and we're going to take a look
at the gradient tool and the gradient
overlay option as a layer style a
gradient is basically going from one
color to another in a smooth transition
alright so let's go to file new it's
going to choose 800 x 500 with a
resolution of 72 hit OK zoom up here in
case you're not at a hundred percent
with the magnifying glass tool alright
so I'm going to take the paint bucket
tool and change the background to a
black okay let click alright so today
I'm going to illustrate the different
ways to create gradients and use them
through a button so let's get out our
type tool and I'm just going to have aro
around aerial rounded here and I'm going
to choose white as the foreground color
okay you can use whatever font you want
doesn't really matter so click type in
order now we're going to create you an
order button okay so underneath it let's
just select the background layer let's
use the rounded rectangular tool so I
gradient I'm gonna leave at ten pixels
or the radius and then I'm going to
choose a foreground color of a light
blue hit OK and then I'm just going to
select right around it just a big order
button basically all right okay so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
group these layers so with the shape one
layer selected hold ctrl and click on
order now and then over here new group
from layers you just call it button
hit OK alright so now we have I'm just
one single layer to go ahead and just
move this around alright so i'm going to
right click duplicate group actually let
me move over here right click duplicate
group hit ok hold shift and move over
right click duplicate group again it ok
hold shift and move it over again
alright so here are three buttons and
which will work with high gradients so
right off the bat um we don't have to
necessarily add a gradient to all of our
buttons that's just one thing I want to
emphasize don't over use gradients but
I'm going to show you how to use them
though alright so but so I expand the
very first button group that we have and
the first way to add a gradient is
through the gradient overlay option
we're not going to use this tool over
here alright so with the shape one layer
selected which is layer that we want to
add the gradient will right click or
double click I mean with the left mouse
button on the right side of the layer
and that brings this up these are the
layer style options we can apply all
these different types of layer styles to
this specific layer what we want to
focus on today is the gradient overlay
so if we click that it applies a default
gradient just from black to white or
white to blackish today we can set the
scale we put a 150 it starts way up here
our way down here and the way up here it
really scales it out whereas we go to
just ten percent you get the idea ok so
I'm just going to set it at 150 and then
if we click right here gradient we get
the gradient editor I we have all these
different presets just click one and it
automatically applies all these
different crazy-looking presets here
what I want to focus on is a very first
one which is the foreground to
background which stitch takes your
current foreground to your background
and that's a gradient right there so
these are our color Pickers we can move
them and obviously you can see affects
the orientation of the gradient I and we
could double-click them as well so this
white one over here double-click it and
I were able to change the color I just
go back right around here I'm going to
make this a real like a teal color so
going from teal to this blue kind of
just makes the button pop hit okay
another thing we can do is we can just
click here we can add a ton of gradients
or color Pickers and you can see really
affects the actual gradient itself but
that doesn't look good and usually it
doesn't more often than not we can't
create kind of like a metallic effect so
if we just move these real close to each
other in the center somewhere it almost
on top of each other add another one
over here and add another one over here
and double-click it to change the color
ok
okay then hit ok and then head ok we can
see that it kind of creates as a like a
brief type of metallic effect on the
button that's one way to add a gradient
the second way I is to create a layer
mask so if we create a new layer and
select this button right here use
previously to create a clipping mask hit
OK and then get a gradient tool out and
up here it allows us to see the same
presets let's go to foreground to
transparent and up here this allows us
to really choose different types of
gradient styles this is the very default
one which is just a linear gradient I
and we select say maybe a darker color
right here for our foreground hold shift
and you can see that we have a brief
gradient I we can also add multiple we
can do this multiple times and it all
stays on the same layer that's one way
another way the third way over here this
way only works on shapes which is what
this is is created by a tool over here
or the pen tool I we can click right
here and that gives us our path outline
hold ctrl and then left-click once and
that outlines the entire outline or
whatever the path is then we can create
a new layer ctrl shift n it doesn't have
to be a clipping mask this time hit OK
and then anything that we have will only
basically we have the same effect as
this left button except it just applied
differently because if I drop this down
you'll see the layer mask it's actually
taking this entire area but it's only
showing through the visible I path
beneath it ok so those are the three
ways to add I gradients and in this case
right here and I would only use I the
very first option for the button however
you don't always want to use a gradient
overlay through the layer Styles option
for example if I'm working with a
background
and I want to add a gradient to the
background usually just create a new
layer take the gradient tool I and
usually I'll use this to preset right
here which is foreground to transparent
let me change the background color just
like a slight slightly lighter version
and hold shift straight down and there
we go pretty simple we can add multiple
gradients if you want you can even
create a new another one say for example
we wanted to add like a drop shadow like
a spherical drop shadow underneath one
of these change our foreground color to
something like around here okay and then
just drag out or this could be just a
glow actually so if we take our square
marquee tool and just select a little
bit above and below the button hit
delete we have kind of like a Google go
glow thing not a big deal really i but
these are the ways you can work with
gradients one of the most important
things to get out of this is first you
have to understand how to use gradients
which I just gave you a pretty good run
down and then second I how to use them
effectively and not overdo them all
right that's it on scary Simon here and
check out design course calm if you
haven't already I you'll see a ton of
tutorials I as a member which are a ton
better than this one which show full
website design and logo design all right
talk to you later
what
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
