hey everyone Gary Simon of course Etro
nope you don't see me in front of the
camera like usual because I've been
restructuring my little studio area it's
gonna be sweet here in a week or so but
anyhow this side this is a very very
quick tutorial that's I you know
somebody who is having trouble or trying
to figure out how you would switch
themes and angular material and I
thought you know I I might as well do it
now I wanted to get a video out today
I've been really busy and this is gonna
be a real quick and it's also going to
require that you follow the previous
angular material video that I did from
two or three days ago I'll link it in
the description
if I can remember here in YouTube so
we're gonna be using that same project
we're not going to be starting from
scratch
alright so to do this what we're gonna
do instead of having like four options I
wanted to make it more simple it's just
gonna be a button that you click and it
will toggle on between two different
angular material themes alright so come
down here this is the project that we
worked with before called custom theme
I'm gonna go to my source and we're
gonna go to the app component HTML
alright so this is the HTML that we were
working with before so just here in the
middle I'm going to put in some HTML
here section class equals will make
example - section and then we're gonna
put a button with a click event and this
will be change theme and we're gonna see
Matt raised button color equals primary
and we'll see how that will change once
this is clicked alright so that's good
there next we're gonna have a little bit
of CSS for this example section right
there so I already have it there so
basically we just have a display of flax
and lion content is blah blah blah
height is 60 background color you're
just giving it some styling so it
doesn't look like garbage and as we
could see here in the browser make sure
by the way you have ng serve running in
your console we can see we have a local
host 4200 this is our current theme this
is our button which won't work just yet
alright so coming back we're gonna go to
our app component
and we're gonna put in just a bit of
types before we do that they'll let me
go back to our template we actually have
to update this part we're gonna use
class binding all right because that's
the way you changed between themes but
we need it to be dynamic so that's we're
going to use class binding so the way we
do that is we simply put in brackets is
class and then we reference the name of
the class alternative all right and then
we put we bind it to the let's see here
a property that we're gonna create
momentarily called other themes gonna be
a boolean which is they're gonna be true
or false that's how we'll toggle back
and forth so go ahead and save that and
before I get back to the component let's
check out real quickly our theme this is
what we worked with in the previous
tutorial so up here is our main custom
theme that we created right here is the
alternative theme alright so just
thought I would show that real quick as
a refresher all right so now in here
we're going to put in other theme and
just gonna be a boolean and we're gonna
make it false by default and then we
create the class change theme and we'll
just simply say this the other theme
equals this other theme and that will
toggle back and forth between that
boolean alright so let's see if this
works with any luck it will alright so
here we go it's click it okay this main
top bar is not working because I forgot
and our theme real quickly I'm using
from the previous lesson I was showing
how to change a theme for a specific
component like a button if we wanted to
change the whole thing which I do in
this case we'll make that change right
there
angular a material theme mix in all
right so now I click this everything
changes so how would you switch between
like night and dark for instance for the
dark theme because right now we're using
the dark theme well let's go back and
we'll take a look at
here they're both using the dark theme
so let's make this one light so by
default it's gonna start off on a light
theme as we could see here it changed it
to light look at that so it's changing
multiple things the custom colors and
also the theme right here now of course
you could also update this in such a way
that allows you to select multiple memes
in which case you wouldn't use a toggle
you would basically restructure your
component class down here and just a few
other adjustments based on what you're
doing but that's how to do a simple
toggle based wine really what it would
take to change between multiple themes
if you know basic JavaScript you should
be able to figure this out relatively
easily
alright so I big things coming up here
for the channel and in the site course
hecho I'm going to be making a couple
announcements and it's all good stuff of
course so yeah I'll see you guys very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
