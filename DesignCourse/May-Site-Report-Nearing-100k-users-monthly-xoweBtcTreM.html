cetera calm and welcome to the may
update of my website and basically I was
doing these every month earlier in the
year but that got a little bit redundant
so now I'm doing it every two months
so this update is going to cover all the
months but really it's been two months
since I've done this oh but real quick
before we begin make sure you check out
my site course cetera com
where you're going to find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like expect
each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it so what we have
here are just just some quick
screenshots that paste it in from Google
Analytics on my web site that I own in
run course cetera comm and so a lot of
the videos that you see here on YouTube
they're all pushing traffic to my
website and so the purpose of these
updates by the way I you know a lot of
you I understand have your own websites
you're interested in getting traffic of
course if you have a website and this is
just to give you you know what I'm doing
personally to grow my website traffic so
that you guys can get ideas if you wish
okay so I right here we have from
January February March April all the way
to the current month we'll also go down
and look at this stuff real quickly at
the end but what I want to do now is
just discuss a few of the numbers so
this is January the very first month
that I started really paying attention
to my website to try to drive traffic up
so this column I want to look at now is
just users and these are just the you
know the daily visitors that come to my
site so back in January who was at
15,000 538 now of course my site was
around for about the last half of last
year but I really didn't pay much
attention to it a lot of those users
were coming just from YouTube
essentially from two different channels
from Viv's when he was with corset row
in mind as well so there was very little
Google traffic or anything like that
coming here as you can see from January
to February there is an increase I think
it's around 8,000 visitors from February
to March there's an increase of over
10,000
so good growth for a March April again
around 10,000 user increase April domain
and this is the current month and there
was a big jump well over 20,000 now if I
just move this over real quickly the
next section I wanted to pay attention
to is page views and so page views we
had a lot initially compared to the
users and we could see the pages per
session was 2.79 which was my highest so
is that seventy thousand eight hundred
ninety seven as we can see over here if
you look at the pages per session it
dips quite a bit from two point set for
basically 2.8 to 2.4 still there was
about a twenty thousand increase in page
views from the first a second month the
next month increased quite a bit more so
we are twenty six thousand increase now
again this pages per session gets quite
a bit more and I'll discuss that
momentarily and then march/april will
see we increased again about thirty
thousand page views 1.95 which i think
was my worst pages per session and then
April to May a huge increase almost a
hundred thousand page views and that's
not because I've got like a massive
mentioned somewhere on some other
website it's really um we'll see down
here how this kind of corresponds to
that but unfortunately my pages per
session did increase and I did a couple
things to increase that so first what is
pages per session you may be wondering I
pages per session we move this over here
is basically you know a user comes to
the site what is the average amount of
pages a visitor will visit well back in
January I didn't have much content on my
website we did have a really large free
course a Java course that lives made and
a lot of people were visiting a lot of
different pages because they were taking
that course as I started to add more
tutorials they were really just single
page tutorials that started ranking and
started getting more users and so they
didn't need to visit all these other
pages so that's why the pages per
session started to dip quite a bit
because they weren't visiting other
pages essentially so you see 2.8 down to
2
for down to - and of course you want
people to click around on your site I'm
the worst that got was to 1.95 in April
so I was like okay well I don't want
only you know just one person to visit
you know two pages we need to increase
this somehow and so I did increase it
slightly over here and through what I
basically did to try to remedy that is
if you look at course cetera comm here
I'm going to click on just a random
tutorial and that's where most of my
traffic by the way is landing is at
these tutorial pages we can see the
layout here basically what I did I
actually this wouldn't be a good idea
let me show you there we go an angular
one down here just right here we can see
these different courses I decided to add
this section here so when a person
visits they're going to see these three
relevant courses this is an angular
tutorial so I show angular courses on my
website this is what has increased the
amount of people clicking from different
pages so of course you know these are
free and paid courses so there's an
advantage there in terms of making extra
money as well so coming back here let's
go down to Google traffic so this is all
the traffic that I'm getting to my
website from Google from January 1st all
the way to present day you can see it's
been a nice steady increase so what I'm
just trying to do is try to create
anywhere between you know six to ten
tutorials per week or per month rather
and trying to get links to those sites
so that it ranks high in Google and
we've gone all the way from around 165
per day at the beginning of the year to
right here at this peak as 3668 all
users again from Jan 1st to May 30th
will see that this as well pretty much
aligns with this nice slope upwards so
we're at just 4126 so as you see most of
my traffic is coming from Google this is
coming from other sources like my
YouTube channel you can see there's not
very many
also pageviews again I the pageviews you
can see didn't really increase much here
within the first I'd say four months and
again that's that's because I down here
people were visiting a lot more pages
about two point eight per day and
in-state around one point nine so
there's not a huge increase but then we
got a real big increase up here which is
really nice but if you averaged out
these three weeks right here probably
comes around to 9500 pageviews and then
finally over here at tutorials this is
just for the month of May you know again
I also in April I didn't really cover
that but I released this course right
here learn angular four from scratch
angular four had just released so I do
it would be a keyword that's going to be
easy to rank for because there's not
obviously much competition because it's
angular four was new so I was like
alright and then make a free course and
each one of the videos are that are part
of this course I featured a written
version which would rank in Google well
so I'm gets also one of the things
that's aligning to this stuff right here
these new angular four keywords now you
can also see that down here I have I
trying to extend outside of angular
because most of my traffic I would say
95% probably or people that are looking
for angular content so angular obviously
is just one part of the puzzle in terms
of development and so right here is my
my attempt to try to extend outside of
that so this is another free course it's
not done yet it's probably close to four
hours react versus angular versus view
so I'm going to start branching outside
of that obviously to increase traffic
even more so and yeah so that's
basically it I I understand it like this
growth right here you know just being a
one-man show I'm not sure how long I
will be able to sustain that I will
definitely be able to keep it going as
long as I cover you know this this new
stuff but I can't just keep on covering
angular of course I will do angular
content
you know from time to time in whatever
is relevant because angular seems to be
one of the most searched-for
probably out of these three react first
angular versus view based on my research
and either seems to be the most
searched-for slightly above react
content so I'm gonna be covering react
content also view I really like view
based on you know this what I've learned
in this course here but yeah that is
basically it I don't really discussed I
you know what I'm making from all this I
make my money for prey like four
different sources on my website so I'll
just discussed real quick you know what
I'm really making so I these ads right
here just a leaderboard this ad over
here I have an ad right here this is all
from Google Adsense and so I make money
this way and that's been increasing very
nicely again I can't live off of it
that's for sure and then I also make
money of course from the subscription
service that I have so that's uh you
know with these Pro courses right here
have about four pro courses I to access
that people are paying nine dollars
monthly just to access these courses so
I make money that way as well I also
make money from a YouTube channel ads
and again one of the things that I try
to set myself apart from other similar
sites is the fact that pretty much every
tutorial on my site has an Associated
video so this is a YouTube video it's
free for people to watch you can see I'm
really trying to target the keywords
that would be relevant like angular for
SEO that's a huge term and it basically
gives you just me talking running
through the process step-by-step that's
outlined in this because some people
prefer watching video and I so yeah
that's I again Adsense my course cetera
Pro account
subscription service my YouTube ads and
then also a lot of my paid in free
courses are also available to purchase
from udemy.com I'm also starting to add
them on Skillshare so out of those for
the income obviously as I get more
traffic so too does the income increase
so by the end of the year I'm really
hoping to get it to a point where I can
say well I don't really have to record
courses anymore for my other networks as
some of you know I record courses for
Pluralsight my record courses for
LinkedIn and lynda.com and yeah so I
mean I still will probably record
courses for them but not indefinitely so
that brings me in the last section you
know of course if I want to keep
expanding and if I want to keep on
driving up I you know the little website
traffic right now to ninety four
thousand Alexa I think that even at
current traffic numbers because the
Lexus slow slow to update I'm probably
close to around I would say fifty
thousand rank and of course if you're
unfamiliar with the Alexa rank it's just
a ranking the lower you are the more
traffic you get just ranks you against
other websites in the world like number
one is Facebook or YouTube or something
like that but anyhow if I want to keep
on growing I can't just be a one-man
show so I have to take the the profits
that I'm making and start hiring out for
other people to write my tutorials and
like again my stick is making videos
that parallel the written tutorials so
when I start I think this would be as
soon as next month like an odd June
which is tomorrow I'm going to start
trying to actively seek out developers
who can write tutorials and write them
in such a way that I will be able to
record parallel video tutorials with
them so yeah if you're a developer who
has a particular experience um
particularly probably with react angular
review hit me up and I could set you up
with a writers account I already have
that system developed so it'll show your
name of course on the tutorial like
right now if you show by Gary Simon so
it'll show your name and I you will get
paid per tutorial on some specific
element that pertains to you know like I
said react view or
angular all right I'll see you guys in
two more months to discuss what's
happening with the traffic hopefully it
doesn't stagnant and remain the same
hopefully there's still growth so I'll
see you guys later and also look out for
probably tomorrow the next day I'm going
to add to this course down here right
now
I just have the design aspect into Adobe
XD 9 I also have UJS that was finished
so react will be next and at the very
end angular so react will be added like
I said by tomorrow or the next day
alright see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
