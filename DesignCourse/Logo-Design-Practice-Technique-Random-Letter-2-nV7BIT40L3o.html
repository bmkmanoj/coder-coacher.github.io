today we're going to do the logo design
practice technique random letter and
I've done this one of the time before
and people seem to like it so I'm just
gonna do it again I didn't really know
what I was gonna record today so this
seemed like a good idea alright so you
don't have to really follow along you
can if you want and I mean it's always a
good idea to try and improve your skills
especially on the spot but yeah I'm just
gonna work in Adobe Illustrator and so
yeah check out design course comm if you
haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube alright Here I am at random
letter generator comm and I'm going to
click this it's gonna come up with a
random letter and then I'll speak the
first noun that comes to my mind that
begins with that letter alright so let's
go ahead and click this H hair alright
so I got to come up with hair somehow
within an H and I already know I want to
use the lowercase H simply because it
usually has this nice curve right here
alright so but I will still put a
capital H and then space it with a
lowercase H right here and you know just
quickly go over these fonts I just to
see if I have any ideas that are sparked
by doing this I think I already have an
idea
all right so I guess what I want to do
is I'm gonna get out the grid though I'm
not gonna use a font I'm just going to
view show grid here I'm gonna do my own
and I will view in snap degree as well
and I want to focus on the right portion
try to visualize how I want this to be
all right so I'm gonna take the pen tool
and it's going to come up around here
yeah how about right around
no no no come on get this right I'm just
gonna leave it at that just for now just
so I can get somewhat of an idea here
you know that probably will adjust these
all right you know I might do I'm gonna
back up oops damn it not that much one
second and I'm going to get rid of the
Phil give it a stroke and click on this
get her stroke with up here quite a bit
and use that it's kind of like a better
option there and I want to work with
this this looks all not correct here so
you can always just play with your
anchor points here move things around
and see if there's something that we
want to use we want to experiment with
the stroke again
and I really want to get this right
that's a little bit better of a change
alright so now what I want to do is I
want to create some portions that go
outside of it yeah we'll see if I can do
this I start right here
maybe right around there change this
again the stroke oops
all right and then change that as well
actually kind of do this yeah change
that all right and then I would look
right just with a straight up and down
sort of thing I don't know we'll see
probably not
no not at all all right so let me I
think here no no I don't want to do that
on second
alright alright I just want to
experiment a little bit more with these
hair stroke things that's irritating you
know if you eye color I drop it it
should also take a stroke style with it
but it doesn't know first of our
problems I guess you could say that's a
little bit too thick and yeah I think
these over here maybe it just might be a
little bit too thick for my liking so
I'm going to bring those down as well
and maybe move them in slightly
and this one
maybe come down here and then
another one
and all justice real quick
all right and see if there's anything
else I want to change I want to
experiment with not having that one yeah
yeah I want to get rid of this one and
add one right over here all right and
maybe put one right here and then there
all right actually at this point turn
off the grid view view and hide grid get
this thing out of there hmm
you know and maybe it's set up inside or
outside I'll have this thing inside over
here because everything is outside it
was kind of creating it making it look
empty
all right so I can take this duplicate
that real quick see what it looks like
without this portion
kind of like just with this alright and
then to further like solidified the idea
I take this I'm going to group it and
then hide it we could first let me go to
object path and outline stroke and then
take this group it and give it a linear
gradient up not on a stroke though all
right G and we'll try to get an
interesting color here a blonde maybe
color yeah now you know what like a a
brunette inside
all right and then finally I'm going to
make this one darker yeah it changes
maybe don't radial I need something like
that and yeah there we go I think that's
what I'm going to consider complete and
bring up the other one here and let's
see something
create some more interesting effects by
before you convert the paths or the
strokes to outline you can scale it
because the stroke with say the same
they don't scale down proportionally and
this makes it look you can pave a fuller
at this size if I want an object path
outline stroke and then scale it back up
I think I even like that better this
looks a little bit too thin so what I
could do is just take that duplicate it
get that color
something like that yeah anyhow that is
it I think it's pretty decent it conveys
the idea of hair I guess and age all
right so yeah that is it for today's
