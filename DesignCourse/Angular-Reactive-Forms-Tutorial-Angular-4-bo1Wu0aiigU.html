demonstration of the form that we're
going to build all the way from the very
beginning to the end okay so as we can
see we cannot click on our submit form
because nothing is valid yet so we have
validation that's applied to both the
name and also the description so we can
see how these anime end will be covering
all that and we can see this build is
currently required so if I just hit
effort any type of character it will go
away in this field here we have a
description as between needs to be
between 30 and 500 characters so you
know if I just paste this in real
quickly it goes away and we can submit
our form very easily at this point you
could save it to the database or do
whatever you want now we also have
something down here that really
demonstrates the power of reactive forms
which is a minimum of three characters
checkbox so right now if I simply click
out of here and I just hit our little F
key here and if we turn on it's going to
change the validation that's required
for our name input and the reason you
would potentially want to do something
like this in a rural case scenario is
dependent upon you know somebody chooses
a checkbox or changes any other value to
something and it may have to change your
validation requirements on your other
input fields all right so we're going to
be covering all of that so let's go
ahead and get started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
com where you're going to find a bunch
of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost of buying me
like expect each month that's it now
also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on all right let's get back to it all
right so just so we're on the same page
we're going to use the angular command
line interface to start a new project
now if you need help with this process
such as installing and meeting all the
dependencies such as no Jas and NPM then
check out the free angular 4 from
scratch course it's located at course
cetera comm so assuming you have
everything you need let's go ahead and
we'll type in ng new and we'll just name
this ng
forms so I'm going to pause while this
installs all right
and then we'll CD into it which is at C
D and G - forms and we'll go ahead and
run ng surf with the open flag which
will open up a browser automatically
whatever you have running as default of
localhost 4200 alright and there we go
this is our default angular 4 app that
is started now by the way if you're
watching us in the future and it's
angular 5 that doesn't necessarily mean
that this tutorial is broke or outdated
okay so what we're going to do is we're
going to go to our code editor now and
open up the project and the first thing
that we need to do before we construct
any type of form is to import the
reactive forms module into our app
module PS file and that's located in our
source app and right here okay so what
we want to do first is we're going to
add the reactive forms module into this
right here and this is included in the
angular forms library we'll copy that
and then we're going to add a comma just
after HTTP module and add it as an
import and we'll save it okay great
so now you know at this point you could
either choose to start going into your
template and defining the HTML for your
form or you can go to your component
really it just depends on your own
preferences so we're going to work
within the component code first so we
have to first start by importing some
necessary form specific functions and
the component that will house perform so
that for us it's going to be just this
standard app component right here so
we're going to import three different
form classes from the angular forms
library that is the form builder they're
our form group into validators so each
form that we have is going to be bound
to an instance of form group and then we
use the form builder right here to
handle form control creation and within
that we use the validators to set up
validation for each of our form inputs
so you'll get
a better understanding of how this works
as we progress so now what we want to do
is within the class here we're going to
get rid of this title we're going to
define just a few different properties
so I'm going to paste this in based on
the written tutorial that is at Coursera
calm and just give you a quick
exclamation real quickly of what is
going on here with these properties so
first we have our I property right here
called our form which is bound to form
group and we have a post of type any so
when we handle form submission I this is
going to be in reference to that we also
have the description of type string
bound to this empty and also the name
and that's bound to I nothing as well
and it's a string so our form again it
just has a name and a description
primarily so now within the constructor
we're going to use dependency injection
this is going to be private form builder
to form builder alright and next this is
where we specify the validation so we
reference our form and by the way that's
in reference to reactive forms and then
FB group all right so now we have really
three different inputs that are part of
our form so first we have name and
inside of here we add for the first
argument we're going to leave as null as
the first argument allows you to specify
a form value so we're not going to do
that I the next is where we set up our
validation and this is where we
reference our validators class up here
so we'll go ahead and just say that the
name is required so to do that
validators dot required that's it very
very very simple so let's go ahead and
i'm going to come over here well paste
this
and changes to description and let's say
for instance that we ate this particular
input we want to have multiple
validation requirements so not only will
be required but maybe when we want to
have a minimum length and a maximum
length which is obviously a common
validation requirement so the way we do
this is we use first validators dot
compose so right before this validators
dot compose and then we wrap it in a
parenthesis and a bracket so we'll close
this out real quick so it's going to be
required and then we just start
separating this right here by a comma
and then the reference validators again
dot minimum length so min length will
say 30 and then validators not max
length and we'll make this 500 all right
so what we want to do next is I'll also
don't forget to add at the end our
parenthesis and a closing bracket over
here alright and also we're going to
have that check box and that's not going
to be required however we need to
reference that we can access it later on
when we do the setup for that check box
and making it change the validation on
our name input here so that looks like
simply validate which will be the name
and then we'll just set it to empty
right there all right so let's go ahead
and we'll save that so now we want to
add a custom method of add post for
handling the submitted form so just
beneath the constructor link add post
will accept post here and this
description equals post description
and this dot name equals post name so
this is where you would you for example
if you had a back-end or an API of some
sort you would make the call to your
service to store it or do whatever you
want with this information but right now
we're just setting our description in
name bound to the submitted description
in name from the forum alright so for
now that's it for our app component
let's go ahead and focus on the HTML so
control B control B again to hide that
alright so there's a fair amount of vibe
HTML involved here and what I want to do
first before we begin that section is
I'm going to import the front-end
framework called foundation which I use
a lot in my tutorials and it's just real
quick and easy for structuring and
setting up a form or a layout of a
website so it's kind of it's basically a
competitor to bootstrap so we're going
to hit ctrl B and we're going to go down
to our index dot HTML and I'm going to
copy and paste just above the closing
head tag this line right here so if a
control B you'll see everything you need
and if you want to go to the written
tutorial of this this tutorial the
written version you can just copy this
from the tutorial right here and that's
just going to give us foundation right
there all right so now let's go back to
our HTML real quickly and get started so
I'm going to copy our first lines get
rid of this stuff all right so what is
happening here okay so basically we're
just saying that if the name property
does not exist then show everything
that's going to be inside of this div so
real quickly let's go ahead and close
that off and so if the name property
does exist we're going to go show form
info which is going to be a local
variable I local template variable and
the way we access that which we can go
ahead and do that real quickly
I'm going to copy and paste that blip in
real quick so we use ng template and
then we put a hash sign with the names a
form info
all right so if name does exist or if
they already submitted the form
successfully then it's going to show
this and not the stuff up here all right
so does it make sense hopefully so we
have a div class a form container we
have a div class of row columns this is
specific to foundation it just basically
helps structure their simple container
and then we have interpolation of the
name and description properties that we
define in our component file right here
and here so it's just going to show us
what the user submitted all right so
let's go back here and the next section
is the form element so I'm going to go
ahead and paste this in also close it
off right here all right so when you're
using reactive forms on the form element
right here you have to wrap form group
into brackets and we bind it to our form
and remember that's the name that we
gave it in our component our form as
form group all right so then we use
event binding on ng submit so when the
form is submitted then we're going to
call add post and we're going to post or
pass in our form value which that will
send in all of the input values that are
contained within this form right here to
our method all right so next I'm going
to go ahead and simply type out the rest
here class equals form container again
this is some custom CSS that we will
paste in a little bit difficult all um's
so it's structured similar to our ng
template down there and first we have
I'm going to go ahead and just copy a
little bit of this have a title right
here and then we have our first input so
we have our label of name input type is
text
form control name equals name so this
right here name has to match this right
here so this controls the validation of
this element this input element with the
name the form control name of name very
very simple so next we have a text area
for description and it's the same exact
thing we have our form control name of
description matches up to our component
description there we go again very
simple and then also we're going to have
a check box so we'll have a label and an
input type of check box here's our label
right here on line 17 and then 18 we
have type of check box name is validate
control name is validate value is 1 so
if it's checked that's the value it's
going to be passing on to our add post
through our form dot value ok so then
finally we just have a submit button
there's nothing special about this with
exception to the property binding that
we have on the disabled attribute and
this is disabled if the form is not
which is indicated by this not operator
here if it's not valid so if it's not
valid disabled will be added to this
button and you won't be able to click it
if it is this will be removed ok so
that's pretty good for now to go ahead
and save that and before we actually
check this out in the browser
I want to real quickly just go ahead and
style the form and so this would
probably be a good point to head on over
to the browser check out the written
tutorial and you'll see a section called
styling the form and we're just going to
copy and paste just a few rule sets in
two different files so control B I'm
going to go to styles the CSS and paste
this in it's just two rules that are
basically 1 import and we're just
changing the background on the body
we'll save that and then we'll go to our
app component CSS and I'm going to paste
in just a little bit here right there
so what's happening has very quick
exclamation we have the form container
and that's just kind of structure the
container that's going to house
everything it makes the background white
gives us some padding we have alert
which we are not going to mess with the
alert yet because we have an integrated
we'll cover that shortly in this video
we have our button and just just styling
a couple different things in an
animation for our alerts we don't have
to worry about any of that right now but
go ahead and save that and visit your
browser again make sure your ng serve
command is ran and here we go
so I if we click out of it we don't have
any type of message because we didn't do
that into template just yet but we can
notice that the submit form we cannot
touch cannot submit it so if I type in
you know asdf here and then also I start
doing this so we can get to 30
characters there we go
now we can submit the form again if we
can remove this can't submit it because
it is required so we'll go ahead and
submit it there you go
so real quickly this is fine but it's
really not a great user experience so we
should show an actual validation message
that lets them know what exactly is
needed so they can get to submitting the
form because sometimes that can be
confusing and extremely frustrating so
we'll go ahead back to our code here
we're going to go to our app to dock and
put onto HTML and just underneath
depending on where you want this to show
up underneath is pretty much standard
we're going to real quickly reference a
div class right here of alert we're
going to add ng if all right so this is
we're going to put an odd operator our
form thought controls name so that some
reference to the above control valid so
it's saying if this is not valid and our
form controls name
dot touched so real quickly I'm just
just to show you what this does I'm
going to remove that and we're just
going to save it just with this first
rule right here I we're going to go
ahead and I'm just going to put this is
required I'm going to save it we'll go
back to our section right here alright
we'll see by default when the form loads
it says this is required so if we don't
add that touched requirement this is
going to show up on all of our alerts or
our validation requirements you don't
want that obviously you only want to
show up when they focused on and off or
have touched that given input type field
so let's go ahead and real quickly we'll
add this back I'll save it and then
we'll come back and now as you see it
reloads and we cook off there we go this
is required okay so over here we're not
going to bake in the actual message
we're going to use interpolation to show
a specific property that we're going to
define in our component so our
interpolation brackets will call this
title alert we'll save let's go back to
our app component and add that real
quickly so title alert type string
equals this field is required now we can
save it real quickly let's go back this
field is required now why would I want
to do that because we're going to be
using this specific name field right
here along with our validate checkbox to
change the validation requirements when
that checkbox is pressed all right
so again you can add this I'm just going
to paste in a second one here for our
description validation message so I'm
going to paste this in it's very similar
to the top one however
the one difference is is that we're
simply not going to use interpolation
we're just going to put you must specify
a description that's between 30 and 500
characters and again this matches up
with the requirements and app component
because we could see minimum length is
30 max length is 500 okay so now we can
go ahead and save this in both of these
I will work so down here down here and
that will go away if you satisfy you
know the needs of the validation so
goodbye there we go now we could submit
all right that's awesome
so you know another way to demonstrate
the powerful nature of reactive forms is
by we're going to utilize this check box
right here so nothing's happening when
we check on it all right so we have to
tie into that in our component class
real quickly so we're going to add the
ng on an it lifecycle hook all right so
when this component loads this stuff in
here gets ran so what we'll do is
reference this to our form get and we'll
get our validate field value changes all
right so all of the fields that are
defined up here have the ability for us
to tie into value changes so we're going
to subscribe all right and inside of
here we're going to add or pass in
rather validate and we're going to say
if validate or the value of the value
add a check box equals 1 and if you
recall real quickly we'll see that our
check box the value is set to 1 then
inside of here we'll say this our form
get name because that's the validation
rules that we want to change set
validators
and this allows us basically within here
to redefine the validation requirement
so let's add in validators dot required
so we'll still make it required and then
we'll add a validators minimum length
requirement right here we'll just say
three all right so it doesn't really
make sense I but this is just to show
you how to do it not exactly why
so now we'll also change our title alert
because now not only is it required it
needs three characters so this title
alert equals you need to specify at
least three characters okay now we're
going to say else right here and I'm
just going to copy real quickly and
paste we're going to set validators back
to the original which is just right up
here all right great
so now what we can do is save this and
we'll come back actually at the very
beginning we have to add at the very end
of this this to our form get name update
value and validity and that's giving me
a red line because that is not to go
there it's to go here all right so we'll
go ahead and save this and we'll go back
alright so just to demonstrate how this
works right here by default because this
is neck not checked on we can satisfy
real quickly by hitting any type of
character because it simply requires now
if we turn this on watch what happens up
you need to specify at least three
characters so there you go that is
basically the power of reactive forms in
that it lets you to control validation
through your component class you can
also do unit tests on reactive forms
where as these are two things that you
can't really do with
template different forms which I'll
cover at a later date I but yeah there
we go so this is my awesome title corset
Row is great
that's a shameless plug right there and
then here's my stuff right here submit
form there we go alright so if you
enjoyed this please do check out course

courses just release this one over here
