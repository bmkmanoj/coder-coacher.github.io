here and today it's just gonna be a real
quick videos tour because I'm extremely
busy I so basically I've had a couple
people ask me how exactly you set up in
iOS app icon the actual icon with the
rounded corners and all that because
just recently a few days ago I launched
the sixth design course calm design
challenge which is about iOS app icon
design which you can still enter if you
visit the design course forms and check
out the design contest forum I but yeah
so what I'm gonna do is just go over in
Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop
how you set up the document along with
the proper icon structure alright so if
you haven't yet check out design course
calm and subscribe here on YouTube
alright so get started so first we'll
start with Photoshop here and you know
some people say don't use Photoshop for
app icon we'll just disregard them
they're the lightest assholes basically
because you know the iPod concise I
believe for for iOS is like 1024 by 1024
as long as you stick to 1024 by 1024
you're fine now I know for our contest
recently I specified 512 by 512 but
that's just to make it easier for us to
just show it off or display it or
whatever alright so the first thing you
need to do in you don't even rely on
this tutorial right at the present time
because you may watching is you may be
watching this several months down the
road and then all of a sudden Apple or
Android changed up their icon
specifications or requirements alright
so what you want to do and this is from
yesterday's tutorial I just finished
recording that I what you want to do is
look for the official Doc's about it so
i OS app icon launcher guidelines I mean
I haven't searched for this so I'm just
doing it right now
icon and image sizes
and it tells it has a whole page for you
here that lets you know the general
sizes to the app icon for the app store
which is required for all apps is 1024
by 1024 so the launch image now that's
the actual full image like when the app
is loading that's right here
I then you have all these other ones so
you have the app icon I the app icon for
the store 1024 by 1024 and pretty simple
so file new up snot open file new what
you would do is set it to 1024 by 1024
pixels at 72 which is web-based RGB
transparent or why it doesn't really
matter hit OK and then what you would do
is select the rounded rectangle tool and
before I begin what we need to do is
bring this back up and let's click over
here and see if we can find corners ok
so I let's see here real quick you can
upload a the actual app icon as a square
and they automatically place a mask over
it but generally when you're designing
an app icon you kind of want to see what
it's going to look like in the end which
is why you apply the corners so for I
1024 by 1024 the border radius is 160 so
left click here wants specify 1024 by
1024 now if you were used in 512 by 512
the radii radii would be 60 I know 80
sorry it would be 80 on each corner but
since we're using double that it would
be
sixty so one sixty one sixty one sixty
one sixty move that over here into place
with your your keyboard arrows and there
you go
so whatever goes in here is there going
to be your app icon and again you could
just go to image image size scale that
down to five twelve and everything would
remain exactly as it needs to be so what
I like to do generally when I'm
designing the app icon is for this layer
right here that's this background
control shift and to create a new layer
and then any layers that you add
additionally on to this should be
clipping masks for the most part that
way you can add design in here
specifically that will not be shown
outside of this area otherwise you run
the risk of it clipping or coming out
here or whatever but but either way I
just like to use clipping masks for
whatever is going to be going on inside
of the actual app icon alright so that's
how you do it in Photoshop and then
another tip by the way if you want to
try to show off or present your app icon
what I do is to create a larger document
so if I go to file new let's try like
1600 by 1200 fill it in with the color
so what I like to do is once I'm ready
and I have the app design app icon
designed as I want it I will take
everything and just group them and then
duplicate that group or right click and
hit duplicate and then hide the initial
one that has all the layers and then
take this and then just hit ctrl e then
ctrl c ctrl d merges everything and then
ctrl V to paste that in make it this so
what we can see it the background boy it
looks ugly and then I move that over
here and then what you could also do is
go to image image size 512 ctrl a ctrl C
and then probably go to canvas size and
make it bigger on two for the width make
this bigger and that way you get to show
all the different sizes of the app icon
just like that and by the way if you
wanted to save these of course you would
I go to file save as as a PSD obviously
and then save for web and then change it
to like a PNG 24 and that we can
actually use them as a part of an app
icon launcher icon alright so that's how
you do a Photoshop very simple that's
how you work around with it and then I
Ellis traitor file knew you could do the
same thing you could use pixels here not
centimeters I either 512 by 512 or 1024
by 1024 you should always probably just
use 1024 if you're seriously going to
create an icon it's gonna be used for an
app and hit okay you have over here
rounded rectangle tool left click same
thing you know 1024 1024 and 80 and 80
no what am i doing
160 and then very simple there you go so
if you wanted to make it an illustrator
you can do that as well so it's very
simple to get your app icon set up in
either Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop
alright so just a quick video for you
I'm actually quite busy today that's why
I kind of did a real quick one so yeah
check out these on course comm if you
haven't yet subscribe here on YouTube
and I'll see you tomorrow with a new
tutorial alright goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
