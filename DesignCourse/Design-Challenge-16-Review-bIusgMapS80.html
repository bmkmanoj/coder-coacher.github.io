calm and a is the review of design
challenge number 16 which is another
letter mark challenge for a fictional
gaming company called kill X alright so
I if you submitted a design and go ahead
and review them very quickly so the
first one we have from Andrew I do
there's a big big problem with this is
it's just a k and it's just an X and
there's really nothing unique going on
in terms of combining them to a single
letter mark or a symbol that relates to
the idea of the game so all we have here
is just a scaled-down k and there's a
pass idiotic so the big issue here right
off the bat is just the fact that
there's nothing unique happening so I
would focus on just trying to come up
with a symbol that really makes sense
and also not you know taking this the
opacity down just to create an effect
just for the sake of doing so alright so
just you know if you are answering your
watch and it's just I keep on watching
my reviews here to get more of an idea
of maybe what I'm talking about so all
right Chris we have here I this one that
this technically is yes a letter mark
because they are joined together the KNX
I but they are still kind of you know it
does work but I would say that the
execution of the cross here is here is
just a little bit too dramatic it's a
little bit too much clutter going on
here I there's some issues here that I
could see you know for instance it just
throws it off because it's not
consistent like these cross here I
little vertical lines the thickness of
these and then you compare them to the
thickness of these I it just creates an
issue of consistency inconsistency so I
would try to i simplify this in the
middle and you might have a better
result in the end so I like the idea of
using a negative space here to create
this so this actually has potential all
right so I Indies another one definitely
from Chris odd this one definitely is
inferior to this one I just because
definitely get rid of the head just
because if you scale this down to a size
it might appear on a website or
something you would not be able to see
the execution of the head as well I
think would definitely need to work if
you were to do anything it would just be
a silhouette of like a black you know
outline of a head or something like that
and then the KX it's almost just
indiscernible if you didn't know if
there was a KNX you want to be really be
able to read it so this one is
definitely better execution all right so
Mitch in Stein hi all right so the idea
is to illustrate it costs of having a
bullet I going through the KNX all right
so it's not obvious that this right here
is a bullet to me just because I have a
gutter mind it almost kind of looks like
a penis I but I if you were to try
really make it look like a bullet
there's a couple things you could do I'm
the one right off my head is just too I
I create kind of like it's thin vertical
lines coming off the tail that way it
illustrates that you know it's in motion
or something like that so the idea in
and of itself I did there's definitely
AI potential there I think it just needs
to be work reworked a little bit all
right Liam alright so this there's an
issue here just because I let me see
about scaling this down a little bit I
this background is completely
unnecessary this this red kind of
political thing going on so and it makes
it hard to see this you know the actual
letter mark especially when the letter
mark also has some opacity on it as well
so I would have just completely get rid
of that make it one solid color and
background or make make it slow make at
least a textured background of some sort
that doesn't take away from this so
focusing on the letter mark itself i
would say definitely get rid of these as
well they probably supposed to be
bullets but it's kind of hard to tell
plus there's not a lot of white space in
between this portion right here so
there's a little bit of clutter here i
would just get rid of these entirely
just because the K and X are there's
already a lot happening here so you want
kind of simplify things all right I
galaxy x 85 let me reset this I see ya
the X here that the bullet holes cool
idea but the problem is it kind of just
looks like the case slapped on there I
mean I know it's aligned here
like at a 45 degree angle but it just
still fills separate if you know what I
mean I although I understand it's also
kind of hard to combine a k into x and
make it decent looking so it was kind of
challenging but thanks for the
submission euros so this here there's a
issue just because I the KNX aren't
combined so it feels way to separate and
the idea I tried to emphasize is try to
create a single symbol this is a unique
idea with the cave you know being a gun
and all I but again the X is not a part
of this essentially so thanks for the
entry anyhow so Gabi I this is a little
bit difficult just because you know you
have it behind the X and that this part
isn't connecting to this part of the K
so it's a little bit hard to read
there's AK so again if somebody didn't
know you know these are supposed to
represent a KX off hand it might be hard
to discern that mainly because of this
issue right here I but yeah yeah there's
potential there for sure moving down let
Zach I alright so I like the cool kind
of texturized background and I like the
fact that you have it also placed on the
the logo itself the type is good and the
idea overalls good but it really breaks
down just because it's so hard for me to
see a que here I know that this
obviously has something to do with it
with the K but it's real hard to tell
and again like I said this is
challenging I probably didn't really
foreshadow how difficult it might be to
get a que in an ex together I but I like
this overall I mean the design and
everything is good I just think if
someone were to look at this they
wouldn't be able to really see a que
there but I do like it so this is
actually you know even though it's very
simple I think it's a really good
attempt at trying to combine a k + x-c
because the X in and of itself is kind
of the part that plays off on the game
you know when you have a game like a
first-person shooter or whatever a
shooter game of any sort I you know you
you see X you kind of think of a target
of sorts so this is actually pretty good
i probably make some slight changes just
so it's a little bit more unique rather
than just having the the negative space
here to separate the x and decay but I
overall I really like it so good job I'm
coming down here from this individual
I'm not going to try to announce that
salsa okay I when I looked at this the
immediate thing that just came to my
mind was like a swastika I know this is
an ex but the fact that it kind of
changes form right here and it just goes
doesn't go straight through is what
gives me that vibe obvious that's
probably not something that you you want
to emphasize is a Nazi stuff but I I
mean I like the idea of kind of how
everything has a lot of 45 degree angles
and it makes it feel gamer ish but I
think maybe trying to get that straight
X in there somehow I and you probably be
able to do it if you tried hard enough
would be more ideal but I do I overall I
do like the simplicity of it for sure
cool stuff alright coming down here
Jimmy I so this right here it's still
hard to see that there's AK I just
because the part of the K only only part
of the K is just like the left part is
just read but this part as well is is an
ex oh really P dominantly you just see
the X with these brackets and then just
like a line in a background so it's kind
of hard maybe if you made it the same
color like just black it would be a
little bit more discernible I think
changing the colors kind of throws it
off in my opinion just a bit but
otherwise I like the simplicity of it
okay what is this is a different
variation here I yeah I mean I still
think he's you're running into somewhat
of the same problem I this is a little
bit easier to see I but i still think
keeping the same color may have been the
best bet oh and this would be identical
to the other guys and up there so
because we're thinking along the same
lines so that's
and dl 2904 kept it simple both
designing color of the cross eyed over
the ex being a mark would give it okay
alright so i would say this i mean it is
simple I when you just think about you
know all the lines and stuff and there's
not much happening in terms of effects
and visuals and stuff but I think it
actually is a little bit complex if you
consider all of the dots and all the
lines and all the overlapping that's
occurring between the light crosshairs
and the X here and the K here so in that
regard it's definitely pretty complex I
so I think simplifying this keeping this
all black getting rid of a lot of the
little circles and just focusing on
really simplifying this so that you
don't have all the overlapping I would
be a little bit better and then it would
be a little bit better more of an
effective letter mark in my opinion all
right and then mass I so this one's a
little bit hard for me to understand I
think this may be like a keyboard key of
sorts I'm not sure I so I really don't
have too much to say beyond that just
because I'm not sure exactly what is
happening here no description was
provided so sorry for that Tina are Tina
I so again this is somebody else did
this sort of negative space with with
the crosshairs I probably would've went
with a different font but I'm just
pulling here is here I in and of itself
it's not bad and I do like the concept
obviously it's something that could be
worked with and that people would
universally recognized simply because to
another person took this route as well
so good entry alright so here is a
another entry I would say this is high
the problem here is there is no k so are
not know okay that I can see at least so
that's a niche issue because going to
try to get the KX in there I otherwise
if it was just X this would be a pretty
cool concept alright in ours sire
ah let's see here we can add this yeah
this time there's no separation at all
just kind of the letters laid on top of
each other I it's not bad in my bidding
I when we're looking at the type like a
name along with it I think the
proportions and the scale could have
been adjusted maybe this point on the
top or something like that kind of like
you have over here I'm but in and of
itself that it's a pretty it's a very
simple approach you know getting decay
and having to X in here I so yeah I
actually like that and then servlet oh
well I didn't really see this one before
hand so I'm trying to figure out so I
guess you could say this is definitely
the K right here and we have like a
water droplet thing and just kind of add
some clutter to it because just because
you're not sure or i would soon maybe
this signifies blood arm so there's a
lot happening or you have the circle
here maybe 2 emblem eyes it i have the k
and then you have the X and with the
tiny little lines in mirror so it's a
little bit complex going on I would
probably probably get rid of the the
drug of the blood drop area right here
and try to simplify it a little bit more
and it does kind of feel almost like a
like a boat wheel or steering wheel or
something anyhow I like the idea I think
it could be worked with and simplified
so I good entry let's see here how
vicious yeah there's a lot going on here
like this crosshair just looks way too
i'd say like 1995 is graphic i guess you
could say just because it's a very thin
almost like i was taken into paint and
this is slapped on top of it the
crosshairs just because they're one
pixel you know and there's a bunch of
them and it's over laying on top of the
X so that's there's a lot of clutter
happening or so it focus on simplifying
this concept big time and that is it so
thanks for watching I coming up here on
what is that today's November 28th so
2015 is right around the
Warner and I i'm going to set a new goal
for myself so previewer in a year are
basically january first of this year I
set a goal to record a video every day
of 2014 and I think I got to like June I
but that got way too difficult the
quality was suffering a bit and so I
just got kind of stopped that I
nonetheless I did keep it up quite a bit
pretty long I yeah I thinking for this
year I want to try to focus on some new
goals and try to structure how I produce
videos a little bit differently and
actually have a schedule so that people
know what's going to be coming up maybe
once a week I know and also focusing on
some other things I'm trying to expand
beyond just design course calm into
other learning sites such as udemy
Skillshare and i'll be doing promotions
and advertisements based on whatever
create there as well but yeah I as
always subscribe here on youtube if you
haven't yet I look out for new tutorials
coming up pretty soon I'm going to do
another appt tutorial a full app
tutorial and also some digital painting
tutorials alright so yeah subscribe here
check out these anchors com if you
haven't yet and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
