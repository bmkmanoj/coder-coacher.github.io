course Tarkan today I am announcing the
second design course design challenge
and that task is going to be designing
three flat icons alright so these three
icons one needs to be an edit icon
another needs to be a shopping cart icon
and the other one needs to be a calendar
icon and so all of them need to follow
the DS flack design trend and they all
need to look as though they are part of
the same set so if you never designed an
icon or whatever I put out a flat design
icon tutorial back in January second
this year is the second video I that I
put out I think while we're getting
close to 100 videos of the year so so
far but I yeah you can check that video
and it's an Adobe Illustrator you don't
have to use illustrator although its
preferred there are some other
requirements which you can find out in
the thread which I'm going to link here
to the forums where you can get more
information about you know what the
requirements are liking they need to be
at least 256 pixels by 256 you need to
display all three of them in the same
post and you can submit multiple entries
if you wish and basically yeah check
that out and this is going to end in a
week from today so I think it's April
