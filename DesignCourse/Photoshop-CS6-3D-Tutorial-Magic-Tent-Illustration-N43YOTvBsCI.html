salmon net and design course comm and
today we're going to design this 3d tent
in Photoshop cs6 is 3d features and this
is a basic introduction to Photoshop 3d
however you can see we have something
pretty cool going on here in which most
people wouldn't think is quite possible
in Photoshop so let's go ahead and get
started let me go to file new with 850
by height 600 and you can use whatever
fits your screen best hit okay we're
going to give the background a light
blue gradient so for the foreground
color we'll select something right
around here hold shift left click and
drag down alright so now we're going to
change our foreground color to a darker
shade of blue and choose the ellipse
tool hold the shift and Alt key together
and then left click and drag to create a
perfect circle and then we're gonna go
to 3d new 3d extrusion from selected
path now this puts us into the 3d
editing mode so the first step here
we're going to select the actual shape
and under shape presets we'll select
this one right here which is inflate now
the next step is with this roll the 3d
object mode selected we're going to
rotate around the x-axis axis right
around there and then we can move it
down slightly so it's actually hitting
the plane alright and then we could
select environment
with this option this mode selected
right around there all right now let's
select the object again and we'll go to
deform now inter deform we're going to
adjust the taper to around 170 percent
and we're also going to change the
extrusion depth to a little bit larger
right around there
now let's take our move tool and just
move this up make sure we can move this
up on the y-axis of course it's being a
pain in the ass there we go
okay alright and then we're going to
select the cap option and we'll get the
top portion working here so I'm going to
scroll down I'm going to take the angle
down a little bit and increase the
strength right around there alright now
let's go back to the environment and I
want to rotate this just a little bit
more okay
alright now that basically has a set
actually I want to add I'm gonna adjust
the lighting up here so if you click
this little icon it'll be somewhere
around here and then take this ball you
can see we can adjust the lighting here
right around there now let me select
that again and we have intensity will go
in environment and under intensity
actually yeah shadows right there we're
gonna adjust this down just so it's not
so it doesn't stick out quite as much
alright so now I'm going to go to the
layers tab and just select the
background and as you can see here it
takes all that we're out of 3d mode and
now what we want to do is just
under it so rendering can take a little
while so I'm gonna pause the video and
I'll come back to it once it's ready it
usually is depending on your computer
specs it could take anywhere between 30
seconds to a few minutes so you do that
under first selecting the object 3d
render alright so I'm gonna pause it
while I do that okay so now I have it
rendered so it looks a lot better now
we're going to give it some actual
texture so right here we have two
different options and if we hide one of
them you'll see once for the top and
then one will be for the actual face of
the tenth so that's what we want to work
with first so if we all have to do is
double click on this and it brings up a
new kind of like a new Photoshop
document so what we want to do here is
go to view show grid all right so it
shows us this grid and it's not 100%
perfect so I'm going to go to image
canvas size and adjust the width to an
even 1000 and hit proceed and we're
gonna give it some red stripes so let's
select the rectangular direct angle tool
and choose a red color for the
foreground and we'll just draw in this
first cell here and then we will
duplicate it right click and duplicate
looked okay move it over duplicate it
again and then I'm just going to merge
these right click duplicate layer and
then just one more time right click
duplicate and there we go now if we
switch back here you'll see it
automatically adds the the red stripes
here you can adjust these so you can
even get more we take these three select
them hit ctrl T and drag them in it's
right around here
actually maybe more like around here
select move tool hit apply
you see we add a few more you can
actually drag them in and get more but
for now we're just gonna move along I'm
and now this is a little bit too gray we
want this to be white actually so with
the the object selected actually let me
go back here control Z we have diffuse
up here and we can change this to be any
color we want as you can see so let's
hit OK
alright so now if we just clicked on
select or click the background layer you
can see we have the basic looks so far I
want to actually add a door here so what
we're gonna do is right click on the
ellipse and hit rasterize 3d and from
there we can select the pen tool change
the mode to path and we're going to
create a door just right here we kind of
want it to fit within the 3d shape as
much as possible okay so now we'll
right-click go to make selection hit OK
and then hit the delete they had to
delete key so now we have the door here
but obviously there needs to be a shadow
in here so and also this we may see a
portion of this wrap around the actual
tent from the door so we'll create a new
layer control-shift-n hit OK with the
pen tool still selected we'll select
shape and we'll change the color to an
almost black and we'll only see a very
small portion of it which is right there
actually we'll select black for that by
default all right so now we could just
barely see the other edge
of layer and we can move this a little
bit more oops wrong layer these are
arrow keys and then what we can do is
actually give the AI a shadow in the
center and select the background layer
control-shift-n for a new layer hit OK
we'll take the brush tool and increase
it to around 160 or so actually I want
to increase a little bit more than that
so and then we could just take the lasso
tool and delete outside of here and then
take the eraser tool to get rid of
anything hanging off at the end okay so
now I want to give it some grass to
circle around so I've linked a free
grass grass texture so go ahead to that
URL and right-click the image I in
Chrome or Firefox and copy it copy image
which is what I've just done and then
select the background layer and hit
control ctrl V to paste so now I we're
gonna take the eraser tool and just
start erasing most of the grass here
just to only encompass the portion
around the tent okay so this is I I the
shadow right here doesn't look very good
so we'll drop this down actually to
probably around 130
and just I erase the very end of it now
this shadow and here doesn't look very
realistic at all so we'll select it and
change the blend mode and we could just
use the down arrow key after selecting
the drop-down box and just hit several
times until we find one that looks a
little better and I think I think there
was one that was pretty good
up here all right I think that's pretty
good
and that's linear burn I had changed the
opacity to 75% also there was some
shadow up here you can delete and now
we're gonna give it an actual flap so
we'll take the plan that pen tool we'll
choose this color right here just a very
edge for the foreground and then we'll
draw out a basic shape as if the the
flap of the door is kind of in the wind
we'll move this up here
I'm hitting ctrl Z if I'm not selected
at a point that I like yet and then we
can always use this tool here the
selection tool to move these around
afterwards all right now hit ctrl shift
N and we're going to select this
checkbox here to create a clip clipping
mask
I hit OK and we're going to select the
pen tool and select this color right
here at the very bright edge of the door
just above it and we'll continue this
red stripe down the center of the door
and close it up
alright so now the colors don't match
here the actual tent color so what we
can do here is a control-shift-n hit
okay we use the paint brush tool change
the size change the foreground color to
this color right here at the opposite
end all right and then also we'll adjust
this so those match up to select the top
layer create clipping mask
actually we'll go back here double click
on this one and it's like the inner
color and then for this layer we'll
select the outer darker color and then
along the outer edge we can add the
color so now we'll take the direct
selection tool click once and adjust
these so these line up perfectly
I still want to adjust this
I'm using my arrow keys and we'll take
this inner one and adjust it so it lines
up better okay I will create one more
layer as a clipping mask and we'll give
it some some shadows here and almost
dark and almost black color change the
radius and it'll be right around here
and then we'll change the mode
scroll down to darken and then it'll
just lessen the lighten the opacity all
right so now that gives it an actual
sort of shadow to make it look realistic
all right so the final step here will be
to add some extra lobs call magic balls
or if you will but they'll just be the
paintbrush on a soft brush and I will
create a new layer and we'll make it a
hundred percent white for the foreground
we'll start with the bigger size first
and we'll drop down the size just a
little bit
all right uh and then another thing I
want to do is select the original
ellipse layer ctrl shift and create a
clipping mask and that's just the size
of the brush with a darker foreground
color I'm on a bigger size and we'll
change the mode the blend mode here to
multiply and just down a little bit
further and then we'll take the grass
layer create a new layer make a clipping
mask as well drop the size a bit and
we'll do the same thing and change the
blend mode I think overlay well yeah
that doesn't look too bad and that is
basically it so you can see we initially
use the 3d the 3d features and Photoshop
to create a basic shape and then you can
see we can really just edit everything
to make it look pretty realistic and
100% within Photoshop all right I hope
you enjoy the tutorial and I am Gary
