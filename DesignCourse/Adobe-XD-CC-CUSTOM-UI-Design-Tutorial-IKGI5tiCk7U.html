this video today we're gonna be taking a
look at creating custom user interfaces
using Adobe XD now XD just released to
the official 1.0 version so it's out of
beta so now I thought it would be a
really good time to do a brand new
tutorial bringing everybody up to date
and it's really not going to be about
the tools in Adobe XD this video is
really going to be about the concepts
about what it takes to create solid user
interfaces because I know a lot of you
are new to this and when you're new to
this type of thing you're probably not
thinking a lot about these really core
fundamentals that you really need to be
at the forefront of your mind when
you're designing so I'm gonna do my best
as I'm designing to describe and explain
why I'm doing the things I'm doing
alright so make sure you check out
corset row comm and also subscribe here
on youtube if you like this and you're
going to so you might as well just go
ahead and do it so I'm gonna switch over
to the desktop here and this is the new
window the new document portion when you
load up Adobe XD we're gonna choose web
1920 just by default all right
so also mind you when I go through this
I do not have any custom colors
predefined usually I'll do that and make
my life a little bit easier so I'm just
gonna kind of wing it and hope for the
best here so the very first thing I want
to establish is a background so we click
on the artboard name which is web 1920
I'll just call this app by double
clicking on it and all these damn dogs
and what we'll do is I over here for
appearance we want to fill of course we
don't want it white I'm gonna choose a
gradient
I don't always choose gradients actually
a very rarely do but for this I make an
exception this is kind of more
experimental kind of going back to
old-school I I'm gonna be using
gradients in this design so right here
for the first color picker I'm going to
come just like in a turquoise sort of
of color right around there and you can
see the color code down here if you need
to hopefully you can see in the video
and then on the second one we're going
to come around the same area maybe just
slightly a little bit more green it's
not going to be too different we don't
want it to be too too different so
something right around there and it's 1
4 9 5 5 D if you want to follow along
exactly alright so that looks good the
next we're gonna create the actual
rectangle that will house the interface
itself so I'm just gonna left click and
drag out somewhere right around here
it's gonna fit in nice and easy with a
lot of margin and pagin between the
background here and itself and then also
once we do that I want to bring these
little corner angles in just a bit but
not too much maybe right around there
alright great so at this point when
we're considering color for this we have
to really consider and contrast it with
the background so if you look here this
is great because there's a lot of
contrast between this foreground element
which will house the user interface and
the background eye we could also make it
darker than the background but it has to
be significantly darker so if I look
over here I just realized I I was
showing myself when I was doing that
sorry about that
if we take this darker we can see
there's also a lot of contrast so
there's tons of contrast here and then
there's less Conte or there's more
contours the same amount of contrast
here if we go really dark what you don't
want is this eye this still amount of a
decent amount of contrast but if we look
over here if you get a little bit
lighter oh man that just it just makes
it makes you want to shoot yourself you
don't want to do that because you can
barely see like the the difference or
the contrast between these two elements
here you know it hurts your eyes almost
so that's one thing to always consider
is contrast contrast contrast it's like
one of the four
core foundational principles of any type
of design so we could go white or we can
go dark I'm gonna go dark and it's gonna
be in this blue area and roughly right
around there looks pretty good all right
so that is two zero three one three AAA
or one 3a sorry about that all right we
can also add this to the color swatches
right there okay next we're gonna create
sort of like a top bar along the top so
I'm going to hit control D to duplicate
that we can check out take a look at our
layers too by the way so we can see we
have rectangle one into just copies of
each other
I'm going to drag this one up on top
roughly right around here we don't want
a border so I'm going to uncheck that
and we also don't want it to be rounded
here at the bottom so the way we do that
I'm gonna zoom up oh by the way this
bottom one we don't want a border there
either so just so we can see this
temporarily I'm gonna make it white we
don't want this rounded angle here so
we're going to double click choose that
one so I'm left clicking on this anchor
point and I'm also gonna come over here
I'm going to hold the space and my damn
cat just jumped on my desk here messing
me all up alright so I just I select
both of those while holding shift and
hit delete and that's how you get rid of
that and we're gonna make this top maybe
just a slightly darker so to do that on
my fill I got my dog up here by the way
the cat is on my desk this is turning
into like a nightmare oh well I'm not
gonna worry too much all right
that's pretty good right there alright
so also when you do this you could see
if I double click this let me make this
white real quick let me add is two
swatches so we still have it we'll see
that
this right here is affecting that
there's a little directional anchors I
just pushed that up and it's happening
over here as well there we go now it
should be straight across all right
so now let's take this will make that
color again right around there
all right cool that works now we're
gonna have a sidebar so to do that we'll
also just go ahead and take this hit
control D so it created another
duplicate over here dragging this in and
this time we'll make it the same color
as the top just initially and then this
is going to be real hard to see I want
to make sure we could see all the
differences here because the the
difference is in color going to be
slight all right so we have this
yeah actually it's going to be really
close to the top so I'm going to change
the top here to be slightly darker so
now we can see kind of a difference
between these three here and what just
happened
I accidentally I moved that it over
nobody'll try to fix this there we go
okay all right so far so good now I'm
going to add kind of like a logo area
right here so with the type tool I'm
going to put in tactical stuff that's
going to be the name of this weird app
or company or whatever it is by default
I'm gonna choose railway font and that's
a free font you guys can tell I use it
in a lot of my videos and I'm also gonna
change this here to bold and choose a
color like right around here at the top
this is going to be white just to create
a little bit difference in like a little
bit of a word mark logo all right right
there's pretty good I'm gonna put a
vertical navigation right here make it
line up with the very left side where
this begins so this is going to be right
there I'm going to put in railway for
the font we'll take down the size just
slightly you right around there and I'm
gonna change it to semi bold and also
the color we don't want to be gray we'll
go ahead and just choose this by default
and we'll just bring it up so we have a
good amount of contrast there okay so
looking at this in terms of alignment
alignment is another thing that is
absolutely critical when you're
designing your user interfaces every
element needs to be aligned in sort of a
a thought-out symmetrical way and so
what I mean by that is if we look at the
logo right here we could see I didn't
choose to put it right over here because
I throws things off there's no there's a
lot of padding at the top but now
there's like 1/4 of that padding right
here so you want equal padding and
margins between your elements you can
also see that vertically in B when it
comes to this top bar right here it's
right in the center so you need to make
sure you pay attention to that and it's
one of those things that if you're new
to this type of design you're not
usually not thinking about it and that's
one of the pitfalls it just results in a
design that just looks bad you're not
sure why and you're mad and life is
horrible and everything so just think of
that going forward now the same thing
here we don't necessarily have to for
instance we have a a certain amount of
padding between this portion in here and
then this portion here you don't have to
maintain that necessarily for almost
every element when it comes to repeating
elements you definitely should have an
even amount of white space between these
elements so to repeat a vertical
navigation here in Adobe XD we'll click
on that little repeat grid and just pull
down and we'll just have four links here
initially and let's see what this looks
like a hundred percent I'm still gonna
make these smaller which I can I can
make that adjustment and a little bit
later
right around there is good once we're
happy with that we can ungroup it and
then I'm gonna take all four of these by
holding shift and just scale down just a
little bit more I'm gonna make them a
little bit smaller this next one I'm
gonna call tactical and I'm just coming
up with names that really don't make
sense briefings and Intel
all right cool now we're going to
simulate what it looks like when one of
these is selected so to do that we're
going to create a rectangle right here
all right we can adjust few other things
afterwards we can get rid of the border
here and we're going to use this fill
take the eyedropper tool actually I kind
of want this to be a little bit brighter
so I'm gonna come up like right there
and now we're going to position this
beneath this one we'll make the fill
right here so as you can see when it
comes to selecting items you want the
contrast also to be quite high so here
we're simply inversing the color scheme
that we're really working with up here I
don't like that this is a little bit off
it should be this one right here and we
can add this to our swatches - all right
great so far so good now notice you know
when we were creating the space in
between each of these I gave it a lot of
room that's another thing that new
designers kind of get wrong they cram
everything together they make everything
extremely tiny no give things room to
breathe that's if there's anything that
you should walk away with this video
it's that things need to have space
between them now obviously you can do
too much space but usually new designers
to cram and everything together I'm not
sure why I did the same thing okay that
looks pretty good so far to me all right
so right here we're gonna have sort of
like a video player kind of like a video
type thing I really when I design this I
wasn't really thinking of any type of
specific project in mind I just wanted
to come up with something that looked
interesting from which I could you know
show you design principles and stuff so
make sure this is I kind of a hundred
percent in this section right here in
the main body of this
and the color doesn't matter because
what we're gonna do now is I found
through images google calm I sorted it
by free to use images and also free to
modify images and I came up with this
one I do my best to remember to link
this in the description so that you guys
can just quickly access this and just
take this image you can save it to your
desktop somewhere and when you do that
Maya that photos right here make sure
this is selected and we're gonna just
simply drag this over there tada
it's one of the exciting things about
Adobe XD so this is a pretty good
looking right here we're going to take
the opacity down quite a bit so maybe
around 37% all right that looks good and
underneath it we're going to create kind
of like a bar where there's like a
progress bar as if this is a video so
I'm gonna take another rectangle drag it
out maybe right around there looks good
and no border get this background here
click on it make it slightly darker just
like that okay now let's go ahead and
the next part the one of the also I want
to just mention when it comes to these
type of layouts detail is key when it
comes to sort of futuristic slash gamers
there's all the what really makes it are
the details so I'm gonna sit here and
real quickly trying to make a quick just
a little video player UI so we'll take
the pen tool holding shift
just to create a little play icon and I
don't like for some reason they don't
allow you to see if this is in the
middle or not but yeah no big deal right
there is pretty good we're gonna use our
foreground color right there we're going
to create kind of a by the way going to
make this a little bit smaller we're
going to create the actual progress
section it's gonna take a thin sort of
skinny little bar here and I'll put in a
slightly darker color right around there
all right well let's we want this to be
in the center I'm gonna zoom way up here
zoom up more we can see we can also drag
this out we're gonna have an area where
there's the time now once you have that
in place ctrl D to duplicate it and
we'll change the color to our primarily
color here and then we'll drag this and
just to emulate you know okay this is
perhaps near the center or so it's like
inactive actively being played or
whatever so let's come over here and put
in a type here and what I could do is
take from here to here I can left-click
and drag out a text area and then Center
it right here and I'll just put
something random like 0 4 31 again we'll
use our railway actually no railway has
a really ugly type 4 for font so we're
not going to use that let's see here
what else do I want to do we'll make it
also this bright color
take the size down so you can just left
click and drag down in this little area
right there all right coming along so
far so good I another thing I wanted to
add real quick would be an area where
for instance if you hover it over or
clicked I don't really know I haven't
thought about it in terms of whether
it's a hover click either way this I
pop-up will show up over here so to do
that we'll take our rectangle tool again
maybe drag out an area about this size
get rid of the border it's always
applying that damn border and then we'll
make it black but we'll take down the
opacity right around 65% so inside will
have some type now just try to remember
keeping your mind when we're adding the
type or trying to really pay attention
to margin padding white space all that
stuff so I'm gonna put in waterboarding
101 I don't know why I chose that we'll
put in yeah we'll make that our primary
color railway we'll take the let's see
here we'll make this bold
all right so position position so right
here seems pretty good the top of the
type is matching the middle of this
section over here and also from here to
here it's being it's it has even space
next we'll take the type tool again and
the lift left-click and drag out a
section and you can see exactly where I
have it's pretty much even space all
around from its parent container that
black container so it has a lot of space
from which it can breathe and so if you
go to lips um
calm you can get you or lorem ipsum
generated fake text to put in let me do
that real quick right here it's gonna
copy that
sorry it wasn't highlighting for me
there we go
take this paste that in obviously some
major adjustments here so size goes way
down here
we don't want it bold mediums looks
pretty good I'm gonna put a space in
here alright and then we'll go ahead and
make this not cut that color because we
leave it that color even though we do
have a lot of different you know a lot
of contrast here there's no separation
and this is another thing that's real
important something called visual
hierarchy and this isn't just specific
to UI design it's pretty much
universally applicable to any type of
design visual hierarchy is creating a
separation between the different
elements and also prioritizing different
elements in your design so you do that
through size color in an actual physical
horizontal and vertical position and and
all that stuff so right here we're
giving them the the same color so it
kind of creates it's a little bit hard
to see a distinction between the two so
we can and we can increase that
distinction by changing the color so I'm
gonna make this color that we've been
working with except it's going to be up
here more on the G saturated side maybe
right around there and then we can also
increase the line height oops that was
the size sorry about that right around
there
alright cool another thing will create
some sort of very strange kind of
navigation for like a sub navigation
over here so I'm just going to hit
control D to copy that
I'm gonna move it over on the right just
like a few times
my right here book Hiroki take this up
to 100% we'll make this the color we've
been working with alright and then we'll
put in take this control D and right now
it's at the bottom just bring this to
the top and we're going to rotate it
over here to 90 degrees remember try to
keep things all centered up right there
so if I double click this we have to
double click up here and I'm just going
to put in intelligence I better have
spelled that right or would be quite
ironic right there alright and then
we'll take both of these and we'll hit
repeat grid and pull it out to the right
just two times and we'll bring in the
space pretty much even with the space
that was over here so ungroup it and now
we can just change these real quick
psyops
and this one will be Coogan I don't know
what I was thinking here right there all
right looking pretty cool at this point
um let's see here it's kind of very wide
but that's okay the original one design
was a little bit less wide like this in
terms of aspect ratio all right so let's
continue on this is getting close
getting there getting close another
thing I want to do is add some icons and
so a great resource to getting icons is
at icon finder calm you can sort by
icons like whether or not they're free
and don't require backlinks from your
website or your project if you want to
use them this is one of those cases so I
typed in satellite and I found this one
and now also had it's a set so it shows
all those down there so I just chose
three of these and I download the SVG so
you can click SVG SVG just get three of
them and then save them to your desktop
and now you can see where mine are now
I'm just going to left-click and drag
somewhere at the top and I might as well
do each one of these real quickly oops
when you do this you want to make sure
nothing else is selected because it'll
try to impose it into that section all
right
so now we have this cluttered mess over
here now sometimes when you import the
SVG's from icon foreigner or anywhere
else and you try to change the color you
may think you're not able to but you are
it just has to do with the groupings and
structures based on whoever created it
so if I double click or if I try to
change a color over here just by click
on it we see it's not there but that's
because it's in a group and so this one
has a bunch of groups for some reason
and now we can see we have access to
change the color to our main color right
here so now we can just really decrease
that size quite a bit let's see right
there you see it's small I don't want
you don't want to saw it you want
icons for instance if you can replace
them in a bar like this big that's just
that looks terrible it will never look
good please don't do it
so we'll take this down give things room
to breathe
you can see it's also an equal space
from the top and right all right and
we'll just keep on repeating that
process so come in here here in here
take both of these paths by holding
shift and change that color let me do
that real quick over here while I'm in
that mode change that alright great so
now I'll take this one scale it down big
time kind of just get it over there
randomly and then same thing with this
one scale it down holding shift and alt
while I do this and that changes how it
scales down towards the center all right
so you want these to be obviously for
purpose of purposes of consistency the
same size otherwise it's just going to
make your design look like garbage and
also equal space between and it gives
you kind of like a purple guide there to
help you with that process all right
that looks good we're almost done almost
almost so at the bottom we have some
empty space here so I thought okay maybe
this can be some type of video
thumbnails and I
oops I'm gonna zoom up like this I'm
going to let's hide this real quick take
the pen tool I'm going to hold shift
left click and left click right around
there then hit escape and then we're
going to change the cut the border
rather right around there so that's 4 4
5 7 6 1
all right and then I'm going to
duplicate that with control D and then
drag this right over here while holding
shift so that they're equal size and I'm
holding shift and just dragging it to
the right I'm going to take both of
these control D to duplicate them
holding shift there we go so now we've
direct we've drug it down or we flip the
order rather and then select let's see
here these four might be easier just to
go over here and just like these paths
and I'm going to group them ctrl G we'll
put them in a group and get these even
up over here with the whitespace also
making a start at the left of this play
icon would make sense too all right and
then inside of here we're going to take
this control D to do duplicate it bring
this here in the middle hold shift and
alt to scale that up we're gonna make
the fill this color all right and then
also we'll take a ellipse in the center
holding shift and alt and scale that up
drag it down up one second let me move
this over real quick let's find this guy
and drag it up here re lips will go
underneath that get rid of the border
here and then we'll make this fill that
color right here which is this I think
it's the same or very close at least
alright so we have these two elements we
want to make sure that in the center
there we go
actually the center of this I'm gonna
make sure that's yep all right so we'll
take this and then this as well and then
hit ctrl G and then we'll use repeat
grid to make it go all the way across
how many are here about five wow it's
kind of hard to see those but they're
there and especially in this video you
may not be able to see them very well
all right great
so another thing I want to do real
quickly is I kind of create what
happened there this got moved again I
think let me move that into place all
right good it creates sort of like a
little picker or I'm not even sure what
you would describe this as I'm just
taking a rectangle right here and then
also we'll make it that darker color
like I said the details and these kind
of intricate user interfaces is what
really makes them more impressive so
this will be this color I have an
ellipse here even space right in the
middle right there awesome
all right another thing that I wanted to
do is to take this the very first layer
that we created duplicate it will change
we'll take the one at the bottom we're
going to hold alt scale this out maybe
right around here and then also take the
top hold all scale it down just a bit as
if there's another panel back here and
take the opacity right around 50% and
that just kind of adds an extra layer of
something that's interesting and they
design essentially another thing I
wanted to do is take this we're going to
duplicate it control D
drag it just two above or actually just
to the very bottom
so let's drink this up here now it's at
the very bottom I'm going to move this
up real quick
because I don't want to select the one
on the top so I'm taking my keyboard and
just putting that right around there and
then I'm going to duplicate that with
control D change the fill to anything
random and maybe just white and then
changes to a background blur so you have
this amount over here and the opacity
let's see here brightness yeah we can
also take down this fill as well and let
me just experiment with something
because we can really increase the the
blur if we do something increase that'
pasady take this one
it's not blurring it very much there we
go that app acity up there has to be
changed and has to be increased all the
way to a hundred percent ah I do it like
that mm-hmm
let's see here yeah I think I I think I
do
I think I like that sometimes you come
back to things and thinking yourself
yeah I'm not sure if I like that
we'll leave it that for now and then
finally another thing I wanted to do is
we'll take him let's see we'll take ya
we'll take one of these actually I'll
take this one right here this arrow
duplicate it increase the size bring it
over here give it a fill make it that
color this one will place over here
right there looks good duplicate it
control D bring this one over here
get that lined up more evenly all rights
I'm kind of hesitant though I'm not sure
if I like this take this make it darker
maybe
yeah I like that crew in that is it so I
really when I was designing I was really
trying to remember okay make sure you're
describing what you're doing and so I
think the biggest takeaway that I had
here is that you know in relation to
this design one of the things that I
felt like I really needed to stress is
alignment and white space that is one of
the biggest things all in all so
contrast those three things if you can
get those three three things right
you're generally going to be able to
create a user interface that is well
structured and easy to use for the user
this little experimental thing that may
not be very easy to use but I wanted to
throw in something unique there just for
the fun of it but yeah this is the
design hopefully you're able to walk
away learning some new stuff here in
Adobe XD CC 1.0 and also about user
interface design in general alright make
sure you check out corset row i'm gary
