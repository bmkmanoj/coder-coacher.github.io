course calm and welcome to the fourth
video of 2014
today is January 4th and today we're
going to go ahead and do a logo project
follow along and this is going to be for
an upcoming radio show called try this
at home with Dana Martin now Dana Martin
is an advocate of peaceful parenting and
unschooling and if you're unsure of what
that is just go ahead and check out Dana
Martin calm alright we're gonna use
Adobe Illustrator CC to design a logo
that meets her requirements so first if
you haven't already check out design
course calm put in your email and if you
need access to the project files there
in the link below this video in the
description alright let's get started so
let's go to file new and we're just
going I'm going to use 800 by 600 and
hit enter and then hit ctrl one to get
to a hundred percent now the information
that I had from her is that the name is
try this at home with Dana Martin so she
wanted to include all that along with
the website address and she also wanted
it to have a progressive feel I tribal
um and to use pink and black and to also
communicate the idea of you know what
this is all about which is pretty much
peaceful parenting and love etc so she
did suggest possibly using a heart so I
came up with a concept and we're gonna
go ahead and design that now so the
first thing I want to do is actually get
the heart designed so to do this let's
go to view and we'll go to show grid and
then we'll go to view and snap to grid
so now we have this grid here and we're
gonna use the pen tool but first I'm
going to zoom up just a bit about 200%
and it doesn't really matter where I'm
just going to start right I'll start
right here and with the pen tool I'll
just go ahead and left-click and I think
I'll start right up or
out here and hold shift so that we're
gonna shift out one two three four five
times and I'm going to go right around
here and hold down shift down one two
three four five times and I'm just
eyeballing this by the way I mean
definitely make some adjustments and
then I'm going to come down to right
around here and I'm going to drag out
I'm using my mouse girl rule screw a
scroll with wheel rather and I think
right around there would be pretty
decent and then if you want to make it
any adjustments to any of these points
you'll take the direct selection tool up
here and you can click on the actual
point and you can hold shift to drag
that down I think that's basically than
you adjust an adjustment that I want to
make but yeah it's pretty easy to make
these adjustments by dragging those
around so now what we want to do is just
basically flip this so first we have to
duplicate it so I'm going to hit ctrl C
and then ctrl F then right click go to
transform reflect and this dialog box
will come up and just leave it at
vertical and hit OK so now what you want
to do is drag that over right there by
holding shift and now what we want to do
is join those so let's go ahead i we
don't need a stroke we're just going to
give it a pink color here and so now
what we want to do is bring up a window
and go to pathfinder and we want to
select this one a unite and that
basically takes it all on a single path
alright so let's go to window and then
we will go to a view rather unclick snap
to grid and then we'll go to hide grid
so now I'm just going to take this and
scale that down a bit
and let's go ahead over here I'm just
going to create a copy of this and hide
it so I'm gonna hit ctrl C then ctrl F
and now we have this ready to go
alright so now what we want to do is
create a sphere so let's drag out and
we'll take the ellipse tool and holding
shift and alt scale out to right around
there it doesn't have to be the exact
size doesn't really matter and now we're
going to do we're going to drag this
beneath and we're going to make it black
and we're going to take this here and
position it over it so I'm going to
scale out by holding shift and alt and
let's see go right around here okay that
looks pretty good so once you have that
all aligned up now what you can do is
take this go to object path divide well
first I want to copy that sorry about
that and then hide that layer then we'll
go to object path divide objects below
alright so then what we want to do is
get rid of that center portion and then
we'll bring back the one that we copied
and hid from the previous step so now
what we want to do with this is select
it and then hold shift null and scale
that down to right around there alright
so the idea that I had going with this
is to accomplish a couple things first
obviously we have the heart outline here
and the heart within the heart right
here I and secondly we also can see kind
of like a flower if we got rid of that
portion we can see you know basically
the idea of what could be portrayed as a
flower which is symbolic of growth and
personal development etc so now what I
want to do is
go ahead and get the ellipse to a lot
again and I'm gonna select right around
the middle of everything hold shift and
alt and we'll go light right around here
and I'll go ahead and take the gradient
area right there and I will hide the
foreground or get rid of it rather and
then we'll give it a stroke and the
stroke right now isn't too poor and
actually we'll save it for another step
what we're going to do is hold alt and
select right there with by left clicking
and now this will allow us to create
text that will follow this circle just
path so what we want to do is to type
try this at home okay and for the font
we're going to use something called yeah
known and I'm not even going to try to
pronounce that portion and we're going
to make that part bold and really
increase the font size a bit here and
then also I'm going to increase the
letter spacing by clicking over here to
a character and we'll make I will try
200 there actually I mean want to go for
a little bit less we'll try 100 all
right that looks pretty good alright and
then what we want to do is duplicate
this so control C and ctrl F and this
time I'm going to move the start of it
over here and I'm going to double click
on everything there and type in with
Dana Martin and this time I'm going to
make the size if the 18 we'll try just
try 11 and you may need to adjust it
based on the font you're using and that
looks pretty good
and then finally we want to get the
Idina Martin calm down there so I'm
going to control C and control F that
and then you'll see this area where we
can drag this in and we see it comes up
there we can just rotate this around and
I'm going to enlarge this by
left-clicking holding shift and all and
scaling up I'm going to try right around
there for now and we're going to type
Dana Martin calm and this time we're
going to use a light or the thin version
okay and I also want them to be the same
font size so this font size is 11 if you
recall now because we scaled this up
increase the font size to eleven point
seven seven so let's just change that
back down
and we'll go ahead and twist that a
little bit more all right so now what I
want to do is create kind of a a border
that goes all the way around here so
I'll create another ellipse and we'll
try to match this up just to right
around here and we can make further
adjustments once we get this out of the
way
so let's hide or get rid of the
foreground
let's give it a stroke of two pixels and
further adjust this
alright alright so now what we want to
do is go to object path outline stroke
and then I'm gonna take actually just so
I can see underneath this I'm gonna go
to transparency and just drop that down
that down to 20 I'm going to zoom up
here and again we can I adjust this so
everything lines up the top of there and
there all right and then we'll take the
pen tool and we'll click right here and
then right over here and then we'll just
go all the way around and we'll go ahead
and take this and then this and move it
over holding shift and now we want to do
is get an object path divide objects
below select that portion and delete it
and let's bring it all back I'm gonna
take this and just scale it up alright
alright that looks pretty good so I'm
going to take that back to 100% and we
need to adjust this this doesn't really
seem in line enough so what I'm going to
do is just take this here and we'll
scale it up and position it a little bit
differently you want this to basically
follow this area and then once again if
this was I 23.1 then this one needs to
be changed to 23.1 as well alright so
now I I'm going to focus on the actual
heart now I want to take all this so
let's take hold the shift key select
these four layers and we're gonna hold
the shift key now we don't want quite a
45 degree rotation but what we want to
do is probably right around here
okay and then we'll go ahead and zoom up
here to this heart and just to try to
get some lines here we want to follow
the contour of this portion right here
of the heart so we'll get started
and we'll go ahead and end this right
around here okay and then hold the Alt
key and then left-click once and we'll
click right around here and then right
around this edge we'll drag up all right
and then we'll hold alt and then combine
it to the original starting point all
right and then we'll go ahead actually I
want to adjust that real quick so we'll
take the direct selection tool and we'll
drag that and then we'll go back to the
move tool and we'll duplicate this so
ctrl c ctrl f we'll right click and then
go to transform reflect and vertical and
then we basically just want to match
this up on this side and that'll be and
that's not quite right we want this to
be even so we'll just have to play
around with this just a little bit and
not quite there yet okay that looks like
close enough for now just for the
demonstration of this we can refine it
further if you wish and so now I what we
want to do is basically take this and go
to object path divide objects below and
the same thing with object path divide
objects below so now if we take these
and select this we can hit the Delete
key all right and so now that got rid of
all those things now you may notice
it will have created a couple of other
layers that we don't want yeah so if we
deleted that selecting knows and we'll
deal with that in a little bit all right
so now what I'm going to do is create
some shadows so we'll go ahead and I'm
going to just use I the same color here
and I'm gonna select just around here
and just end it right up around this
point going right around there so now if
I come up and I follow this middle
portion and then go to object path
divided objects below I can now use the
direct selection tool so select this and
we'll make this a darker color so we'll
go to gradient we'll select a foreground
color and just just a little bit darker
right there and then we'll do the same
thing for this side and this time we'll
kind of invert how we tapered it off so
we'll taper it off more over here oops
and we'll come up end it right around
there get an object path you've got it
objects below direct selection tool and
we will make it that color with the
eyedropper all right
so now I just a few other things to make
this more look more like a flower
usually at the top portion they have an
edge or like a ring kind of like a tulip
does so that's what I'm gonna do here so
we're going to make a white foreground
color choose the pen tool and kind of
just start right around here with the
pen tool and come in maybe yeah
we'll start right here and end it right
around here right there okay well make
sure it's closed and then what we can do
is just ctrl c ctrl f right click and go
to transform reflect hit okay
and then we'll just come over here and
get that same thing kind of going which
this is not correct yet you want the
orientation to be the same over here and
it looks pretty good
alright and then finally I'm going to
continue on these paths right around
here so these shadowy areas we can go
ahead and just take you can start right
around here and go say right around
there hold alt and we'll click around
this portion and go to object path
divide objects below and we'll choose
this then also I'm going to take this as
well go to object path divide object
below delete that will get rid of those
edges afterwards we'll do the same thing
over here
alright and then we will also do the
same thing with this portion so we'll go
ahead and and we'll start right around
here
and we'll come up and it doesn't really
have to be it doesn't have to match this
one exactly and then we'll come up
around here and close that off the
object path divided objects below select
this portion and select that all right
all right so now what we want to do is
go ahead and take this I kind of just
want to see I I think some adjustments
do need to be but first what I want to
do is get rid of those areas here before
I do that I'm going to take all these
hit ctrl shift and the letter O and that
converts everything to outlines and then
we'll zoom up here and we'll use the
direct selection tool to get those out
of the way and then do the same thing
over here I think we saw some over here
these
oops these lines that got in the way
actually this is its own oops
layer so if we just go to object path
divide object below we can I get rid of
that now we have this and that all right
all right so that looks pretty good to
go for now now let's go ahead and take
everything and we'll go to layers and
we're just going to group this together
hit by hitting ctrl G and we'll create a
copy of that so ctrl C and ctrl F will
hide this one beneath it and then hold
shift and scale us down and let's see
here alright so that looks pretty good
so to kind of illustrate the concept
what we could do is take everything
let's copy it I'll just like select it
and go to ungroup and we'll get rid of
the type and if we wanted to show this
to the client to kind of illustrate you
know what we were doing in terms of
thought processes I what we do is leave
this one here and we could make this one
with this path real light just to kind
of illustrate once you get rid of this
or make it light you can kind of see the
flower effect that we're going for and
then we can do the same thing we can
move this over I and then also bring
that back to black and also just kind of
illustrate the fact that there is a kind
of a negative space heart right here and
then a heart within the heart and the
client did request kind of a tribal feel
so that's what these lines are and so I
did present it to the client and they're
really happy with it fortunately so that
is it I so go ahead and visit these on
course comm if you haven't yet and until
tomorrow I'll see you then alright good
