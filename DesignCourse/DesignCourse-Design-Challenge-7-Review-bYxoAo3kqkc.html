today I'm going to be doing the review
of the seventh design course naw Kham
design challenge which is all about
photo manipulation titled shattered
world I the turnout wasn't very good so
I'm probably not going to be doing one
of these photo manipulation contests
again for the design challenge but
nonetheless we did have some entries i
entered it myself just for the hell of
it so let's go ahead real quickly and do
the review alright so let me go down
here to the first entry these are just a
preview or inspirations and also notice
about the 0 relatively simple in
execution you know there's not a lot
going on although they're very
interesting because you know they've
been manipulated in such a way that
makes them unique in thought-provoking
alright so this one you know as he
mentioned it's not I was made Halloween
so it wasn't even for this contest so
it's not too relevant as another person
person mentioned here I so not really
about a shattered world maybe just
assess shattered individual i'll divide
a critique godiva saying you know you
might want to i dim the background so
that to the shatter effect is more
easily visible i would say alright so
Janine I think that's how you pronounce
that there's a couple things here that
just immediately I say would make an
improvement so the second would be are
the first would be I the contrast so
there's not much contrast going on right
here there's it's kind of dull the
colors kind of seemed just the hands are
good or this the skeleton hands but the
world is just kind of muted and so you
can't immediately see it and it just
kind of gets lost a little bit same
thing with the skull just kind of seems
a little bit muted and another thing is
I everything seems just a little bit
symmetrical and so there's something
called the rule of thirds I'm going to
bring it over here I right here and so
it's a rule of thumb I just basically
just guidelines
about trying to make images or
competitions or compositions and designs
I look interesting and so basically the
guideline proposes that ended an image
should be imagined as divided into nine
equal parts by two equally spaced
horizontal lines as seen here and with
the important components should be
placed along these lines or at their
intersections so if we see in the center
is really not too much important that's
happening in the middle I but so we can
see to the right here the main focal
point of this image for example is the
tree in the little tiny island we can
see it's not centered up and it's pushed
over to the right and so you can really
I read more about this and do Google
search on the rule of thirds and you'll
find a lot of information I'll go into
that and it definitely does help your
images kind of take I just one level up
I guess you could say in terms of
appearance I this one it definitely
follows the rule of thirds so
unfortunately I still haven't gotten
around to fixing this so if you're
logged in for a long time and then try
to post it lets you post but it lost the
session and information what the hell am
i doing anyhow I have no clue who posted
this but fortunately no one's getting
prizes or anything I don't do that for
these entries these challenges but yeah
this is interesting I I think this is
Earth I'm not sure maybe it was I it was
manipulated heavy which case is cool
because this is all about photo
manipulation and something just died
gnarly over here is happening or
something exploding or whatever I pretty
cool and I have really much too much
more to say other than that I let's
check out the images though I didn't
actually check this out at all okay so
this is just a planet um it was an
actual photograph though unfortunately
but that's okay alright so go down here
this is a LG poor boy I think I back
when I was picking winners this person
won a few
I so what's happening here is quite a
bit actually let me just try to scale
out the browser so we could see it um
something tells me that this was
possibly a part of another contest I
don't know because I bigger Vern posted
something that he created and it kind of
has two elephants and a tortoise as well
you mentioned that this is for a
different contests but no big deal I
yeah so unlike the ones at the top here
which are all pretty simplistic in their
idea on execution there's a lot going on
here so I like the actual Photoshop work
and what is done to try to you know make
this look like an interesting image I
but let's see here um I think because it
this is due to a um I guess you could
say maybe a different contests or
challenge or whatever it's not entirely
one hundred percent i guess you could
say relevant I mean I understand it's a
shadow world up here there's half of it
gone I but the other stuff i mean i
guess you could say it's just fantasy /
abstract and in that sense it's
effective but yeah i do like the actual
work done in photoshop so i don't have
anything to khatik there and here's
another one I imagine the earth has a
fragile egg cracking and spilling its yo
going into space I so yeah it achieves
that idea and that look I guess you
could say I really it requires a lot of
work to kind of make that look like a
realistic sort of thing you know I guess
you could say I and so I the idea was a
cool idea I think also in terms of the
composition scaling is down a lot you
know this main thing and getting away
from the edge so much be definitely an
improvement just so kind of see you know
give it some white space between the
main image here that would have helped
for sure and then we have the same sort
of
idea up here I compared to the one from
LG portfolio and again just a lot
happening kind of diverse or got away a
little bit from mom the initial images i
posted but yeah cool nonetheless there's
just a lot happening so I'm kind of a
minimalist when it comes to elements I'm
trying to ideally try to keep them to a
minimum other than that cool stuff and
here's one that I made just for the heck
of it um I never entered these contests
and I felt like entering I mean do a
video tour on this and i forgot to i
heed my own rules I didn't mean host in
the reference images I should have done
that damn it but yeah I've all he did
was take a TI in earth nasa earth photo
and then a couple cracked earth photos
and this matchstick and then everything
else the flames and stuff and the work
in here was all done in i/o that
photoshop so yeah sorry i just had like
this too and a power tennis match my
head's like fried anyhow this is my
contribution and all i think it was
awesome one in terms of idea just
insanity is this one from mac my chorus
let me zoom up here oops there we go I
very interesting we got a panda we got a
cow we have some whales and dolphins
that that's just awesome I mean I can't
even could take it because you include
these elements and it immediately
becomes a masterpiece you know the fact
that these aren't blurred or anything
these shadows that doesn't matter this
is just awesome alright so yeah you know
what I'm probably going to stay away
from doing I photomanipulation design
challenges I just don't think it's right
for the audience you guys aren't
interested in that sort of thing
apparently so a next design challenge so
we've had seven of them so far and each
one is focused on something entirely
different in terms of design the next
challenge I'm going
to be focusing on a logo design one I
think we'll get a lot more entries and
people will be more in their element I
think all right so check out design
course calm subscribe here on youtube if
you haven't yet i'll see you tomorrow
with a new video and it might just be
the design challenge aight i'm not sure
yet though all right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
