dependencies installed before we can
actually install an angular 4 project
so first is no js' along with the node
package manager and then also the
angular command-line interface now to
check whether or not you have no js'
installed we want to visit the console
or the command line and simply type in
node - V alright so you can see mine is
version six point nine point four but if
yours is not installed it will say it's
an unrecognized command now if this is
the case you want to head on over to
node J s org or click on downloads and
then depending on your current operating
system whether that's Windows or
Macintosh - windows you want to click it
and then once it is done downloading
we'll go ahead and launch the Installer
and we'll hit next
accept the terms choose to leave it here
at the current folder or change the
installation directory directory if you
want and then also we can see by default
we have the NPM package manager ready to
be installed
so then we could just hit next and then
install now once it has finished go
ahead and close down your command line
or your console and reload it then you
can run the above command one more time
and it will give you the version number
instead of it being an unrecognized
command ok so now that we have that done
what we also want to do is install the
angular command-line interface or the
angular CLI if you visit the official
site for it which is CLI angular dot IO
it will give you some more information
about this tool but in a nutshell it
allows you to quickly install an angular
4 project and also it gives you some
handy command-line tools that will aid
you in the development of your angular 4
app ok so to install we see right here
have the command very simply it's using
the node package manager
NPM to install globally which is - G
II the angular CLI all right so let's go
ahead and run that command and by the
way to know whether or not you actually
have that installed we simply run ng - V
and of course it is installed for me so
now what we want to do is run that
command NPM install - g4 global and when
you add - G that installs it globally on
your machine so you only have to run
this once you won't have to run every
single time you try to start a project
and let's go ahead and hit enter alright
and once it's finished don't worry about
any of these warnings if they do show up
for you alright so now we're ready to
install an angular 4 project with the
command-line interface so I'm going to
hop into my code folders and you can
really put this anywhere you want
wherever you want to store your projects
and now to start a new project with the
command line interface it's very simple
ng new and then the name of the project
so we'll just call this ng 4 -
playground and hit enter alright now
once that is finished we'll go ahead and
CD into the name of the project that we
created so CD ng 4 - playground alright
and now now if we want to check what
version of angular it actually installed
we can type once we're inside of the
project folder ng - V once more and this
time it's going to provide us with all
the versions of the angular core in
their packages so we can see for me it's
2.4 so this is installing an angular 2
project and that's because angular the
angular community near face hasn't yet
integrated or installed angular for and
that's because I'm doing this pretty
early on it's March 21st and so if you
run this you may find that yours is
already installing an angular 4 project
if that's the case then you don't need
to do the next step which is to install
or upgrade this angular 2 project to
work project so to do that we can go
ahead and visit the github.com ford /
angular chord / angular blob matter and
changelog - MD and this will give you
insulator tips on how to upgrade or
install an angular 4 project here before
it's official release so if you're on
the Linux or Mac then you run this
command which is right here you copy all
this and you simply copy and then go
back to your command line and paste that
in or if you're on Windows like I am we
take this we'll copy that we'll go back
we'll right-click I'm going to paste
that and then hit enter alright and now
that that is done and clear this real
quick and we'll go back to that page
here and we also have to make sure that
we you are using typescript version 2.1
point 6 or higher so what you need to do
to install that is run npm install
typescript at 2.2.1 and save it and once
finished now we can type in ng - V and
it will show that we're now working
within an angular 4 project okay at this
point you can simply run ng serve and it
will launch a development server at
localhost 4200 which you can visit in
your browser and there we go app works
so that's how you launch and install in
angular 4 app using the angular
command-line interface now what if you
wanted to install it without the CLI
well you can also use git clone to clone
the official QuickStart now the
QuickStart currently at the time of
recording this is simply based on
angular 2 but we can still use that same
process to upgrade the QuickStart to an
angular 4 so just to show you how to do
that real quickly we're going to back up
a folder real quick and so I'm in my Mae
projects code folder and what we want to
do is run a git clone command and I will
paste that in so let's get clone and
then here's the URL of the QuickStart
and then we're going to name the project
QuickStart here at the end so I'll make
this quick start too because I believe I
already did install one at quick start
and then we simply CD into it all right
and then we run npm install and that
will take a look at everything that is
in the packaged up JSON file and install
it and once complete we can check out
the version with ng - V and we'll see
you know it's based on a 2.4 project of
angular so what we would have to do is
to run those NPM install commands that
we pasted or copied and pasted and then
that will upgrade it to an angular 4
project and because we're not using the
CLI for this QuickStart you can't use ng
serve instead you would use NPM start
once we do that it will launch a browser
at localhost 3000 alright so that's how
you install an angular 4 project both
with the command line interface tool and
also without it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
