today we have a quick tutorial on SVG
animation so we're going to first use
Adobe Illustrator to design a basic
loading type of illustration and then
we'll go ahead and save it as a SVG and
then edit some code in the SVG to make
animate so if you need access to the
project files are available for free at
design course comm and if you haven't
yet subscribed here on YouTube alright
let's get started alright so go ahead to
file new here in Adobe Illustrator we're
going to make the width and height 100
by 100 control 1 and that is a basic
size at 100% of what it's going to look
like so I'm going to zoom up here I'm
going to take out left-click and drag
the ellipse tool and I'm going to
left-click once and specify 100 by 100
alright so if you want to go to view
snap to grid and get this thing
basically lined up there I then what we
want to do is go ahead and scale it in
just a little bit holding shift and alt
and left clicking and dragging and we
want to make this stroke a dashed line
and we're going to make it also we're
going to get rid of the fill and then
switch to the stroke and change this to
the blue color alright and then I want
to take it and control C control F shift
and the Alt key to scale it in and then
this time get rid of the stroke and make
the fill the blue color alright so now
what we want to do is actually I think I
will use a rounded rectangle here we'll
make the foreground color white and I'm
going to turn off snap to grid and it's
going to hold alt
and make a bar roughly around that size
control see and then control F take
these two control C and control F and
then one more probably use the grid to
get those even but you don't have to
really I I'm not going to worry about
that for this tutorial though just going
to eyeball it
alright so that's basic the basic shape
very simple I so now what we want to do
is ctrl s to save and we want to save
this as an SVG will call this graphic
dot SVG hit enter and I'm going to leave
everything here the same and then just
hit OK then we'll load up sub line text
editor you can use notepad if you don't
have any type of HTML editor you can
download the project files and you'll
see this index.html and you should be
looking at the same thing here so inside
we're going to put image source equals
graphic dot SVG as you see I've saved it
in the same folder okay I'll go ahead
and save that and then load up or click
on rather the SVG and this is basically
kind of what you should be looking at so
it's confusing but this is basically all
of that image is this is what makes it
you know be produced or whatever so you
can get rid some of some of this stuff
up here
but basically what we want to do is make
some adjustments we can see that these
four paths 1 2 3 4 or 5 rather that have
the white color code RR bars and then we
also have a the first circle which is
the dashed circle right here so we want
to make that one rotate so what we want
to do is get rid of this slap at four
slash there and come down and put slash
circle to close that up now so inside is
where our transform your animation is
going to go
so what we want to do is put in animate
transform attribute name equals
transform and just leave it over here
attribute type equals so I had to pause
my wife had the garage door opening down
there pickles I xml and type equals
rotate from equals 0 100 actually this
is 50 sorry
I'll explain this in a second 2 equals
360 50 50 and do you are for duration
equals 10 s and for 10 seconds and then
repeat count equals indefinite which
will make it loop forever and I put
space here to make those green watch
because those white and then I basically
that will rotate this thing and a reason
to put instead of you could just leave
it at 0 to 360 that means it's rotating
you know basically full circle I but
putting 50:50 well you remember it was a
hundred by 100 for our width and our
height at 50 by 50 we'll make sure it
centers basically at the zero point so
it's centers like this otherwise if we
left it at zero and 360 it would be like
this it wouldn't work right I let me
demonstrate it let me open up this and
let me snag this over here
and as you can see it's rotating
perfectly actually we could have fixed
up that area where there's two of them
together in Illustrator is no big deal
though I so basically I if we had this
way and remove these two real quick
sorry I had to stop again and pause all
right and then come back here this was
the issue I was facing I was like what
how the hell do you do this and I was
doing searches and stuff anyhow that's
why I'm showing you just take the width
and height divided by two and you'll get
your two X&amp;amp;Y points all right so
basically that's it for there I now what
we want to do is kind of make those
areas I are these little things kind of
jump up and down so the way we do that
is let me there we go I will take
basically this part and we'll put in
where am i doing there we go we'll put
the slash path here and come in here and
basically kind of just do the same thing
except with some slightly different
information so animate transform ID and
you know what whatever I don't care
about the ID all right so now we're
going to do is attribute name equals
transform put my space in there the
attribute type equals xml type equals
translate translate basically means move
duration is one second values all right
now this is going to be a little bit
confusing so zero comma 15 semicolon
zero comma negative 15
and yeah I want to make sure to do that
okay cool in step semicolon basically
0:15 and then repeat count equals
indefinite okay
so let's save that and see if it works
all right that's a little bit much I
think so what we can do is take those 15
values take them down maybe to like six
I was using two hundred before just to
test this tutorial and I decided to go
with 100 that's better
all right so now what we want to do is
just to save time is take from the path
all the way up to here and copy and then
take these to paste paste paste and
paste and then what we want to do is put
in for these other four begin equals 0.1
so that means it's going to delay when
it begins this one will be point two
point three and point four also I want
to come over here and I'm going to put a
real quick some CSS style equals margin
top 200 pixels all right so now I go
ahead and open that up we'll see a
pretty cool loading graphic and we can
also see that I if we come over to let's
see here actually let me load up my
containing folder the actual SVG file is
only three Kb so if you were to try to
do this as like an animated gif or
something it would be a lot a lot lot
I would imagine and so yeah there you go
I I know you can also do hover effects I
haven't quite messed with that yet but
of course if you wanted to fix up this
area because I don't like that let me go
over to illustrator and usually you can
I
if you hit control H while you select it
you get rid of that box view all you
have to do is mess around with the dash
gap the value like maybe 15 now it looks
like they're all spread out a lot better
alright so yeah that is it so that's
just a quick tutorial and yeah I will
talk to you guys tomorrow but first
check out design course comm if you
haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube
all right good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
