today we're going to have a quick video
because I was so damn busy throughout
the entire day I think it's almost like
10pm right now I and I didn't know what
I was going to do up until just a couple
hours ago but anyhow I saw my facebook
feed a potential logo design that was
being presented for a local high school
for a stadium and so I decided to take a
crack at it at redesigning it kind of by
keeping the same concept in mind so
whenever you come across a logo design
that you have to redesign or even start
from scratch that has a lot of elements
in it this is a good technique and just
an idea as a way to kind of combine
everything into one single mark alright
so I'm not going to do any design work
in Illustrator or anything this is just
going to be an exploit video so yeah
check out design course calm if you
haven't yet in subscribe here on YouTube
ok so this is basically the logo that
was proposed and there are several
different elements that are basically a
requirement as a part of the logo for
the stadium so obviously you know having
the the indian head for Warren G
Harding's logo obviously would make
complete sense to have and include and
then also this arc here is also
something that's central to the logo the
type here obviously and this spear tort
sort of thing which is I something that
they have on the players helmets so to
include these and plus this red element
also has significance to the school so
the issues that I saw when I first saw
this coming across my facebook feed is
to the local thing is everything kind of
just feel separate you have three
separate primary elements basically you
have you know this up here you have the
type and then you have this spear and I
the arrowhead I mean and then you have
this type Raiders which is kind of like
the the
it's name of the look of the school so
everything just kind of felt separate so
when it comes to sport logos or any
logos where you have a lot of
requirements or kind of complex the way
you really need to construct them is to
make them feel as a one identical
identifiable object is to just try to
combine everything kind of an essential
shape so what I did is this over here so
let me just zoom out here real quick so
if we screw laut we could see the
differences between these two logos and
this over here of course everything just
kind of feels like one identifiable mark
so we have all the necessary elements we
have him we have the arcs we have the
the spear and to try to make and
combined I added kind of a like a hand
here like as if he's holding this sphere
and then obviously you know using
different colors and highlight colors
although keeping them minimal as well
and basically taking this whole thing
and really making it feel like a sports
logo and so also it works well in
grayscale as well and even black and
white so that's just a quick tip just to
kind of you know if you have a logo you
have a lot of requirements you know the
best bet is to really try to condense
them into a single shape like this and
that's it so yeah today was a difficult
day it's already 945pm
and I my goal is to record a video every
day of the year of 2014 as today I March
29th I don't know how many days is but
that's close to 100 consecutive videos i
think it's around 90 at the point at
this point but anyhow so yeah today had
to be a quick video but yeah i'll be
back tomorrow and check out design
course calm if you haven't yet oh and
also just to show off something real
quick that I released on the forums let
me get this thing in here and get my
browser window up one second so those of
you who follow this channel know that
I've recently just launched forums and
now I've added a live chat down here at
the bottom of the main forms page where
of course you know you can go ahead and
type whatever you want and I'm gonna be
here a lot so yeah alright I give you
some exact course calm and I will see
you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
