course calm design challenge and I chose
black and white logo design as the topic
I just because I've as I mentioned a
notice a recurring theme around a lot of
the design challenges and that's the
over usage of drop shadows gradients and
your gloves out of glows so I really
wanted to see what would happen if I
restricted all of these I excessive
effects really and just restricted it to
only one color or while blacks not a
color of course as somebody had to point
out but you know what I mean I so I
think the results were overall pretty
good and I think hopefully it helped a
lot of you learn something about logo
design and that it's not about all these
extra effects you know the core logo
needs to work in black and white so
before I get to the reviews real quick I
want to of course spam my service I
which is basically designed course
premium and I we've been at it for
roughly two months now and those who
have joined have and those who've used
design course mentor spill specifically
which is the one on one design training
module with myself I have found a lot of
use and help from it so do you think
about you know the review that I'm about
to do for your design your logo design
specifically i multiply that by like a
hundred and that's what design course
calm premium is because I work
specifically with you throughout
multiple projects to really try to make
you a better designer and of course it's
a monthly thing I if you join with the
promo code down here it's 3995 a month
and you can cancel at any time so if you
only want to do one month that's 40
bucks you know it's like the price of
going out to dinner with your girlfriend
but once you know except this has a much
better pay off you know you're improving
your skills big time alright just 30
days as well alright so with that said
let's go ahead and move on alright so
the first post
and I got is from mxv design and I was
actually very impressed with this design
because I it's really good in the idea
that it's whimsical its stylistic it's
not just a very you know it's not a
photorealistic presentation a
representation of a nut its stylized I
like that a lot I I also like how the
it's actually made into a you as well
and that's seen right here and so
honestly I do not have too much there
anything bad to say about this I mean
it's really good i like it I mean if I
really got nitpicky which is unnecessary
kind of you can kind of move it up a
little bit here because it's a little
bit closer done here but that's not a
big deal this is a really good design in
my opinion so there's not too much that
i could say against it alright so st. WP
now this one has an issue and the idea
that I this text ad over here and to the
right it's warped too much so when you
have this I logo that's especially on
like a smaller size that's being scaled
down you see that it becomes hard to
distinguish what exactly it says it
almost looks like an M at this point so
there's too much distortion of the text
occurring for it to be effective so
that's the big thing that I would remedy
about this is trying to make it probably
you know you can all you can distort the
entrace form and warp the text but only
a little bit because otherwise it
becomes too difficult to read and you
want your business name or your clients
business name to be immediately
recognizable and identifiable and easy
to read alright so that's what I would
say about that as for the nut it's kind
of hard to tell that it is a nut just by
looking at the shape and the form here I
but yeah the major concern is to text
and that's what I would work on
specifically all right so bamboo
graphics all right so I'm going to copy
this just because this is real big it's
hard to see in the browser and I'm going
to just paste it right here so we can
get idea of what's happening all right
so I like the ad the creative idea of
thinking out
the box and you know combining two
different concepts the idea of an
exclamation which takes care of the
excitement factor and the nut being you
know the end point of the exclamation I
and then down here over for the text
i'll get back to this but over for the
text over here the sea it's a little bit
hard to recognize what that is almost
looks like a pacman you know like that
game so i probably stay away from that
for doing anything this elaborate you
know when you have a logo that works as
a combination mark which is a
combination mark you know is a word
market that it has a separate symbol you
don't want to try to do too much with
the the word mark portion I in terms of
manipulating the text or working with it
you can do small things but you know
really going after it like this it's it
takes away from the main symbol so I
would just leave this probably a regular
C and then up here it feels like it's
almost two separate I for it to be real
effective I and it's also real large in
relation to the text i say separate in
the idea that we have this large portion
of the ! up here and then this down here
and it almost feels like it's not a logo
feels like a multiple parts it's not a
single identifiable unique mark and the
way you can remedy that is if i switch
back here I let me see if I I could
quickly just scroll to one of these to
show you an example is by encasing it in
like a some sort of little fierce an
elliptical fear now an elliptical sphere
of sorts so that it really brings
everything together so if you have an
object or a symbol that has multiple
parts that are that are separating you
can bring everything together in either
you know a square of some sort or in
ellipse of some sort and that brings
everything together and so let me see
okay yeah so I what I'm talking about i
can probably illustrate it real quick
and I want to spend too much time but um
see if I could do this
bring everything together like this and
you see if I can play around with a
layer of a pirate probably not I what I
can do is just I've actually one second
I'm not being smart about this let me
drag this up and use the magic wand tool
put it like 32 and image adjustments
invert it's not going to look great
probably yeah that works pretty well so
the idea what I was talking about is
kind of like doing this this sort of
thing I it's not perfect though
obviously because I it just it seems a
little bit oops and get this white there
we go it's not a hundred percent perfect
but I because I would probably work with
stylizing this this a little bit more
but we could see that it does bring
everything together by being encased in
an ellipse like this all right so it's
move on to the next one all right coming
down here this is from Dillon Nelson all
right so I this is this too simple it's
too I don't want to say too simple but I
mean it there's not enough happening
here that's unique for it to be you know
a real effective logo I we just have a a
sort of like an oval here two lines on
the top bottom and there's nothing
unique and there's also prairie nothing
that's relevant about the company for it
to be effective so I would I just just
keep on watching if you are Dylan I and
and I really point out some of the
effective logos so you can kind of see
more of what to do all right so Claudia
Greek I don't know why I try to
pronounce names claudie glad you are
Gabriel alright so this one is a pretty
good logo I'm going to go back here and
paste this in and di I like the font it
really just does feel nut nut
I butt over here I probably work with
the tracking or the space between the
letters so that it's pushed over more
just because the rest of the letters
don't have you know they don't combine
really they don't clash I so this
creates for a little bit of a I guess
you could say complexity issue over here
or clutter issue secondly I do like how
the night is is kind of inside the N but
i would probably push it away and create
more of a separation just because if we
scale this down we get to smaller sizes
I it becomes a little bit pixelated
because it gets thinner than a pixel at
this point and you know sometimes logos
are shown at sizes this small and
smaller so yeah I would just kind of
move it away a little bit other than
that I like it I the nuttin you know it
could maybe could use a little bit of
work with the shadows you know it's kind
of coming in here but it's continuing
down here but either way I like it
overall so good job let's I continue all
right so dl 2904 on so the immediate
thought that i have here have two main
concerns here and that is we go in here
I the shadows or the highlights here
rather that right here is too thin so
scale this down they're going to become
cluttered and lost and just not going to
look good so I would get rid of them
entirely or I I would thicken them up
and also I probably try to work with the
shape a tad bit more maybe the
highlights just to maybe make it look a
little bit more like nuts again the
separation between these two nuts are
here this inner line needs to be more
you need deadly maybe about three or
four times thicker than what it
currently is between these two because
remember it's get scaled now and you get
clutter and then the second thing is the
nut tastic i text there's too much
tracking between each too much space
between each letter so it feels
separated and and it's hard to read
especially if you also emphasize the
night and then
the a the lowercase a stic that's a
little bit too much clutter especially
with the type of font that you've chosen
as well so it's it's fine to choose
these type of fonts but it would be best
just to keep a capital N and then you t
you know the rest of the all lowercase
and then bring it together closer a lot
closer and be easier to read all right
so let's go over here all right so viel
oh I all right so I like this logo
design a lot for some reason I don't
know why I'm a because of the bell logo
from taco bell it felt like Taco Bell
logo but it's actually it's it's it's
not I when I went to look for it the
Taco Bell logo looks quite a bit
different but I don't know why I just
felt like it just felt like talk about
but either way I know that wasn't the
intention I could still tell it's a lot
different but I still do like it I using
the negative space here in this this
oval to create this very identifiable
nut right here and then I also like the
text as well I it seems like the the
tracking could have been worked with a
tad bit between some of these letters
like over here we have a certain amount
of space between ending you and then
over here we it feels like we have a lot
more space between these two letters I
but yeah that's just something you work
individually on each letter by the way
though this is a good design and like it
alright so minifigs Steve I let's see
here so i'm not going to focus on the
color one just because it's not
necessary for this I challenge but I for
this one alright so a couple things
happen here with the exclamation point
you could tell that it's not a part of
this font or if it is it's not
consistent with the boldness and the
thickness of these letters it's too tall
and it starts to low and it's too thin
seems squished so it just doesn't fit
well with this type so I'd get rid of
that and then additionally it feels like
it's too cluttered and too cramped in
here with inside being inside this nut
because there's not a lot of space here
well
here there's a ton of space up and down
and it's going right in between the
letters and it just feels right off the
bat the too much clutter is going on
alright so I would work on trying to fix
that I there's a number of different
ways but I'm not going to go into it
specifically just because we're already
at 14 minutes I've done you know not too
many reviews yet and we still have a
long way to go so jazz ID okay so let's
see here I may have four different
options and just to go through these I
this is a unique idea no one's done a
nutcracker so you know this is something
that could possibly work i would say
having the addition of the the nut on
the eye I see it's just at a bit
excessive or if you're going to have it
push a little bit tat up a little bit up
on top of it and scale it down just at a
bit so it's not thicker than the eye I
and then when it comes to the text
inside here it seems like it's almost
squished a little bit too much in
between here although it's not too bad i
may just because be because that type of
font is naturally a little bit squished
anyhow option two let's see again we
have like an issue with a white space
the N is touching this over here and
over here and over here remember it's
always good to have a lot of room to
breathe in between the various design
elements so I would scale down the size
of the N I you may have to do the same
thing with you get you know the UT ASDIC
I but that way it will improve quite a
bit I the this part not tastic I don't
know I guess it depends on the type of
nuts that they're selling if you really
want to have a silhouette of a squirrel
in here i also i was going to curious
maybe what how this would work on a
smaller size so just because there's a
lot of detail when it concerns the the
nut guy over here oops this is large one
second skill us down
and let me move up all right so can you
still tell that that's a scroll yeah I
guess you can but I one thing you tell
right away is the thickness here between
the top of the nut in the bottom is not
great enough so it makes it look like
way too thin so that's again that's an
area that I would increase the white
space on for because that's too thin of
a line um if I had to choose between all
four I don't know it's hard to say I do
like this fly but again we have a
tracking issue right here you want to
bring this closer I because everything
else is closed some fonts and they just
do that right off the bat so you have to
be wary you know you have to check that
afterwards I but yeah this isn't a bad
logo design I and I like this this one
as well this one yeah seems just a
little bit too crammed up in there for
my taste all right so sad Omar let's see
here okay so this I would completely get
rid of right away just because it looks
like he's being impelled by the I up you
the wrong area you know so I would get
rid of that because it could be on one
of those logo compilations where you
know something that was not intended to
be designed is actually shown in logo
anyhow with that said I i'm not sure if
having filling in the a with a negative
space sort of nut is the best idea just
because it seems like it breaks up the
the the the name kind of it's kind of
hard you can t see nut and then you see
like this symbol here then stic not
stick or something I it's just not a
good idea to put it right in the center
of kind of just an arbitrary letter so I
would make it kind of what you did here
yeah I'm basically you took a not you
put it over and made it a separate
symbol so this would definitely be the
better approach than this so I mean you
could just tell a thousand times better
this is than this and then the only
thing done here is maybe it a wrap it
lacks just a little bit of originality
or creativity but other way big
improvement
these two for sure um all right so
somebody join with the post of nuh
tastic all right um so yeah this one you
know what I didn't look at this one
before or any of these beneath this
point but this one it almost reminds me
of like an A Wrap guy or something
because he has like the the whole I
don't know about the technical
terminology like that hat thing and then
you have like this beard all right well
that probably wasn't the intention right
all right so the nut tastic thing I
overhear the end I'm looking at this
just not not immediately aware of what
this thing over here is but I could see
kind of like broke it down maybe that's
like a branch or something and it's it's
falling down it's an interesting idea I
I mean especially if you're gonna have
if this is intended to be the whole logo
where this is here and then this is here
it's too much you have to hi there have
it on the left or keep it in here I so
I'm not sure if that's your intention or
not but I just if you really wanted to
emphasize the UI probably get rid of
this thing over here just make it a
regular n move this up and then make
sure that you know I think maybe the the
u-shape here definitely is recognizable
enough so I think it would be a lot more
effective you get rid of this get rid of
this line up here Berg drag this up so
that it you know it sits on the regular
horizontal path where the text begins I
and I think it would actually be a lot
better then you know everything that's
presented to your currently so yeah mna
design let's see here PS I'm a new
designer ok so no this isn't a bad to
start it's a little bit complex though
in the idea that I the you have these
different whimsical lines that are
coming down here and then ones that
originally up here and then there's a
nut I try to simplify it a little bit
more so than this also the the portions
of the nut here at the top when it comes
to the the lines the individual lines
are a little bit
to they need work you could tell their
kind of just hand-drawn almost so I
would work on that trying to make it
more uniform and less hand-drawn I and
also it doesn't really seem to make too
much sense to me to really you know have
it hanging off this I portion because it
really doesn't make too much sense in my
opinion I but I mean if you were to take
away this and this you know this is
actually a good word mark I in terms of
a logo design because it's it's very
simple and it does flow well and it's a
a nice font I so yeah I would just work
on those couple things and then option
two I would definitely stick with
working with this then over this just
because I these connected lines and this
and it's just I this is drastically
inferior to what you did up here in my
opinion alright so Alexander alright so
there's too much happening here in terms
of this over here it almost looks like
this is like a photograph that was made
white and black or something and there's
too much fine details I don't even
really see a nut in here honestly so it
doesn't seem like this would be very
effective I so again you know the effect
of logos for coming down coming up here
you know they're whimsical you can tell
it's a nut not tastic we don't want
photo representations or photorealistic
nuts for low designs just because it's
not unique people won't remember it I so
that's something important to remember
so go back to the basics in terms of in
simplicity in terms of low design all
right so is d we have my first design
alright so yeah this looks like a nut
although I would say there's too much
clutter occurring design off white space
I I would scale down the size and then
not probably move it over a little bit
more from the the N and then that way it
doesn't feel like it's one big kind of I
wouldn't say mask is just not really a
mess but I would work on just die trying
to position things differently and
scaling them down but otherwise I kind
of do like the
the nut tastic font I that you've chosen
the script font all right dash designs
all right so I'm just reading this real
quick all right so all right yeah I I
actually do like this it's very simple
obviously you almost can't tell that
it's a nut but obviously with the name
you can tell it it is so I just looking
at this as is I can't really say too
much to you know that's that's negative
about this I I think especially if you
used color and you made this a brown and
gave it like sort of just a couple
highlights or something it would really
definitely stand out so I like it all
right soda kita Nikita we have I this
might be another all right oh ok so it
seems like this font choice you know
definitely creative it feels like it's
not a great fit for this this type of
business this almost feels like a game
type of font I or some type of
futuristic or tech font if you if you
will maybe not so much like an organic
you know nut company font just because
you think of organic you don't think of
these these type of lines and
intersections because it's not really
based in nature if you will I although I
definitely like what you've done you
know outside of thinking about relevance
the EU the top of this being a nut I i
would say probably need work on this
this i highlight right here just because
if your scale dad to get down again you
would find that it's i'd probably
doesn't scale down to well too much
clutter so work on separating things out
making a little bit thicker yeah thanks
for this mission all right Jacob w
design all right so this is I I like
this I it's easy to read I so when it
comes to nut tastic part you know the
explanation point for the eye that's a
unique idea work still read it and I
definitely like this symbol right here
um there's a lot it's very simple
obviously there's not a ton of detail
everything separated there's good white
space in between here and so it will
scale down while so this is a very good
design good job okay so there's some
type of spelling error I didn't see it
all right so Alexander alright so again
we're having an issue here when it comes
to these fine fine details because if
you take this again and paste this scale
it down it's going to end up blurred and
like like looking blurry and just too
much detail in my opinion I this sort of
half lips along with these dashes
probably a necessary as well especially
given how much details here already and
then there's too much complexity and
collision and clutter occurring right
here specifically you can see if you
scale us down you're going to lose that
detail and it's going to look blurred
and not good overall so if I already
have to use this I would begin it right
here I would have nothing intersecting
or getting close to the type same thing
over here you can see it went beneath
here and over here I start it right here
instead of there so you want to be
mindful of not cluttering things and
again this is there's too much there's
not enough space between this area and
the not tastic portion you want to you
want to make sure things have room to
breathe for sure right so let's go over
here all right so rtet are all right so
it's a cartoon squirrel with a nut
shaped mouth all right so I like the
type you know everything very easy to
read it's a nice thick font I like it I
you can almost you can't really tell
though that there's a nut inside of here
I so it kind of just looks like an
interesting squirrel character I you
could probably work with it though to
make it look like there's more of a
night by having like a stem come out
here or something and maybe kind of get
rid of the the tooth here either way on
originality and creativity this is
definitely a plus but in terms of making
it obvious i would say probably work
with it
little bit more all right then jde woj
you know all right let's see here all
right so let me copy this all right so
let's just scale this down for the fun
of it I know there's not going to be any
issues in terms of not being able to
read it it seems like this nut portion
is just too big in relation to the text
I it's extends quite a bit up here to
the left to the top and then quite a bit
over here to the left and then down it
just seems I and also it does seem like
it's just kind of unnecessarily cut off
right here and it doesn't feel I I guess
you could say it it doesn't feel natural
in the sense that i'm having a hard time
explaining what's wrong with this I but
it's just too big and bulky I guess you
could say there if you really want to
try to get the nut here and you want to
have white space for the letters I
probably just stick to the N instead of
the whole nut because otherwise you're
stuck with you know trying to convey a
whole not but it has to be this thick in
order to fit within you know fits the
whole nu T inside of it I maybe there is
a way to do it but I really can't think
of a way to fit all three letters while
not still having like a massive symbol
here it just feels like it's a little
bit too much too big and bulky other
than that I like the font so let's go
back here all right so Josh Turner I
used some type of a distortion on a
stroke here of the letters and again
we're going to run into an issue where
we scale us down and then it just starts
looking a little bit blurry I like the
idea of it you know having let me go
back to on our percent here the idea of
kind of emphasizing you know enthusiasm
through these different types of strokes
but I think there's too much detail on
this specific effect for to be desirable
so I like that idea
and you know that this actually is
identifiable as a nut and it does work
as a letter as well even though it's
filled in here so I think if you were
just to take the font right here I'll
all the white and the nut and move it
out of this black area and then make it
black it would probably be more
effective in my opinion and obviously
you'd have to make it black too but it
would definitely be more effective
because the font the nature of the font
itself kind of does the same thing as
what you're doing here because the font
you can tell it's a script font and it's
kind of like a I don't know a nut tastic
font i guess you could say so yeah not
bad I've just kind of work on that area
oh you basically did what I just said
right here I yeah this this is
definitely better than this I my opinion
too much going on here so that's good
yep all right so Lou was cool I this is
almost the last 1i too much happening
here we have that same issue from a
couple I entries ago where this nut is
just too big in proportion to or in
relation to the text and also I can't
exactly tell that this is a nut it's
kind of hard to tell I so I would work
on that and then finally Peter
I'm sure people butchered that all the
time you know called you Peter
right now anyhow I Peter Falk ok Iyaz
about two days after deadline no problem
I'll still do a thing here this is a
little bit too much occurring here when
it comes to slicing the text in half it
becomes almost disorienting when you
look at it I have you ever seen this
optical illusions and stuff they post on
Facebook or whatever I it's just a
little bit too much going on I even
though it's a simple idea it creates for
so many different parts and elements and
colors and and all this stuff that it
becomes disorienting so I would get rid
of that idea and just stick with a solid
color I the nut is pretty easily
identifiable and it would be much more
easily identifiable if it weren't cut in
half like this i but i like to shape the
itself and probably be much more
effective if we got rid of that sliced
portion that's in there but anyhow yeah
thanks for the entries everybody again
I'd like to work with a lot of you
one-on-one so check out for sure design
course calm / premium consider joining
and we'll have a new design course like
a home design challenge announced in a
day or two and are at the three at most
I'm going to be going away on vacation
just for like two or three days over the
