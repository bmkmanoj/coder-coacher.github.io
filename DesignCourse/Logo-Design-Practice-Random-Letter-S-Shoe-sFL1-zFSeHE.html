is to use this random letter generator
calm to generate a random letter letter
and once I come up with that letter I
have to immediately think the first noun
that begins with that letter that comes
to my mind and the goal then is to step
into Adobe Illustrator and try to
illustrate that letter also in such a
way that represents an idea of that noun
in logo design this is called as a it's
referred to as a letter mark so let's go
ahead and see how good I can do s shoe
okay so that was the honest answer shoe
um let's try this all right so let me
extend this window a little bit all
right so I'm gonna go to file new and
we'll call this s shoe and the width and
height I'm just going to choose 860 by
600 that happens to fit well at 100%
within my current viewport resolution
and so I'm just going to hit control 1
to get to 100% all right so the first
step is to get the type tool I'm just
gonna get a capital S and a lowercase s
I'm just going to space it out a few
times and scale it up all right so here
we go what do you usually do is just I
up here in the font selection let's
click up here left-click once and then
use my down arrow on my keyboard to go
through some of the fonts that I have
and just to see if anything that relates
to the idea of a shoe will come to mind
based on these letter forms here so you
know the the initial idea that I've come
up with in my head just randomly is our
shoe strings so that will possibly work
based on what I have going here um so
let me just keep on
sifting through these and so the goal is
of course you know to emulate this our
convey the idea of a shoe but also
adhering to good logo design and good
graphic design fundamentals okay so I'm
going to keep going through these I'm
going to keep going I'm going to pause
it until I get to a font that I think I
like so one second all right so I'm
going to use this font called Kartika
and let me just get rid of the other one
and stick with the capital version and I
want to make some adjustments just right
off the bat so the idea I'm going to try
to work with here just by using the both
I by creating at the ends of the letter
here right here and here are going to be
that sort of plastic hard plastic piece
that's smaller than the actual shoelace
or shoestring I and then also work with
an idea of intertwining the shoelaces
right here in the middle so we'll see if
this can work well I did not do this
beforehand so let's see if I can get it
done all right otherwise I'm going to
delete this damn video because it would
be embarrassing and I'm just talking to
myself now and I will have wasted all
this time okay so actually I want to
make sure if straight lines here just
hold shift left clicking and right there
alt left click shift right there okay I
also want to I may adjust the size of
that but just real quickly I also may
want to round out these edges right here
kind of like this and there oops
all right okay so let's uh move this up
a little bit yeah maybe right around
there is fine now again I may adjust
this but for now I'm just going to leave
it as is so ctrl c ctrl F hold shift and
rotate this by left clicking holding and
we'll place this one right here okay so
not too evident I've for the time being
so I'm going to work with this center
portion right here so real quickly I'm
just going to save a copy sure we'll see
ctrl F and I'm going to zoom up on this
one and I'm going to take this type
layer here and hit ctrl shift and the
letter O to convert to outlines all
right so my idea let's see if I can get
this to work so I'm going to get I white
sorry my wife barged in I suddenly you
get a white for the foreground color
here and I just want to come along this
edge here and just kind of create a
white sort of negative space in between
these two and you'll see where this is
leading once I once I'm able to get this
designed in a sense let's just go in the
middle
and left click right here yeah something
like that roughly come out over here
and real quickly I'll use my direct
selection tool select this one to move
it up just a bit click back over here
ooh I had two points here yeah right
there alright and hmm
trying to think of how I want to do this
actually move that back down what is
that I delete this one too alright so
I'm going to click back on this left
click on alt and let's see here
and left-click an alt and drag that
portion right there all right so it's a
little bit off it's a little bit uneven
but I really just want to see what this
looks like just for now okay so still
some work to do to get this to look
right so I'm going to take ya this I'm
going to use the add Anchor Point tool
and add a point here and drag it out
roughly right around there and then do
the same thing for this down here just
add one right around here and then use a
direct selection tool drag it out around
here and pull this in alright
and I'll kind of want to make it I you
know you know what our shoe strings like
obviously you know how it kind of I it's
very thin on one side thick on any other
so let's I'm going to add another one
here and I'm gonna start right around
here and maybe come in just so I hold
shift and then come back down right
around here alright and that right
around there you know I could possibly
go a little bit higher all right
this needs to be a little bit smoother
on this edge or this one's brought out
just a tad bit and his needs worked with
a little bit
all right now that's good and I want to
do the same thing here with the bottom
so I'm just going to duplicate the
actual C ctrl F reflect and horizontal
all right so we're dealing with a
different it's not exactly the same here
at the bottom so will that work at all
no I'll just die let's go ahead and do
another one real quick
and we want to get around the same space
the same thickness from the top all
right all right let's see here now I'm
thinking I want to work with the center
area because if it's thin here and here
then it's going to be thin in here as
well so I want to shrink the size when
it comes in so let's work with that real
quick if you start up around here and
come in like that Alt + left click to
adjust that direction a little bit now
we've got all these white layers and
we'll adjust that oops did I connect
that with a one on one oh no no I did
all right that's good all right and then
I want to do the same thing for this
side right there so I will come in right
around here actually just kind of start
right down here and
now we want this to end kind of like a
smooth or to come to a point like right
there all right
all right so it needs a little bit of
work with the edges like right here and
right here but I think I like that as is
just it's a black and white version
although I want to work with these just
a tad bit so I'm going to make them
skinnier drop down in size just a little
bit and then duplicate that bring the
sucker up alright so when you're in a
situation we have all these white layers
that is essentially significantly
altering another layer beneath it i we
can do is select all the white layers so
because there's so many white layers and
so few black layers we just liked
everything shift to deselect those few
black layers and then we can hit I bring
out the Pathfinder if I go window
Pathfinder and unite them or merge them
right here and then with them selected
hold shift and select the black layers
and I think it's just this layer that
these only intersect so then you click
on - front there so now it's transparent
in those areas that it needs to be
alright so let's go ahead and increase
this see how that works our large size
copy that see how it works on the small
size as well not too bad
maybe I may want to work with possibly
creating more separation right here you
can still see it on this the smaller
scale down version but it's still a
little bit too a little bit too close
for my liking but nonetheless I think
that's pretty decent as is so let me go
ahead and delete this one
and we can I take everything and if we
right-click it in ungroup I can select
just the bottom one and I can move it up
a little bit actually to create more
separation to fix that issue so that
smaller size it does work a little bit
better alright and just for the fun of
it let's go ahead and create a colored
version of this so let's see here
shoe strings are usually white I'm I'm
going to make it like a experiment with
maybe a gray color in a black background
so let me go ahead and I'm going to take
this and group those again and then hide
it and then I'm going to get a black
background layer here right around there
drag that to the bottom and lock it and
then take everything here and make it
white alright so now what I want to do
is we'll go ahead and just select the
these three layers right here and let's
go ahead and get the with the Pathfinder
up real quick just so I can i unite
these shapes into one shape same thing
with this these three layers alright so
now we're just working with two layers
essentially and go ahead and add a
gradient on this so linear and let me
think about how I want this to work
hmm we reverse that real quick
yeah I'm going to do something different
real quick I'm going to do is just take
I the pen tool come up right around here
and object path divide objects below so
now that cuts in half this layer so that
now I'll make sure this is just white
and now it only applies that gradient to
this portion because it was also
applying it to this over here and I
don't want that so now I can just take G
for the gradient tool and experiment
with that and then I could do the same
thing with this one down here as well so
let's I cut this off right around there
with the pen tool ctrl shift d dude
divide objects below and then just
select one second let me save this real
quick sometimes the issue that happens
when I start working with divide objects
below and the like randomly select
something out here that does not exist
I can't even delete it so one second
alright so now I need the way I did the
fixed size just to save it close it then
reopen it alright so now I we have just
this portion can I drop just that over
there hit G oh wait wait wait wait wait
wrong one I want this one
there we go alright G you obviously
don't want it to affect this down here
and it looks kind of interesting let's
see what this looks like I scaled down
let's do another one
um when it comes to shading and adding
shadows and stuff you have the option of
gradients or you have the option of uh
you make it a little bit more simplistic
although sometimes the results look a
little bit better so I'm going to make
everything white here for this one and
zoom up here
all right so let's think about how I
want this to work
let's start right around here someone's
calling me all right and then come up
write it down here actually and let me
bring that in right there I'm going to
be quiet
all right so anyhow go ahead and hit
object path divide objects below
like that
yeah unlike that starting point
sorry I'm messing this all up although
this is usually the case when you're
trying to do a tutorial on something you
haven't yet color covered so you know
this is the raw unedited version all
right so come around there divide
objects below
you're not going to like this better
than this and then you can finish it up
by bringing these over to the outside of
this and we'll start right around here
and then do the same thing on the
outside of this line
pretty cool stands out pretty well of
course you can always experiment with
this shade right here I pretty easily
just by doing this control H get rid of
those points and then experiment with I
think this right around here works
pretty well
and so that is it pretty cool I think it
emulates the idea of shoe or some idea
of a shoe obviously being the shoe
strings and it seems to work pretty well
at most sizes cool stuff alright hope
