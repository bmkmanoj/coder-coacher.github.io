today we're going to pick the winner of
the gorilla mascot design all right we
had some pretty good entries this time
we didn't have quite as many simply
because this was a more difficult
challenge so I admitted that even at the
beginning I knew it was going to be
tough but I you know he's still about 29
if you entered I got about 32 total
entries so it's still pretty good all
things considered so what I want to do
first is switch over here to the monitor
and before I begin a splendid preface
stick around to the end of the video
because i'm going to show you something
pretty interesting that i've been
working on in terms of a course coming
up here possibly within the next two
weeks alright so right now I have
everything sorted by highest rating
first and again just to preface this
these ones there there's only a few
percentage points that separate like the
top six or seven or so so the person
that's number one doesn't necessarily
mean that they're going to win okay so
right here this one I really liked you
know stylistically it's very unique I
think that's probably its strongest
point is the fact that this is a unique
more abstract representation of a
gorilla it also has you know a good kind
of feeling that's coming from it so it
lists it's the right type of emotion for
a sports mascot logo design I there's a
few small areas like this little area
right here to the right side of this
bottom portion of the mouth I that's you
know when you get that you can you scale
that down that's going to get lost I
would just completely get rid of that I
just some small like I would say the
same thing right here the for the
nostrils I completely get rid of these
highlights right here as well just a
couple other areas that don't quite
match you know this one styled a little
bit close together this I sort of
lighter grey portion and this one is
done in a better manner things are
separated just small things like that
overall very good entry over here I
really like this one stylistically as
well it's very unique it has its own
personality
it seems like kind of more like a
throwback to more like a retro style at
least that's that's the hint that i get
from it like a retro style you know sort
of gorilla mascot design I but
definitely like this this too did have
some of the small details that you
probably could get you know just
completely remove I because again
they're going to get hidden and kind of
pixelated a smaller sizes like down here
over here as well over here I like this
one it's just a really nice solid entry
a little bit bland in terms of contrast
but I I still really like it um you know
again this is that sixty-two percent
these ones are at 64 and 66 but you know
really they're very even in terms of
execution it actually turns execution
this one's a little bit better because
it doesn't have those tiny little
artifacts that aren't necessary so this
one is good as well looking at this one
I really like this one in terms of you
know having the right attitude perfect I
there's just large areas of kind of
white space over here on the top of the
head over here to the side I think just
in relation to all the detail that's
happening here with the face it's kind
of just thrown off a little bit with
these large broad shoulders so you know
it's just filled just to unnecessarily
large I would probably just price stuck
with kind of theta head and not and not
leave the the trapezoids and shoulders
as a part of it the very good entry
nonetheless I over here not bad entry as
well coming down here this entry kind of
feels like this one up here in terms of
color at least and contrast but I still
good I and then coming down here this is
more like a stylized version this one
actually had a lot of potential but the
contrast is killing it you know there's
just a lot of darks here but you can see
there's really good shading work in here
I but the problem is you can't see it
you know so I really liked to see maybe
a lighter color here so that these
outside edges can really stick out more
I but other way though that's all
do in terms of reviews so the 1 i'm
going to choose as the winter is where's
it at okay now that was unnecessary i
right here I'm not sure how to pronounce
your name ania or aneya or something
like that Ania but yeah i'm going to
choose you as the winner so you'll go
ahead and receive free access to our
Android app design development course
and free access to the upcoming design
challenge course okay so here's the part
where I want to talk about the upcoming
course that upcoming plan and it's not
the design challenge course that I
alluded to before actually it's going to
be a course that's all about how to make
money being a digital asset designer
specifically for creating mock-ups so as
you see here I have myself where's the
original oh there was an original
picture where it's just mean the the
photograph I took and then I edited
everything out and we do a launch a
bunch of cool jazz in terms of
displacement maps and actually I I won't
show you um I was going to show you real
quick the actual PSD file but we use
smart object layers a bunch of
adjustments we're actually let me show
you their original real quickly if I can
find it footage let's see here yeah it
me really it was like a picture like
this right here it just look looks like
crap but we're really able to do a lot
of work with it turning into something
it looks a lot more professional here so
showing with different backgrounds and
what's really cool is the any type of
asset you put on here like a logo or
t-shirt design automatically morph with
a displacement map based on the shirt
here and same thing down here I took the
all these images are photographs I took
myself and I I'm going to teach you how
to exactly how to make these and sell
these and make money with them on the
various digital asset websites I also
not just t-shirts corporate identities
so this is one I created from scratch
and this is the original photograph and
then this is it afterwards we completely
create a custom
adjustable customizable background right
here and there's a lot of work that
really goes into it aside from just
cutting things out of course everything
uses smart object layers and over here
we have a real simple monitor one so
this is the original picture right here
with me my foot right there it looks
like garbage of course and then we
convert it to something more like this
with a smart object layer what's also
cool we use Smart Filters to create
blurs as well as duplicating the smart
object layer to create this sort of
automatic flare not flare about
reflection and of course customizable
backgrounds very easy and then also
tattoos like so how to create your own
tattoo mock up so people you know
designers tattoo artists mobile app
designers if you're out you're doing
mobile mock-ups or identity designers
our t-shirt designers all download these
things like crazy and many of them pay
money for them as well so i'm going to
show you how to make money and also
generate email so if you make these free
for instance you can generate hundreds
of thousands of emails from which you
can then monetize so the whole point of
this course coming up these are again
the projects that we're going to be
covering is to a show you exactly from
scratch how to create these mock-up
templates for t-shirts identities
monitors and tattoos and be how to sell
them as well yeah because it's nice you
know it's one thing to be able to create
I be able to create these mock-ups but
if you don't really know what to do
after you've made them in terms of
marketing then it's not really worth
having so anyhow that is it that would
be out and probably about two weeks i'm
hoping less than two weeks so look out
for that alright so i look out for a new
design challenge maybe the next three to
four days you get your free to submit
ideas i think we're going to do a more a
user interface based challenge this time
around and yeah all right i'll talk to
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
