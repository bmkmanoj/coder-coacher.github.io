today we're going to pick the winning
entry for the second course etro design
challenge alright so this was a good
test of you I skills this time around
and we had several pretty good entries
and a lot that I think a lot of you
still need a lot of work on so we're
going to be working on UI design stuff
definitely going forward although I
don't know what the next challenge will
be per se but let's go ahead and switch
over to our screen here for the second
challenge and I'm just going to scroll
down here i have this by default at
highest ratings and so I've spent
yesterday going through in rating each
one of these all of you should have
received an email and I yeah so you know
looking at this we didn't have entries
that were rated you know as quite as
high as our logo design challenge we go
we had a several Deborah in the 80s and
70s percent um although I probably could
have rated some of these higher either
way still good job for some of you and
let's go ahead and look through these
and I'm just going to go through
probably the top five just to give you
my thoughts okay so this individual left
three different designs here for me to
choose from I was probably singling out
the one that I thought was most
effective and that's what I judged it on
I for the first one I think there's just
let me go ahead and zoom up here just a
bit there's not enough contrast between
the background the background actually
you know even though it has some type of
I perhaps a layer blend mode set to it
or andorra pacity it's just still
sticking out a little bit too much
especially with this in mind that the
type here and also the login button it
seems like it's just great out or it's
something that's inactive that you can't
click I being you know with that less
contrast this one over here definitely
cleaner on you know again this could
have been better if we just took down
the opacity quite a bit um the I mean I
love the layout
the icon is good I the white space
everything is very well structured i
also used you know the appropriate
facebook connect button a lot of people
didn't do that and kind of made their
own and they didn't use the blue very
important to use that blue um but again
the one thing that kind of threw me off
was the the login button you know
generally call to action should be
something that sticks out well you know
this blue bond here it sticks out well
but the log in right here just almost
seems like an afterthought were it
possibly an active same thing over here
I having said that it still did get the
highest rating but again when it comes
to the top five to ten you know I'm not
necessarily comparing them against each
other you know I one category I could be
off in relation to the other so really
they're all very very similar so that
that's why the top rating won't
necessarily win all right so come down
here I right here okay so Robert
submitted this one I very simple as you
can see a white background which there's
no problem with that you can see I just
kind of a watermark background with a
couples looking at each other or
something I again here the the icons
very good the form inputs are good you
can see the email and password and i'll
stick out too much appropriate type size
forgot password sign in very good clear
call to action right here also uses
probably the most obvious color which is
based on this color right here for the
anarchy doubt love I nice simple or here
it doesn't stick out too much I noticed
some people they gave a lot of
prevalence or prominence or importance
to the or label and really you don't
need that I it'll start competing with
other aspects of the layout in that's
what's referred to as a visual hierarchy
the or is very low on the hierarchy so
you know we don't emphasize it very much
and then sign in with Facebook using the
appropriate Facebook blue here so very
solid entry coming down here I this is
also the same individual right here
Robert just a different color scheme and
it works well noticed you know use this
time
a pink background instead of white I and
and I would say the the opacity from the
photograph that's watermark in the
background is perfect doesn't stick out
too much you know it's almost just
barely noticeable but if you look at it
you can see it that's what you want you
don't want it competing with elements in
your foreground like the form elements
all right and again you know the call to
action stands out very well here I great
contrast all right another one here this
is more of kind of io what's referred to
as a card-based UI design and I did this
very high as well I matches the top two
entries at sixty-six percent I the only
slight thing that I didn't like about it
was the side it seems like almost you
know if you had a phone maybe not one of
the larger ones that was on in your hand
there's so much white space and padding
here that there's not a ton of area to
type I would probably just expand these
elements out a little bit further just
to give a little bit more room that's
the only gripe that I really have with
this is as I very good very very good
alright David this one is her is very
good as well I definitely more on the
unique side I kind of with how this
section is can split in a diagonal
manner I'm definitely unique and it
works well though sometimes people can
overdo those sort of things when they're
trying to be unique especially if you're
new designer I but this works very well
I liked it the one thing I just didn't
really like was the black underline from
anarchy with this type here beneath it I
think if you probably just got rid of
those two elements the underline and the
the slogan and then just Center the
anarchy doubt lover here it would have
been just a little bit better but still
good entry anyway and that's always
going to go through before I pick the
winning entry let's sort by lowest
rating not to like pick on people but
just to look at some of the things that
people have done
that I you know you want to avoid I so
right here we have a lot of issues in
this one I I don't really want to single
out and just start going over each one
but if we go through all these will see
similar patterns and this is the same
individual submitted like four or five
designs so I'm going to go through these
quickly all right I one of the things
that's going to tie all these things
together there's several aspects that's
going to tie all these entries together
in terms of if you know what they've
done wrong I just going to go through
these just a little bit more is probably
the two categories simplicity and color
and contrast so if we look through these
I the color and contrast isn't very
great here we have kind of like this
light blue with this white type here we
have this do you have an accountant here
it's almost white on white definitely
avoid that and then complexity you know
we have all these lines we have a lot of
things happening here that you want to
avoid you know the outline distant
stroke on the login button not using the
Facebook blue definitely want to avoid
those types of things I this here
there's no essentially no layout is kind
things just kind of thrown on top of
each other definitely avoid that this
one was done actually this one is
actually pretty a lot better than his
other ones I but coming down I you know
the color and contrast is completely off
here it's not really relevant looking at
some of these other ones you know it's
kind of hard to see the email and
password form fields here I very blocky
kind of sort of unnecessary strokes on
certain areas so what I suggest if you
you had a lower rating sort this by the
highest rating and just see what they've
done right look at the categories and
their ratings on the side and try to get
a really strong feel for what they did
that was right so the winning entry that
i'm going to pick here I it probably
would have been this one the very top
writing but just the logging but instead
like this tiny thing tiny difference is
going to separate most of these I just
doesn't stick out enough um the winning
entry I'm go
one to choose is between this one and
this one which is by the same person so
i think i'm going to choose this one
ultimately as being the winning entry
here so Robert light heart or not and
you're not light heart it's something
else I'm going to go ahead and contact
you and you will get the prize which
appear is noted as being free access to
the android app design and development
course which is unfortunately our only
paid course at the moment I so yeah
having said that I there's a lot of
areas like again I mentioned before the
some of you or a lot of you can improve
on in terms of you I so we will
definitely try to make that a priority
going forward with the challenges now
also something that I want to mention
and it's going to be coming up quite
soon is a new paid course and it's going
to specifically be focusing focused
towards these design challenges and like
I said it's a paid course but is gonna
be dirt cheap you know I mean I don't
anticipate being more than fifteen
twenty bucks max and it's going to be a
really comprehensive course that's going
to like if you take it you're you
purchase it and you watch it you're
going to be well equipped to participate
in any of the design challenges whether
it be a UI based design challenge or an
identity / logo design challenge or a
general graphic design challenge and how
to use photoshop and stuff like that so
you'll get a strong understanding of
what these five categories mean and how
to apply them and they'll be it'll be
really project-based so you're going to
see me tackling these types of
challenges and projects so I think
that's going to help a lot of people so
look out for that I in a couple days
maybe today or not tomorrow but tomorrow
the next day I Amy release the next
design challenge if you have ideas for
what that should be I just give me a
shout out here online the YouTube
comments and throw out your idea alright
so I'll talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
