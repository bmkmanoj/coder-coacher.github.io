today is Jerry 25th or 25th video of the
year and we're going to continue on with
our iPhone breathalyzer by creating a
few renders in blender and then we're
going to take those into Photoshop and
design user interface that's going to be
animated in after effects so as always
visit design course calm see what's
going on there and also subscribe here
on YouTube and of course the project
files are available for free in the
description below this video alright
let's get started alright so this was
the last view from yesterday I want to
make some adjustments real quick so
we're going to separate the top of this
from this bottom so what we're do is go
to solid hit five to go back into or
thumb graphic mode and we'll hit one to
get a side view and we will select this
object hit tab to go into edit mode we
can see this kind of like a slight you
know like a bevel up here we don't
select those ones so we're going to hit
be ok well hit a first make sure nothing
selected hit be and just right up there
we'll select those and then we'll go
ahead and hit p to separate that so now
that if we go back here is its own
object right here ok now what we want to
do is select this portion we're going to
click this little plus sign to create a
new material we're going to change it
from mixed shader right down to their
it's going to render to see how this
looks now has more texture it looks
better in my opinion so we'll
right-click the top portion and we can
just make that a little bit darker come
around here now this one I remember it
was separated and kind of looks cool but
now we'll make sure it has the same
material so if we select this and then
over here click on this down I think
there's a last one that we created
now that is the correct color now I want
to make an adjustment here too you know
what we have going on for roughness you
can turn that up a bit okay and yeah
that looks good okay so now that we're
going to consider this basically ready
to go for renders so to get your
rendering ready I'm going to hit five
here we want to set up a camera so hit
zero on your number pad and go to view
properties lock camera to view that's
something I do every single time I'll
learn that from a different dude through
tutorials and now we can basically
position what we want in view or how we
want it to be viewed let me just go up
here I'm going to hit zero to get back
into user perspective mode i'm going to
right click on these two go two solid
pull them up and kind of out of the way
alright so zero to go back to our view
and hit rendered and i'm going to leave
it right there alright so now we're
going to redeye to the render panel and
i want to select i'm going to change a
couple things here for 1920 x 1080 we're
going to leave that there but change 52
all the way to honor basically what that
means is if you left at a 1920 x 1080 it
only do fifty percent of that resolution
so you want it to go hundred and let me
come down here for render i'm going to
choose 1200 and i think everything else
is good to go so i'm going to go ahead
and hit that wait i forgot about
something i want to click on this object
let's make sure it's selected okay go
back to rendered and i'm going to go
back to their our object modifier for
the subdivisions i want to turn this up
to four
well maybe not the view we don't need
that but for the render we want it to be
four ok so I'm going to click on render
and this will take a little oh no I
wanted to change the tile size so to do
that escaped twice down here under
performance I'm going to change this to
256 and this works well if you have a GP
if you're processing with the graphics
card so alright so now it's going to
change the style size to be a bigger so
I'm going to pause this until it's done
ok so now that it's rendered I'm going
to going to hit f3 now i'm going to save
this as phone perspective view jpg and
you can set the file types down here one
hundred percent save and once that saves
our jars being slow alright so now i
want to get out the next view hit escape
and we're going to do a side view so i'm
going to hit let's see three is a front
view one is the side and i'm just going
to slightly change the view here
actually we'll just do this
I'm going to right-click in it s5 one
second let me go into solid mode that's
five again I don't base achill II want
this to go all the way so let's go back
into rendered here I think that's pretty
good just for now I'm going to hit zero
though to get out wanna see about
something I'm going to select that and
playing around with these a little bit
I'm going to take another light real
quick I'm going to duplicate it and on X
and then come over here and then hit G
well now we could just take it over here
r z come move around I'd are again all
right so just kind of so it's facing
that I'm going to see if that affected
anything needed a little bit lighter
over here i'm going to right click on
this
yeah that's fine right there I think all
right so I another thing i'm going to do
is right click on yeah we're and three
this will render smoother because we
change out the for all right so let's go
back to our camera view and i'm going to
render this view right here so let's go
back to render and hit render i'll pause
this and I will unpause prematurely
because I want to push everything down
or rather bring the plane up so go ahead
scape I'm go to solid view select on our
plane and temporarily just right there
all right let's go back to rendered here
all right now I'm going to hit render
see you at that edge okay that looks
much better alright so I'll pause it
here and you guys are going to kill me
again cuz I'm playing I made a mistake
over there I'm gonna hit escape to
select this I forgot this is not a part
of that so we have to go back here sorry
about that change at the four I am an
idiot okay render again maybe the third
time you know we'll get lucky here pause
okay so I'm going to save that f3 phone
why do you keep on call on the phone
it's on phone oh well phone side view
and make sure jpg is down here save and
then we're going to get a top view on
the escape we're going to hit seven
let's see here yeah keep doing that to
myself I have to go back and review and
do this there you go now because our
resolution is big I kind of wanted to
make sure that yeah
this is there's a lot of space around
here and you'll kind of realize once we
get to after effects we want a lot of
room so we can kind of scale in slightly
all right so let me hit rendered view
okay I'm going to go with that i'll hit
render pause all right I there's a an
issue here you can see everything has
this I think it's called Nancy otro pic
or whatever I'm kind of like a radial
gradient thing it has it on this and
this and that doesn't look quite correct
and I know are typically on oops a
actual like this metal part I know it
doesn't really have that on a an actual
you know if you were to hold on your
hand I but for this one right here I
kind of want to change that just for
this view we're not going to have any
other views so I'm going to hit escape
out of there and I'm just going to zoom
up here and i'm going to right click it
to make sure it's selected and a way to
fix that is let's go back to rendered is
to go to a mixer add diffuse and then
add that right there and let's take
these down a notch terms of color
and then you can kind of push it towards
point 28 and take that down a little bit
now it looks better I think they look
better for our final render all right
right there render and pause ok hit f3
and save this phone I'm not a phone will
do top view and take this to jpg save ok
so now I've switched to photoshop and
I've opened up those three images so
basically I want to get an idea of you
know what this interface will look like
for our animation so I'd zoom up just to
right around here and also you can
notice like kind of looks like I don't
know like there's a its kind of beveled
right here so if you wanted to go back
into Photoshop you could adjust that by
flattening it that down or removing the
inner edges and then filling it back
then but I'm not going to really do that
and that work too worried at this point
so what I'm going to do is just get a
rough idea of what we want the interface
to kind of look like and then we'll take
that and kind of recreate it and after
effects so I right off the bat I'm gonna
hit can let me zoom out real quick
oops I'm going to take everything ctrl a
ctrl C and then just well wait one
second file new layer and I'm just going
to paste it in here and let me zoom out
one more time hit ctrl T there I didn't
have a perfect angle on that one issue
that just realized you know this because
we change this it's not going to look
like or is that yeah it's actually
pretty close it's not a big deal alright
so the interface that what basically i
wanted to do is have we're gonna have
like a little like a power icon or a
status icon right here so i'm going to
hold shift and drag out right around
there and ctrl h twice get rid of that
view and then just come over here to the
direct selection tool take the fill make
it a gradient make it radial actually
you know what a bunch quicker way of
doing this let me delete that I'm going
to take the paintbrush you know right
around there we'll make this a green
color okay all right just like that
that's fine and then I want to have like
a circular like percentage radio bar
type thing so what we'll do is go ahead
and take the ellipse tool hold shift and
it will be roughly this size will get
rid of the fill their changes this
now right around there roughly all right
and click out of there and then we can
create a new layer ctrl shift n use a
clipping mask take the pen tool make
sure shape is selected make this black
hold shift and create two points right
here in the middle come down and connect
it ctrl H and then in the middle point
74 ctrl T and i'm using source sans pro
it's available for free use Google to
find that we're going to just do this
all right and I want to make this a
little bit closer those so we go to our
or we can go over here just go to may be
0 or maybe negative 25 that's better and
we will duplicate this a text control
 Andy scale this down ctrl t hold
shift alright so i can move till it
apply BAC as in blood alcohol content oh
i didn't get rid of that period ctrl T
will make this a little bit smaller
apply and maybe we'll change it from
extra light to light change this to
a bluish color it around there and then
I think we'll go ahead down here yeah
we'll go ahead and type good to drive
scale it down take this color
actually I don't like that blue color
doesn't doesn't fit so just make it
white so the idea is to have this
animate once we have in after effects to
this point and then do a red variation
as well alright so now that we have our
image is saved we have an idea of what
we want the interface to look like I
tomorrow we can go into After Effects
and then recreate this and make it look
really cool and animate it and then
after that of course will deal with the
web design all right so I'm Gary
assignment now I'll see you tomorrow

say this please check out design course
com if you like this tutorial subscribe
