powerful animations and activate them
based on a variety of different factors
you can place animations on any HTML
elements and make them occur based on
angular lifecycles user events and more
now one of the changes from angular 2 to
4 what the fact that they move the
animation functions from the angular
core library into their own animations
library this means that if you wish to
integrate animations within your own
angular 4 app you will need to use NPM
to install the animations package as
well as input the library within the app
module ts file so let's get started with
that and then we'll figure out how
angular 4 animations work so being that
this tutorial is a part of the free
angular 4 course we already have a
project set up and ready to go if you
are following along so but if you've
landed on this tutorial without having
follow along with the previous videos
make sure you use the angular
command-line interface to generate a new
angular project this way we'll all be on
the same page so once you've done that
or you already have one make sure you're
in the project folder in the console of
your angular app and let's go ahead and
type NPM install at angular animations
at latest and save it to our package dot
JSON file
so again this is one of the steps that
differs from using and integrating
animations I've based on angular 2 verse
4 so 4 you have to do to do this but
what if you're using Angela - you didn't
it necessarily so now let's go over to
our code editor and we're going to hop
into our app module ts file here now if
you generate a new project us now it may
look slightly different you're not going
to see these things but still it's the
same exact process when you're
integrating animations so we need to
import this line right here so basically
you're importing the browser animations
module from angular platform browser
animations now that's just the first
you import it now we actually have to
import it into the imports array of our
ng module decorator so we add a simple
comma copy this name right here and
paste alright so that is all we have to
do there so let's go ahead and get the
component ready for our animation so
let's just say for example that the
component that we want to animate is our
default app component es that is
generated when we use the angular
command line interface to create a new
project so the first thing that's
required is to import some of the
animation functions to the top of the
intended component so to do that I'm
simply going to paste in by the way I'm
following the written tutorial this line
right here so what's happening here is
we have an import and we're importing a
trigger State style transition animate
and keyframes functions from angular
animations which we installed alright so
I'll go over each one of these in more
detail very shortly now all these
functions here that I just listed off
there are all pretty much required with
exception to keyframes and if your
component template won't include
multi-step animations then you can omit
keyframes right here so next we have to
add the animations property to the
component decorator so for now I'm just
going to get this out just to give
yourself some space we'll get rid of
that - so after Stiles
we'll add animations right here alright
so now the first step is to use
animation triggers so we have to use the
trigger function which we imported up
here at the top so to do that trigger
and the first argument accepts the name
of the trigger and the second argument
will accept all the other innovation
functions that we imported all right so
what we'll name this is just my awesome
animation and then we open this up in
brackets
so also we can put a comma here and
that's there so that you can define
multiple animations or multiple triggers
and that's where these all go alright so
next up our animation States so the
state function allows you to define
different states that you can call in
transition between so the first argument
accepts a unique name just like this
trigger does and the second argument
accepts the style function so the style
function allows you to apply an object
with the web animation property names
and associated values so expanding on
our previous example let's continue on
here in the middle I'm going to crease
the size just so we can see things a
little bit better here and we define
state and we'll make this one small you
want to make the names relevant based on
what's happening between these states of
your animation so we'll just say this is
small and then the second argument will
add style as an object and inside of
here we'll just use transform and we'll
scale it and we'll set it at 1 so this
is the default size based on what's
happening into CSS all right now let's
add a second state now just to keep
things simple I will copy this and paste
it we'll make this one large and the
only thing we're going to change is
scale from 1 to 1.2 all right so we have
two different states here where the
scale property is going from 1 to 1.2 so
and next up is the transition function
and the transition function is what
makes the actual animations occur so the
first argument accepts the direction
between the two different states for
instance are we going from small to
large large to small or basically
either-or and then the second argument
accepts the animate function so the
animate function allows you to define
the length delay and easing of the
transition it also allows you to
designate the style function where you
can define styles while the transitions
are taking place or
or the keyframes function it accepts for
multi-step animations both of which are
placed in the second argument of the
animate function so for now we're going
to omit the second argument of the
animate function when we write it so
going back we're going to make our
transition and for now we're just going
to make it go from small to large and
then in the second argument animate and
we'll make this last maybe just three
hundred milliseconds and we could also
put a delay if we want in this next
section or we could just add easing so
I'm going to make ease in and that
changes how the animation takes place so
this transition is defining the length
of the transition as well as the easing
type and when an HTML element that uses
the my awesome animation trigger goes
from the small state to the large state
so let's leave it like this for now but
we will revisit this code snippets
shortly so now let's attach the
animation in the template so let's go
ahead up here and our template is going
to be very simple we're just going to
have a single paragraph element so let's
attach the animation to that element and
add a click event bound to a method so
up here we'll add in AP and this is how
we attach the animations to different
HTML elements so we had to act and then
the actual name which is my awesome
animation then we bind it to a template
expression which is usually just a
property defined in your component we'll
name is state and then we're going to
add a click event so I'm going to user
clicks on it we're going to call a
custom method that we will create called
animate me and that's that alright so
we'll put in some content I will animate
and then close out the paragraph tag so
as you can see to attach an animation to
an HTML element you wrap brackets around
the trigger name preceded by an @ symbol
you bind it to Enix template expression
which in this case is a property that we
find in the component class now before
we do that let's give our paragraph some
style in the Styles property right here
so P will make a width of 200 pixels
back around we'll make it light gray
just so we can see it margin 100 pixels
Auto that will Center it
text-align:center to Center the text in
the actual paragraph tag and then
padding we'll give it some padding like
200 pixels and then font size 1.5 yeah
all right great so coming back here real
quickly I'm going to make sure we have
ng serve ran and so now this is what it
should look like in your browser nothing
too exciting if we click it of course
we're going to get an error because we
haven't defined those properties or that
method so let's go ahead and do that
right now so coming down here will first
define our state property so state with
the type of string equals we're going to
by default when the app loads make it
the small state which is defined right
here all right then let's create the
animate V property by the way we can get
rid of all this stuff right here from
the previous lessons as we don't need
them so animate me this top state equals
and we're just going to do what's called
ternary operator it's going to be to
toggle between small and large when and
make me is called which again is called
by a click event so this state equals
small large so if it's small we're going
to make it large otherwise make it small
save it we'll go back to our browser and
now look at that so if you notice the
animation at this point only works in
one direction because we only have one
set of transition properties going from
small to large so to make it work in
both directions we can actually make a
very simple
one character change to our code so
right here if we add this now the
animation will work smoothly in both
directions from small to large and large
to small very very very cool all right
so we can also add style during the
transitions and we could define it
within the transition function so to do
that what we would do now is in the
second argument of the animate function
we add a comma and we add style and an
object so now we can just give it any
other Styles based on the web animation
API so we'll try to transform again with
translate Y so that's on the vertical
axis 40 pixels so let's save that go
back to our project and look at that
kind of looks a little bit silly but I'm
just demonstrating what you can do which
there's a lot that you can do and so
that brings us to the next and final
section of animation that I'll cover and
that is keyframe animations so the
second argument of the animate function
also accepts the keyframes function and
this allows you to create elaborate
sequence based animations so to do that
let's go ahead and get rid of this stuff
right here and by the way we have a
bunch of there we go let's go ahead and
add keyframes and this is wrapped in an
array and then it accepts a bunch of
style property so style again it's a
object so opacity we can make it zero
and then we'll also add transform we'll
make it translate Y which is vertical at
about negative let's say 75% so it's
coming up from the top of the original
starting point and then offset so the
offset designates the point at which the
next style function will begin during
the animation so zero is the very
beginning and one is at the end so
you'll see how this works momentarily
when we finish
is off all right now we'll go ahead and
copy this and paste it two times so the
opacity will go from zero or hidden from
one fully and make this come past the
original starting point by five or
thirty five pixels this will be at 50%
or 0.5 of the animation duration so edit
really 150 milliseconds this style will
occur and then also make this one as
well and make this as a original
starting point of zero and make the
offset one so let's go ahead and save
all right make sure it's refreshed fully
and there you go that's a sequence based
animation so as you can see angular
offers you a great way to create and
control a lot of great UI animations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
