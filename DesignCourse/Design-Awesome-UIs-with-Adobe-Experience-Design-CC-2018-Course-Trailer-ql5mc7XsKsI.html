Etro hopefully you know that already
this is like the 400th time I've had to
say that throughout 400 videos it's
getting so redundant but anyways
throughout the past week we've been
focusing on UI design or user interface
design so I thought it would be
appropriate for this month's premium
course at my site course cetera comm
where you can take that right now the
links in the description to focus on
Adobe experience design CC 2018 to
create a full prototype of a fictional
service where there's going to be a
desktop version and a mobile version and
I created a trailer just for that course
which by the way again you could take
right now and I'm going to show you it
right here as a designer your life just
got easier with the release of Adobe
experience design CC 2018
hi I'm Gary Simon and I'm a full-stack
developer with over two decades
experience working with some of the top
companies including LinkedIn and plural
cycling in this course you're going to
learn all the Adobe experience design
has to offer by falling along as we
create a full user interface project
from scratch see if you know anything
about me you know that I love to teach
by example
it's how I think most of us learn best
Adobe experience design is not only
software that allows you to design user
interfaces but it also allows you to
quickly and easily create interactive
mock-up prototypes as you see here in
this course you're going to learn how to
create user interfaces for desktop and
mobile from scratch quickly replicate
and modify our boards use the Adobe
experience design protector tools for
design create prototypes between your
art boards and effective user interface
design principles the only thing you're
going to need is a copy of Adobe
experience design CC 2018 in an
eagerness to really become an awesome UI
designer so stop staring at the screen
already and let's get started
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
