calm and welcome to the final portion of
this little tiny series where I've
released about three videos so third
about cryptocurrencies and creating a
very simple app that will retrieve data
from a free of 100% free cryptocurrency
API from crypto compare comm and display
that data so the first two showed you
how to do that with view J s and react
now this one's gonna be for angular so I
figured you know might as well cover all
the bases from the three major front-end
modern JavaScript frameworks so of
course the world of cryptocurrencies and
blockchain development are exploding so
as a developer you're probably
interested in learning more about these
emergency or this emerging industry so
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to use again angular to interact with
that API to retrieve and display
information in your app so let's get
started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it first four
prerequisites of course if you're new to
angular or these modern jobs capri more
it's gonna need no js' with npm or no
package manager so to check whether or
not you have that open up your command
line or console and type node - v NPM IV
of course - give me version numbers
because I already have installed but it
may go unrecognized for you and that's
not the case make sure to go to node.js
dot org download the appropriate
installer in the download section for
your operating system and then install
it with the default settings and reload
your command line of console and you can
run these and you'll get version numbers
all right so let's go ahead and start
the actual project so we're going to use
the angular CLI or command-line
interface to start our angular project
so let's install that through NPM the
way you do that NPM install at angular
CLI and g4 global now hit enter I'm not
going to because I already have a fresh
copy installed it'll take about maybe
you know 30 to 60 seconds then next
after that's done we're going to use the
newly installed CLI to start the project
so to access the CLI we type in ng for
angular and then new for a new project
and then the name of a project and
that's going to be angular crypto you
can name it whatever you want so hit
enter and I'm going to pause this until
it's finished alright and it's done so
we can see here project is angular
crypto the name we gave it so let's CD
into that alright great so from here we
come around ng serve and that will
launch development server and we can
access it at localhost 4200 right there
in the browser and there we go here's a
really exciting rather ugly default
angular landing page right there
so now the next part is going to be
connecting to the actual crypto compare
API so you know unlike react in view
angular comes equipped
fortunately with an HTTP library so we
don't have to install anything in terms
of an external HTTP library but it's
generally a good practice to stick your
API calls in a service file here in
angular so let's generate a service file
using the CLI so I'm using by the way
and a lot of people will ask me this
question all the time like we know what
console are you using I mean I'm in
Windows so I'm using Commander so CMD ER
just go to Google
that and get the same one it's free and
this allows you by the way to right
click at the bottom status bar launch a
new console and start we're going to go
back into the same project so that's
going to be C D code CD and then angular
crypto and we're going to use this
inside the project for NPM to in or not
NPM sorry but the angular CLI ng
generate service so we're generating a
service called data that's where our API
calls are going to go to interact with
the crypto compare API alright so next
we're going to go to the Visual Studio
code that's my code editor whatever you
use is fine alright I have open right
here we can see we have our source
folder we want to go to app and the app
module ts file and we're going to import
two different things so first we had our
data service that we created so I'm
going to import that right here so it's
import data service from data service we
can see that file right here we can see
it's a export class of data service then
we're also going to import the HTTP
module library from angular HTTP next
we're going to take this name data
service and we're going to add as a
provider and then secondary to that
we're going to take this HTTP module and
as add as a important so this is all
standard stuff whenever you're going to
be using you know HTTP calls you add
this here or whenever you have a service
you also import it and then add as a
provider down here in this module file
so again you know if you're 100% new to
angular this will be this will seem very
foreign and alien and confusing as most
you know new technologies are or if
you're new to it but again is a pattern
there this is all very standard stuff so
next we're gonna head on over to that
data
service right here so we're going to
import a couple of lines at the top so
first we're going to import HDPE because
we need the HTTP library to interact
with the API so we're going to import it
from and this comes baked in with an
angular HTTP right there and then we're
also going to import right here rxjs
add operator map and you'll see how this
comes into play very shortly alright so
inside of our class at the top we're
going to add a result property of any
and this will basically store the result
that we receive from the CLI or not the
CLI sorry about that then in our
constructor we're going to create an
instance private HTTP to our HTTP of the
HTTP library and then next we're going
to create a method get prices and inside
of here we're going to return this HTTP
GET and this is where the URL goes to
interact with the crypto compare API now
before I put that in there it's gonna
leave a blank I want to finish this code
we're quick so this is where we use line
three the map operator so we put a map
by the way I gonna hit ctrl B to get rid
that sidebar is little bit annoying so
we're gonna put in result arrow function
to this result equals result jason and
so you know we're you know what exactly
do we put in here so i this is a good
point to look at the crypto compare api
documentation so if you go there you see
the urls crypto compare comm /ap i click
on data and these are all the different
pieces of data that you can retrieve
from the api so we have a coin list
and you know this is all very similar if
you go through all these we could see
that we have your all perimeters for
coinless there's none we're not going to
be using this one though but it does
return a lot of different data we can
see the data here for like like coin
gives you the ID or L image URL the coin
name full name etc but it gives you this
for like hundreds upon hundreds of
different you know all coins and such we
don't want that we're just going to keep
things simple and go to price and we're
going to go to price multi this is the
one that we're going to use because
it'll allow us to specify I right here
under you know for the examples price
multi we can specify two different
arguments or URL parameters where we
separate through comma the different bit
your all coins that we want and then
also the currency you know the current
currency value of each so just to show
you that I'm going to paste in real
quick an example right here so we're
requesting Bitcoin btc-e th for
aetherium and IOT for iota now if you're
kind of confused about you know where
did I get these names run for the
shorthand names just go to coin market
Capcom you'll see all of these different
you know essentially all coins and such
these cryptocurrencies if you click on
them it will show you the associated the
shorthand name for those currencies and
then we're saying for t sims we just
want the US dollar equivalent of for
each of these alright and so that's it
for that file next it will be here in
Visual Studio code we're going to go to
the component file itself so this is the
component that's responsible for showing
us that default landing page that showed
up so at the top we need to import the
data service like we did in the app
module file at the top so just copy that
and then we'll go to up here and save
that and then within the
class we're going to remove that default
title property we're going to add or two
of around so like object keys Lee book
equal object keys and then also kryptos
property will hold the response you know
of all of our cryptocurrency data at the
price data that we requested so object
keys is a property right here on line
ten that's defined as a JavaScript
object keys and this is necessary
because the response from crypto compare
is composed of an object as opposed to
an array normally you wouldn't have to
do this with most other api's so after
here we're going to add in a constructor
as we saw in the other file where we
create an instance of our data service
all right then after this we're going to
use the ng for angular on and knit or
I'll not on initialize essentially which
means when this component loads by
default executes with whatever you know
whatever is inside of here so this is
where we make a call to our data service
so we're gonna say this data which is
our data service get prices because
that's what we named the method next
we're going to subscribe the result and
we'll say this dot Kryptos which is
defined up here on line 11 and that will
equal the response we can also
console.log the response which can be
helpful for you know creating the actual
template alright so we'll save that
let's get our sidebar up again and now
let's define a template real quick so to
do that we go to app component HTML will
gut all this stuff here because we don't
need it and we're going to have a div
with ng if
people equals kryptos which is our
property that we define so once it's
defined we can display a div of id
crypto container we'll define that in
CSS in a little bit ng4 which is a
directive to you know iterate over
objects or array of objects or arrays so
we're going to say left crypto of and
then we're going to reference that
property object keys and passing Kryptos
the Kryptos property alright so inside
of here we're going to create a span of
class left it's going to just show
crypto so this isn't through
interpolation crypto will be is the
actual key right here and that's going
to show btc-e th4 aetherium
and iot and then I'm going to use shift
or yeah shift all and down just to
replicate that above line we're going to
say class of right and on the right side
we're going to put in cryptos with the
crypto key right here USD for the object
property and we're going to pass in a
pipe of currency and this is baked in by
default within angular and we're going
to say it's a USD currency and true to
show this symbol all right so it's saved
that and then finally let's define the
CSS an app component CSS I'm going to
copy and paste just three different rule
sets right here in this file so that's
our ID of crypto container has just a
few properties here to make it look
better and span left and been right
nothing big going in there and then also
our style.css and that's just gonna be a
body rule set right here to make the
background a light gray and padding and
fought family Arial so let's save this
and we'll see if it works it probably
will not work just because it's late at
night and we'll see if I actually typed
everything correctly let's try it out
all right and no I mean the actual data
is there
the CSS is messed up for some reason oh
yes because I didn't save this app
component file so I saved it just now
let's go back real quick there we go
surprisingly enough it actually worked
on the first try
awesome stuff so yeah hopefully you
learned a lot throughout this you know
especially if you're interested in you
know angular plus cryptocurrency
development of course as I mentioned
before I've done the same tutorial for
few jeaious and react so yeah I'm
showing you obviously how to do the same
thing throughout these three different
you know JavaScript frameworks and your
bases should be covered at least when it
comes to getting started in each of
these three with displaying
cryptocurrency data so this is just
really you know the very beginning of
what we're going to start focusing on
course cetera comma centrally when it
comes to cryptocurrencies because
there's also a whole nother world of
blockchain development especially with
etherium possibly with the iot at the
iota tangle you're probably wondering
what the hell is that but you know in
due time we're going to experiment with
all this it's all peer-to-peer
distributed ledger technology very
exciting times we're in so hope you
enjoyed it if you liked it subscribe
