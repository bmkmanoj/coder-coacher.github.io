Tetro here and I just decided to do this
video real quick because I realize you
know I put out this course about how to
build this upcoming game Zack in ionic 3
but I never really showcased the actual
app so I figure I use this opportunity
to spam you guys just you know one once
more so we can see I have it up at
Google Play so you can download it for
Android I don't have access to a Mac or
anything so it's not available for iOS
even though it is a hybrid app and will
work for iOS so you know if you have
them if you just have like an apple
phone sorry
you can check out this video instead but
you'll still be able to follow along so
I we could see here you know it's just
at the Google Play Store very simple you
can install if you want um so the very
first thing we do in this course is
design this icon right well let's see if
my focus here will work correctly
there'll be a pain in the ass priority
yeah that icon right there and that's
based on a letter mark logo so the you G
that you see there is something that
will conceptualize me design and Adobe
Illustrator though you can use any other
you know vector-based drawing
application to do that and then after
that we focus on doing a mock up of
course of the main user interface so let
me just get back out here and we'll
launch the app so we'll hit it the very
first thing we focus on I again is the
logo and that's also that splash screen
that shows up we'll do that as well and
you get very first thing that it after
the logo and all that stuff is done is
this side nav bar up top that we design
in Adobe experience design or XD again
all that stuff the design stuff is
optional you don't have to really follow
along if you don't want to I provide all
the assets from my end if you just want
to do the coding stuff but yeah once the
app loads after the initial splash
screen what it's doing is its connecting
to a API and it's an API that offers a
free version then it's called I D GB
internet games database
and basically you have thousands upon
thousands of games in this database that
you can make any type of app with so
that's what we're doing here and we're
pulling this list of these games and
we've sort them in such a way that their
upcoming games and we design all this
from scraps I like I said in Adobe XD so
we get a good idea of you know what we
want to design for or code for later on
using the you know standard HTML and CSS
and so basically when you click on one
of the games I will see that we have
some animation that will come up and we
work all that stuff in we have a game
summary we have screenshots cool sort of
a horizontal based sliding of the
screenshots and then down here we also
have the actual videos and trailers that
are associated with it so it's pulling
all this stuff from that API which is
really cool so if you click on one of
these of course it will launch a YouTube
video based on that particular video and
so in order to get that to work of
course we'll be integrating Cordova
plugins for YouTube each game has its
own website which is right there it says
visit and that requires an in that
browser that will install so there's
just a ton of different stuff let me get
back here that this app is that
developing this app will show you how to
do in ionic so up top we also have a
favorites our faves and we also have
filter so if you have a game that you
like we can favorite it and it stores
your favorite games in local storage so
you'll learn how to use local storage
and saving data here in ionic so now we
can click on phase my thumb will stretch
that much you can see there is some
animation as well when the games come in
and also we can filter and this filter
here all these lists let me get a little
bit closer so you can see this please
focus
there well kinda there we go
sorry about the scanlines as well I suck
at video but um yeah these are different
game genres that you can choose to sort
through and this is also pulling
directly from the API itself so we can
go to like I let's see here
simulator and there we go
now we can also real quickly search so
we have that work in I'll take then
something like quake or Call of Duty 52
and I had to kind of pause there because
I was taking a little bit time to load
but um yeah all this stuff you're going
to learn how to do if you take that I I
on a course of course it's not only $9
and you get access to all of my courses
so um yeah definitely a huge view huge
bargain setting it up like that
so theoretically you could just join for
one month pay $9 access all of my
courses alright so that is it
hopefully you decide to join up and I'll
be seeing you soon there will be another
course released this month month of July
so yeah stay tuned subscribe and all of
that fun jazz alright see you later
welcome to this full stack development
course where you're going to go from
design to code from start to finish
while creating a fully hybrid app
hi I'm Gary Simon and I've been a
full-stack developer for nearly two
decades and I've produced courses for
LinkedIn plural site and envato Network
now my passion is teaching others how to
build cool projects by example and
that's what this course is all about
you're going to build an ionic app which
is based on an extremely powerful hybrid
framework for building android iOS and
windows apps our app is called upcoming
games this app will allow users to sort
through the latest upcoming games in any
genre users can search games favorite
games and even watch trailers and learn
more about each game
so what will you learn in this course
logo design designing user interface
mock-ups creating interactive prototypes
and on the development side installing
ionic connecting to an API templating in
material design launching your app on
your phone and so so much more now if
you're only interested in design or
coding that's perfectly fine my project
files are set up in such a way that you
can jump in at any point during the
course now while this course is based on
just one project I'm a firm believer in
quality over quantity so if you're ready
to begin learning how to build a real
app that people are actually going to
want to use let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
