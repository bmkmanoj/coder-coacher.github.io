calm I have to talk really fast because
my two toddlers are in the room and
they're gonna yell out any second but
anyhow it's late I just need to get this
done my wife can I'm watch because she's
getting the shower I so yeah today we're
going to be doing a blender text
tutorial so it's going to be an
interesting type of an effect that could
be useful maybe to learn a new skill
alright so if you need access to the
project files they're available for free
in the description below this video and
if you haven't yet subscribed here on
YouTube alright let's get started
alright so I'm using the new blender 2.7
though I'm not going to be doing
anything that's specific to it so if you
have a previous version should be able
to follow along fine so if you never use
blender to right to select elements or
objects all you to do is right click on
them and to delete you just hit the
Delete key and enter to move around in
the viewport you can basically move this
way by holding the third mouse button
you can zoom up with the scroll wheel
you can pan using shift in that third
mouse button so that's all I'm going to
go over in terms of basics so that's
basically what you need to know before
you can begin this is essentially a
beginners tutorial so what you want to
do is delete this cube so with it
outline and selected just the delete key
and select delete and we're also going
to get rid of the camera we're not going
to need that so I'm going to delete that
as well I'm going to add a text object
so shift a or just go to add down here
shift a and text alright so now we have
our text right there by default so if
you want to edit the actual text all you
have to do is hit tab and that puts you
into edit mode and you could switch
between edit in object mode so I now are
in edit mode all I have to do is hit the
backspace key and you can enter in any
text that you want so I'm just going to
use a one letter just for this tutorial
to make it a little bit simpler simpler
and make it go quicker so with I'm just
going to use the letter D you can use
multiple letters if you want it's going
to take a little bit longer for you to
do the manual parts so we're going to
switch back to object mode hold hitting
tab alright and then we have to rotate
this upwards
so r is for rotate and then we can enter
90 that know R X 90 sorry about that you
have to hit the X key and that allows
you to constrain on the x axis all right
so that just puts it up my 90 degrees
and now what we want to do is come over
here and right here is the text panel
and it gives us certain options that we
can really just play around and make it
actually 3d so basically I've played
with this tutorial beforehand and what
I'm going to use is and you don't
necessarily have to use it but this is
what I found that worked okay 0.04 for
the offset and that just kind of makes
it thicker then depth we're going to
change to 0.05 and then the extrude
we're going to make it 0.1 all right so
we have a nice thick letter right there
alright so once we've done that now we
want to basically hit the alt C and then
make a mesh from curve made us or text
and so what that will do right now if we
go into edit mode we were able to edit
the text still but if we actually want
to work with deforming some of the AMA
geometry we have to hit that alt C and
select this so now what happens is that
text panel goes away and if we go to
edit now we can see all the different
vertices alright so I'm going to hit 5
on the number pad and that gets us from
perspective to ortho mode and I'm also
going to hit 1 alright so that gets us
in the front view and so now what I want
to do is switch over to face mode face
select mode so you have three different
modes you have your vs. where you can
select by right-clicking the individual
vertices you have the edge mode right
here you can suck edges and then you
have faces all right so what we want to
do is select all of the faces that make
up this portion right here so if you use
a different letter same thing applies so
what you want
do to make it easy to select you're
going to hit B and you're going to keep
your selection within this area so what
we'll do is go down and just keep on
hitting B and it won't deselect you know
whatever you currently did oops and then
if you accidentally select one just hold
shift and right click it and that will
deselect it
B B and there's going to be a couple
that it probably did not select
correctly like if we zoom up here real
close we could see that there's a couple
in here that didn't get selected so if I
hit B now it's selected those I come
down here there's one as well as hold
shift and right click and that will
individually select that alright so that
looks pretty good I think I selected
everything and if you want to be able to
I check if you did select them all just
come off to the side and drag that to
see if you selected everything or not um
so it looks like I got everything so
what I want to do now is basically we
want to extrude it so hit the letter E
and then enter all right so now we
basically duplicated that selection so
what we want to do now is we want to
move it on the y-axis back a little bit
so to do that we'll hit the G key that
means move we're going to hit Y and then
I'm going to move it back by entering in
a value 0.5 actually no that was wrong i
G y 0.1 all right and and I thought this
would get in set and it didn't for some
reason so all I'm going to do real
quickly is a to deselect and make sure
everything's selecting that a again to
make sure nothing selected and hit B row
again real quick again and just select
real quickly
all these front faces so that we can
just delete the faces manually yeah it
didn't do that last time but you know
stuff like that unfortunately happens so
now if I just died with all them
selected delete and delete faces now we
see that portion right there alright and
then real quickly unfortunately I have
to select all these stupid things again
with all these selected what we're going
to do is separate it adds a new object
alright and let me just come over here
real quick these ones don't want to
select hold shift and right click those
two alright so with all of them selected
and nothing else hit the P key and make
that I hit the selection the first
option when you hit P and so now if you
hit tab and then right-click it we can
now go back into edit mode and we'll see
that it is it it's basically its own
layer so are its own object now so with
it selected and this is your layers area
up here that's Texas 0 0 1 we want to
duplicate that object so shift D and
then just you can hit enter and then we
want to move that back by G Y point 1
alright so that move that back further
in there and we can see if we go to
wireframe so we have this one right here
and then this one back here and that's
what you want so now what we want to do
is let's select that first one which is
not that one alright there it is we want
to select that one we're going to
inverse Marine auth ortho mode so
hit the one to go to the front and now
we're going to just left-click and drag
this out to create another panel over
here we're going to go to the uv/image
editor we're going to click right on new
and we're going to make the width and
height two zero four eight two zero four
eight pixels and just hit enter and
we'll zoom out here a bit wait why is
that not normal
let me do a new one oh that one did not
get changed all right there we go all
right so now we have a perfect square
and what we want to do is we'll go to
yeah solid mode hit a oops we're not not
object mode sorry about that we want to
select that text zero zero one by
right-clicking it and then hit the tab
key hit a to select everything and then
hit u to unwrap oops I forgot about that
hit you to go to project from view all
right so now we could scale this up a
little bit hit s over here just roughly
around this size and now what we want to
do is this is where we're going to go to
Photoshop and so we're going to go to
file and new we're going to create a new
one by two zero four eight two zero four
eight and we're going to make it black
for the background and we're going to
use a custom pattern not a custom patter
but one that you're going to download if
you want to follow along with this and
it's like a honeycomb pattern and so I
will link to that in the description
here in YouTube to where you can
download that and so basically right
here once you've loaded that in it's
this one and the scale we're going to
make it up just slightly and see if that
looks okay at a hundred percent
okay so 100% I let me zoom out here
quite a bit to get it a lot so going to
fit on screen and now what I want to do
is right-click on this and we're going
to rasterize the layer alright and
that's basically all we want to do so
now we want to do is save this so we're
going to go to file save for web
although it's not really the web I just
make my JP JB jpg at 92% quality you can
use 100% doesn't really matter and let's
call this a honeycomb and then we'll go
back here to blender and now we want to
do is set up some of the things we want
to switch from blender render to cycles
render and I'm going to come over here
and I'm going to change a couple things
I yeah I have to go to my user
preferences I didn't have to do this
before twice because I already did it
once after downloading the new version
but if I come over here to system I'm
going to change my wow that's inch oh
yeah you have to click on CUDA and I
have to GeForce GTX 580 cards alright so
now over here I can specify GPU compute
in rendering and all that stuff will go
a lot faster for sampling I'm going to
change this to a hundred actually the
actual rendering I change that to a
thousand and then for performance it
changed the this X&amp;amp;Y these tiles to 256
and you could do that if you have a GPU
alright so with that basically all set
up I also want to go to the world tab
and make of the everything white alright
and now what I want to do is switch this
over to the actual yeah node editor and
what we want to do now is with this
portion selected this is what's going to
basically be metal so let's switch over
here and click new and here is our node
editor if I switch this over to rendered
we can see what everything basically
looks like so if I hit five yeah this is
perspective mode right here yeah my
voice is going it's like the end of the
day it's like 10 p.m. anyhow so what we
want to do is basically change this over
here to I this an Co Tropicana so I
should really learn how to say that
anyhow but yeah these default settings
I'm going to leave but I'm also going to
switch back over here to solid and I
want to make shading smooth what that
does if we go back to rendered and makes
it render a little bit better and
there's not those jagged areas alright
so now what we want to do is take this
one this is Texas zero zero one you can
still select objects in rendered mode
you just it just doesn't show you
selecting it but we know it's selected
right here so you right-click on that
make sure it's selected now what we want
to do is set up a little bit more of an
elaborate node system so I'm going to
click new just to get some on there
initially and you know what to make our
life a little bit easier I'm going to
right click and join this area this over
here instead of dragging the left I'm
going to drag it down alright so now I
can make this the node view and this
over here the rendered alright so now I
have more space to put these things or
situate them basically alright so I'm
going to ctrl left click to get rid of
that connection I'm going to hit shift a
to add a mix shader'
and I was going on with my mouse it's
all messed up whoa all right there it
goes so basically we want to add a mix
shader'
and I don't know if that actually got
added so I'm going to add it again there
it goes
alright and then connect it here to the
surface portion connect this one up to
the top
go ahead and add another one a shader
this one's going to be transparent add
this on the second portion and then go
ahead and also add the image texture
shift a and then this is where we're
going to open up that image and that is
right here just double-click on it and
then connect that to the color portion
right there alright so as we can see we
have a really cool effect already
showing up here we can see it's a little
bit transparent
it says 50/50 and we're going to leave
it yep just basically right around there
and now what we want to do is select the
zero zero two portion we're going to hit
new and we're going to hit control hold
ctrl or command + left click and just
cut that connection shift a we're going
to add a mix Eider so mix shader' is
right there and I'm going to add that
right here and connect these up real
quick and my kids are being loud
downstairs of course and then also I so
this one we're going to make it like a
blue and then hit shift a add another
shader and this is going to be an
emission shader
which is right here connect that over
there and the strength is going to be I
think I had like around six point seven
and then make this emission color right
around here and then of course connect
that I think that strength is a little
bit too much so I'm just left clicking
and dragging it down just a little bit
alright alright so now one final thing
that we can do is go ahead and switch to
solid mode real quick make sure Tex is
your 0 1 is selected that's our front
honeycomb portion and hit shift D and
then hit enter and then just drag it on
the y-axis on front a little bit alright
and as you can see it still has the same
material so if we come over here and we
click on this button right here we'll
give it a new material so we can make
changes to this specifically and all I'm
going to do real quick is switched to
rendered is take this FAC value and push
it up a little bit more so that this
doesn't stand out so much all right so
now I'm going to right click on this
middle section and just hit join area
down and then finally we'll go back real
quick and our last step will be to shift
a to add a plane hit s and just drag
your mouse up quite a bit we'll give
that material we'll make it a 100% white
switch back to rendered hit G and then Z
and move your mouse down so that these
are sitting just right on it the letters
in this interesting design basically
alright so yeah that's just a quick
tutorial on just you know showing you
how you can separate objects parts of
objects and apply very interesting node
materials and shaders to create some
interesting effects all right so if you
wanted to redditor and save this out
you'll just go over here to the render
area and I remember the higher samples
the more samples you have the better
will look and also this is where you can
control your resolution I'm going to set
mine to 1280 by 720 and also this little
by percentage area if you just take that
up to 100% and we'll
100% of these value up here and then
yeah basically be ready to render right
here and then you can hit f3 I believe
to save that as an image alright so that
is it I'm Gary assignment of design
course comm and if you haven't yet
