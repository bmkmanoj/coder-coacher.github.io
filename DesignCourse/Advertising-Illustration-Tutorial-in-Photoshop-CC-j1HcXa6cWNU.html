and today is january 17th with our 17th
consecutive video of the year and today
we're going to use adobe photoshop CC to
create a really cool and unique and
interesting looking product illustration
for a fictional company called heavenly
eggs so as always the project files are
available for free in the description
below this video and also please check
out design course comm there may be
courses and full awesome tutorials that
there aren't quite up yet I'm working on
creating notes but depending on when
you're watching this I don't know
whether it be a few months or a year
down the road they may be there so go
ahead hurry up hit ctrl T on your
browser and check out design course comm
to see what's going on there so let's
get started
okay so the first thing we want to do is
go to file new and we'll call this
heavenly hives are in completely wrong
position on my keyboard heavenly eggs
for the width I'm going to choose I
let's see 850 and then 600 so basically
for my resolution that fits well at a
hundred percent so we'll hit okay zoom
up here and a hundred percent okay and
I'm going to fill in the background with
an orange color pretty bright so it's
FFC zero zero zero being the color code
hit okay and paste that in paste it in I
am not on my game today we're not
pasting anything we're just filling it
okay so now what we want to do is kind
of create like a backdrop or look kind
of like a gradient in the background so
what we'll do is hit ctrl shift and for
a new layer hit okay drag out for the
gradient tool and we'll switch to the
the background of the foreground and
we'll just go darker right on right
around there and then what I want to do
is with the gradient tool selected and
we have this option right here that
preset rather hold shift and just pull
up just right around there roughly and
then we're going to move it right around
here and then go to filter blur Gaussian
no sorry
filter blur Gaussian blur and go into
fast aren't I and take the radius up
right around there and hit OK and it's a
little bit too dark so we take the
opacity down enemy yeah
ctrl T it's going to shift and drag that
up a little bit right around there and
then I'm going to take the eraser tool a
large one Wow
thousand not to Anna's I say 700 all
right and I'm going to zoom out yeah
right around there is fine just once go
back to that eraser tool and I think I
didn't just go right around here there
just like that all right so now what I
want to do is that is actually create
the egg shape so we're going to take the
ellipse tool and we're going to take a
white color for the foreground and we're
going to create basically an oval and
doesn't matter where you set it
initially I think right there is a
pretty decent egg shape except I'm going
to take the direct selection tool select
that portion hit shift and do those two
so we want these two points selected and
then just hold shift and bring them down
you're right around there yeah no I
think that was good right there all
right and hit ctrl H to get rid of those
points and we're going to push position
it right around here all right
so far so good alright so now what we
want to do is create kind of like a
shadow right here so underneath it we'll
go ahead and take our brush see how big
that is so it's pretty much the same
almost the same size it's fine if it's
off a little bit and we're going to
change the foreground color to something
dark hit okay
and then just come up here in the middle
somewhere and then just click once hit
ctrl T hold shift and oh no oh no I put
that on the same layer oops
I'm just going to hit ctrl Z and then
ctrl alt Z a couple times so we can undo
that mistake control shift down for a
new layer we call this egg shadow sorry
about that
good go ahead and do that real quick
ctrl T shift maybe right around there so
we're really flattening it out we want
to be like just like right there alright
so that looks good so far
and I now what I want to do is we're
going to give it some shading this egg
so we're going to take it I which is
called ellipse one we're going to call
this egg
shrill shift end for a new layer make it
a clipping mask hit okay and we're going
to go back to our brush and you know
this is pure white right now
so we're going to go a little bit darker
of a gray hit okay
and just like that and so you know this
is a pretty large brush three and a 30
pixels so I'll have to do is just very
lightly right along that portion now
what I want to do is create another
layer I'm going to call this background
shadow make sure that's a clipping mask
I forgot to check it off all you have to
do is right click and fix that and let
me name this real quick too so take
background shadow and now what we want
to do is go ahead and take take the
eyedropper click right around there and
drop our size down just a little bit or
maybe not and we're just going to click
right here so that doesn't look correct
that's okay
what to do is go to control T and I'm
holding shift and scaling that down just
a bit and you could also hold alt and
increase the size width wise all right
select apply and you can experiment with
moving these up and down I mean you can
even change the blend mode up the egg
shadow so we could see this underneath
it and you can play with that just by
using your arrows I think I'm just going
to leave it normal and leave this there
and then what I can do is take the
eraser tool and just very slightly get
rid of oh that's the egg shadow part
nope yet is okay
there that's the one I wanted sorry
about that alright and then just kind of
get rid of the very bottom portion of it
okay so so far so good I'm going to
create one more shadow though underneath
this so on top of egg shadow
control-shift-n for new leg layer egg
shadow too and I'm going to take I kind
of a darker color here we're going to
bring the scale down just a little bit
and kind of go right here in the center
there and then I'm going to take these
sides of the eraser lay around there
maybe I'm gonna make it a little bit
larger
capacity maybe just down very slightly
okay I'm going to leave it there for now
I don't know if I like that but we'll
see all right so now what I want to do
is go ahead and start cracking this
thing so we're going to have a cracked
shell so what we'll do is we'll just guy
click up here on the top layer take our
shape our pen tool make sure shape is
selected we're going to choose the
background color just right around the
area where it's going to be cut out and
this is just temporary
but you'll see what we're going to do
real quick zoom up here and we're going
to crack it right around here so just
select just a outside of the shell and
then just click all around to make it
look like this thing has been cracked
open
oops sometimes it look that will happen
you just undo it like that all right now
we'll select to our original point now
we'll hit ctrl C just to copy that's
going to copy this path now we can get
rid of this later so hit delete now
click on the egg layer and hit paste
control V and then we can come over here
subtract front shape all right
so hit ctrl H now we can see you know
the actual background is back behind
there all right so now what we want to
do is go ahead and create yolk so and
I'm not talking about the egg yolk I'm
talking about the the white stuff the
egg white so what we want to do is I'm
going to select on the top layer and
this is going to be we're going to make
this white it's not white in real life
it's actually a very faint type of
translucent color but just for now we're
going to make a white so we're clicking
just above that eggshell
and we want to come down right around
here and just drag out and it's going to
basically overflow this portion
just like that all right cool I know if
you've never played with the planned
tool it could be a pain at first trying
to learn but it just takes practice all
right so now what I want to do I'm going
to right click and I'm going to
rasterize that okay so I'm going to zoom
out here
let's take control one just to get to a
hundred percent and now what we could do
is take this eraser tool and let's see
here I think at 240 might be a good size
and just click once so now we can see
we've kind of made it slightly
transparent so I'm going to go to image
adjustments hue and saturation I
shouldn't have made that white initially
but we're just going to colorize it so
select colorize and turn lightness down
just slightly saturation up and we can
see that it does have a very faint
almost like a skin tone type of color
it's we want it to be yellow slightly I
think right there is probably good and
then hit OK okay and then what I want to
do is then create the yolk inside of
this so it's going to get real close and
let's take the pen tool and this is
going to go beneath this shape line so
we'll just call this egg white all right
so let's start right here and we're
going to try to follow the shape of the
egg white like this
and then just go all the way out right
there and then we want to make this
yellow like a real yellow and we're
going to drag this beneath the egg layer
right there alright so now what I want
to do we're going to zoom out here get
100% alright so I'm going to call this
yolk and now I want to create some
highlights so obviously when it comes to
egg yolk and it's very reflective so
we're going to take the pen tool we'll
come up here to the top layer and these
are going to be reflections of like
lights basically and so you want to
follow the shape basically of the top
portion here maybe another one right
there alright and maybe we'll do one
coming down here do another one over
here oops
me another one right here
all right we'll do like a large one
right here and take the ax pass it down
just a little bit and maybe another one
right here all right so if you control
one now it looks I pretty decent we want
to create kind of like a let's see a
shadow that's going from the eggshell to
the actual yolk so we're going to hit
ctrl shift end with the yolk layer
selected create a clipping mask and
let's go ahead with the brush tool I
need to close this thing out all right
so I will go ahead and take that down a
bit change the color here something
darker
yeah you know what I don't like that of
course there's a massive playing outside
you guys could probably hear that all
right let's see
very faint and then I got to take the
opacity and drop that down quite a bit
all right
and another thing I want to do is I'm
going to slightly change the color of
the yoke so double-click on that square
portion of the layer and yeah just
dropping it down slightly so it's a
little bit more orange than it is yellow
and hit OK all right and let's see if
there's any other adjustments I want to
make actually I think that looks pretty
good right there
we're not done yet though so what I want
to do now I want to get some type going
real quickly so I'm going to go to the
very top and all these shapes these are
all of our shadows so I can just group
those ctrl-g call these highlights I
mean rather not shadows all right so
it's off like that all right and then
what I want to do I'm just going to
click once right here just call this
heavenly a little beyond heavenly eggs
all right and we'll take the color make
it white this will be a yellow rope
right one control T will scale this up
right around there and we'll get rid of
that space and then we will duplicate
that real quick control T
and I'm just going to put the most
wholesome organic eggs you can imagine
alright so we'll take this top one we'll
make these line up evenly this
background layer I want to make it
slightly darker so I come over here just
fill this in just like that not too too
much there alright so now what I want to
do is go ahead and use our brush tool
and create some clouds and so I've
linked some cloud photoshop brushes in
the description my video and you can
download this one.i which will work or
you could I just check out all these
other ones there's there's tons of
different sites that offer free
photoshop brushes for clouds so you know
basically the way load those up is you
know once you download them they're just
a file you can double click and I
Photoshop will automatically recognize
those and so when you do that nothing
will happen but if you take your your
eye your eraser tool or your paintbrush
you'll see if you drop down here you
have they'll show up at the bottom
alright so these are all different
clouds so I'm just going to experiment
here I'm going to choose this one and
these are real large so I'm going to
create a new layer above layer 2
control-shift-n just to enter call this
clouds real quick
oops double click clouds and take the
size down a lot oops
we need them to actually be white all
right ok and I'm going to create a new
layer clouds to
and you obviously want these to be
different you want to vary the clouds a
little bit and some me look good and
some may not so let's just try one right
there and we could try putting this
above everything so it kind of goes in
front so looks like there's some depth
here and let me see if I want to do one
more not you don't want to overdo it but
we'll see if we can get away this is
kind of different type of clouds here
now that's a it's like a little bit too
much in my opinion you're really just a
matter of playing around I I think that
looks good right there
all right not done yet though I want to
create another layer and I think I'm
going to do it just above that layer -
and I'm going to take the paintbrush
tool and go up to a feather brush and
make it real
well let's see how big we want to make
this thing maybe 600 and with the white
in the foreground just going to click
right here and that really just
brightens things up a little bit we can
drop the opacity down slightly if we
want all right I think that is pretty
good I like it so hopefully I you've
created something that you're proud of
and you know and hopefully this is a
good tutorial for you to learn how to
use the the the pen tool because we use
that a lot so as always go ahead and
