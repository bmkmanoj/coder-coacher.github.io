force com Adobe f release its new CC
2015 update and along with it our new
ways in quicker ways to export assets in
also entire layers very quickly so I'm
going to switch over to the desktop and
show you exactly how to use these new
features so as we can see here we have a
fictional mobile app UI mock-up let's
assume we're finished with this design
and we need to export the assets and
send them off to the developer
traditionally I would have to select
each layer individually hit ctrl command
a control command C and open up a new
document and paste them in and then go
to file save for web and well
fortunately now it's a lot easier with
CC 2015 you can now export layers
automatically so let's say we want to
export these three assets which consists
of an on and off state of a toggle
button and a logo all we have to do is
select all the layers and right-click
and either specify quick export as PNG
or export as so let's look at each one
individually if we specify quick export
as P&amp;amp;G all allows us to do is to specify
the location in which we want the files
to export so I'll just choose desktop
and hit OK so you're showing up off
screen but I can double-click them and
we can see they are all there ready to
go now if we do the other option we can
right-click and choose export as and
this gives us more specific controls in
terms of each layer so we could specify
the format the quality to scale etc and
hit export and I'll have to do is
specify where you want to save it and
you're good to go now another advantage
here let's say for example we're working
with a document that has the new
artboard feature and we have two Art
boards right here for these fictional
banners so what we can do is go to file
export export as and we could see that
the artboards themselves as
I'll get specified on their own document
and will be saved as such all right so
that is basically an overview of the new
export options here in Photoshop CC 2015
