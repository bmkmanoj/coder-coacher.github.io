Gary Simon here of course tetrode calm
and yes I have brought back design
challenges once again except this time
it is open to everyone and you don't
have to be a corset remember that was a
big failure so I did make a change and
the change that I made this time is you
can only submit one entry so one entry
per user the system won't let you post
more than that and that's simply because
I need myself to have time and the
ability to rate these and not get bogged
down with hundreds of entries so I
you'll prefer this I challenge right
here you're going to have two weeks I it
does let you edit your entry so you know
if you think of something else or
something better you can do so and you
can submit one entry all right so this
entry right here is designed an app
onboarding screen oh but real quick
before we begin make sure you check out
my site course cetera com where you're
going to find a bunch of courses on
modern design and development a lot of
free and others you can access for the
cost of buying me like x-pac each month
that did now also it probably wouldn't
hurt to subscribe here on YouTube and be
sure to make sure the notifications are
turned on alright let's get back to it
so as mentioned I
I recently stat 35 minutes tutorial on
creating an app onboarding process with
ionic I didn't really cover the design I
just kind of did the the technical
implications of it but that gave me the
idea though of making this design
challenged with tasking you with just
handling the design aspect of a single
onboarding slash tutorial screen for a
fictional app alright so what I want you
to do is I here in the description on
YouTube I've linked directly to this
challenge page right here and check this
out and take a look at the design
requirements because you will not be
eligible when if you screw this up
so this on Orion screen will be based on
an app that for rating alcoholic
beverages I so do not
create or show a logo or app name so you
don't have to worry about that we don't
want that present in this slide the
slide title will be fine the best
alcohol and the slide description will
be users like you rate the alcohol the
drinking and this makes it easy to find
the good stuff I want both of these
included it must be included ok and you
must also include some type of unique
illustration or element in your slide
that illustrates the idea of fighting
alcohol which is the purpose of this
particular slide so what I'm talking
about though if you get onto an
inspiration you click on these these are
just some examples of these onboarding
slash tutorial screens that I'm talking
about so of course this has just a very
simple unique illustration as to do the
light bulb and this one's about to
discover this is about news and this is
about be inspired be entertained has
people happy or whatever it's relevant
and so basically you're tasked with
coming up with them some type of visual
that illustrates the concept of finding
something or if you want to make real
specific finding alcohol or something
alright so this I need you to submit
your entry by July 7 to 2017 that's two
weeks from now and also this is very
important to now these aren't
requirements but here suggestions it
makes my job a lot easier when I have
better I you know submissions to be able
to judge so like a mention here the
whole purpose of these design challenges
to help you get better at design so in
this case its UI design user interface
so there's a few good design principles
and fundamentals that you really should
consider when you're designing you is
not just for this but for any for any
occasion so first is using good white
space which means like margin and
padding you know like right here look at
this this this is a user interface
essentially this page here's layout you
can see that this text right here it's
not smashed up against the edge of this
containing element that's white space
alright so I use good color this means
using colors that are relevant to the
subject and colors that also
in each other and then color that we can
also very quickly become a big
cluttering mess of your design if you're
adding too many colors so it's usually a
good idea to limit the amount of UI
colors that you have like for my site
for instance I kind of go between this
side this teal / turquoise color and
this blue and light gray and white
that's it you don't want to add a bunch
of colors just because you can I also
use good contrast so people can't see
your important UI elements you know like
your buttons or your text etc I they're
going to have a hard time seeing them
and then this is obviously bad also use
visual hierarchy and when it comes to
design in general not just UI design
there's something called visual
hierarchy and this is essentially kind
of what helps place prominence on AI
when you have various elements that are
a part of a design composition so size
position and color these all help
establish visual hierarchy let me show
you an example real quick
I for instance visual hierarchy here
first we have an element that you know
it's very simple it helps communicate
the idea of discovering or enlightenment
and that's that light bulb it's very big
it's centered here so this is you know
one of the most important elements I
next we have discover right here this
this title then we have this paragraph
here where it's obviously it falls less
on the priority priority side in terms
of its visual hierarchy because they're
using you know a smaller font size and
it's going to relegate it to the bottom
portion so all these things help create
a nice concise design otherwise if
everything is given equal importance
equal size there's not good visual
hierarchy and in other words that means
your design sucks
oh alright so also finally use
simplicity and this is something I find
a lot with people who are new to design
new design there are just they're
overusing effects like crazy just
because they can
you know just because you have so many
tools and effects to use doesn't mean
you should use them so you know keep
things simple avoid overusing fact
effects like drop shadows and glows and
outlines and strokes etc usually more
often than not things I their best when
they're kept simple for instance I mean
just look at this this is actually from
Google so a guy who's making well over
probably six figures this is what he
designed same thing here extremely
simple so that doesn't mean you always
have to go so simple that you're just
you know you have nothing else going on
but if you're new try to keep things
simple more often than not all right
so I'm looking forward to the entries go
ahead if you're just watching this you
may see this go ahead and be the first
guy to submit in entry again just one
entry per person and in terms of prices
you get one month of course cetera Pro
free which is located right here and
what this simply means is that you have
access to all of the courses that I have
available here that are listed as pro
courses and I within about seven to ten
days there will be a new Pro course
added here alright so I'm looking
forward to the entries and I'll see you
soon by the way also I do review these
entries at the end if you're new to
design challenges back when I have them
up at four and I rate everybody's entry
and I do a quick video overview and
basically pick a winner all right I'll
talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
