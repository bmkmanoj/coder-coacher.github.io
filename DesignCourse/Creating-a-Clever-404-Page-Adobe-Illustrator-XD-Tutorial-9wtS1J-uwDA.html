so today I'm going to be focusing on a
real niche very focused subject and that
is the concept of designing a 404 page
mainly doing this because I've been
working real hard on the rxjs course
have been promising for a while but I
don't like a lot of time to go by my
YouTube channel without actually
uploading something so over here to make
it more difficult on myself and to see
you know how I would do it kind of just
off the cuff for designing a 404 page I
have this page right here discover calm
and if I click this button take me to a
useful website then it's going to just
present me with a random website
apparently and I will try to tackle the
process of designing a relevant and
unique for a four page sort of
illustration or layout or concept so if
I click on this let's see where it takes
me to all right ugly ass website all
right so this is El mail.com see what
there lexer rankings yeah this site
doesn't even practically exist as like a
3 million Alexa ranking yeah this looks
really old school but you know that the
whole concept is though for me to do
this this is just a an email service so
I'll still do it okay so what would be a
relevant 404 or a creative 404 page for
an email service of looking again is
there anything unique about this it's a
the easiest way to send a letter LML
send your letter on post will just be
there okay anyhow we'll just say it's
email or message delivery or some sort
that's a general concept so how would we
or how would I tackle doing a 404 page
for such a concept alright so I'm gonna
start off here possibly actually I'm not
going to do illustrator we're going to
do Adobe XD first it's just just a you
know this is from Adobe assist Adobe
experience design in case you're unaware
it's just a very quick an easy user
interface
ix tool you can design web mock-ups and
app mock-ups and all that stuff and
prototypes here so you can do this in
any application it doesn't really matter
we're not making this a functional 404
pages just purely for design and coming
up with the process of coming up with
you know just relevant sort of 404 pages
so I'm not going to use their kind of
layout because it was really ugly I'm
just gonna make a very simple container
here where we'll have our fictional 404
page first I'm going to take the
background and again I'm not really
thinking too much about what I'm gonna
do yet I just want to get a page here
something very basic I'm not gonna spend
much time on it all right so we have our
container here we have a gray background
and this will be our fictional 404 page
before I begin we'll just assume maybe
there's you know a very simp simple
actually let's just make it el mal we'll
use the same name at least I'll use
montserrat iPhone I've been using quite
a bit lately let's see here we'll make
it bold and we'll make it a little bit
larger
all right there's fine I'll duplicate it
some fictional links real quick about
all right that's fine for now okay so
this would be our kind of a fictional
404 page maybe I will duplicate this and
create a very light background there we
go all right so this would be our 404
page container essentially and so now
going back to the topic I coming up with
a 404 page you know if you do something
really really unique sometimes you can
get actually get publicity for it so
that's the whole point in doing this I
and also just an interesting user
experience for your users anything up
there ending up on a page that doesn't
exist so in the concept of email or
message delivery so this is where it
really takes some brainstorming you know
what's happening when somebody reaches a
404 page while the page doesn't exist
it's not a pleasant experience so let's
try to make it better by doing something
that's relevant and witty or unique so
how could we translate the concept of
404 you know something like a page that
doesn't exist with the concept of email
or message delivery all right so the one
of the things coming to mind is you know
when you send an email sometimes you'll
receive another email back stating that
the address has not been able to be
delivered for whatever reason usually
because that the email doesn't exist
anymore they deactivated their account
or something like that along those lines
another way of coming up with ideas is
just to use Google you know can help for
sources of inspiration so we can just go
to like images at Google we can type in
email broken and you know something
might you know right away catch our
attention and spark a new idea of course
we're not talking about stealing or
anything like that
here's a literal representation of the
concept of mail obviously not electronic
a mailbox you know it's something may
spark your your your
tension and something may not one thing
I'm thinking about in terms of likely an
email box is you know yeah like it say
for instance teenagers they come by
there and they're batting email or not
email but mailboxes and that could
potentially be a way to represent a 404
page so maybe a very simple illustration
of a mailbox with the top portion of the
actual box laying on the ground maybe so
maybe I'll try that direction maybe that
could be a pretty unique way of saying
okay we're combining the two ideas of
email and a broken alright so I'm gonna
try that this may not be the easiest
thing to do and I do have a Cintiq like
a walk home monitor that I could draw on
but I don't want to do that I'm going to
keep this more simple than just freehand
drawing so I'm gonna use the mouse so
I'm gonna come back to we're gonna use
illustrate now you could do this
possibly with their tools and Adobe XD
because they do you have a pen tool and
some basic shape tools but I'm not quite
familiar with them enough I'm a lot more
familiar with Adobe XD so what I'll do
is just create the illustration here in
Adobe Illustrator and then just import
it
assuming I'm able to do this correctly
so let's see here oh there's a new
update you know whatever alright so I'm
gonna zoom up here just a little bit and
I think I'll start with the post like a
wooden post or something with the
rectangle tool alright so we'll make it
kind of I got a in angle we don't look
directly at it almost look at it from
like maybe you know 45-degree angle or
whatever let's find the where is it at
it's the shear tool here
let's see maybe yeah something like that
will work alright let's also I don't
want to stroke on this you could you
know go with the stroke it all depends
on how you want the end result to look
something like that is fine and then
let's go ahead and control C control F
transform reflect it's showing up on my
other monitor we'll hit okay move this
over okay
so we're obviously based on the
perspective that we have at at we're
looking from above and also to the side
of this portion right here alright so
okay so now we have to tackle kind of in
a bit I will make this look like it's
all you know like broken up or whatever
but what it will do now is use a rounded
rectangle tool alright and we'll create
the actual shape of the eye the mailbox
itself the portion that's that opened
alright
I'm also going to come over here in this
section the lower left we want to be
zero and lower right zero as well
alright
alright that looks like a fair enough
opening it seems to be about the right
size now again this is going to be
laying on the floor so we have to get
this perspective right this may this
might be a little bit eye a little bit
tricky trying to get this correct so I'm
gonna go ahead and rotate it and then we
can use some of these tools over here
let's see we have a reshape and scale
the shear tool I haven't really used
these tools too much in the past trying
to get this right around and here's fine
maybe it's laying kind of like that
all right so I let me get up closer here
there that way it looks like it's kind
of straight up and down
all right I'm gonna duplicate this or
yes ctrl c ctrl f we'll move it back
something like that all right
and then we'll take the pen tool now I
want to make this look like it's kind of
like broken up a little bit there we go
yeah something like that will work we'll
connect this up and then we'll come up
here right around here
all right and then come down here all
right okay looks like crap now so what
we'll do is let's see here I think a
quick way of let me fix this by the way
there we go that looks fine to me
a quick way of trying to structure this
well we'll go ahead and just in case I
screw something up I'll take everything
and just move it over great copy and
then what I'll do is we'll take our
window we'll go to our Pathfinder and
then we'll use this divide tool all
right so now we can just select the
certain things that we want to select as
being actual outlines based on what we
need all right so what I'll do is take
let's see your just this one this one in
this one and those are all going to be
I'm going to use unite all right so
that's the one side of it we're going to
take this one in this one and that's
going to be the open portion will unite
those we'll take let's see here I want
to see what we're looking at so far
we're gonna take this one this one this
one this one and then you need unite
those so now our our shapes look like
this okay now to really make it obvious
that this is something that's banged up
we're gonna use some different shading I
think we'll make this of course the
typical gray color or the silver so
let's go ahead and what I'll do first is
let's get the the shading going so what
angle is the the Sun coming we'll just
say it's the light source is coming from
up here so the bottom will be
with more light so we'll say we'll make
this yes yeah right here's good we'll
make this one slightly less bright all
right and then this one is going to be
even darker now to really illustrate the
fact that it's banged up we're going to
use our pen tool connect these points
here maybe this one will be a little bit
lighter all right like that we'll do the
same thing up here
all right this one will be a little bit
darker all right and then um usually has
you know mailboxes have those what do
you call little flags here so I'll just
make a circle and ellipse rather just
holding shift and alt while I do this
and then we can use that shear tool
and this will be let's see here we'll
make this kind of a darker red for now
and then I'll use the pen tool
I'll just create a slight bezier curve
by pulling up yeah something like
that'll work all right it seems a little
bit too big but don't worry we're not
anywhere near done yet
okay let's see do we want to show the
bottom portion kind of coming out do we
do we do we take this
we'll see if I can line this up
correctly
yeah maybe something like that will work
then I'll just take the direct selection
tool and move this over into place this
needs to be a little bit longer so I'm
going to drag them out I will use maybe
just a slightly different shade oops
there we go
all right so I'm gonna get rid of that
all right so not done yet
I want to polish this up obviously a
little bit more this is going to be a
lighter color mmm let's see here
there we go
now let's simulate this eye top portion
being broken so what I will do is let's
see
something like that
and then we will let's see here
I'll use this shade for now we'll just
do this yeah this would be slightly
darker and then we'll create another one
right here
this one will make yeah that'll work
and then we'll use this one for this
point right here
all right cool
to really make this obvious a little bit
more I think what we'll do is also use
will create part of it coming off here
all right so let's see if we can get
that all lined up we'll say we'll
probably just a little bit coming off so
we have to think of dimensions here
getting this correct something like that
is fine we have to adjust the points
afterwards all right and then we'll do
another one right here
make it aligned with that angle up there
okay and then we'll do that same thing
like like this this and that doesn't
have to be perfect I'm not really
worried about it too much make this one
use the eyedropper tool over here same
color is this oh wait okay it already
was this one will be a darker okay so
then we'll just do the same thing down
here start like like that alright this
one would be a lighter color so I'll
take the fill there we go and then um
I'll take this doesn't have to be
perfect still looks pretty obvious and
then um yeah there we go sweet so it's
kind of isometric in a sense all right
so now not done just yet
and what we'll do I'm trying to think of
I how I want to do this we have the
light source coming from this way what
we'll do is let me put this day I'll
think of how I may end up changing this
we'll see but um I'm gonna take this
we're going to get our layers out where
those are there we go I'm gonna put this
to the very bottom and we'll make a very
just kind of light shadow so I'm gonna
choose grayscale what's that look like
mmm not bad
so I'm gonna I'm gonna try I'm gonna
hide that and see if I would rather put
just like a soft or not a soft but a
solid shadows being cast from this okay
so I hit escape come down here there we
go and then also this so should be
something like this is e this would be
easy to mess up by the way we'll just
put and we'll try that we'll see which
one I like better just different
approaches this would have to come out
more alright do I like that do it like
that let's hide those and bring this
back or this yeah kind of like this
actually
alright so we're gonna say that's the
illustration we're gonna use for the
basis of the 404 page something that's
unique I kind of almost want to change
this a little bit make it look roughed
up more do I do I do I do I want to do
that I could just cut my losses and say
yeah we will
yeah let's let's do that real quick I'm
just gonna take a rectangle and we're
start up here I select everything here
and then pulse device wait do I want to
do that no I don't what I'll do instead
is use a pen tool
to kind of just cut off this section
right here now I'm going to take this
and put it to the bottom and then we
little hit divide I'm gonna get rid of
the back but now we can easily just
select if I right-click and ungroup
select the top and move it off and maybe
we'll make it go that way yeah something
like that maybe and then we'll connect
up these wooden pieces this one will be
darker all right so we'll go right there
this one will be slightly slightly
darker here but not quite as dark so if
I come up here
yeah yeah something like that that'll
that'll be fine and then let's see here
we'll take another one let's see how do
I want to approach this something like
this
and I think that'll yeah you know what
makes sense to go all the way and maybe
we'll do this just dive one more time
maybe right here
move this to the bottom select all this
and then we'll divide it and then we'll
ungroup and then shift this over just
slightly that looked good let's see
alright so then we'll just fill this up
alright so before we go in exports or
import this into XD for our our file
we're gonna make sure that certain
things are you know they're there where
they need to be in terms of their shapes
and their outlines being on the same
path using the unite tool because
there's some you'll be able to see
strange artifacts in XD if these aren't
united so all the faces this will be
this is the same color so we'll just
unite that and i'm going to go through
this real quick just on my own just to
unite these certain areas that all look
like they should be on the same face
all right that's good so if I look at
the outlines this is what I have here
all right cool
so now I'm going to save this as it's
just an SVG file we'll go ahead and
import it into XD all right so now let's
say you know we'll think about how I
want to position this in a second so
this is going to be the main graphic
that we're going to use here to
illustrate this 404 for this email
service I'm going to put some text here
I'm going to just going to put 404 let's
increase this we'll make this bold
all right and let's see here we'll say
something unique let's see or not I'm
not sure if I can come up with something
really clever here on the spot
let's see bring down the size well have
some type of secondary message here
we'll say mmm let me think there's some
kids took a bat to the page you were
looking for I showed oh let me see here
let's let me get up my layers here
now the way I created that text area it
wasn't an actual a text area let me just
copy that and delete that there and now
I can adjust the size oh that's right
I'm gonna get rid of the page breaks
here we'll put this life psych Center it
up over here with a lot of white space
on the side and then we'll take this and
move this over just trying to align it
yeah something like that's fine
period here do I like that I mean yeah
it's very simple I think it's a little
bit you know it's it's it's slightly
comedic and entertaining um is there
anything else I want to do to it
probably not I think what in there and I
think we you get the gist of essentially
what I was going for here there we go so
here is the final 404 page that I came
up with obviously something very simple
obviously it's meant to serve more is
kind of like an illustration tutorial i
but yeah hopefully you found some value
in that I again I've been working real
hard on this rxjs course I don't want to
let too many days go by without
uploading something here on YouTube so
hopefully some of you were able to find
value from that all right see you guys
real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
