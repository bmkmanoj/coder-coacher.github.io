calm today is january twenty third with
our 23rd video of the year and today i
am introducing what I'm going to call a
mega tutorial so we're going to take
three different applications blender
adobe photoshop and adobe after effects
to create this unsure if you're unfit to
drive after a couple drinks blow into
this device and it will let you know if
you're over or under the legal limit
with its compact design baxter is the
first iphone power breathalyzer
available now pretty awesome so we're
also going to use adobe photoshop to
create a landing page website design for
this fictional product so the first
thing we're going to do is go into
blender and actually create the 3d model
then we're going to use adobe photoshop
to create the interface and then we're
going to use After Effects to animate it
and then we'll go back into Photoshop to
create the actual layout for the web
design so this tutorial is going to run
obviously several days long and I'm
going to knock it out day by day here in
the next few days so we don't actually
have a tutorial today this is just an
announcement video for the upcoming
tutorial which will begin tomorrow so
it's always check out design course calm
and also in when it comes to these
future videos that I'm gonna be
releasing all the project files and even
the song everything is free so let's go
ahead and look for that email tomorrow
alright goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
