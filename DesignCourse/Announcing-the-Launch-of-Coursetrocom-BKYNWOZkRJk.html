is what this video is all about I and
Viv's a slide nerd many of you know them

new website
corsetry com that cou RSE TRL and what
course etro is is basically a hundred
percent free also with paid courses

development with a strong focus or
initial focus on apps all right so we're
launching with three courses and the
first one it's a paid course it's the
one that we released six months ago you
already know about it and the other two
are hundreds of new free courses and the
first one that I created the eyes is on
creating app mock-up templates in
Photoshop so you can check that out I'll
have a link here in the description and
the one that Viv's created is a seven
hour course on beginning java all right
so these are hundred percent free like I
said and all it requires is a quick
email address a user user registration
and that's it not a big deal so just do
that once and you'll have access to all
future courses that we create and as
well as the paid courses gonna be
dirt-cheap like always

of beta testing yet there may be issues

bottom of course cetera comm all right
