so today we're going to continue on with
the theme that I've been keeping up in
the channel the last week or so with UI
design and prototyping told overviews
all right so just last week we did
graphic designer and also lunacy and
today we're gonna take a look at figma
and I have to say figma is the one tool
that I think most of you have requested
more than any other tool so that's for
good reason it's 100% free for an
individual and also it's a hundred
percent web-based it also has
prototyping in it and a hat also has a
desktop version that you can use on in
multiple operating system which is made
possible through electron so I'm gonna
go ahead and walk you guys through a
quick kind of like a mobile UI design
just to show as many features as
possible like in a 30 minute video so
you can get a well-rounded understanding
of how this tool operates and I have to
say it's very similar to Adobe XD except
it's free and even web-based so that's
pretty freakin awesome alright so make
sure you subscribe here if you haven't
yet make sure you do that because I'm
pumping out videos like a crack addict
and also check out corset row calm
alright so here we are at figma calm and
I so just real quickly just to go
through this landing page it's just
gonna give you some basic overview blah
blah blah about the features but we're
gonna get into that ourselves the main
thing I wanted to look at real quick was
just the pricing area and this is one of
the most impressive things about this
because basically if you are in an
individual it's free I had to do a
search for that even though it was up
top I knew it was somewhere but yes if
you're working with a team then this is
the right plan for you I would
definitely make this more this bigger if
I was the figma team because I glossed
right over that it's kind of important
so yeah if you're a freelancer like most
people are which I don't have any claim
to back that up but if you're a
freelancer it's free and it's hundred
percent off so and then if you
working with a team of some sort you
know you can if you have up to three
projects you're fine it's free it's only
twelve bucks a month if you want a bunch
of stuff so basically you want to sign
in or sign up rather and I already did
that to make easy with a Google sign-in
and once you're there then and you
probably have to confirm your account
unless of course you're using Google I
just accidentally created that there we
go this is a completely web-based
interface and also just as in the
previous tutorial where I covered
Gravett designer they also have a
desktop version and of course that's
made possible with electron if you don't
know what that is do a search on my
channel for that but basically allows
you to create a native desktop apps for
multiple operating systems using web
technologies so basically you can kind
of just in a sense clone their existing
code base here that works in the browser
but also make it work for native
desktops and add you know special
additional functionality but I'm just
going to need to use this I the desktop
version here you could see I am in the
browser okay so let's go ahead and take
a look at this so the first I think it
start is just this new file icon up
there and as we could see I if you've
been paying attention to any of my to my
channel at all lately I've been covering
prototyping tools and it has a similar
interface you know we have our canvas in
the middle properties on the right we
have some tools I up here and then we
have a layer section down here and also
a couple other things that we'll take a
look at in a little bit but first how do
we actually start with a project or a
canvas of some sort or an artboard well
we do that right here we click on this
tool and then it shows us this stuff on
the right now I would change that
because I was kind of confused when I
first used this and mind you I've only
used this once
so it made it confusing you know okay I
had to click there to figure out where
to start all right this should be
selected by default that way you have
your templates here to get started so
I'm just gonna choose iPhone X and
notice we have our three tabs right here
design prototype because yes this is a
prototyping tool as well unlike a few of
the others that we've covered and an
also code which will provide you with
CSS code depending on which elements
you're selecting so here is our ir
artboard and again just to talk about i
which i've done in the previous
tutorials how do we move around in here
so spacebar very simple and standard you
can zoom up holding the control key
which is kind of different i'm used to
holding the Alt key but the Alt key if I
press that it allows you to go up and
down so just you know my new difference
is nothing big so I once we have this
selected again if you select anything
including the artboard you're gonna have
the all the options show up here like if
you want to change the background color
here we go in the backgrounds so section
I'm gonna leave it white but just to
look at this which is pretty much a
universal color picker for any element
we have our ability to select any type
or shade of colors and the lightness and
darkness down here we can have an output
hex its hex by default or RGB CSS HSB we
can change the opacity and there's also
a slider right here for that and then we
have a swatch section down here and we
can add new by clicking that okay so
let's go ahead and start designing a
mobile app or just a mobile version of a
web app and I'm not gonna get too
in-depth I really just you know the
purpose is just to learn this
application so I let's start off with a
rectangle and I'm just gonna maybe this
would be like the splash screen or the
very first screen let's drag this up
alright so it does have guides exactly
as you would want so if I get this there
it snaps nice and into place
alright let's let's make it a primary
a color or something like around a blue
maybe we'll turning it up just a slight
notch there we go so now with this
selected we can add this as a custom
color down here would have been nice if
they added up there was personal colors
document colors okay that's better there
we go
switch document alright so I would say
for instance we wanted to change the
actual physical shape of this rectangle
beyond just scaling it up and down the
left and right so double-clicking it
will get us into a mode from which we
can now access the anchor points so if I
just take this one hold shift go down
look at that cool what if we wanted to
add an anchor point can it do that so
let's see here sweets and notice it's
it's snapping right here in the middle
just as we would want it to so if I left
click did it add it well let's see so if
I hit escape and hit V which is kind of
the universal shortcut for a move tool
in most applications there we go it is a
part of our shape now awesome so what
about the Bend tool there we go so now
we can create a nice sort of a Bezier
curve alright so let's see if we take
multiple anchor points and move them
down just like v2 go back to the move
tool well I just created the Nike swoosh
almost all right let's uh let's bring
this back up let's play around with this
some more all right this is a quite
intuitive I have to say select this we
can get back to just the regular select
mode let me double click this and take
all these three and drop them down drag
him down rather okay that wasn't
snapping no this time so maybe I'll use
my keyboard arrow keys
okay so to get out of the mode where
you're in the anchor points you just
double click outside notice I still
didn't get that lined up correctly so
all this is just helping me to kind of
get acquainted with this with the move
tools and such looks like this one got
moved on its own there we go all right
great
all right so how about duplicating let's
see what would it take to do that select
it
control D duplicate selection very easy
as you would expect but you know you
have to do it because sometimes with
these apps certain no-brainer things are
left out so I've just duplicated and
moved up with my keyboard arrow key just
now I do I didn't see a comet that
somebody said there's no skewing tools
up here so edit object of course gives
us into that object mode the bend tool I
don't think will probably help us here
the pen tool has just have a pencil tool
yeah so I don't believe right now there
is any type of skewing but that's okay
let's take these down I don't know just
I'm just experimenting here I'm not sure
if I necessary like that maybe I'll
bring this one and hide it all right so
let's I also let's duplicate this let's
rotate it see how that works all right
as you would expect hold shift
all right so now we have this big thing
hanging up here now that's because it's
not really considered a part of this
artboard so because most of its hanging
outside of it if we drag this in here
mm-hmm all right so I know one way we
can tackle this or we can fix this we
can just take the rectangle tool make it
match the very top of the canvas select
both and this is where we can use this
section which is equivalent to like
Adobe illustrators Pathfinder where we
can do different things with multiple
selections here so we can subtract the
selection voila now we have that part up
top awesome so of course we you know we
have a pasady down here you can use your
once you have any of these select these
text fields with these numeric values
you can use your keyboard up and down
arrow keys I don't like this though but
again I wanted to demonstrate this tool
right here this is really important if
you're working with shapes and you're
creating vectors here so I'm let's see
about you know can this import SVG files
that you're using so let's say for
instance we want to use some material IO
icons so material IO icons let's type in
traffic light okay so we click this will
choose you know well let's just make it
a No we'll leave it black and then we'll
choose SVG to download it alright so
we're gonna show this in the folder this
showed up off my screen but what I'm
going to do is just I drag it on to my
desktop alright so if I move this and I
show this right here and then we go back
to our app there we go
I can we drag this in yes we can that's
awesome just like you can in Adobe XD
and I presume other apps I didn't try
that with gravity
I'm not sure but now we can notice that
this inherently is a group because we
can see it's a little drop or this
little arrow if we click it will see
that we have our vectors here already
that's how material IO icons are though
they give you a background like a
container in each one but so let's say
for instance you wanted to change this
color to the blue that we've been using
when you select it it's just gonna
select a group and it has the background
as white that's not what you you what
you want to do you can actually get to
the inner layers here by double-clicking
onto it and now we can choose our
primary color awesome alright so let's
get that centered up maybe make it a
little bit bigger shift and alt will
allow you to scale up so the I so far my
my impressions are very positive of this
app I mean it's behaving exactly as I
would hope it would behave so let's just
type in my app now this is using a de
montserrat font that I've always been
using this is they allows you to use I
think this is part of Google web fonts
so you have a ton of awesome fonts that
you can use already they're already
ready to go so the type tool of course
you have all your justifications here
you have your line height you have your
letter spacing paragraph spacing and
indentation I let's see here
for our fill let's go ahead and just use
yeah it's just completely blue ass app
right here so this is looking pretty
good so far let's increase the size keep
our up arrow key perfect my app let's
make a button so how would a button work
oh by the way let's get that out there
so we have the rectangle tool let's just
go from the very left at the very right
even though I don't want it to and the
reason I'm doing that is because it will
allow me to very easily hold the Alt key
while left click that left clicking and
dragging in and that way it's completely
centered up for me alright so does this
have the little
or border radiuses all right well let's
zoom up so control mouse wheel and there
we go we could see it right there when
you get a little bit closer so it gives
us our ability to change the radius is
very easily all right so let's say I
change this ugly gray color to I will
make this white something that really
contrasts well let's get some our button
call to action text out here so I'm just
left clicking and dragging to create a
text area so let's see we'll just call
this let's get going some type of unique
call to action text let's get this now
and again we're gonna use our swatches
here let's get this centered up there we
go nice what about drop shadows all
right so let's have a drop shadow on
here and again drop shadows are one of
those things that I you could really
screw up so only use them if you know
what you're doing you might kill kittens
so effects this is where you're gonna
access your drop downs along with inner
shadows layer burglars and black back
black around blurs no background blur
there we go
drop shadow if you want to change the
options let's zoom up a little bit let's
get the rid of this thing down there so
change options we have the blur amount
so we can change this to 0 X is 0 in Y
is 4 I kind of like that and let's just
take down the opacity a little bit like
9 percent and there we go we got a
fantastic drop shadow let's create a
secondary actually this isn't even DUP
entirely there we go all right now let's
take both of these now it would make
sense to make this a group right because
we have two different layers but if you
move the button you want the text to
move too so ctrl G gets you into a group
you can double click rename it
my button so again everything's working
as you would expect it to so control D
that's duplicated it just drop it down
and let's say maybe this this button
down here isn't as important so using
visual hierarchy through design here we
can double click on this to select this
let's get rid of the fill all right so
hide that and then we'll add a stroke
now one thing that's kind of frustrating
is because it's selected the actual
selection indicator box is kind of
hiding this one pixel stroke that's over
here so not a big deal
just make this white and then we'll make
our text white we can't see it but I
know it's there and that way it's
selected right there
we'll make this over here white as well
and then we'll just say do something
else hit escape sweet and again if you
really want to make this not that
important another way is to decrease the
the font weight so we can go to regular
awesome
okay so we'll say that's done all right
what we'll do now is let's create
another artboard so lets you know
because prototyping is a thing here i we
want to make something a page that will
show up when somebody clicks on let's
get going or to ended the actual app so
we'll take and select this artboard hit
ctrl d voila perfect as you would expect
and so now let's create just a real
quick app interface I'm not going to do
much trust me so let's take this scale
this down quite a bit
that's about 43 by 43 my app
we'll take this and scale down the size
quite a bit like graphic designer it
doesn't allow you to like left-click and
drag that would be cool if they allow
that technically I'm not sure how
difficult that would be to integrate
though alright alright so now let's add
a hamburger icon menu thing over here so
let's bring up our material IO real
quickly we'll do the same thing so it
was the same menu I mean a typical menu
right here we'll choose yep just black
again and then we'll change the color
after so we'll download that I'm gonna
drag that off-screen onto my desktop
here alright and then we'll go back to
figma drag it in there it is awesome get
this back out and once again we'll just
open this up we actually have our vector
here we'll choose our blue and we'll
change the size we could either um you
know hold shift and change the size that
way or we can change the size up here we
could choose this to constrain to
proportions
let's try 32 awesome
and you can fine-tune it of course with
your I keyboard arrow keys okay so now
let's uh I'm gonna get rid of all this
it's just um I'm gonna get rid of this
bottom button we're gonna keep this
button but I'm gonna put it off to the
side so now let's just create kind of a
container right here and let's make this
kind of like a light very light grey
Edie Edie Edie move this over here to
the center alright I think that's the
center and let's try how this see how
this app works with images or
photographs so we'll have like a
photographs kind of container down here
so let's go to images Google alright so
let's just type in traffic
alright usage rights they before use
with modification let's drag this on to
the desktop copy and replace I'll go
back to figma now let's just drag this
sucker right on to our artboard okay so
I made it quite large let's zoom out
holding control all right so I scale it
down zoom back up now notice once it
snows it's inside of this artboard it's
not going to display whatever's outside
of it which is Andy of course so let's
see about let's play with the layer
blend modes so this is really handy as
well so let's create a selection over
the entire area we can also reorder
these we can just left-click and drag it
underneath or you can right-click it and
either bring forward to front and
backward to back
so send backward we'll make it go just
one layer beneath it and then now let's
take this and over here we have this
pass through all right so now we can
change blend modes and stuff like that
so we can darken it oh by the way let's
let's get this out let's get this this
is that ugly gray color let's just make
it that blue right click send backward
there we go so now you can just play
with your blend modes if you want this
is too much contrast we want kind of
like a water mac mark that watermark
background so we can do something like
20% here that looks good all right cool
so I'm not going to really develop this
this interface anymore
because I'm just want to get to the
point where we can show the prototyping
ability I'm gonna make one more quick
adjustment and we'll say ok what happens
when the user clicks on this menu let's
show a menu all right so ctrl D we'll
duplicate it decide this is the
experience of using this app so far has
been pretty pretty fantastic
I have to say ok so let's take
everything right here
we're gonna ctrl G to group it alright
so now we have a group and we also have
I let's go down to our effects and let's
add an effect of layer blur this will
allow us to kind of simulate a blur and
that way it kind of shifts focus or
emphasis onto the menu that's going to
show up on the right hand side so it
allows you to simply change the blur
amount which is pretty cool one thing
that I would happen naturally is we
could see the edges so I'm just gonna
cheat a little bit and hold alt and
scale it out just a tad bit alright so
now let's create a container on top so
just going from very left or the very
right to about 1/3 of the way
one thing I do wish it would do is
remember the last fill color that would
be kind of handy right so yeah we'll
just leave it that color we'll do the
material icons one more quick time I
will just do or is it is there one for
clothes yes there is clothes
download the SVG couldn't made this
white because that's what I'm going to
use alright and we'll go back bring this
over here extend this alright
we're also going to make this 32 just to
keep consistent and then double click
this change the field of white alright
and then real quickly will create the a
repeating menu right here so this we're
going to introduce you in a second two
components which is a real important
topic here for figma so one thing I
could just create a selection like this
sometimes you'll find yourself it might
be easier I in this case it probably
wasn't easier but you can just duplicate
this layer hold alt that way you know
it's a hundred percent lined up in terms
of the from left to right being inside
of this container so let's just make
this maybe slightly darker okay and
that's also maybe we want to create a
more of a distinction or separation
between this background and this section
over here so we can duplicate this
control D move this over and get a
little bit closer like that make this
one even darker maybe right around there
and then now we're going to have
multiple this is kind of a just an item
or a link container so we're going to
have multiple of these and in this type
of situation you may find yourself
wanting to
to maybe make an adjustment and it would
be a pain to have to make the adjustment
for five different links correct most
certainly so we'll take both of these
layers hold shift and select them you
can see they're both selected and then
we can right click and then choose
create component or you can click up
here I believe that's the component
right here yep and now it's highlighted
in purple to let you know that it is a
component all right so let me show you
I'll show you exactly how this this ends
up working you know what before I'm
gonna back up and not do that when I was
originally testing for this I didn't
include the type the text area in the
component itself I let's see if that
actually works the way I would want it
to work so I'm gonna type in about us
and that's that's that's pretty big
you know what although for usability
purposes maybe it's a good idea to keep
it that big there we go yeah my gut
reaction is to make it smaller but I
think this works well here so let's take
all three of those and then create a
component and see how that works so
we've created the component now let's
duplicate this
alright so we just created a little bit
of separation between them and then
let's duplicate it I was take both of
these control V control C control V or
you could have controlled eat it same
thing and we'll do one more okay so now
what happens if for instance you say
okay well I want this to be this come
over a little bit more to the right
so now if I do that make sure I click on
this there we go if I make it a change
to this it's going to affect all the
rest and that is what components are
that's what they allow you to do they
cut out a lot of work if you have
elements that are repeated now what if I
make a change to this text area or this
text field yeah it will make a change to
all the rest of them which is something
that we don't want so what we could do
or what I hope we can do is right-click
and then we'll choose detach ok detach
instance would probably now make them
not a part of this component but now we
can change these about us maybe services
or something and there we go alright so
in this case you wouldn't want to create
a component out of we know what that
includes the text if you wanted unique
text alright so I think that's pretty
good we'll stop there for the design
portion now let's check out prototyping
so if we switch to the prototyping tab
we see not much changes but what we'll
do
I wish I could close this off or I'm
wondering if I can just collapse this no
I I don't think I can no oh well well
anyhow I mean normally this isn't a big
deal if you if you have a big enough
resolution right now I'm only on 1920 by
1080 for this video normally I'm on 4k
and just wouldn't be so cluttered
but anyhow I what we can do now is
select like this button and we can see
this time it has a little circular icon
a little drag er well over here we have
our destination well we can specify the
destination very similar just as in XD
or experience design by just dragging it
over and it allows you to change the
transition so the behavior is instant by
default if you just wanted to
automatically go there without any type
of animation or we can dissolve it move
it push it try push and it gives you a
preview where you can then change the
duration of the animation or the
transition between the page the
direction as well and then also easing
so it's pretty powerful pretty much
everything that you would want for page
transition animations so now on once
they're here let's make this go back
oops okay so now it's going back we'll
make this push as well except go this
way all right
and then the hamburger menu well make it
go to the this nav page we should
probably double click these and change
the titles appropriately you would want
to do that if you are working on a
serious project and then we'll make the
X go back to this page alright so now we
have all of our connections that are
visible and they're visible by default
unlike in Adobe XD which is you know ok
I think that's pretty much all that I
would want to do you know I would
probably want to make I wonder if you
can make let's see here
just take this whole thing if they click
outside of here they can also get back
there we go alright that's looking
pretty good to me so let's give it a go
alright so we'll click the present
button it automatically launches a new
browser tab by the way and let's choose
let's get going there we go we can go
back
choose our menu there and get out of
there
there we go very simple obviously but I
let's see what else do we have here we
have some other options let's see we
have our current user name we can share
the prototype I'm this show hotspot so
basically this means if I click here
it's going to show us where we can
actually click which is very handy
that's a common feature we can also
choose how to fill this this
presentation here and we can also I
viewed school full screen of course my
screen extends way beyond this viewable
area and that's that's pretty much it
for the presentation section now mind
you there's a lot of other stuff here
that I didn't really touch on but for
the most part we went through you know
you know creating a basic app covered
all the necessary elements like for it
also I will show comments you can
specifically place comments in certain
areas so let's say for instance I
designed this logo I may say I don't my
caps lock is always on I don't know I
don't know about this what do you say
all right post all right so now you it
has a little resolved button like this
is an issue I want feedback and then the
person can give feedback when you share
the prototype in the same location so
now if I go back to here you don't see a
comment but if we go back to this show
comments it'll show you wherever you're
at and you could place multiple comments
very very good stuff so this is quite a
really robust option especially for it
being free we also have a settings over
here pixel preview this is enabled I
would imagine if you're there we go
it's going to show the actual pixels
that looks terrible though so let's go
ahead and
or with the settings at there we go
turn that off all right and then you can
also export oh by the way code we have
our CSS so like for instance if we want
the CSS for this button and this is the
group though so let's click on this if
we want it just for the container and we
want the code well there we go
and that is quite handy and you don't
have to use everything maybe you'd have
some other way of creating this
container here but you want the the
aesthetics like the color and stuff just
copy that there you go and you paste it
into your code editor make sure you
check out my site course cetera comm
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
