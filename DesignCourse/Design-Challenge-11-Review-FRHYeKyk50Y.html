course calm and today we're going to do
the overview of design course design
challenge number 11 and that's designing
a custom sci fi letter R but before we
get to that as always I'm going to spam
you of course with my premium service
right here which is that design course
calm / premium and basically what I'm
about to do with these reviews here you
can just basically just inject a ton of
steroids into it in terms of a more
elaborate reviews and one-on-one design
training which is what the core of
design course premium is all about which
is the design course comment or product
one-on-one training and then I also have
vis ID which is a video course a full
video course of visual identity design
which is things like logo design
business card design basically handy
handling the creation of a full business
identity and then also wise banner which
is a photo shop banner maker action and
PSD script files that I created so I'm
going to be adding to this I a lot in
terms of additional products and
services but right now this is the three
that are there in again this is the
focal point mentor which is the one on
one training with myself so I will help
you become an awesome designer okay end
to spam here we go so I basically the
ideas design a custom sci-fi letter R
okay a capital R and make sure it's
large enough to see color selections up
to you and make sure it's the primary
element or focal point in the design and
so here's the some ideas for you know
inspiration or reference in terms of
what I was looking for so I the first
one is from Gabriel Claudia Claudia I so
when I looked at this initially I
thought it's pretty cool I for summers I
really just liked the negative space
which I in typographic terminology this
any type of negative space like the
inside of an O or the inside portion of
a pea you know the negative space that's
its formally referred to as the counter
so this would be a counter right here
and I really like it kind of reminded me
of like a message
but also because of this line extending
down it does have the sci-fi fuel I
think maybe these all these elements
outside of it were a little bit too much
I but then again we weren't really
trying to design a practical font but
just something that's sci-fi so it does
feel sci-fi in this way so yeah good
entry and I kind of probably like this
one a little bit more than these I know
these still good definitely count as
being sci-fi so yeah good n trees all
around and Bach bombing so let's see
here I it does feel overall sci-fi with
the usage of you know the background I
would imagine is kind of like a spacey
feel to it and the colors I you know the
black into the green I would say that I
into you know if this would be an actual
font I you probably want to pay
attention maybe two men able to be real
hard to recreate this through every
single letter um but like I said this
isn't just for a practical purpose but
you know I would say the way it's
designed kind of feels almost a little
bit how could I say this um a little bit
cartoony if you will so it does feel
sci-fi I'm but a little bit on a
cartoony sign it's not over all bad I
but I was kind of looking to put
specifically more yeah like hardcore
sci-fi you know just like stuff you
would see an alien movie or something
but anyhow no overall good design you
can tell it's an are good white space in
naked space so good stuff i veel oh
alright so this one oh it's not too bad
I think the I like the very simple
portrayals just so I can see you know
what the actual letter form is you can
see that we have the overlaying of the
red and blue and I that does add to it
you know the color in and of itself kind
of does add to the sci-fi kind of
high-tech feel so that's not a bad
option but I yeah this isn't too bad I
kind of like it it's it almost kind of
just feel wonky / cartoony in and of its
in with these two I you know kind of
dashes here or in dense or whatever you
want to call them I but yeah
not too bad yeah it's pretty good so I
yeah definitely I would say if I break
this on like 1 to 10 I would say maybe
like six or seven so i'll show you ones
that are kind of on the lower scale
which we do have hopefully i don't piss
anyone off at that I silverback so here
I here's one my initial thought on this
was that I instead of making like in
versing this right here to white from
red keeping it red but just adding
either up here or down here a white area
which will kind of make it so we'd still
preserve this line that way it would
kind of make it more simplistic and less
cluttered with the checker pattern
that's kind of going on here other than
that and just looking at it like it is I
think it's a pretty cool idea you know
kind of like with the whole why don't
know planet with a ring going around it
thing so yeah cool entry I so here's
another one from Mohammed I yeah overall
I like this this is definitely right up
the alley of what I was looking for um I
do think there's probably just a tad bit
too much brightness here between the
background and the letter which creates
for a little bit of a contrast at you
but not much that's kind of like I'm
really picking hairs hair I do like the
ax you know the letter form and I like
the the inner embossed type thing that's
going on here so yeah good job I really
like this one as well from je je de was
you or whatever um this is real cool it
this one kind of makes me feel like I
don't know like alien ish / you know
with the texture that's inside of the
are I really cool so you know this looks
like a space background type texture and
so that really just reinforces the idea
that it's sci-fi and plus you know it's
very simple but it's also you know right
up the alley just really feels alien in
sci-fi so that's cool good job not too
much bad to say about that at all v lo
um I mean a much better second one okay
so what was your first one
okay right there all right so no this is
not too bad I'm not sure if I would say
much better I I there's a lot of
different size and elements that are
going into this i'm just trying to
compare these two real quick yeah i
would i would say it is an improvement
just looking specifically at this one
right here I'm so yea yea it is
definitely an improvement so yeah that's
on a bad job at all phantom this one
this would be one of those wines i would
say you kind of ranks low on the whole
one to ten scale thing just because
there's nothing that's sci-fi about this
so this doesn't really feel high-tech or
sci-fi in any way shape or form i mean
it's not bad actually i mean it's it's a
good letter R but not just for this
niche though so nut tastic um so yeah
sorry about the rocket he just couldn't
like I get it I but looking at the
actual letter R um yeah i would probably
kind of like to see this negative space
here I kind of it makes it hard to see
it just because the the white duplicate
of it underneath but I would like to see
that more it's kind of hard to tell
what's going on it probably would help
reinforce the idea that you know if this
wasn't here it would make it look a
little bit more sci-fi and another one
from that tastic so this kind of falls
this is roughly the same idea Oh or
maybe not this one up here and the idea
that it's simple when just lines
crossing each other um this one's kind
of hard to tell that it's an R though
it's I mean you could tell the basic
structures there but it would be yeah I
mean if you had it alongside an actual
word like read or something or EAD you
would definitely be able to tell but in
and of itself it is kind of tough if you
didn't know already that it was an are
other than that I it does feel kind of
sci-fi and just high tech the way unique
way it's designs that's not bad alright
so Bram written alright so I wanted to
do something different definitely
different so you know the schematic
inside definitely you know that give
right away that's supposed to be
high-tech sort of feel so yeah not bad
kind of interesting i overlay in the
background here which you know i would
say does kind of go along with the color
scheme so not a bad entry and then Peter
 uh Eric I do remember that thanks
for calling me a last time this
guy his name was like Peter Falk or
something kinda like from meet the
parents or whatever um no one's ever
called me afore but since is the
only reason I haven't asked myself yet
thanks for not having any nickname
profanity filter yeah you know what when
it comes to swear words I don't really
believe in bad words like I just do not
believe that they exist in and of
themselves so this is something George
Carlin he was a huge inspiration of mine
when it comes to bad words get like he
said it words in and of themselves are
not bad it's the user it's the context
in which they're used that makes them
good or bad so I'm not gonna go on
anymore that that's a different topic
I'm trying to talk about these on here
anyhow that was funny that you renamed
you made a new post that's good oh yeah
my throat haha alright anyhow so this in
and of itself yeah you could definitely
say it's high-tech it's retro kind of um
you can tell it's an R and it's a unique
idea with the barcode so yeah I pretty
good entry galaxy 85 let's see so I'm
not too sure about this there's almost
too much going on because you have
multiple things going on here we have
the emboss which is with like a chiseled
edge and you have a bunch of flares here
you can see right here here here here
here I and then the drop shadow to and
then and the stroke seems like oh just a
tad bit too much going on here the
general shape probably not too bad I it
does feel I not sure about like a
hundred percent the direction i was
thinking about taking it are in terms of
being pure sci-fi and high-tech it has
an element of red shirt to it but it's
not bad but i think in terms of all the
effects and maybe a little bit much but
again i'm just pulling hairs here um
isaac low i think are known
try to pronounce that all right so this
one I would say kind of just yeah these
two I'm not too big of a fan of just
because they kind of feel simplistic in
and in trust me there's nothing wrong
with simple but they kind of feel just
died I don't know not put together too
well with the the lines and this the way
that it's structured we have black hair
black here and I'm a hero i'm not too
sure it just doesn't flow right in my
opinion it's kind of hard to articulate
it same thing with this you know we have
this flow here which is white and kind
of looks like a pea but then we just
have this black part that slapped on top
of it it feels separated so that would
be my gripe against that Plus even if
this was white you know this was this
black part was a part of this form and
everything was kind of designed the same
it probably wouldn't really feel to
sci-fi or retro in and of itself I would
say almost the same thing up here as
well alright so I is deep my proposition
yeah then i'd say there's the the actual
form the letter form itself there's too
many different shapes going on here to
really see an r you know up front right
away you really gotta look at it to kind
of get an idea so in that way it is
ineffective but i do appreciate the you
know the attempt to make it you know
truly you know sci-fi ish and high-tech
with these different triangles and other
shapes here Gloria alright so Gloria I
yeah you definitely must be a female
because this this feels female right
here I would say it this is probably not
a very sci-fi or high tech type of
feeling are I like the idea of it this
would probably be a real cool font I
with a little bit of work because this
you can see at the end of this this tail
portion here it ends higher than this
one over here so there's just a couple
things you could work on I like the idea
that there's a lot of reliance on
negative space but you can still tell
it's an R but the one issue is is it
does not feel like a sci-fi or high tech
are in my opinion feels more of like a
kind of like a script dish want but
either way thanks for this mission that
goes for everyone else I hope not
pissing people off with my reviews here
Alexander so yeah there's a lot of focus
on the container here is and it
definitely feels kind of like high-tech
and sci-fi ish they are inside itself
though which is what I was hoping would
be the focus I you know it does i'm not
sure if I would call it sci-fi or
high-tech it's definitely a bold sort of
our but again I think we've just got to
get confused on you know I wanted the
actual letter form itself to be the
focus instead of any type of outside
elements even though you're considering
this probably a part of the font in and
of itself but yeah good entry though in
terms of design i like everything that's
done jazzy jaz ID or 23 oh yeah you know
I think the one thing that making me say
that this could be improved is just the
the colors because the colors don't feel
sci-fi or high tech at all just in the
way you know when you have these bright
yellow and oranges and reds I but if you
were to take this and make it black it
would definitely feel more sci-fi just
because there's an absence hear of the
the counter as you would call it so yeah
the letter form itself is good i'm not
too sure this you know presenting it
like this when these colors would be too
much of a help if you take these all and
probably just make convert him to
grayscale or black and white then it
would be much better in my opinion for
the intent alright so dl 2904 I so yeah
this one you know when it comes to these
strokes used like this i'm not a fan of
them having the black with the you know
very small blue stroke that goes around
every element seems to kind of clutter
it so i would just get rid of the black
stroke here and get rid of the blue
stroke here just to show them and I I
think it would do you much better it
would feel a little bit less amateurish
in terms of presentation just by having
that stroke they're used in that manner
I having said that
assuming the strokes weren't there the
letter form itself yeah this is
definitely you know right up the alley
of what you would consider sci-fi and
high-tech see ya not a bad entry alright
so not you Boogle I let's see here okay
so he accidentally did a lowercase R no
problem I yeah so i would say probably
tone down the the background first
because it's taking away emphasis from
this because there's a lot of contrast
here especially compared to the r which
is not much contrast so what i would do
is get a black background layer at the
very bottom put this on top of it this
image right here and then take down yet
pacity till like ten percent or
something so you'd still have a
background texture you still see it but
the focal point now becomes the actual
letter form which is what we wanted
having said that i know you did a light
are lowercase one which you know in and
of itself I if again I wasn't being
distracted by everything else the letter
form itself isn't bad um but again
unfortunately we didn't get to see like
a full uppercase R so yeah no problem
there I here's another one alright so
same same comments here obviously that i
already put um yeah i definitely
wouldn't have the this orange color here
which is like a drop shadow that's
inverted upwards I wouldn't have that
because it kind of just doesn't feel
like it fits the color scheme and same
thing with this portion here you know
everything else is this blue but then we
have this color right here for some
reason which is not so um I just don't
think it fits well and it's it creates
for clutter and separation so I think if
everything was white and the whole black
round was black and we could really see
the full letter R it probably actually
would it be too bad so I think this is
just an issue with colors in contrast
alright so another one mxv design I see
ya this is very cool it so you can see
mxv his designs I there's a lot going on
in terms of the texture here but one
thing he kept consistent was how the
whole letter
form itself was being displayed and
portrayed and that's exactly what I want
so you know up here you're doing
something that's also graphical but
we're separating it and a few of the
other entries did the same thing or
separating elements with different
colors and other manners but this you
can really tell it's you know it's all
the same consistency throughout the
letter form which is good and also right
here that's good as well so I'd say this
that's that's a very good entry and then
I did a tutorial on how to design a
custom font letter R and this is my
attempt at it so you guys can watch out
if you wish I Janine I'm just going to
say Janine um alright so i would say
this almost looks like an RC or a pc
just because there's a lot of
intersecting lines I mean everything is
designed consistently and there's a flow
with it oh I see we have two different
options here um it's hard to say which
one I would go I've always do this one
just because this one it kind of looks
like a pea and then just like a C's
behind it um so coming down here
excelsis appreciate the sketch going on
but yeah there's a lot happening here I
probably get rid of this one right here
and this would be much more effective I
would say just without this over here I
think that's creating a lot of
cluttering elements over there and also
it's kind of hard to self on or any type
of design where you're mixing and
matching different sorts of shapes so
you know we have I kind of like a hard
edge over here and then these slices
coming over here and then we have like a
nice flowing round area over here it
says it's a little bit hard and it kind
of just doesn't flow right in my opinion
um but yeah thnkx for dinner Gentry
anyhow all right over here quick see
first post on his form yes one post
first and last post uh yeah this one I
would say is kind of needs definitely
need to work because we have the same
issue as in a previous one where you
know we have these hard edges we have
these you know knife slices here but
then we have these you know it's very
soft flowing lines out
here and it kind of just doesn't feel
consistent in its presentation and then
over here this little part which looks
like if you used a bed tool and just
kind of go around there and it didn't
match up quite right so I'm not a fan of
this hanging off there either so I would
say try to work on consistency in terms
of shapes and how those are being
presented so not salts right here so
again this one almost feels like the
first or second entry that we had I
definitely like this presentation of it
better because there's a little bit too
much going on here or not notting the
idea that there's too much I think the
color selection in the grading up here
it clashes too much with this there's
not much contrast up on a top portion
but this one I like this so much better
even though it's the same letter it's
the same letter for him but just keeping
it simple like this really shows it
better all right so EK night ger um yeah
this is one of the other things I was
talking about when I talked about
earlier when it comes to you know this
looks like a pea with like a shake
behind it so if you just would have you
know maybe join knees so that the letter
form itself is being consistently
applied then it would have been much
better I like the idea that you you know
did something completely different by
having a blender but even then it's
still I'm not sure I would really call
it sci-fi too much just any idea of the
shape that it kind of just seems like it
may be a regular are although I could
see the the edges here but yeah thnkx
for the entry and then we have ram rawr
rammer or whatever so we got a gift here
and so this is the first time i'm really
looking at this one now so this is very
abstract obviously did it ring keyring
on a tear drop shape you want to witness
some late night sci-fi that's tips I'm
going to open this up and hopefully you
needn't like mess with me like some type
of like porn image or something no okay
that's good
rookie race' so random I'm just looking
at this real quick interesting yeah i
mean so looking at this are in and of
itself i mean if you're just looking at
it in and up so if you didn't know what
the heck it was or if it was
accompanying no other text you would
have a hard time I looking at but you
know knowing that I know that this is an
R and especially if it were being
presented with other text like this
right here which is still kind of hard
to read I but I could definitely
appreciate you know the idea that it's
abstract so I think it is definitely an
interesting entry I like that it's very
simple and there's a lot of white space
I so yeah this is a pretty good entry
but very abstract in terms of terms of
being sci-fi in the letter form so I
other than that if i'm looking through
that i'm just looking through these
right here um loves reviewing
yeah I would probably get rid of the one
right here to coming up right there
because there's not a lot of contrast
between the red and the the mid grey
background so showing him and its many
different variations I probably say what
isn't entirely necessary um be out other
than that shown yet with these other
ones it's pretty good so this will
probably scale down while so I would say
it's pretty effective going for
something that's real abstract all right
Caesar ACR this is my humble entry yeah
I I would say yeah this doesn't really
feel too sci-fi and also there's some
inconsistencies here like you know you
have the blue on here you have the blue
line here on the inside of what's what's
called the bull which is type of graphic
terminology for the right side of a
letter like PE or B or D or whatever RB
there's there's not consistent in terms
of the negative space or the white space
in between the outer portion of the
letter so you know this minor details
like that really do affect the
presentation of design in general so for
the letter form i would try to work on
making things more consistent but also
at the same time it doesn't really feel
too sci fi e i guess he could say um so
yeah thanks for the entry though so
Devin Wade all right so last minute
upload okay we got Devon wait over here
yeah this is actually pretty interesting
are I again you know we're mixing ideas
here which isn't necessarily bad I think
I you could definitely tell it's an R
would like to see a smaller version of
this maybe I can get up Photoshop or
something and yeah here it is I paused
that real quick while loaded yeah I
actually do like this there's would be
an interesting sort of font if you were
do you know go forward and create one
alright so LG portfolio see here yeah
this one you know there's a lot of focus
in focus and emphasis on external
elements the actual letter form in
of itself there's a lot going on here I
would say almost get rid of the middle
portion right here in here and bring
this over here to the right just because
there's so much going on with the shapes
and parts of the letters I but yeah I
can appreciate everything else you did
with it so it's not bad definitely a lot
of work ones to this that's good rivers
okay this one is a tough one because and
you can see that there is an hour shape
here but almost more so than the are you
see a Z in my opinion see the Z right
here but no you got it right in terms of
thinking about sci-fi and these you know
these 45 degree angles and edges and
everything but yeah thnkx for the
entries everyone I actually there was
one more that someone else posted as
testy over here on in this one i would
say kind of feels a little bit
cartoonish too but yeah thnkx for the
entry I so I'm thinking about doing
something a lot different possibly for
the next entry or next design contest i
mean i'm not going to need to mention it
yet so hopefully in a couple days i'll
have that video for the new design
challenge submitted but it may be one
hundred percent different um and it may
flop entirely i'm thinking about having
no i'm not even going to mention it yet
but no thanks for all these entries I so
hopefully I didn't like make anyone mad
so that's not the point obviously I'm
just trying to give you my honest
feedback in opinion about these things
hopefully so that it does maybe just
help some people well hopefully helps
everyone I probably won't though but I
got people like smashing your keyboard
and say you you know but no I but yeah I
hopefully you guys continue to enter
these it's very appreciated and yeah of
course always check out design course
