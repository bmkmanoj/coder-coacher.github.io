course center com and as we can see we
have our course etro calm march stats
and i basically we have here at the top
is the month of februari which only has
28 days that's also why in march i have
the first 28 days of marks just to make
things fair and so yeah we'll start off
by comparing just these different
metrics here from google analytics so we
have sessions from 35,000 to 47,000 so
you know a good increase of about twelve
thousand of those users it was so
basically almost similar to unique
visitors we have an increase of around
9,000 pageviews an increase of around
13,000 and the pages per session and the
average session duration and it bounce
rate all were negatively impacted but
again i'm not doing anything just yet i
know in the previous two stats of videos
i mentioned okay and try to do things to
increase these or improve these numbers
i just haven't done it yet bits so busy
with other stuff but then I'm sixty-two
percent new sessions so overall very
good growth and its remaining consistent
and we'll see that here in the next
section which is labeled Google traffic
so we have google traffic right here and
this is obviously the traffic just
coming straight from google people
typing in keywords and trying to find
solutions to problems so right here at
this chart is all the way from january
first or second all the way to the 31st
of march here so we have three different
months from here here and here and so
right here this week here average around
165 visitors or sessions rather and then
over here we're averaging I've around
1500 actually this day right here was a
Monday it was just this last Monday and
it was around 16 hundred and thirty but
I think there is something strange
happening there so I chose this day
right here just yesterday which was
just about 1500 s so we can see this
growth is just continuing and some weeks
you know if you look at it and by the
way these dips here are the weekends so
people just aren't searching for you
know these type of advanced front-end
development frame or keywords that I'm
you know I'm targeting over the weekends
and I think that's pretty consistent
across most industries so your weekdays
are going to be your highest you know
visited terms and out days basically so
but we can still see their increased its
still steadily increasing so it's very
good thing coming down here a new
content for march for can we had more
content this time around i compared to
februari or any out like six articles i
believe but as we can see here starting
here at the bottom this one was from
Viv's we have this over here all the
rest are from mine or things that i
wrote and with exception just to these
three articles done here here and here
everything else is dedicated to angular
for so you know trying out the new if
else then conditionals in 804 yes we
will offer a free angular for chorus
paying the for firebase tutorial how to
install you for blah blah blah angra for
you get the point now why well that's
also because any de for just released
and this is a prime opportunity to try
to rank for these keywords which these
keywords are brand new you know no one
had an interest in searching for any
type of content based on angular for
simply because it didn't exist really
before now so I here's the great thing
about it if you go to google and type
angular for tutorial which is going to
be a pretty big keyword you can see that
this is the first organic result this is
an ad from to our site we have the
official documentation we have a gift or
for beginners this is a really massive
to our course on youtube
and then the next result is guess who
course cetera calm and also corsetry
calm so I'm ranking position third and
fourth for this keyword which is great
now it would be nice to rank for just
angular for alone but i think i may be
like page three or something either way
i'm already ranking for these keywords
which is great xml like on page three
here but I've just regular for but
that's the whole point you know you have
a brand new sort of version of a piece
of software or a script or a library or
framework starts writing content about
it obviously you want to be good in
relevant so that people will link to it
and help you rank so that's basically
what I did with this stuff so I'm going
to be continuing to pump out angular for
content for quite a while maybe in the
next at least two weeks or so until I
finish the free course that I have and
that will only serve to boost my numbers
in terms of the search engine traffic
that I'm gaining now with most of my
written tutorials here are basically all
of them I also have a video that I
upload to the youtube channel which has
around 115,000 subscribers so if I go
real quickly to youtube and type in
angular for we'll find out ok so we have
this is an ad so it doesn't really count
so we have one two three four okay so
here I am this is the corset your
YouTube channel under the name design
course that was the old name five six
here am again so I'm into the top seven
positions i believe so it's one two
three four five six extra six positions
i'm also right here and i'm also right
here so people are typing in these
keywords in youtube and i'm showing
for most most of the results which I'll
obviously helps as well so you can see
these like this this one we called has
4000 I've use this is one we go with
4700 three days old with 800 was two
weeks old with 4000 so yeah I mean
that's all I'm really doing really doing
I'm not doing anything spammy I'm just
trying to address keywords that people
are going to be searching for with
relevant content somebody got mad on my
channel on YouTube here and said that
you know I I'm targeting I'm being too
much SEO baked content i'm praying too
much of this SEO bay content here's the
thing that's marketing 101 if somebody
is typing in a keyword and they're
trying to find content based on that
keyword why not try to be that person
who's going to meet that demand so it's
economics 101 it's supply and demand so
if there's a demand for something try to
be the supplier that way you can
monetize from it so with my youtube
channel though I don't really make much
money even though I have 115 thousands
of subscribers it's not much money from
the ads alone the money comes in when I
try to sell the courses at the the
website and that leads me to another
topic is you know currently if we go to
course such a calm we'll see that the
the monetization model that I have is
just a per course fee so I have free
courses here and this one is currently
in development for angular 4 i'll be
adding another video tomorrow i believe
as a part of this series this one's free
this one's free this sounds free and
this is just drive traffic and then i
have paid courses so this one's like
twenty dollars all this is a coupon you
can use it shows right there this was 25
and then this one is nine dollars so
very shortly i'm going to be switching
to a subscription model for like 9 bucks
a month and then that way a person gets
just to pay nine dollars and get access
to
all this stuff and the goal here is to
really increase the course count and
really try to focus it on project-based
courses as opposed to not necessary
theoretical or fundamental courses but
you know just teaching people how to
learn a given framework based on
creating projects relapse road websites
etc all right so that is it I'm not sure
if we're going to have another one of
these videos in the next month I
definitely wanted to do at least the
first three months of the year which
I've done now with the conclusion of
this video but I'm definitely certain
that the website is going to keep on
growing because I have no plans of
stopping creating content and trying to
build links all right I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
