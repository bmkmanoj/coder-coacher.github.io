I'm going to be doing a review for the
ninth design course calm design
challenge and that's based around
designing a specific screen of a mobile
messaging app alright so we got a decent
amount of entries is going to be
somewhat of a lengthy review but yeah
just go ahead and if you're one of the
people who rely received a review go
ahead and just say you can fast forward
although i would suggest and recommend
if you're trying to become a better
designer try to watch all of my
critiques just so you can see what I am
suggesting based on different scenarios
alright so yeah check out design course
calm especially designed course calm /
premium and subscribe here on YouTube
all rights get started alright so I'm
going to do something a little bit
different usually before I record the
review for these design challenges I
would i check out the thread and just
kind of get an idea of what was
submitted this time I I made it a point
not to really look at the entries until
I go to actually review them right now I
don't know why I didn't decided to do
this but I I decided to do it on just to
keep things maybe a little bit unique or
different put myself on a spot maybe in
terms of critiquing alright so I see ya
about a week ago we launched this one
this is I back and forth dialog chat
occurring between two people on a mobile
interface basically a design so I'm
going to go ahead and skip to here and
so Claudia or I'll just call you Gabriel
um first entry I not too bad actually I
let me see if there's okay yes this is a
bigger version right here I yeah in
terms of design and being able to read
it and understand what's going on it
works well I i would say in terms of
alignment and i like for example the
avatar here it's a little bit bigger
than the chat box that's a small
discrepancy but ideally they would be
the same size or if one's going to be
bigger than the other it should be
a tad bit or a little bit bigger or a
little bit smaller preferably probably a
little bit but a little bit more smaller
I just because you tell here it's not as
quite as high too much height on the
actual message in terms of the other
alignment I I would say would probably
be best when you have text that is left
a line like this is this text right here
is left line in this container right
here well this should be all this
information right here should be left
aligned just underneath where it says
hello that way things will kind of flow
better because you know you have
somethings left in line then you have
some that centered and it's kind of just
throws you off a little bit so I would
left the line knees and maybe an align
these better because you have this chat
icon or this time icon here and then I
today is kind of pushed over here I
would move that up a little bit so it's
centered vertically with this icon and I
would also probably work on the check
mark a little bit more it seems a little
bit too big in my opinion so yeah aside
from that everything else you know
contrast colors everything here is
pretty good I let's go down here oh this
one is just absolutely awesome amazing
no I'm just kidding this is an entry for
myself I'm not going to critique it of
course let's see Oliver okay so let's
see what we have here ah let me copy the
image and I'm going to pause I didn't
load up Photoshop yet so the one second
all right so this is odd the layout and
everything here is pretty similar to the
previous entry I but in terms of design
what I was talking about before with the
alignment here being to the left I am
beginning with this this is what I'm
talking about it flows better this way
but I in terms of transparency though a
readability this today part should
probably stand out just a little bit
more a little bit I there's not enough
contrast with the background um the
avatars I would say almost feel a little
bit too big I would definitely be able
to tell who it is if you scale it down
more and then what that does is allow
you and fries
you up more room to put in more content
essentially which is important or ideal
at least so looking at the rest of this
I I like the the subtle gray background
with the white overlay and you're
differentiating between the messages so
that's good let's see here I would say
just a minor critique you know this
thing here you have all this white space
on this side but now it's only like cut
in half here so just kind of slightly
throws you off but that's a tiny tiny
minor thing I but yeah I pretty good so
I would say this I just a couple things
about the contrast and then the size of
the avatars so let's go ahead and
continue here all right so this is dl
2904 a Faro for and let's see what we
have okay let me pick out one here just
so I could possibly see it bigger all
right good all right so I'll just focus
on this one god this looks like
basically these are the same type of
entries just different color schemes all
right so I'm not too much a fan of the
font the font just seems too I'd say
almost like matrix like I so I would
change the font probably I would also
change so you can see the the type you
could definitely see it down here
because the background there's a lot of
contrast it's darker background white
text but up here it's way too light so
you have a readability issue on up there
so you can still have you know some type
of subtle gradient like you have it but
you want to make sure you start maybe
with this color up here and then go
darker down here so that's another thing
i would say another thing i would
definitely get rid of this thick I line
right here this divider don't really
need it I so what essentially does just
kind of clutter up the the interface a
bit so I would remove
this and I actually do like this I would
just remove all those lines and that way
it freeze things up more creates for
less clutter more simplicity i I'm not
too sure about this I it looks like a
logo that's kind of water marked in the
background close things up too much so I
would also remove that people don't care
about the logo or anything like that so
I would remove that for sure and then I
for the size of this data right here
that today it's a little bit small
probably would also left align it over
here and yet also look into possibly
using circles instead of squares for the
avatars as well but yeah not too bad at
other than that so let me switch back
here oops wrong window all right there
we go I all right so Oliver like he
meant this is a second entry yeah I
don't looks like he definitely changed
the size maybe of not maybe I'm wrong I
know odd but yeah same thing looks like
a different type of color scheme so I
just want to be certain about that yeah
it looks like it I think I do like this
better than the other one I can't really
immediately contrast them but alright so
baciami let's see here umm let me copy
this all right so let's see I kind of
like how it's different definitely
different in terms of being you know
this dark monochromatic type of color
scheme I like the I the icons here I
let's see here i would say the eye this
is just a tad bit too small if you're
reviewing out on a phone it would be
probably really hard to read I but in
terms of the avatar I like that they
thick white stroke and there's nothing
really to wrong with that my opinion
kind of works well with the color scheme
as well um ok so you're right aligning
this portion
I you could definitely read this text
I'm not too sure certain how effective
these would be on a mobile environment
to edit delete and copy being close
together I you know maybe what you could
do instead is put like a cog or
something on there somewhere or right
align it over here and push the text
over a little bit i'm not sure but just
some ideas but it does kind of clutter
it up a little bit because it you're
very for you to did this real quick we
could see i would free up some more
space a little bit but yeah I other than
that let's see here I do like it so yeah
just a couple things in terms of being
able to make it more simple and bringing
up the font size on a couple things I
see ya pretty cool yep I like it so
let's go over here alright so minifig
Steve alright got some issues here so
alright so first thing I would say that
the backgrounds just along with the this
teal sort of turquoise color just too
too much brightness too much just too
much stuff too much happening I guess
you could say so i would probably if
you're going to have like an image
background i would try to overlay it on
a darker background and take the opacity
down a lot that's a big trend right now
in web design but standing with so much
contrast and then on top of this real
bright turquoise color is just there's
too much color going on it's kind of too
hard to follow the avatars well for some
reason they look like an oval it's like
squished a little bit and pixelated a
little bit as well so try to work so
that you don't have this pixilation
occurring like right there as you can
see it's blurry so look into vector for
those sorts of things I other than that
this this the the time of ascent
information a white on this light
background there's not enough contrast
it's not enough white space beneath it
and this container so you need push it
down and left on
find a little bit over here I price a
like right around there if you wanted to
make it stand out much more with the
background I the the font size is too
big i would say for this portion for
inside and i would also you know you
have space over here you might as well
use it i would increase this size as
well because you lucky i mean you start
with your void space over here but
you're ending with all this over here
son it's unnecessary so i would just
bring that over bring down the font size
I but yeah just do those few things I
would get rid of the gradients too much
here gradients are fine but when people
start introducing bright different
colors into it becomes just a little bit
too hectic and I would work on this as
well it's like kind of just off centered
and doesn't really look too good yeah
but yeah just try to work on simplest
simplicity if you're new designer work
on trying to get your alignment your
white space etc maybe even join design
course premium I fuck sorry about that
at a recording issue so I'm going to
move on here I yeah this better the
backgrounds definitely creates for more
contrast so you can actually see what's
going on with this time I but my other
comments still apply to this though all
right mxv design alright so ok let's see
here yeah we could still see this pretty
decently I still be confusing with the
outline of the phone being the same as
the color the background I would make
this maybe even white odd just so we can
see if it's not a big deal let's focus
on the design just looking at this let's
see here I like these icons I think
maybe denoting if they were red or not
or or if they were sent it's an
interesting idea in terms of i use user
experience uh yeah actually kind of like
this i kind of want to see it bigger
though so let me all right so one thing
now I would probably either get rid of
these dashes right here because they
kind of just end right there or extend
them all away and also it becomes kind
of an issue when you look right here you
can adjust have this gray on the pink
and kind of clashes so I would either
get rid of those entirely or just extend
it all the way at least but that's a
minor gripe I actually like the size of
the avatar I like the time it's very it
stands out it's a noticeable sighs I
that would maybe even take it down a
notch in terms of maybe make it a little
bit lighter so that the focus is over
here on the actual text otherwise it
creates a little bit of a clutter issue
but not too much at all um but yeah I
like this as well you can tell you know
this is their avatar you can attach
files here and you can type your message
so yeah I like this overall good entry
alright so let's go down here rosanna
vid hellos mantri ok copy oops copy and
all right so let's see here ok pretty
simplistic design um looking at this
though let's see here ok so this must be
your avatar um not too sure if I like
how it kind of just splits with your
avatar right there one thing you could
do is add like a like this color blue a
stroke I maybe like four or five pixels
stroke around it that way you know the
Avatar photograph isn't just contrasting
with this color right here not too big
of a deal right here though this looks
like it was just kind of quickly created
it's like a skewed a little bit
that's just kind of throw me off a
little bit I'm let's see what else ah
let's see here now this isn't too bad it
is it does throw me off a little bit
that this has a container and there's
does not um but I'm not going to say
that's too too bad I think there is an
issue with the alignment though in the
white space you know this one this text
over here starts this far from the
border and this one's like this and it
kind of just makes it flow make the
flood it makes the flow kind of just
seemed wrong I think pushing this over
here to the right just a little bit um
would help if I get this color I think
this is a black eye that way it looks it
this looks better in my opinion just
moving it over giving a little room away
from the side of the phone I better than
that this is simple that looks like it's
simple that send button yeah I mean
terms of simplicity and contrast not
works out where you pull up pretty well
so that's not a bad entry all right
Alexander all right so all right so
let's check this out okay so let's see
here over here these icons you know
there's no reason probably to just put
one right here and then one right here
you have enough room otherwise you're
kind of vertically creating a little bit
of clutter but that's not typical deal
I'm coming down here let's see I
probably like a little bit more I white
space between the text and the outer
container and I would also definitely
consider you know why not just extend it
all the way across that way you can get
more text in in to visit in the viewable
portion so yeah I would add more white
space here increase this size maybe even
not pull this away from the edge a
little bit as well so
well maybe whitespace about from here to
there and I would also stick with the
same type of fun if you're using serif
stick with sarahfey if you're using
sans-serif stick with sans-serif yours
in serif font for the time and it just
kind of clashes with the type which is
serif Oh up here so I would stick with
sans-serif right here maybe move it down
just a tad bit um it may be slightly
take down the contrast just a little bit
and let's see here and also this I this
this watermark sort of design I mean if
the user can specify that like as
options or whatever for the program okay
but otherwise I would just take it off
completely like if you are if I were
designing an app for a client I wouldn't
include this just because it's too I
guess you could say you know this is
something that's like you would only
want the user to ever be able to do and
by default that would be turned off just
because some people might not like that
sort of thing or whatever it is but yeah
other than that's pretty good designed
contrast is working well things are laid
out pretty in and it pretty easy to read
fashion so yeah not bad let's see here
alright so okay we got another one okay
I think this is just the same one
without being perspective alright
another one from Oliver I let's see okay
we'll take a look at this one right here
I like the fact that is a little bit
different um-hmm yeah i would probably
scale down the size of the avatars just
a little bit maybe increase the size of
the font and also allow it give it some
you know for this one well let's see
yeah I mean it would have been nice if
you include like a longer sort of text
maybe they hit enter on here but I if it
was like a longer sentence or a
paragraph it should be coming out to
around here like this width
but I maybe didn't intend for that um
I'm not sure if I really like the the
date area right to the right kind of
throws things off if you took that away
immediately would be fine but um mm-hmm
maybe it's not too bad maybe I would if
you're going to leave it there i'll grab
this hue make it slightly lighter I mean
still still so that you can read it and
then also make this white as well so
that way this isn't competing these two
things I but yeah overall not bad all
right so John Doe I have no clue one I
should not try to pronounce these things
all right I'll go here to photoshop all
right so let's see here what do we have
all right so if you're going to use a
photograph watermark like this I like
that it's blurred I would probably even
just decrease the scale are the contrast
a little bit or take the opacity down
that way there's die it doesn't clash
with like the date and all this and the
the white containers I so I would just
probably just take those and scale that
down that' pacity in terms of everything
else I think I like it in terms of I
this being right aligned verse these
being left line I pride just take these
and take these ones right here and left
the line those under here that way
there's not a lot of clutter going in
between each of these I cool that you
added a photo here just for a preview
other than that I like it so it's pretty
good yeah just a couple adjustments I
think it would be pretty solid alright
switch back all right KITT so 78 all
right looking at this I would say not
too bad i would probably yeah definitely
scale down the size of the john or the
name if that's even needed it's probably
well it's probably not needed you know
what you normally do is you already have
the name appear so you know you're
talking to because this is permanent
fixture and then you have their avatar
so I would get rid of the you and the
John things you already know what you
look like unless you're on a lot of
drugs or something you know who you are
but I don't know but yeah I would get
rid of the the names and other than that
I there's good there's pretty good
contrast here I'm not so sure certain
about this bright green against this
light gray maybe experiment with this
green color a little bit and maybe use
this color up here and that way there's
a little bit more contrast other than
that though yeah maybe I yeah that seems
fine maybe just a little bit more white
space and thickness between the
container and the text but yeah other
than that it's simple there's decent
contrast pretty good alright so we have
another one from him a slight change you
just add like the dates and stuff which
is fine but my comm is still I think I
still think it would be pretty solid a
little bit more solid you got rid of the
John you John you thing and then also
this one I almost like well yeah I would
scale the today part may be down just at
a bit but now that's not too too much of
a gripe Yale ibex all right so let's see
here we got some interesting things
happening with this all right so i would
probably definitely say not probably um
let's see here yeah this thing right
here this design I know trying to be
artistic or some but there doesn't
really serve much function or much
purpose to have this in there so I would
right away just get rid of that in terms
of like you know modern design trends
and simplicity and minimalism that it
doesn't really help I the the purpose of
the design at all like that has no
purpose really so I would get rid of
that I would also i definitely add more
white space between this text in the
containing element I I and I would get
rid of this line because that's creating
some more clutter you don't
that and the today bit I you could
possibly get away with putting on it in
there um if we got rid of this moved it
up got rid of the right lot the white
line and this stuff as well so I would
just say it's a little bit too much
happening for this to be you know an
effective modern sort of design so you
just keep on following long as I go
through these just to get an idea of
what you know looks pretty effective and
what doesn't so all right let's continue
on we got a lot of submissions here this
is taking a long time and Wow all right
so a mill submitted this one and you
know what I this is pretty good thinking
the size the avatar is slightly too big
I'm saying that like to everybody for
some reason maybe it's just me but I
think probably get away with scaling it
down a little bit more um I like this
stuff in here the text that is I image
preview um this is I think the time is
maybe just a little bit too small but I
not too bad and yeah those are my only
gripes that I would have to say for this
design otherwise a solid entry alright
so rezvani vid alright so okay let's see
what's going on here alright so the
alright this time they got the icon or
the avatar a pretty decent size I I
would say that the they type though is a
little bit too big I would just scale it
down just a tad bit and then when it
comes to the separators but almost like
to see those go all the way across if
possible or extend all the way to the
left arm but these are just minor grapes
here and I think if you integrated those
couple changes it would probably be a
pretty ideal design for what you're
going
or so pretty good entry all rights woz
Java George Eve door whatever um let's
see here all right we'll take a look at
these ones alright so the background
it's fine to have like a very subtle
type of background like this although
the the whores these strokes around this
area and then the vertical lines going
between these kind of makes it a little
bit confusing and hard to follow so I
would get rid of the vertical lines over
here and here and that will minimize the
clutter and be able to focus on you know
these what's being said a little bit
more I would also consider adding more
white space between the text and the
containing element here because
everything's squashed in there in this
way you want to try to really get some
by room to breathe essentially which is
a tenant of modern design other than
that it's not too bad it I think if you
just made a few adjustments may be
slightly increase the font size a little
bit I open things up they would become
pretty effective all right so ill aha
all right so let's see here okay let me
copy this see if it's a bigger yeah okay
all right so I yeah the fact that
there's no text in here it's a little
bit well I wish Everest aksam but I just
to illustrate the dead the general
design the colors and the layout this is
effective I my opinion so I like a nice
flat design nice flat icons outlined I
that I do is not really too much that I
can gripe about this I actually like
this so good entry i would say good
stuff all right Oliver let's see here I
just want to see if there's any more
okay we'll focus on this one I yeah
maybe scale down the font they're the
size of the Avatar just a little
bit I see this light this green with
this type of I gray I would probably
work on trying to make one stand out
more so than the other because right now
like they're on the same in terms of
brightness they're the same the I guess
you could say the same i sort of
wavelength i guess you could say and so
it kind of creates for a little bit of
contrast issue you don't see much
contrast between them I would increase
the size at the time right here and they
icon a little bit and maybe even this
text maybe just by a tab that though
other than that though why not really
certain what's happening right here
though seems like that I a little bit
overboard on the the dots so it's a
little bit confusing on exactly what's
happening here what that's supposed to
mean maybe just stick to like three or
four but yeah I mean other than this and
you look at it it looks like you know
the layout wise your I white space I
things have a room to breathe you have
good I white space printing the text and
the containing element so yeah this just
a couple changes and we become a lot
more salt in my opinion and then I
brahim or something like that I guess
you could say we'll let's see here ah
it's definitely an interesting color
scheme what one thing that's good about
it is I you definitely the contrast
works well and the colors actually do
fit together pretty good I the size in
the location of the date it's too
crammed up against the containing
element it's too small as well so I
would try to give it a little bit more
room away maybe move this over I mean
you scale up the size of the font in
terms of the text doesn't seem too bad
it's a little bit difficult to read at
this angle with a perspective but that's
not too bad not too much of a big deal
so yeah
over here and here yeah pretty solid I
would say this maybe just make this
white kind of clashes with this yellow
right here so this I would make white I
but yeah I would say aside from that
just a couple things that would become
pretty solid in my opinion alright let's
see we have here oh my god we got a lot
more oh I'm gonna have to start like
splitting is up into multiple days
alright so over here I from Tobias I
think seemed a little bit too crammed in
my opinion maybe the font size a little
bit too small I the size of the face
here let's see all right number one
hundred percent I let's say yeah in
terms of it being minimal i would i
would if you really wanted to be minimal
as you stated minimal glass tile i would
get rid of this vertical line because
you don't need that i would probably get
rid of or extend this further to the
right and this further to the left I the
size that needs price scaled up just a
little bit for that I mean for the time
yeah but aside from that not too bad
probably to see a little bit more white
space between the text and this
containing element and the avatar just
to give you know a little bit more space
and a little bit more room for things to
breathe so not too bad of the mattress
again these are all small changes a lot
of these i couldn't could have to make a
big difference no slin alright so let's
check this out alright so this one's
does it well in terms of having room to
breathe the elements are spaced out well
which you can see here this really
illustrates you know how easy it is to
decipher who's saying what and to be
able to read things one thing that I'm
not too much of a fan of is the
background it seems like it could be
it needs to be a little bit darker for
my liking for the background just a tad
bit though not too much I I think like
with the this blue and this fourth right
here I it there's not enough contrast so
I would just try to make a little bit
darker that way the messages stick out
other than that I like it so good entry
alright so I can't read this at the
moment I can i'm just going to browse
through this real quick bae yeah alright
so we have some issues here oh we got an
animated gif hahaha that's cool and
worked on this Wow well right off the
bat I can tell you that there's some
things that could definitely be changed
I almost and reminds me of like old
school like IRC I think I know why I the
I let me see if I can print screen that
all right so that way i can focus just
on this screen here I so the outlines
like the block outlines a square the
rectangular outlines I say those could
go that's kind of like an older style of
design you could just get rid of those
completely because we already know who's
saying what you have the avatar and you
have the text right next to it that's
all you need so you don't need this
containing element I like I said that's
more like in the early 2000s late 90s
type of design style and i know that
because i was designing back then so so
i get to get rid of this it'll free you
up more space as well because you know
when you create like a container like
this that means you have to push things
inside of it and then you room you lose
space for these for content essentially
so I yeah get rid of that and it become
less lining and it also become more
simplistic simplistic I also the the
alignment of this I'm not too much of a
fan of it looks like it works like when
it works right when it's just one line
like this and center in here but
then when you have multiple it just
feels like it's just push down and not
align correctly with the avatar so I
would push this up to the top of where
the avatar begins and I let's see we're
going to go back here real quick wow I
like this view this is put a lot of work
in this I appreciate that I let me see
here so here's a better view of it yeah
in terms of it really being able to fit
in a lot of stuff you know I think
that's pretty cool I in like a set of it
reminds me of IRC because IRC is not
formatted like this so yeah it's
definitely kind of like a niche sort of
maybe chat app not for everybody but as
you can see you can fit a lot in there
but it seems like it might be almost a
little bit too small for most people the
font size I but yeah I like the idea of
it and it's definitely one of the most
unique entries so I don't have too much
to say too much negative to say about
that I and then this one is just reading
this up here yeah that's cool to a
design like a slide-out nav but yeah I
like the idea of illustrating this and
it seems like it's pretty effective and
how you would do that Rutger all right
so okay so you know it's okay to have
maybe like this interesting sort of drop
shadow here but when you have it on
these elements to it becomes too much
like it becomes a little bit too much
clutter so i would probably
I would personally take these I I would
get rid of this stroke right here you
can see there's like a two or three
pixel stroke of this color looks like I
would get rid of that and you could
still leave this this sort of drop
shadow on it and I only say that because
it's a strong drop shadow it's not like
a soft edge because you do the soft
edges it's just that's way too old
school but this could work and I would
also get rid of it I'll get rid of the
drop shadow though on this you don't
need you wouldn't need on this because
this is just starting to clutter things
up a bit too much becoming too much
other than that I ought to work maybe
with this background you know this is
one of those things that's popular right
now but I would say you know it seems
like there's too much color in it and so
it's creating contrast issue especially
with this color in this font color so
it's create a contrast issue I would
work on trying to possibly desaturate it
or try to get it into one type of color
I'm using luminosity and then maybe
either lightning it or brighten it so it
doesn't create a contrast issue with
this text other than that I probably
extend this all the way and not make it
so it's it's own container if you know
what I mean that way free up more space
but yeah other than that not too bad
alright so a mill pets frandsen alright
so let's see here alright so one issue
is you lose a lot of space a vertical
space screen real estate when you have a
big avatar image like this up here so I
would left the lioness I would scale
down the Avatar size i would put the
name to the right of it and that way you
have you've moved this up to probably
around here and now we have more space
to be able to actually read text but
that's important in terms of usability
and then maybe increase the font size
and I you know here is the picture you
wanted you could probably extend this
all the way we could see the whole thing
you know and that's important as well
for trying to get as much as in as you
can while also not being you know too
cluttered in a sense I although maybe
not all the way cuz I understand if you
do do it all the way I might become hard
to see you know who's saying what so
maybe just extend a little bit out
further maybe not all the way but yeah
other than that just increase the font
size i would say move this up here and
it becomes a little bit more effective
alright and that is it I have to fix
that it says we're not page to what we
are but yeah so what that was really
long and hopefully I didn't just screw
up the audio there I but yeah so I yeah
overall good entries here I oh wait did
somebody else oh I have to delete that
thread alright but yeah I I like what
people have been doing this person just
kind of resubmitted one I but yeah I've
been going I design course premiums been
launched for a few weeks now and a
premium of course let me log out I is
the premium subscription service that I
launched that has a couple different
products the main one being one-on-one
design training with me so these these
weekly design course design challenges
I'm doing I where I spend maybe like a
minute on each one well I'm spending a
lot more time individually with you guys
in order to make you better designers
and I so definitely consider that you
know if I really fight if I critique
your design and you're still feeling not
confident about you know not being on
make good design please consider joining
the design course premium it's something
that you could just stay one month if
you wanted to and you can I quit anytime
and just in that one month if you enter
these design submissions these projects
get really really help your ability
design as it has helped some other
people already alright i'm gary same
design course com I'm moon by
