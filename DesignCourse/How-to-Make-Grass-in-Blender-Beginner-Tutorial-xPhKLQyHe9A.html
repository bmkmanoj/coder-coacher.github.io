today we're going to go into blender and
we're gonna make grass okay so it's
actually pretty easy with the particle
simulator and if you've never used
blender before this is a good beginner
video I said we're going to be doing
anything too crazy and yeah the end
result looks pretty good as you saw all
right so let's go ahead and get started
all right so if you've never used
blender before to select objects you
right-click to move around to viewport
you hold your middle or third mouse
button and just hold it down and move
your mouse to zoom up you use your
scroll wheel to pan you hold shift and
that middle or third mouse button
alright very simple that's all I'm going
to cover in terms of introductions to
the application so as with file new and
reload startup file and you can apply
grass-type to any type of mesh object
like this cube if you wanted to but
we're just gonna hit delete and then
enter on the keyboard and then hit shift
a mesh and UV sphere segments 32 rings
16 alright so what we want to do is add
what's called a subdivision surface so
we're gonna click on this little wrench
that's our modifiers and so we click on
add modifier and then select subdivision
surface and the view is what we're
looking at right now render is when you
go to like officially render it so I'm
gonna turn this up to 4 and that's
actually quite high I'm also gonna
change
shading to smooth over there and then
hit apply and switch to edit mode so
we're in object mode object allows you
to take this object as a whole
moving around rotate scale etc if you
switch to edit mode and you could do
that with your tab key we're able to
manipulate the individual vertices faces
or edges we're in virtus select mode by
default it selects everything if you
right-click you can select individual
ones and you can do all sorts of things
with them same thing with edge just like
the individual edges and then faces are
these tiny little faces down here
alright so we're going to switch back to
virtus and vertex mode and hit a that
loyal toggle between select all and
select none so kind of a handy thing to
know and I also
to turn this option on here limit
selection to visible by default it's
turned off and I'll just show you what
happens when it's turned off if I hit a
to deselect all hit ctrl or command a
Mac and then left-click and drag like a
heart shape real quick you'll see that
it doesn't select anything be fine
behind it it's only the visible vs. I'm
gonna edit undo that ctrl Z and then I'm
going to turn this on you'll see real
quick what happens it now selects
everything behind it alright so make
sure that's on or clicked or checked on
bit rather and I'm gonna draw a real
quick
heart shape I'm gonna start like right
around here just inside of it and hold
ctrl left click making a heart shape
something like that if you want to make
another adjustment you can hit ctrl and
I'm gonna kind of smooth this area out a
little bit and then you can just add to
that selection so now we have kind of
like two hearts alright so what I want
to do now is basically separate them
separate this and make it into its own
object so hit P on your keyboard select
selection so now if we go back into
object mode a new tab we could select
each of these individually I want to
right click this to select the hearts to
shape only and hit delete and enter so
now we've deleted that and now we can go
ahead and add our if we right click on
it add the particle system so you're
gonna have to left-click and drag this
out to the left just so you can see this
little tab over here and we want to
choose up here from a blender render to
cycles render hit new alright so the
type we have to change from emitter to
hair so you see all these crazy lines
here like we want to make 0 and the
number we want to make very high so
200,000 hit enter it's gonna make your
computer a little bit slow or quite a
bit slow depending on the specs and real
quickly I just wanted to preface this I
I got most of what I'm gonna be showing
you
I from this tutorial on deviantART from
this guy Durge Rotter so I just wanted
to make sure I give credit where
credit's do about making glass and
cycles I and so I'll be doing most of
what we're going to be doing this up up
until this point but you'll see so what
we want to do now and a lot of this is
just experimenting with what it looks
like and if you want to see what it
looks like you could change the rendered
mode right here and I the adjustments
you make over here will be displayed
over here so what we want to do is
change also because right now we don't
see any because I changed the hair like
the zero but if you also choose advanced
real quickly you'll see down here
something called random now if I change
random real quickly one second I'm
looking off screen for my settings I did
previously and we change it to 0.01
we'll start to see the grass basically
alright I want to come down here also
and you have the hair settings right
here thickness there's the root that
means like where it begins is that one I
just want to change that to half so 0.5
the tip is 0 so it tapers off to 0 and
everything else can be left the same
here alright and now what I want to do
is we want to create the material for
this real quick alright so I'm going to
change a couple of their settings before
I do that so I'm going to come over here
to the real tab and I'm going to choose
use nodes and then the color make it a
gradient texture and then change linear
to quadratic sphere all right and I'm
gonna switch back to solid mode and a
zoom out I'm gonna click up here hit
shift a lamp and a son all right so the
Sun we can adjust those settings I'm
gonna make the strength go from 1 to 5
and I'm gonna make it like kinda high
like a yellowish tint out here
all right so if we go back to rendered
we'll see what this looks like all right
so now let's go ahead and add the actual
material so right click to select it and
we'll come over here to the material
section hit new and I'm gonna left click
and drag this down I'm gonna change this
view over here to the node editor this
up here we can specify and leave at
rendered that way we can see the changes
we make down here take place up there
all right so I'm going to zoom up here
quite a bit and I'm gonna delete this
node layer so just left-click it delete
and it looks like this got deleted but
it didn't there's just no material on it
so what we want to do I'm going to be
using again that that a lot of that the
node structure from that tutorial that I
showed I so what we're going to do is
add a mix shader shift a shader mix
shader and put it right around there and
connect it to the surface you know how
to zoom out just a little bit and again
the way you manipulate or move around
here is just the same as in the 3d view
let's just hold shift and your middle
mouse button a third button and so now
what we want to do is also add a glossy
shader so shader and then glossy connect
this to the bottom change the color here
real quick to kind of like a light
yellow alright and then up here shift 8
we're going to another mix shader'
connect this to the bottom one and then
we want to add a diffuse shader shift a
and select diffuse select or connect
this one to the top shader right there
and also add a translucent translucent
shader add that to the bottom we're
going to add what's called a layer
weight shift a and it's around here
somewhere I'm always not fine there we
go input layer weight add the facing
this one right here to the FAC value
here changes to zero point four then we
want to add a mix RGB so we go to shift
a color mix RGB connect it to the color
portion of the diffuse make the first
top color right here a just basically a
grass color and the bottom could be I'm
going to choose like a darker green
alright and then we want to duplicate
this one so shift d add that to the
color of the translucent right there
alright so now it's quite green and
grassy looking I and that is it for the
node structure I know there's a little
bit confusing but a lot of this is all
about experimenting in what that guy had
in his tutorial worked out pretty well
so I'm going to go back to this section
because right now you can kind of see if
we zoom up here the portion underneath
it or the actual sphere I think we
didn't experiment with that by changing
the thickness by 0.02 we'll see what
that does
so now you can't really see it beneath
it so much all right so there's kind of
getting this view to look a little bit
different
alright now I'm going to get rid of this
window just going to right-click in this
center portion hit join area
and then you could join either this up
there or the 3d view down here just
left-click alright and let's go to
render settings and if you have a
graphics card a GPU you could choose GPU
compute if you've never set that and it
makes it go much faster by the way if
you've never set that before or worked
with that you can go to file user
preferences system tab and then down
here usually by default it's at none if
you choose CUDA you can see your
graphics card I up to these GeForce GTX
cards and then this will show up over
here come down here sampling usually one
of the biggest questions a beginner to
blender or is it'll look a little bit
grainy the render bus because there's
only set at 10 samples so the preview is
what we're looking at now because we
haven't actually clicked render up here
the preview you know maybe changes to
200 and it'll take a little longer and
up here it's showing you how many
samples it's going through I next you
can see it already looks a lot better I
just about finished the render you can
change up something even higher thousand
or whatever so I just want to zoom in
with this and see if there's anything
else that I can kind of change I think
these are these these blades grass or
way too thick looking so I'm gonna come
back alright so I paused that and
experimented with it a little bit and
what I did was change this back down to
0.01 for the scaling because they were a
little bit too thick at the base and
then it came up here for random and I
changed that from 0.01 to 0.02 and this
is the result which I think looks quite
a bit better and so when it comes to the
lighting and stuff I you can you can of
course experiment with adding different
light sources so ok so I pause for a
little bit just to experiment with
different lighting setups and basically
let me switch over here to solid to show
what the lighting looks like I added
you could a shift a and add a lamp point
I added three of those basically one I
put over here
four right click it you can see these
settings I changed the color here to
like this darker green the strength I
left it a hundred I same thing over here
I just basically hit shift D to
duplicate it and moved it over there and
then there's also one inside of here
which is this one point zero zero two
it's inside of it just to illuminate the
center portion of this just a little bit
and I made it a dark green I also
changed the Sun settings so it's like
this color right here and then also the
strength I took down from five to one
and so that gives us this color right
here or this render I guess you could
say but yeah you cannot experiment
however you wish and that is this
tutorial so you can see it's very easy
actually to add grass so exciting stuff
all right check out design course comm
if you have oh you know what I probably
should show you real quick just about
how to render if you've never rendered
anything render resolution by default
set of 1920 by 1080 you change yours to
whatever you want I'm gonna change mine
to 1280 by 720 because that's the size
of my video recording this percentage
right here simply means I I'm sorry I'm
swallowing spit this size you know so if
is that it by default to 50% it would
only do 50% of 1280 and 50% of 720 so
just leave it all the way to 100 and
then also down here if you are using GPU
compute and click on conformant
performance and change the XY tiles to
256 by 256 and then also your the only
other thing you really have to worry
about for this would be the sample
settings and I have my render at
thousand which should be more than
enough for this particular render and
that's it so then you just hit render
actually not to make this a little bit
quicker I'm just going to make mine 500
all right and then I'm gonna hit render
and because this will take some time I'm
gonna pause this and then come back
oh wait stupid me let me cancel that
real quick hit escape I forgot to set up
the actual camera right now we're just
kind of looking through whatever view we
have but there is a camera view if you
hit zero on the number pad it'll show
you what the camera is gonna render so
if I hit n as a nose click on lock here
into view and again to get out of there
we can move around based on what we want
to render and so I'm gonna choose right
around and never to run there and now we
hit render it's gonna render exactly
what that looked like so now I will
pause alright and that's the render at
500 samples I probably took about a
minute and a half or two on my computer
I don't like it though because of this
thing hanging down doesn't really look
correct but you get the idea you can
adjust this the eye the scene however
you wish but yeah that is it check out
design course comm if you haven't yet
and subscribe here on YouTube alright
good bye
