letter and design course calm and today
we're going to be looking at layer
styles let's go and click on file new
with 800 height 500 resolution 72 pixels
per inch said okay zoom up to a hundred
percent and to illustrate today's point
about I layer styles and what they are
and how to use them I'm just going to
create kind of like a website menu panel
so I with the rounded rectangle tool
selected I'm going to leave radius at 10
and just this blue color selected right
here for the foreground I'm just going
to drag out kind of like a vertical
column menu here alright so I'm going to
just create some fake links inside of it
with the type tool and choose white for
the foreground color let's give a
heading like I let me think here
navigation now let's use our I move tool
ctrl T and will hold shift and scale
that down a little bit we'll use the I
move tool hit apply then underneath it
with just standard Ariel will use i will
type in some just fake links right now
let's see here let's change the font
size here to say 14 all right link one
link to and if this is happening to you
which it probably isn't because I mess
with it before and the character I
handle over here for the line height
we're just going to put auto that will
fix that all right another link another
link here you get the point all right
okay so let's just say for example this
is our I our menu we're designing for
our website I want to space these out a
little bit further with 24 look like
okay that's better alright so obviously
I this I this panel may or may not look
good with whatever our entire website
looks like so let's just say a dozen and
it would make sense to try to add some
layer styles to it so this is the first
shape layer that we created which is
this blue area right here I if we
double-click on the right hand side of
the layer we get the layer style option
of our window we can see that there's a
ton of different styles down here that
we can use so really it's just a matter
of experimenting so if we choose stroke
gives us three pixel stroke by default
it's black around the entire shape so
let's just make this one you know
obviously we have a ton of different
options i'm not going to go over every
option for every style here i but i'm
just going to use them in a way that
could make sense for this particular
design that we're working on so we can
change the position of the stroke to
either inside or outside by default its
outside we're going to leave that there
and change the color to white which is
the same color the background so okay
now let's choose drop shadow we can see
that white area now because the drop
shadow I we've applied so let's choose
blend low normal I'm
let's choose size we're going to go all
the way down to zero but the distance
we're going to increase the angle we're
going to change a little bit as well and
then you pacity we can change like rural
down to just two we can barely even see
it so that kind of creates a cool effect
you can also add a gradient overlay and
we have a style option here where we can
change it to radial if we want or angle
I are reflected shoes reflected and hit
gradient and this gives us the gradient
editor in which we can edit the gradient
if I select this right here which is our
current foreground and background and
double click on this picker here for a
white option as you can see we can I
kind of just mess around with the
gradient here and this option although I
may want to reverse these let's take
these over here and maybe just mess
around with this a little bit more hit
OK head okay we could even add a little
bit more here if we wanted to say for
example the inner shadow we see this it
doesn't look good by default so let's I
mess around with the options here like
normal for angle we're going to go
straight to ninety percent or 90 degrees
i mean it's change the size 20 distance
are going to do increase and then for
the color we can choose this dark area
right here and that kind of creates a
background for the actual navigation
title it okay and then i do we want to
add anything else well not sure if we do
i also one thing when it says use a
global light that affected our gradient
where am i right here right here okay
ah choose 90 again I met my drop shadow
there we go now it's fixed alright hit
okay alright so as you can see I for
this back panel right here we have no
additional layers everything is applied
in the effects area we can drop that and
expand it which makes it easy to work
with or hide specific ones on the whole
point of this is to achieve any type of
effect that you want and try to achieve
it on the actual layer through layer
Styles if possible otherwise you're
going to be working with a lot of
different layers to create the same
effect which isn't good for organization
purposes and one thing to note though
however say for example for some reason
we want to scale this up or scale it
down I let's hold shift and select all
three layers hit ctrl T now if we scale
this down hold shift and then hit the
apply we could see that it kind of
screws everything up because the actual
layer effects they don't scale as well
so it control Z that's one thing to take
into consideration when you're working
with layer styles we could scale it down
like this of course and then go ahead
and re-edit all the distances and such I
of like the background for example in
the gradient I and the inner shadow as
well but that's just something to note
and that is basically it when it comes
to layer styles I of course is something
that you really need to tamper around
with an experiment with but as I always
like to say simple is usually better so
just because every layer you create you
have these options um doesn't mean you
should use them I we can even apply
layer styles all the same layer styles
to these text layers as well we can give
them drop shadows that you can see
which looks really bad but new designers
love putting them for some reason we can
add strokes etc etc etc in the end
though it's all about making something
that looks good so you don't want to use
things just because you can but that is
it I name's Gary Simon check out these I
in course calm if you haven't already
and I will talk to you later goodbye
wait
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
