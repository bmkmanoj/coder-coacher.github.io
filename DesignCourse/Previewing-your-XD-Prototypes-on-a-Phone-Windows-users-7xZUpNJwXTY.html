comm today I have a quick tip that's
going to make your life just a little
bit easier if you're a Windows user
using the Adobe XD preview now
unfortunately because it's still an
early stage there's not a lot of
functionality with it and if you want to
preview your designs or your prototypes
while you're designing them on your
mobile phone well you really can't do
that without some extra work essentially
so right now if you plug in your phone
and you try to design and you try to
preview it with the Adobe XD app it
won't work so unfortunately you have to
upload your XD file and then you'll be
able to preview it and even that's not
very straightforward so I'm just going
to show you how to do that real quick
but first I'll show you on my own phone
the design that we did in the previous
tutorial just to show you how that works
all right so let's say for example you
have your document here in XD open and
you know the prototype works when you
hit play all that exciting stuff let's
click on that yada yada yada and now you
want to preview it on your phone well
what do you do you press this button
right here well this is coming soon
unfortunately now maybe it's over here I
thought no export that's not going to
work
save as that's not going to work so what
do you do well I found out that you have
to visit the Creative Cloud app the
desktop desktop app and in here we have
a little section called
assets well we click open folder this is
where you place your XD files right here
and voila so essentially when you open
up the Adobe XD prototyping app on your
phone when you go to my assets it's
going to show whatever is inside here so
once you place or save this as right
here say for example you you know where
this folder is copy that come over here
save as paste it in that directory save
it and then you're going to be good to
go alright so if you just came here to
this video to learn how you know to
preview it on the current XD beta for
Windows you can probably leave now but I
wanted to show something real quick just
because this video so damn short
something I've been working on and it's
based on a course I'm going to be
releasing very shortly so this is a
preview here using ionic serve and this
is an app that I've created and I'm
going to show all of you guys how to
both design and code so what this is is
a movie searching app specifically for a
genre in the horror genre and right now
it's listing out all the movies only in
2017 that are based on the genre so dole
point of the course is going to show you
how to hook into an API and also create
customizations in terms of filters base
on that API I also have a lot of other
things going on here so if I scroll down
by default I think it's showing around
20 but I also have worked in infinite
scroll so if we go down here we just
click on one of these random things here
we'll see it gives you a more detailed
page about what's happening or you know
about the specific movie itself I so if
like just click right here for instance
we have a popularity bubble by this play
thing right here will not work on the
browser because it's using a Cordova
native plugin for YouTube so if you just
click it it plays a first trailer that's
associated with the video and yeah so
I'm pretty excited about this course so
yeah I'm going to be showing everything
like how to design this in Adobe
Illustrator how to export it properly
how to include it in your ultimate
project so that shows up on the phone as
denied launcher and also using Adobe XD
as well to design these two primary
screen so you know listing this stuff
out here and also this stuff out here
you can also see animations that are
worked in here which look a lot better
on a phone as opposed to just a preview
here but yeah look out for that within
the next week maybe I already have this
icon design part done and so yeah that's
why I've been I kind of just slightly
absent and this is also why I have such
a very short video for you today I have
been killing myself trying to get it
ready alright so hopefully that was
helpful I've been working really hard on
the ionic 2 course that I wasn't talking
about lately so that's not kind of why I
made this real quick video that's
probably going to not be worthwhile in a
month or two months Adobe update XD to
include that functionality but otherwise
no big deal check out course cetera comm
