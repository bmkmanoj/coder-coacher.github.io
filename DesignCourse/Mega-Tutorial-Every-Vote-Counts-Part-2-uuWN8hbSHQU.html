calm today we're going to stick with
modeling and we're going to model the
actual ballot box along with the legs
that it will stand on and so yeah check
out design course calm if you haven't
yet and subscribe here at YouTube
alright so now we're going to create the
voting Bock's portion which sits on top
of it alright so what we want to do is
and the type of voting box is going to
be it's going to be like an old-school
wood in the boom box that kind of sits
up there we put in your your silly
little I voting you know which master
you want to rule over you and then you
put it in the slot and of course it just
goes into a fictional or metaphorical
toilet I so what we want to do is start
off with the actual box portion and then
we're going to have like metal age let's
stand over this portion so I what we'll
do is also make sure you save this I've
already saved it so file save as and
save it somewhere I what we'll do is get
our origin point set up correctly so hit
three on the number pad I'll click right
around here hit one and it's also set in
the correct position so we'll go ahead
hit shift also make sure you're an
object mode hit shift a mesh cube s to
scale that thing down hit one to get the
front view we want it to be roughly the
same width as this back portion right
here so hit s and X move it over that's
pretty good get three to get to the side
view and this will also be s in why
let's say right around there that's
actually it looks a little bit too wide
for my liking so I'm going to 3s and why
again bring that down maybe roughly
right around there actually I would
probably like it to be just the width
this middle portion so I
at seven and we'll hit s and why again
and we'll go right around there and
position it right there all right okay
so now what we want to do this is this
bottom portion pretty much done is going
to have wood and a decal on it um so
what we want to do now we're going to go
to edit mode hit tab we're going to face
select this top one right here so right
click it we're going to hit shift D to
duplicate it hit Z to push it up this a
little bit hit p separate by selection
hit tab to good object mode right click
the duplicated face and then hit tab
again to go back into edit mode a and
then hit e and it's already on the z
axis so this portion when it comes to
like these voting boxes I don't I is
this how they used to be i don't know
but i always remember just to be like a
you know the old school ones just to be
a portion where it slants up like this
so what we're going to do is go to edge
select mode down there right click this
edge hit three and drag it up like that
all right very very simple okay so now
we need like a slot in here in the
center so the way we'll do this is add
some edge loops so let me hit ctrl R
left-click and drag it up just a little
bit control are again left click and
drag it up right around there alright
and then hit ctrl R to add an edge loop
on this angle left click to set it
control are left click and if we hit
seven we can get a better view of what
this looks like just to make sure it's
I'm just going to eyeball to make sure
it's pretty even right around there I'll
right so now we have a portion right
here in the center this face if we go to
face select mode we can take this and we
can hit E and then just left click to
set it and then drop it down right
around here and then hit the Delete key
and make sure you specify face alright
so now it's empty in there cool alright
so that's all it is in terms of modeling
the actual voting ballot box thing
alright so very simple I now what we
want to do is model the actual metal
cylinder legs that this thing comes on
our sirs basically sitting on so what we
want to do is go hit three to go into
side mode right side we're going to
left-click our origin point right there
hit one and it's pretty much where we
need it be me over here a little bit
more and we're going to hit wait one
second the MU all right right there now
we're going to hit shift a and we're
going to add a cylinder it s to scale
that thing down by a lot now it's
already on the correct orientation as
being up and down so let's hit one real
quick it's kind of in the box so drag
this over to the right just against it
drag it up a little bit maybe around
there all right and hit three wait did I
just add that to one of our yeah I did
so if you have that issue where you add
an object when you're in edit mode like
I just did and I advise you guys to be
wary of if you want to separate the
objects of course just go back into tab
we have it selected currently hit p by
selection now there are two separate
objects alright so now let's go back to
edit mode and we need to drag this thing
down to the floor so it's hit one
on the number pad you go to front view
hit a actually do it twice d select all
go to the vertex mode a I to do select
it be and then just select the bottom
and will drag this down to the floor
just above it may be right around here
all right very simple alright so now
what we want to do is come down here and
we want to add like kind of just rubber
black pads that will go around here so
what we can do is yeah that's the only
thing that's currently selected are just
these edges right here are these
vertices so what we can do is hit shift
D Z on your keyboard just drag it down a
little bit beneath it and hit p two
separate by selection hit tab right
click it to select it and then hit tab
again to go to edit mode hit a to select
all and then hit e and then Z oops z it
was already there by default and you
could tell if it when it starts going
beneath the plane right there it shows
that it stops right around there so if
you just get right around there you'll
be good and then hit s to scale this up
and I'm going to select the top row only
so hit a B make sure you don't select
any of the bottom and I'm going to scale
that up a little bit as well and then
hit tab to go to object mode and we'll
select this the bar right here and then
hit tab to go to edit mode hit a make
sure nothing selected hit B and let's
drag this in a little bit all right cool
there's one other thing I'm going to add
and so what I'm going to do is add an
edge loop control are you see it adds
right in the middle of wherever you're
adding it so left-click drag this thing
right around here close to the top we're
going to hit ctrl R again drag it up
around there and maybe it right around
here and then what I'm going to do is go
into face mode right here and hit three
what I want to do is right click to
select actually let me turn that off
right click to select yeah yeah so I
have six selected if I hit the Delete
key and you only choose faces we have a
hole there alright and this would be as
if you know you have like a what do you
call like a screw that's attaching
although i'm not going to do the screw
just because i don't want to get too
hung up on so many details and you won't
really even be able to tell anyhow
because we're going to be zoomed out for
the final render so just like that's
going to work and now what I want to do
is add a subdivision surface to this so
I'm going at tab to go into object mode
and we're going to come out here to our
modifiers add subdivision surface let's
choose three on those and of course we
have the spear looking thing because of
that so go back into edit mode and
control our pull this thing down all the
way and we'll see we look at this yeah
that's fine all right let's go ahead and
also select this and add subdivision
surface tab control our control are
again bring it up all right also you
want to add smooth shading to all these
so if we go into object mode smooth
wanna make this smooth
this I'm not sure if we set smooth to
these once or not alright alright so now
what we want to do is take this and we
have wait wait wait before i do that
this needs fixed up here we'll go to
edit mode tab control our and just bring
that up okay now we're going to select
this and this by holding shift and right
clicking both and we're going to
duplicate those so let's go to top view
7 hit shift D and then why all right now
both of these are selected I so hold
shift right click both of these objects
shifty hit X alright so now what we want
to do is go ahead and we're going to
make sure I these are flipped around
because I the whole is facing this way
so if we right-click just the bar we not
to worry about these these are pretty
much the same all around so we're going
to hit r and z 180 ah no right now the
origin point is right here so it's going
to rotate around this instead of just on
the center out of this so what we can do
is come over here and you see where this
has set origin put to origin to geometry
RZ 180 now it's facing out set origin to
geometry r z 180 all right sweet ok so
let's go ahead and see what this thing
looks like at this point rendered
alright so I'm going to right-click just
the top so when you're in I rendered
mode and you try to click something
you're not going to see whatever you're
selecting but if you just right click it
you know you have it selected G is the
shortcut for move so if I hit G and then
Z and then just move my cursor down a
little bit you'll see now it's a lot
closer and then just like left click to
select it or set it rather all right
this is the doesn't it looks ridiculous
and funny okay um alright I'm not too
happy about how thick these are these
legs they seem a little bit too thick
especially in relation to the size of
the box like this is overkill you don't
need that much structural support so I'm
going to scale these down a little bit
but we want to do it in a way that
doesn't require a lot of work to fix so
I'm going to go back here to solid all
right and I also want to make sure this
these are set to the the origin points
at the center of the geometry but these
aren't these two over here so set origin
to geometry and as well over here all
right so if you were to hit like s point
5 that gives us obviously I something
that's scaled down quite a bit although
we're going to have to fix it a little
bit i'm going to undo that control Z so
the way you can kind of fix that is if
you ever want to scale or rotate
something on two accesses instead of all
three you hit s and then you hit shift
in whichever one that you do not want to
be affected so we don't want it to scale
down on the z z axis so you hit shift
and then Z and then you'll see the only
the axis is which are going to be
affected the x and y are highlighted and
so now I if you were to use your
your mouse you could scale it down like
that or scale it up I because I want
them to be all the same i'm not going to
rely on the mouse i'm just going to put
in the number value so I'm going to try
point six just like that so if i do that
for all four of these will hit shift I
mean s rather sorry and then shift Z
point six enter all right s and then
shift Z and point six enter and then
also finally one more time s shift Z
point six enter alright so now we have
just a minor issue I yeah this those
rubber things that are way too big too
so let me hit odd let me do the same
thing here I let me just put s point
seven that got that issue right click
and set origin to geometry s let's see
if I habs I that's hit point I point
seven
let me undo that what we'll do is s and
then shift C point 7 there that's better
do the same thing over here right click
sorry about this set origin to geometry
s shift 0.7 and then set origin to
geometry s shift 0.7 what did i do I
don't think I got the point in there s
shift Z 0 point 7 enter and then s shift
Z point 7 damn it i forgot to set the
origin to geometry s ship see points7
enter there we go alright that's better
now these things need moved
unfortunately so what we'll do is hit
seven zoom up here we could see that
it's further away because we scaled it
down so I'm holding shift and
right-clicking to select both and move
those over right against it okay seven
again come over here do the same thing
right click holding shift right clicking
and move that over all right I like that
a lot better so now if we go to rendered
view get a better idea of what this
thing looks like alright alright think
we can quickly set some materials up so
what we'll do is work on the toilet real
quick so i will just right-click the
biggest portion of the toilet which is
right here and we'll come over here to
the materials tab hit new make sure
you're on Cycles render by the way and
by default ads diffuse okay so we're
going to add what's called a mix shader
and so if you've never used nodes before
I let me show you real quick what I'm
talking about become up here up to this
little edge right here you'll see your
cursor changes left click and drag down
and then down here we can change the
view port over here and there's all
these different types of editors that we
can view
so we're going to change this one to
node editor alright so the node editor
is basically a reflection of whatever is
set over here in this materials tab okay
so we have the material output by
default and then we have a default
diffuse surface shader there's all these
different types of surfaces that we can
apply I one popular one is called a
mixed shader and a mixed shader allows
you to add or mix two different shaders
together and you control which of the
other one is shown more versus the other
one so what we're going to do I because
nothing is perfectly very few things are
perfectly glossy I we're going to add a
mix shader which will add a diffuse in a
glossy shader together so to sever this
connection and there's two ways you can
do this by the way the surface can be
set over here so if we click on this
we'll see we have all these different
surfaces we see mix share right here if
we just left click it you'll see that it
updates right here now if I hit ctrl Z
twice we'll see we go back to the
diffuse shader right here we can make
the same changes entirely from within
the node editor so what we can do is
sever this connection you hit control in
your keyboard left click you say a
little knife and so now it's severed by
the way let's switch to render just so
we can see everything that we're doing
because there's no material set and i
severed that connection it's black we
add that back when we have this default
diffuse shader so let's sever that again
shift a and we want to add text that
shader and then we have all the same
options that we had over here okay I so
what we do is add shader mix shader and
we can see we could drag it on wherever
we want and I'm going to put it right
here between this portion right here the
material output and then a diffuse so
we'll connect this white here to this
shader and then this right here to the
top shader alright so now it's only
fifty percent point five of diffuse and
then there's nothing else down here so
let's hit shift a
and we're going to add glossy if I can
find it right there all right and then
connect it to the bottom okay so now
this is 50% diffuse and fifty percent
glossy and you can see we can control
the colors and the roughness of all that
I so let's go ahead and it's a little
bit difficult to kind of see you know
what exactly is being glossy and what's
not simply because everything is white I
so I'm going to leave it right here I
mean if you turn us all the way up you
can see how the reflections off of these
soon-to-be metal poles are more defined
in there less diffuse so this is all the
way hundred percent glossy so we'll just
put it around I don't know maybe around
point seven just for now all right so
now what we can do is apply this
material and we can name this to light
gloss or whatever you want to call it to
the other objects so we're an object
mode right click the seat and we'll
apply white gloss you could tell how it
changed already it's a lot shinier right
click this portion white gloss white
clip like right click this top portion
and choose white gloss as well all right
very very simple so what if we wanted to
make a change like to cut like what if
we want to make the color black all
right so let's click on the seat and
with it selected and you can you can't
tell again if you go to solid you can
see it's selected we go back to rendered
we can I click this plus sign right here
so now it's basically duplicated this
texture and its name white gloss 001
will call this black gloss and we can
change the color real simply just by
going over here and it didn't become
completely black because we only change
it on half of this I've are actually
it's only about point 3 or point too
whatever I we change this to black as
well we can see now depending on how
black we make it let me make it leave it
right around there that we still can see
some highlights right around there all
right so now what if we wanted to add or
we wanted to make these metal portions
look metal so let's right click on them
right now there's no material set so
it's going to be empty we'll hit new and
we'll change this over here to a yeah
I've still never learned how to say this
I mean this isn't it ridiculous and is
so tropic or something I'm so ridiculous
humming a trial to shut up I so what
we'll do is you can really adjust this I
depending on how rough you want it to be
I right now it's zero and you could
change the different colors will
experiment with this went into time time
so we're going to change the name just
two metal legs and then we'll apply it
to each one of these so metal legs metal
legs where are you yeah right there and
then this back one right here okay and
then we can also right click on yeah
these little rubber stopper things hit
new we'll leave it at diffuse and just
make the color like black right around
there and we'll call these rubber stops
I guess you could call them right click
that and rubber stops right click rubber
stops and then Wow my kid is being loud
down there I hope you guys can't hear
this just like freaking out having a
tantrum or something alright and then
this one will be changed here oops yeah
two rubber stops we also have this
handle right click that and we'll make
that the same as a metal legs material
it's not perfect but it'll do for now
and we're already at 25 minutes so if
you want to get rid of this window you
right click right here
join area down looking good alright so
tomorrow we're going to go ahead and
start getting work I we're going to work
with I photoshop I think and maybe go
ahead and work on getting this box
looking as it should all right I'll see
you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
