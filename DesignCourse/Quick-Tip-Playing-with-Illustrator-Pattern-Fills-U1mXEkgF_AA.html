today we're going to be taking a look at
pattern fills as a way to I just add a
little bit extra to our illustrations
and shapes and designs in general and so
specifically the ones who are going to
be looking at are gonna be good for
adding a sort of illustrative line based
and dot based patterns in terms of
adding shadows or highlights so I'm just
gonna file new I for my resolution I for
this video 8:59 by 600 points works well
at a hundred percent and then for
advanced I'm gonna make sure everything
is at i RGB and raster effects screen 72
and you can align new objects to pixel
grid hit okay so I've a control one will
get 200% and so the first example I'll
give you I I'm going to go ahead and
just use the type tool left click and
we're just going to type design so I'm
gonna move to the move tool a selection
tool hold shift left click and just
scale that up and I'm going to use a
font just called news cycle it's free
you can find it
I actually that's not the one I wanted
there we go Oswald is the one I wanted
so you can find that if you just google
it I had no big deal and so just looking
at this I let's say for example we
wanted to add some sort of shadow to
this you know there's several different
ways you could do that you could I just
take control C ctrl F to duplicate it
and then select the bottom line down
here and then just use your keyboard
down and right arrow keys a few times
and make it maybe a lighter color like
that very simple not much to it another
way you could do it while keeping the
same black color here I what we could do
is go to over here and find it under
this section and there's drop-down menu
open swatch library now mine is kind of
showing off up on the right hand side so
whenever I'm going to basically is
and then it comes out basic graphics and
then basic dots and in basic graph lines
so the one that I'm going to choose is
lines graphics lines right there and we
can see we have all these different
swatches these presets here alright so
if I just click on one of these we'll
see what it does it just fills in that
text path or a text field with these
lines so these are thicker and then
these are real thin now in and of itself
may be something right around here would
maybe work well but they actually work
well when you combine multiple so let's
say we select this one maybe move it up
a little bit closer and control C
control F to duplicate it select the
bottom one use your down in right arrow
keys just a couple times maybe right
around there and then use a thinner one
and then now you may want to use your
down arrow key and right arrow key to
get it to I because they are transparent
over each other so if you if you have
them aligned incorrectly it'll look kind
of cluttered but right there looks
pretty good
and just kind of an interesting cool
effect that you could apply to not just
type layers like this so let's say for
example we have a shape here we'll use
the ellipse tool and I can hold shift in
alt T and left-click and drag out to
create a perfect circle and we'll get
rid of the fill this time so we can come
over here in swatches click that red
slash switch to our stroke and we'll
give it a black stroke turn up the
stroke size and then change our variable
width profile which by default is
uniform I - maybe something like let's
see maybe this one right here so it's
just kind of different and how the
stroke is applied so then what we go
will do we get an object path and will
outline the stroke all right so it's no
longer a path it's or a stroke rather
it's a full path and we control C and
control F and we could do the same thing
take this one right there
oops I think I'm selecting the text so
let me
convert that to an outline take the
bottom line and control H and yeah right
there
control C control F yeah move it the
bottom one
let me real quick running into the same
problem actually I'll just probably use
this becoming oh it's because it's
applying a stroke there we go there we
go
that looks a little bit better and we
can see it just gives you a nice sort of
taper effect over here over here it
doesn't look so good I so once you have
these paths filled in you know you can
use let's say for example we only wanted
to have this show up on the inside and
not the outside we could just take the
pen tool I'm gonna hit ctrl H so we can
see the path that's and the points I
come up right around here come up around
take the move tool select that along
with our two pattern paths let me shift
left clicking will move it over select
the top path object path and divide
objects below and then take the direct
selection tool and just select somewhere
in the middle and hit delete twice then
we can move this over and now we can
make this so that it only shows up here
on the inside but yeah that's the
general basic idea of this it's just a
very quick way of manipulating paths and
adding interesting sort of graphics so
another one you could do if we come down
here we go to patterns again we could do
dots even so they have a lot of cool
dots they kind of look like half-tones
so when you apply these let me apply
maybe a thick one here and then a less
stick one here
control C control F move it down trill C
control F move this down that way we can
sort of just taper it off but yeah
anyhow you could just really experiment
with it and you can make it really
interesting just by duplicating the
layers and then just adding different
variations of these so yeah go ahead and
explore all of these you know they have
the patterns but they have so much
others here I'm hopefully my kid that
didn't microphone didn't pick that up
she's screaming anyhow I but yeah just
go ahead and experiment with that and
hopefully you learned something new that
can really drastically alter the
appearance and the quality of your
designs
alright so sorry I haven't been updating
lately with a lot of content I've been
focused on kind of restructuring how I
do design course comm and actually the
whole bowl show and such so I look out
for more updates in the future and make
sure you subscribe here on YouTube and
check out design course comm alright see
you later good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
