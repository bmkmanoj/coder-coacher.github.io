course comm and today we're going to
finish off the mobile GUI element design
in Adobe Photoshop CC today's January
10th with our tenth video and as always
if you need access today's project files
the final file is available in the
description below this video and as
always check out these on course comm
see what's going on there put in your
email and also like us on the various
social networks the links are available
in description below this video alright
let's get started okay so the first
thing I'm going to do is go ahead and
take all of these layers and group them
up so let's take the top layer and then
hold shift and select all the way down
to here and hit ctrl G and we'll just
call this radio and we're going to leave
it here in the center and then to the
left we're going to create some vertical
sliders so I what we want to do to
maintain consistency in terms of the
design the aesthetics is just to make
sure that everything goes together we're
well so in terms of a vertical slider
it's basically the same thing except it
obviously it's vertical and the user
will be able to control it with a button
or a novel of some sort so the actual
slider the part that's not filled will
be black and the part that's represented
as being slid up or down whether it's
volume or whatever it's going to be the
same green so what I'm going to do is
just temporarily this right here is just
dragged out I'm going to hold alt while
doing this and I'd say right around
there I just want it to be the same
height that's why I did that so now I'm
just going to push it over here to the
left by holding shift and now what I
want to do is I'm going to select this
layer so make sure all those select
layers checked on and I'm just going to
click it and then I'm going to right
click and copy layer style then I'm
going to click on this layer right click
paste layer style
now we're not gonna be able to see
anything but basically that takes the
inner glow and transfers here an
integral it happens deal with block in
this case so we can't see it now what we
want to do is get this green portion in
there so the way we do that and it's the
same way over here we can see that this
is a clipping mask so we'll create a new
layer
control-shift-n and we will choose use
previous layer of clipping mask and hit
OK and if we just double click on this
we'll get the exact color code cancel
and then we'll go back up here and yeah
that's it right there
we'll just choose anywhere around here
and hit ctrl H to get rid of the
outlines and you can see it's not really
filled in quite as much as here so we
can go back here to this inner glow and
bump up the opacity a little bit and
bump up the size and also you can
experiment with the choke if you wish
we'll go around here let me drop the
choke that choke down just a little bit
I think right there is pretty good so
I'm going to hit OK and I'm also going
to bring that back up just one more time
I want to give it a inner shadow well
now actually we'll do a drop shadow I
change it to normal blend mode take that
pasady up to 100 let's go around there
for now take the size to zero and the
distance to one I think that's pretty
good right there so this color code is
6-2 6-2 6-2 and that looks good now what
I want to do is go ahead and create a
sphere on the lips rather and we'll
choose a top layer so it goes up above
it hold shift and right around there
alright control H
now what we want to do ramp layer styles
we'll do a gradient overlay and we'll
change the angle here and we'll bring up
the gradient editor
we'll make this right around here then
take this one and yeah I think right
there's good hit okay and then I also
want to give it a we'll do a drop shadow
same way as before so I'll be quick here
hmm I'm not sure if I like that we do
that maybe we could just do this make it
actually darker and then we could do an
inner shadow up here change it normal 0
1
all right and then we'll hit okay and
then finally we can move up here you can
create that same sort of a shadow that
kind of comes off so I want to go
underneath that layer here and we'll
switch to black we'll select right on
there
hold shift let's go beyond I'd say right
around here and then hold shift again
take the direct selection told hold the
tool and hold shift it's like both of
those and make that black drop the
opacity down and control H we'll
right-click rasterize that use the
eraser tool all right and then now to
kind of just make that a little bit more
realistic we could take the square
rectangular marquee tool and select just
an along this edge the writer portion of
that shadow take the move tool and then
hit the up arrow on your keyboard a
couple times
yeah obviously it doesn't make sense
that this is up too high I wanted to do
I'm going to do this again move it up
again and then I'm going to take the pen
tool change it to path and we'll go
right around here and hold shift right
click make selection and just hit OK hit
delete all right all right so that looks
pretty good so now what we can do is
group all of those and hit ctrl G oops
ctrl G rather ctrl H by accident we'll
call this vertical and then we'll take
the move tool auto select group we'll
duplicate this group
we'll duplicate it one more time and
then we can take auto-select layer and
we can move these down so we'll just
select this layer that circle hold shift
and select on the shadow and then hold
shift and select the actual layer map or
clipping mask and that way they all move
together although if you go too high we
would just have to extend the height of
that green portion all right and then
take this one do the same thing hold
shift go slightly higher take this hit
ctrl T drop that down all right cool all
right so now we have the actual vertical
sliders done we could take these or just
one of them real quick and make it a
horizontal slider so we'll just
duplicate the top one I named it to
horizontal right click duplicate group
oops
I already duplicated what am i doing it
has been a rough day
my wife has pneumonia my kids are sick
all right ctrl T hold shift and we want
basically to be perfectly horizontal
now obviously the shadows messed up so
we'll fix that go ahead and select right
around here right well yeah we go edit
transform flip horizontal and then just
move that right here and that works out
to where we'd really don't even have to
mess with it so that's good and then
finally I just wanted to do some toggle
switches like on offs we'll do that over
here so now would be a good time to save
what you have on so let's get started um
I want to first take this layer right
click copy the layer style alright just
ctrl shift to add to get a new layer
there and then what I want to do is take
the rounded rectangle tool
and create something just around that
size all right so right click and then
paste layer style so now we have that
slight drop shadow right there and now
what we want to do is take this right
click and copy that layer style and I'll
collapse that and we'll create another
rectangle just above
right click and paste now we may need to
adjust this just a little bit so I'm
going to switch this little button right
here actually doesn't help if it selects
the otherwise just hold ctrl and then
click it that will deselect it we're
going to go let's pull it out law right
around there all right now if i zoom up
I think it's a little bit too big just a
tad bit so I'm just going to slightly
pull up right control T alright now I'm
going to take both of them scale them
down I think it's just too big all right
and then finally I know I'm annoying
everybody I'm making so many adjustments
to this take the direct selection tool
ctrl H to see it and just pull this out
a little bit further all right so now
we're ready to go
okay so inside here I'm going to put off
so caps lock I have off written I'm
going to make it white and and change
the anti-aliasing just smooth I'm using
source sans Pro this is a free font you
can find it on Google I'm going to make
it black and hit ctrl T scale that down
by holding shift and hit apply and then
to make it kind of look like it's inset
in there in that black space we can
double click bring up the layer styles
and we could do inner shadow and then
just bring down the opacity to around 46
and hit OK all right we're almost done
we just have to do a couple more things
I I wanted to make it look like there's
like little grips for your thumb on here
so the way we could do that is to create
I'll just use an ellipse very tiny like
a one pixel practically I
a little circle there and then take the
foreground color leave it so right
around there it can be the same color it
doesn't really matter control H to get
rid of that bring up the layer styles by
double clicking hit drop shadow just
going to change this to normal bring
this up and change this to zero and one
alright hit OK all right so if we do
this enough times or duplicate it rather
or so I went down right down right on
the arrow keys
and then I'm going to take all these
four hit ctrl ctrl e and that won't
rasterize them but it'll take all those
shapes and combining to one layer so
I'll duplicate that and that way for I
guess it doesn't really matter if it's
all perfect I'm going to group those or
merge those rather ctrl e and duplicate
it again
all right so you may not be able to see
it very clearly here because of the
video but when you zoom out it's a very
fine detail and I think it just looks
kind of cool so alright so the last
thing we're about to do before we
duplicate this and show it on the
on-state is to take the pen tool and
we'll go will click on the off layer and
we'll start right here go out here I'm
holding shift alright oops
hate when I do that make sure shape is
selected
take the direct selection tool hold
shift select this one move it as needed
take it down below yeah that layer make
it black right click rasterize it and
we'll dig the I'm gonna hit control one
just to get back to 100% view take the
pasty of that layer and then use the
eraser then the blur which I failed to
do on these ones are kind of forgot to
do that
but we could fix that real quick just
like this select that one
and then finally this one alright okay
so let's go back to this layer I think
that's better right around 31% all right
so now all we have to do is take these
layers is all these hit ctrl G call this
switch off right click duplicate that
group bring it down and then we'll just
take some of these layers and pushing
them around so I'll take this over here
then I will take yeah we need those
three layers I believe yep
wait the shape three as well select this
one
change this to on change the color to
green all right and there we go now if I
just wanted to kind of move everything
around here real quick I take all this
here all right I think that looks good
so obviously you know there's there's a
lot of other type of uh interface
elements that you could create but this
should give you a good start on the
process of kind of creating a themed
type of basically GUI kit so hopefully
you learned a lot um as always visit
design course calm and like us on the
various social networks as that is
always helpful and I will see you
tomorrow
all right good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
