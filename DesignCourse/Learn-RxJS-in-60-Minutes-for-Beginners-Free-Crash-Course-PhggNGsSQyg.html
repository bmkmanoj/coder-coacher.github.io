to this brand-new 100% free course and
crash course really on rxjs so rxjs is
the JavaScript implementation of
reactive X well what is reactive X it's
an API for asynchronous programming with
observable streams if you've never heard
of or remember never messed around with
this before that probably means nothing
to you as well what the hell is that
that's okay though because I'm going to
show you exactly from scratch what all
this stuff means
and so at reactive xio which is the
official website for it we can see we
have our languages Java JavaScript which
is what we're going to be focusing on
Nets gala etc so if we go to /r XJS
we'll have the official documentation
for reactive X library and we will be
referring to this especially when it
comes to understanding what are called
marble diagrams and you'll understand
that stuff very soon as we go through
throughout this crash course so I
there's also a written version of pretty
much everything I'm teaching here feel
free to check that out it's linked and
let's get started
okay so we're gonna get started by
setting up a quick development
environment so that we can start
learning rxjs and there are frameworks
like angular that already have it
integrated but for this series of
tutorials for this course I really
wanted to make it AI framework agnostic
we're just gonna be working with in pure
vanilla JavaScript I'm not gonna be
choosing any frameworks so with that
said I'm gonna go ahead and go to the
console alright so we're just going to
create a new folder called rxjs and Ivan
learn and then we'll also CD into it
so CD rxjs Ivan learn all right and I'm
going to use yarn for this I although
you could use NPM the node package
manager for installing the necessary
project dependencies so I'm just going
to type yarn a knit and - why that will
create a package JSON file with all of
the answers being yes for that so then
we're going to use yarn to add rxjs
itself and then web pack which we'll use
to bundle everything together and then
also type script although you don't have
to use typescript in order to use rxjs
but eventually I'm going to be leading
into angular so might as well just get
used to some type script right so then
yarn add rxjs web pack web pack - dev -
server this will launch a dev server for
us on localhost 808 oh by default and
then also typescript and TS or
typescript loader all right so I'm just
gonna wait until this installs alright
and then finally we're going to add as a
development dependency in our package
JSON file I a package called web pack -
CLI yarn add web pack
- CLI and then we add the dev flag
alright great so now I'm just going to
go ahead and clear this out and type in
code and a period this will launch
Visual Studio code if you haven't
installed from
to me online in our current rxjs learned
folder okay so first thing we want to do
is open up the package.json file and let
me make this a little bit larger so
everybody can see what's happening here
and inside of here I we just want to add
a new property called scripts so scripts
and we're gonna open this up and we'll
say start so when we run a command
called yarn run well what's it called
start well upgrade later there and what
would be what command do we want to be
run when we call start it'll be web pack
dev server and then also we're gonna add
a mode development here if you just I
was running we're web pack dev server
itself and the output mentioned I need
to specify a mode here that's why I'm
adding that here alright and in a comma
at the end save that so now we need to
set up web pack itself so we're gonna
create a file here called
web pack dot config das by the way I
everything I'm doing right now in terms
of the code if you don't want to follow
along you can grab the github code
there's a link here provided and also
all the codes in the written version of
this tutorial which is also linked here
ok so I really at this point I'm just
going to copy from the written tutorial
this section right here again this is
all linked so I'm just gonna copy all of
this because I'm not going to go through
all this this configuration set up
simply because it's not relevant to the
purpose of this course alright so the
only thing that's really happening here
that you know it's worth mentioning is
that our entry point it's going to be
looking at this for this folder in a
file called code TS which is for
typescript that's where all of our code
is going to be throughout the pretty
much the duration of this course to
learn rxjs alright and then of course
the extensions that we're using TS for
typescript javascript any testing we're
not going to be doing that
and it just bundles everything to a
bundle Jas and into a path of the dist:4
der alright alright then we want to
create another file for a typescript so
it's going to be TS config Jason
and once again I'll be copying the code
for that and this is the code for that
it's just specifying our output of dist
we're able to use I the es 2017
otherwise known as es 8 JavaScript while
compiling down to 2015 or es6 right here
so we'll save both these files alright
and then we need to create our
index.html alright and here are in
Visual Studio code you just put a
exclamation point and hit enter that
gives just some basic boilerplate hit
control be a guru that sidebar and also
in the written version of the tutorial I
do have a couple adjustments I made to
this basic document for instance I I'm
going to change this document here the
title I'm also going to add just some
three CSS rule sets right here again I'm
grabbing all this from the written
version and then for our body we're
going to have a single unordered list
element with an ID of output and then
outside of here we're gonna have our
script source equals forward slash
bundle j/s alright so this idea of
output right here we're going to be
using that to display the output of our
observables while we're learning rxjs I
we could have just console.log it but I
think that looks ugly it's a lot easier
just to have something that's kind of
styled and it looks well in the browser
for us so that's the purpose of this
unordered list element again it's not
necessary but it'll make life a little
bit easier
in prettier so let's go ahead now and
create that source folder so create a
new folder right here called source
inside of it will create a file called
code TS alright so just to be sure that
everything's working and that we have
rxjs you know integrated as we want it
to be we're gonna put import all as rx
from and we'll say rxjs four slash
observable and then we'll simply
console.log rx for now
alright so now if we go back to our
console which by the way you don't have
to use a separate console you could go
to view integrated terminal and just run
this far line following command which is
yarn yarn run and start so if I do that
everything should work here as expected
and then we'll be able to visit our
localhost 808 Oh
control shift I and we'll see we have
our object right here which this means
correctly that rxjs has been integrated
and we're ready to rock
all right so now we're going to actually
begin learning about the exciting world
of rxjs
and a great starting point would be to
understand what a stream is and an
observable so a stream is simply just to
represent it's a concept it's basically
values or events as they're called that
are emitted over time so think of for
instance Thai you know a bunch of users
chatting in a chatroom an individual
filling out a form you know through
through multiple different inputs these
are all values or events that are
emitted over time essentially and their
relation to an observable and observable
is actually what facilitates the stream
it provides you with a function and a
means to both emit these values and also
respond to them all right so that's I
don't like a lot of conceptual stuff so
let's get a better understanding by
actually doing so I'm going to go back
to our editor here and we're gonna make
some adjustments to this so first you
know you could just import everything
the entire kitchen sink here as we're
doing but I'd rather not do that because
you know chances are you're never gonna
need to import this much stuff and that
would just be a waste so what we're
gonna do is what is it that we want to
experiment with and learn well in
observable so we're gonna import
observable from rxjs for slash
observable if I could spell it there we
go and then we're going to create an
observable very simple we'll simply say
var observable equals observable dot
create method all right so I should warn
you there are multiple ways to create an
observable and to create method is just
one of which are one method that you can
do so to create one from scratch alright
so this in and of itself is an
observable but this create method
accepts a single argument which is a
SUBSCRIBE function and the SUBSCRIBE
function accepts what's called an
observer
argument so adding to line three right
here we're going to pass in a function
called subscribe and then we pass in
that observer alright and then we can
open up that function within our
squiggly braces and to emit a value from
this part right here what we'll do
by the way it's giving us this red
squiggly line because of typescript we
have enabled so I just put any and that
will go away so to emit a value we
simply reference observer dot next and
then we pass in whatever it is that we
want to emit so I'll just put in a
string value of something like hey guys
all right so I dissonant of itself if we
were to save this we wouldn't see
anything in the console or not console
logging nothing's really happening here
by the way what we're gonna do this here
we can make this less verbose if we
simply get rid of function subscribe
alright and then we convert this to an
arrow function which is what we're gonna
do throughout the rest of the duration
of this course but I did just want to
show you the initial we're there alright
so next if we want to grab the value we
have to define what's called an observer
right so we haven't yet done that so the
way we can do that is we can say
observable dot subscribe alright and
then we're going to take whatever value
is being emitted from next so we can
reference that as I don't know X of type
any our error function and then we can
just console log X for now so now if we
were to save this and go back and view
the console hey guys we can see R it
right there and this is ugly
and as I mentioned I did want to output
these type of results over here in the
actual web page started using the
console log so what I'm going to do
based on the written tutorial is just
copy this little piece of code right
here this function and we're going to
use that function throughout this entire
course essentially so function add item
all we're doing is using vanilla
JavaScript to create a list item element
and we're going to be passing in this
value that we pass in to it so we can
change this console.log here to add item
and then X so now we save it and there
we go we have something that's much
better to look at alright so let's take
a closer look at observers and we can
see right here this here is in observers
every time you subscribe you you are an
observer and you create what's called a
subscription all right so once again
these observers they read values coming
from the observer observable up here so
an observer is simply a set of callbacks
that accept notifications coming from
this observer which include next error
and complete alright so in our current
example we've only provided the next
callback which technically is right here
however we can come and separate these
to also include error and also complete
so let's make this a little bit more I
you know I did say demonstrative of the
possibilities of observables and
observers so we have our observer next
hey guys right here
well let's replicate that with shift all
in the down arrow key if you're using
visual studio code we'll say how are you
alright and then we're gonna call
observer dot complete and then we'll
copy one of these and we'll say
this will not send alright next before I
describe what's happening here let's go
ahead and open this up alright so this
is the next function that's handled
right here
let's also handle the other two
functions which would be error and
complete
so we'll say error we will put add item
error and then we'll also say complete
we don't need to pass in anything here
we can just say add item and completed
so now at this point if we save it we'll
see that it says hey guys how are you
completed however we can see that
because we completed the observer right
here this will not send alright great so
hopefully you have a pretty good idea of
observables at least at a very basic
level all right so one thing if we want
to demonstrate error and how that works
is we can wrap our observable code here
in try-catch blocks so try and we'll put
this here
catch and then observer dot error that's
how we can define an error through the
error method and then just put er R and
we want to catch that all right and
that's how you would communicate error
and make this fire right here if there
is an error
we'll see if we save it it still works
there is no error at all okay so let's
talk about cancelling a subscription so
when you subscribe to an observable
within observer you've created what's
called a subscription as I mentioned
earlier and you're given the ability to
cancel that subscription the event that
you no longer need to receive the
emitted values from the azure observer
so up here we completed this observable
but what if we wanted just one of our
subscribers in our case we only have one
right here what if we don't need to
receive that those emitted values
anymore all right so let's set up our I
our example here just so we can
demonstrate this so we're gonna use I
right here a set interval function and
this will just repeat whatever is inside
it here for whether whatever duration
that we specify oops alright so what
we'll do is I'll say observer in the dot
next we'll change this to I am good
alright so this is going to continually
spit out I am good right here for every
two seconds let's also get rid of this
section right here these two lines and
then we'll go ahead let's rename this
just so we can understand what it is a
little bit better
instead of renaming I mean we're going
to create a variable out of it so that
we can reference it so we'll call this
var and was call this an observer then
we can create a set timeout
and inside of here we're gonna call
observer dot unsubscribe in 6,001
milliseconds or six seconds plus one
millisecond so if we save this I am good
I am good I am good and then it's been
unsubscribed and we will no longer
receive any other emitted values all
right so that's how you cancel a actual
observer from receiving any further
emitted values
all right so also let's talk about
creating multiple subscriptions so
you're able to create multiple
subscriptions on the same observable
very easily so this could be useful if
you have different areas of your your
user interface where you're using the
same data but you're displaying it
potentially in a different way so what
we'll do is let's copy this right here
and we'll call this observer two and we
don't need to have the error or complete
callbacks there and now if we save this
you'll see we'll have duplicates of
everything
all right so also notice that we will
still receive the I am good just from
one of the observers simply because the
set timeout is only unsubscribing from
the observer the first observer up here
all right so if we want to tie these two
together then we get into what are
called child subscriptions so what if we
wanted to unsubscribe both of our
subscriptions if the one has been
unsubscribed so to do that all we have
to do is call observer dot add and then
we add observer two so if now we save
this all right
here it goes now none of them will emit
any more values because it's been added
and you can also call subscription dot
remove and also remove a previously
added observer if you need that
functionality
now the next most important thing to
understand once you understand the
basics of what an observable is is
whether or not an observable is hot or
cold
all right so in the case of a cold
observable like the type that we've been
working with so far right here it's an
observable whose producer and by the way
a producer is this observer or the
subscribed function right here because
it produces or it emits these values or
events
it's an observer who's producer is
activated once a subscription like down
here has been created all right so to
better demonstrate this let's go ahead
and adjust our code so we're gonna leave
all this the same up here and down here
let's go ahead and get rid of just about
all of this stuff and inside of here
we'll make this by the way just one
second and we're going to create a
second observer so we'll say our
observer two equals observable dot
subscribe and then we will pass in just
as we have before our next callback so
we'll call it X of type any and we'll
add item and we'll say subscriber two
and then plus X which is the return the
emitted value here essentially all right
so if we go ahead and save this you'll
see now that we it has hey guys how are
you
and then after one second the subscriber
receives hey guys how are you
etc and this means that the observable
is cold and so an observable is hot when
the producer is emitting values outside
of the observable up here so we can
actually make this cold observe
hot and technically this is more of
what's called a warm approach or a warm
observable with just a few changes so if
we import rxjs add operator share and
we're going to learn about operators
later on in the course but we're doing
it just for this relevant purpose here
if we had the share operator at the very
end of our observable and then we save
this
we'll see it says hey guys how are you I
am good subscriber to starts receiving I
am good and not the very initial values
that were already emitted and this would
make it a warm or a hot observable
all right so an example of a truly hot
observable would be mouse movements for
instance that are made by a user so
let's remove all the current code with
exception to the add item function all
right so let's remove all of this let's
get rid of our share operator here and
we're going to import from event from
rxjs observable from event all right so
we're going to create what's called a
truly hot observable so we're gonna save
our observable equals from event
document and mouse move this right here
is technically an observable and were
created creating an observable from this
from event function so you can create
observables through these creation
operators as they're referred to as so
then we're going to set timeout
and we're going to create a subscription
or an observer unobservable dot
subscribe and the same thing as before
with our next call back we're gonna add
item right here and then we're also
going to give this a delay down here of
two thousand seconds or milliseconds
rather all right so this is an example
of what would be a truly hot observable
because if we save this and for the
first two seconds we were already
emitting values and this observable was
receiving those values already but once
we come over here only refresh see it's
there already Stephen it's only gonna
start receiving from that point at which
the observer was created alright so
there are also like I mentioned other
creation operators that we'll get into
perhaps in later on in the course and
you know that we just from event is
simply one of probably about ten
different creation operators you can
create observables from ranges and
timers from a promise just from a lot of
stuff so at this point hopefully you
should have a fairly strong and basic
understanding of what streams are and
really a stream is just a concept
observables observable observers and
subscriptions
all right so now let's talk about
subjects and you should really only you
know get yourself to this point if you
truly understand what an observable is
so if you're ending up on this from the
internet from this page without watching
the previous lesson where I discuss what
observables are then make sure you watch
out first because a subject is just a
different type of observable that has
different capabilities alright so going
back to the code that we've been working
on we're gonna go ahead and just cut
everything with exception to our add
item function and what I'm going to do
is get rid of this and this and we're
going to import our subject from rxjs
subject all right so let's create a
subject and by the way a subject you
know in contrast to an observable is
simply an observer that's also able to
emit values so it's both an observable
and an observer simultaneously and this
is unlike an observable because as an
observer that's subscribed to an
observer or rather an observable it can
only read values emitted from an
observable so if that sounds confusing
and word solid just I'll hold your
horses for a second we're gonna create a
subject new subject alright that's how
easy it is to create a subject and now
we have to subscribe to it just as we
would a regular observable so think of
this just as an observable alright so
what we'll do is subject dot subscribe
and we have our three different
functions here so we can say our data
add item
observer one and we'll pass in the data
and then we can have our error of add
item and our complete callback item
observer one completed alright now if we
save this project nothing's going to
have that or nothing's going to happen
next because we have to use that next
method to start emitting values from the
observer so now we can say subject dot
next the first thing has been sent now
we weren't able to do this before like
in the previous lesson when we were
talking about just pure observables I
the the actual subscriptions or the
observers or subscribers can't actually
emit values like we're doing right here
so if we save this and go back observer
one the first thing has been sent all
right so now that's simple enough but
let's make it more interesting by
defining another observer and then
pushing some more values alright so
underneath the first thing has been sent
let's create a second observer so far
this time we'll create a variable out of
it so observer two subject dot subscribe
and we'll say data same thing over here
add item and we'll say observer two and
plus data all right and then let's go
ahead and reference our subject and make
two more calls so the second thing has
been sent and shift alt and down arrow
key that and then also a third thing has
been set
let's save that and this is the result
that we get so we can see that the
second observer doesn't receive the
first thing has been sent but only the
values that came after it was created so
it doesn't receive this simply because
this hasn't yet been created so it's
created then it receives both of these
values down here so this subject
observers also have the following
methods which are add remove and
unsubscribe so let's try unsubscribing
the second observer and sending a value
after it and this will demonstrate you
know when it what it takes to
unsubscribe and what happens as a result
so what we'll do is we'll reference our
observer two right here and we'll say we
don't need that one anymore to subscribe
so we'll say observer to unsubscribe and
then let's push one more event and we'll
just say a final thing has been sent all
right so if we save this and we go back
we'll see that I the observer two
receives the two values that were
emitted right here in here and then
observer two is unsubscribed and
observer one will still receive all of
the events that are coming from the
subject itself
so now that you understand what a
subject is let's talk about the
variations of subjects so there's three
different variations and the first one
is called the behavior subject and
they're all very similar but they offer
different capabilities so going back
here basically a behavior subject is a
special type of subject whose only
difference is that it will MIT the last
value upon a new observers subscription
so what does that mean alright so for
instance in the above example that we
have here of a regular subject when
observer to subscribed and we can look
at this in a result it only received the
value that was emitted after it or the
values rather plural that were submitted
after it as we could see in the case of
a behavior subject this observer too
will receive the last or the previous
value that was emitted from the from the
behavior subject so in this case it
would have received the very first thing
that we received was right here the
first thing that has been sent so let's
better demonstrate this so you can get a
better grip of what exactly is happening
here we're gonna change subject simply
to behavior subject and we're gonna
import it from behavior subject and then
on line three instead of a new subject
this is a behavior subject right here
alright so we also have to pass in in
the first argument right here we'll just
say first because it needs any an
initial argument here so what we want to
do then to better demonstrate what's
happening just after this very first eye
event that's emitted we're gonna say
subject dot next observer two is about
to subscribe alright so now let's go
ahead and save this and we're going to
see in the browser we have our observer
one and three instances of this where it
has those first three pushes so it has
the very first
you appear and then the first thing has
been sent observer 2 is about to
subscribe then we can see observer 2
right here and this is the first time we
see it and it gets the last event that
was emitted from the the behavior
subject so right here observer 2 is
about to subscribe observe it to
receives that in the case of a subject
you simply wouldn't get that previous
value and that really is one of the only
differences between behavior subject in
a subject itself so now let's talk about
the second type of subject and that's
called a replay subject all right so
it's like behavior subject except it
allows you to specify a buffer or number
of emitted values to dispatch to
observers so behavior subject only
dispatches the last emitted value as we
can see here and replay subject allows
you to dispatch any designated number of
values so let's try to go ahead and give
this a try in our project so we're gonna
change this here from behavior to replay
alright same old stuff right here and
then in this first parameter we can
specify the number of events or values
to dispatch to new observers so let's
just say - alright so and then let's say
what's once again make adjustments to
our next calls alright so we'll just say
the first thing has been sent let's
replicate that and we're gonna change
this to another thing has been sent and
this is just to give us 3 just to show
that it will only return the last two to
the new subscriber so it saved that
alright so looks let's look for observer
2 we can see the very first thing it
receives is another thing has been sent
and not the first thing has been sent
and not the observer - alright so
hopefully you're understanding the
differences between subject behavior
subject and replay subjects so far
they're all very similar I in the most
flexibility so far to the plus at this
point is basically in replay subject
where you can specify
any X amount of events that a new
observer or a new subscription would see
okay all right so now let's go ahead and
also talk about another really cool
thing that a replay subject is able to
do all right it accepts in optional
second argument up here and upon
creation which is referred to as the
window window time and it's defined in
milliseconds so it allows you to define
a maximum number of events to return in
the first argument as we've already done
and then the second argument is the time
in milliseconds so sounds confusing so
to demonstrate this let's make a number
of changes here we're gonna change we'll
say we want it to return a maximum
number of 30 events within a 200
millisecond ibuffer time here all right
so then we're going to just make an
adjustment right down here we're gonna
get rid of these next things right here
so we're gonna save our I equals 1 and
then our int we're going to set interval
if I can type and we're going to say
subject dot next so we're going to push
a value on an interval and the value
that we're going to push is going to be
that I and we're going to increment it
every 100 milliseconds and then we're
going to take our observer to that's
created right here and we're going to
wrap it in a set timeout and we'll make
this timeout I have 500 milliseconds all
right so now if we go ahead and let's go
ahead and get rid of that unsubscription
right there and we can go ahead and get
rid of everything else down here as well
now if we go ahead and save this alright
so we could see that in the browser we
have our observer of 1
two three four and five that the
observer one receives then after 500
milliseconds the observer - is created
and observer two will only receive four
in five all right so hopefully that
makes sense I we can go ahead and change
for instance the window time on line
three from 200 to 500 and in this case
we'll see that observer two once it's
created right here receives all of them
all right now the final type of subject
that we're going to discuss is called
the async subject and this is the last
subject variation and it's perhaps the
most simple to understand
so async subject only emits the very
last value and will only do so once the
complete method has been called upon the
subject so using the example from the
above let's just make some slight
adjustments we're going to import async
subject all right and we can get rid of
this sector this table don't need any
arguments here and we're going to simply
come down here and in our set timeout
we're going to call in an order for a
synched subject to work we have to call
subject doc complete so now let's save
that and what has happened well we can
see that I the only the very last value
has will be sent to each of the
observers and they will only be sent for
instance if we remove that nothing will
happen they only get sent once complete
has been called upon the subject
all right so for the final section we're
going to discuss operators and in our
rxjs operators are perhaps what might be
used most outside of observables and in
and of themselves all right so there's
over a hundred plus I don't know I think
it's like something like 120 different
operators to use and it would take
forever to go through all of them so the
goal of this specific tutorial is to not
go over every single one of them but to
help you understand how to read the
official documentation and how to read
what are called the marble diagrams so
that you can have confidence going
forward so we still are going to use
several of these operators so you can
you know get some muscle memory and
understand how they're used in relation
to subjects and observables alright so I
what I want to do first to spend a
little bit of time just discussing what
an actual operator is alright so there
are simply methods that can be you can
use on observables and subjects and
remember subjects are just special types
of observables that allow you to change
the original observable in some manner
and return a new observable so these
operators they don't change the existing
observable they simply modify it and
return a new one so operators like this
are known as pure functions which are
functions I can JavaScript that they
don't modify the variables outside of
its scope all right so the only other
two things to understand here in the
context of operators are that static
operators and then the instance operator
so the instance operators right here
these are methods on observable
instances and these account for the
large majority of rxjs operators then
you also have static operators and these
operators are usually used to create
observables and you'll find these mainly
under the creation operators all right
next I want to show this part the
official documentation when it comes to
these operators we'll use what is called
a marble
right here all right so this here is
just an excerpt from the official
documentation that describes what's
happening with a marble diagram and so
at the top here this represents the
original observable this whole portion
right here this arrow is time that's
flowing from left to right and these
here are events or the values that are
emitted from the observables right here
and then this vertical line represents
the complete notification as we've
already discussed and demonstrated how
you can complete an observable and here
in the middle is the actual operator all
right so we're going to be passing the
original observable to some type of
operator and it could be multiple
operators not just one I and then this
shows the output like what happened to
these events based on whatever happened
to this I you know whichever type of
operator was passed into all right so
they're using an example called x 10 so
you know 4 becomes 40 6 becomes 60 and
then the X represents an error emitted
by the output observable so they're just
kind of throwing the kitchen sink at you
you're not going to see all this type of
stuff with all these marble diagrams so
it's really important you know to
understand and we're gonna take a look
at a few examples and actually integrate
them in a code here going forward ok so
let's talk about using an operator so
the official documentation has a section
where you can see categories of
operators let me try to find it just
kind of lost a page there we go
categories of operators so there like I
said there's a time there's a creation
there's transformation operators there's
filtering combination multi casting
aerial handling I that utility
conditional boolean and mathematical
navigate so just just a time that are
here and so depending on what you want
to do with the incoming observable you
would choose an operator from one of
these categories so let's say for
instance that we
wanted to I wanted to merge two separate
observables into one well you would use
what's called the merge operator and so
that's all about combining two
observables and it falls under the the
combination category in the
documentation I got rid of that I
shouldn't have done that but let me come
back here we'll find it real quickly
just so I can show you the marble
diagram and then we'll actually work
with it in the code so we'll have our
let's see our combination there we go
right here and we'll find merge and this
is what the official documentation looks
like it gives you a description and then
it shows you that Marvel diagram so here
when you have two arrows it's
representing two different observables
so the events coming from observable one
are a B and C observable two would be de
and F now in the if you pass it through
a merge operator then it becomes and
outputs a single observable right here
that has all of these values combined
so let's actually do that and of course
it does give you you know more
information as needed okay
so to do that let's go ahead and we're
going to import just in observable and
let's create and observable right here
all right so it takes in an observer
arrow function and we'll say server next
to emit a value of hey guys we're going
to go back to the original demonstration
here we're gonna say observable to
alright and we'll say absorber
next would be something like how is it
going by the way you don't have to use
this create eye operator for creating an
observable you can use one of the other
creation operators which will do shortly
you could use from a lot of different
ones there's like ten or eleven all
right so this wannabe how's it going is
this observable too what if we wanted to
merge these two together let's go ahead
and by the way get rid of all of this
stuff right here and let's create a new
observable of our new mobs
observable and then we simply call by
the way before we can call merge we have
to import rxjs observable merge and
we'll say merge and then simply the
observables that we want to merge so
observable and observable - and by the
way I screwed that up and need to import
merge from there there we go
and then finally we have to subscribe to
this new observable right here so this
would be new of OBS subscribe X of type
any typescript stuff there and we'll say
add item X all right so we have two
different values hey guys how is it
going to different observables we're
gonna merge them and then we subscribe
to them so let's save that and there we
go
our single observable that has been
merged now takes and emits both of these
values here all right so let's get more
practice just by working with these
operators so we can help with muscle
memory so a common
operator that's used a lot is the map
operator and you're probably familiar
with it if you've used angular and any
degree so let's take a look at that real
quick in terms of the marble diagram so
in this eye map operator this is the
marble diagram for it so we have a
single observable up here with the
values or the events of one two and
three and they pass in the map operator
and you pass in whatever events are
coming from it being X and then you
transform it in some manner and so in
this particular case they're going to
multiply it by some byte by ten so one
becomes 10 20 and 30
so we could do a lot of different things
so we could append a string to the end
of the vents or make all the results
capital or just do anything you know
Under the Sun so basically it's a
transformation type of operator so let's
go ahead and and actually I get
experience with just making a real
simple adjustment here so we're gonna
put in map and then we're going to call
observable dot create and I want to do
this to show you a less verbose way if
you don't necessarily need to create
variables out of these so get rid of
this and right here just get rid of all
that stuff we can say dot map actually
will come down dot map
and then we'll call will transform the
value of which we know is going to be
hey guys
and we'll just call a javascript
function of to uppercase so we're
transforming it in some way and then we
can subscribe to it and add item X oh
and I forgot we need to adjust that
slightly this is not the correct
location it is ad and then operator map
sorry about that now if we go back there
we go it's transformed it in some way
and in our case it's just to make it
uppercase I so again very very simple
stuff to understand these operators
let's try another one called pluck and
so let's say your observable emits an
array of objects with multiple
properties but you only need a single
property so you can pluck that property
from the original observable and return
a new observable with just that property
so this is what the marble diagram looks
like for that coming down here pluck
alright so we have an object with a
property name of one with a value of 1
and also here same thing these are all
called V you want to pluck just V well
here we go we have the values that are
returned are 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so let's go ahead
and try that eye by adjusting our code a
bit more so this time instead of just
creating an observable from observable
let's use one of the other creation
operators we haven't used so you can
create an and observable using what's
called from and this is a creation
operator so from and then we're going to
include pluck instead of add or map
rather and then let's go ahead and get
rid of all this
and we're going to say from and we're
gonna pass in an array of objects so the
first will be first we'll name the
property first so first name would be
Gary last would be Simon age 34 I'm
getting old
and then I'll use shift alt and down
twice and I'll just change these two
properties here so Jane and John I'm
gonna leave the other ones the same I
don't feel like adjusting those so then
we can use the pluck operator on this so
we'll say pluck first being the name of
the for the property that's from this
array of objects so we're just going to
take that one and then we're going to
subscribe to this newly transformed
I'm observable so the the original
observable is still here but we just
this right here will return a new
observable that we're going to subscribe
to so xne you know the drill at this
point and we'll say add item X so now
it's only going to return Garry Jane and
John the values from the first property
alright let's try one more and so we're
gonna try one called skip until and this
is an operator it's a little bit more
complex than the previous examples but
it's the last one we're gonna try and it
allows you to start emitting events from
one observable based on when a second
observable begins emitting events so
let's try updating our code i from here
so we're just going to use an observable
from observable and let's replicate this
two more times the second observable
let's go ahead and use a subject this
time and again it's an observable it's
just a special type of observable and
then we're also going to import interval
and you'll see how this comes into play
all right and then we're going to import
the operator we want to use skip until
all right so now let's go ahead I'm
going to gut everything here and we're
going to say observable one is
observable and this is one that's gonna
be created just from the create operator
data type any and inside of here of our
I equals one and then we're going to say
set interval data dot next I plus plus
so it's just going to start event I'm
omitting these events or which are
simply going to be introvert all right
integers that increase by one and they
will do that every one second all right
so that's the first observable now let's
go ahead and create a subject observer
or observable rather so var observable
to equals new subject and then we're
going to create this subject after a
certain amount of time so set timeout
and we'll say observable too and we're
not going to create it rather I meant
we're going to emit a value after three
seconds so observable to and because if
you remember subjects can as they can
act as observers and that they can
produce so we can put next hey and I'll
do that in three seconds and then we're
going to use our skip until so we're
going to create a new observable from
observable one dot skip until observable
to begins emitting its first value
alright so then we can subscribe to new
observable so we'll say subscribe
X any I keep on doing now to put an
underline or an underscore rather and
then we'll put ad item X alright so the
thing that an important thing to note
here is that observable to does get
created at the same time but it doesn't
actually emit a value so it has to emit
a value in order for observable one to
actually start being displayed and
you'll see that here so if we say that
we go through three seconds and then it
starts producing values and it will only
produce a value until this right here
gets met that this this subject starts
producing values so if you change this
to five seconds
you count one two three four five there
it goes it starts emitting those values
so this of course is just one of many
operators that you can use that
dramatically allow you to control how
your observables and how you respond to
the events and values that the
observables are emitting over time
all right so hopefully you found that
crash course into rxjs useful because
now going forward especially on my own
channel we're going to be expanding on
be covering rxjs i in relation to
angular and i'm also going to be
creating actual practical practical
example projects using what we've
learned with these observables and the
subjects in operators alright so as
always if you enjoyed it make sure you
