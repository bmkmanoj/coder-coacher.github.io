most likely run into a scenario in which
you need to use the same code across
multiple components so you may even need
to share data between these components
or you may need to fetch data from a
database of some sort so it's these
times when creating an angular service
makes sense so in angular service it's
simply a function that allows you to
access its defined properties and
methods and it also helps keep your
coding organized so with that said let's
go ahead and get started so this
tutorial is a part of our free angular 4
course and we've already established a
project that was generated with the
angular community interface so I'm going
to assume if you're following along with
this course that you've already done
that
so if not use the angular CLI to
generate a project and then you can hop
right in so it allows us to generate the
angular CLI that is a service so it
takes care of some of the manual labor
involved with service creations so to
create a service we want to hop in at
the project folder and simply type ng G
for generate the type of is going to be
to be a service and then the name of our
service something that would be relevant
based on what it's doing so I'm just
going to call this data hit enter okay
so now upon running it you may see at
the bottom it says warning services
generated but not provided it must be
provided B to be used so what this means
is we're going to hop into the project
with our code editor and we want to go
to app dot module TS and so we have to
import it in our app module file so
import and then the name of it well what
is the name of our service well if we
click right here we'll see we have data
service ts defined and we'll see that it
says export class data service that is
the name that we need to import so I'm
just going to paste that right here and
then from the location of the file and
then that will be data dot service
alright not done yet once we've imported
it then we also have to add it to the
providers array so data service alright
great so let's go ahead save that and
now let's work within the actual data
service file itself okay so it looks
actually fairly similar let me increase
the size just a bit to a component
except that it's importing and
injectable as we can see on line one and
also it's using it as a decorator on
line three all right so the injectable
decorator simply emits metadata
associated with this given service which
lets angular know if it needs to inject
other dependency and into this service
so we're not going to be injecting any
dependencies into this simple example
service that we're about to create but
it's recommended to leave the injectable
decorator for future proofing and to
ensure consistency but you could get rid
of lines 1 and 3 and our service would
still work so ordinarily at this point
you know you may connect to a database
to return some results but to keep
things simple here let's hard-code our
own array and create a simple method so
underneath the constructor let's just
say we have an array called cars all
right inside of it we'll have Ford
maybe we'll have Chevrolet Buick
etcetera you get the point all right
let's that our semi go in there and then
let's create a method of some sort so
what's the save my data and we'll return
a simple string this is my data man all
right so that is all our very pathetic
instable service is going to be alright
so ordinarily you'd have a lot of
different imports up here if it were an
actual service like for connecting to a
database but just for now just to help
you understand the concept of a service
we're just keeping things simple here ok
so now at this point we need to actually
use the service in
one of our components that's the whole
point so let's bring our sidebar up here
and let's go to our app component es
alright great so in order to use a
service it has to be imported so again
we could just real quickly go back to
our app module copy this line here and
paste it alright now we can actually use
it first we have to use it through
dependency injection which is done
through the constructor so we add a
constructor here alright and then inside
of it we simply add private and then
we'll create a name to access this
service so we'll call it status service
and data service which is coming from
what we imported up here the name of it
alright so now we can access it let me
go ahead and get rid of this real
quickly that's from the previous lesson
and to use it let's use the ng on an it
lifecycle hook this simply means that
anything define within this method
called ng on an it I will run when the
component loads so let's go ahead and
access the cars array that we created so
we'll just console.log it for now this
data service dot cars
alright let's also create a property of
some sort that we can use in our
template up here through interpolation
so let's create a name some property
type string make it equal nothing and
then when this is ran on ng on an it
will say this that some property equals
this data service and we'll call that
method my data
all right great so save come up to our
template we'll get rid of our h1 we'll
just add a P tag and through
interpolation some property alright
let's go back to our console make sure
you save it will run ng serve if you
don't have it currently running all
right there should be no errors showing
up if there are then just you know
ascertain what it is based on the error
use google video figure out just go
through back through the steps make sure
you there's no typos or you didn't miss
in any steps though if everything turns
out good here as it is online go to the
browser and go to localhost 4200 and we
can see we have our method returning our
string right here and then if we a
control shift I go to the console we can
see our array that was coming out here
with Ford Chevrolet and Buick all right
so this in a nutshell or how angular
services work so you create services
that are specific to a given purpose and
which can be reused across multiple
components in your angular app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
