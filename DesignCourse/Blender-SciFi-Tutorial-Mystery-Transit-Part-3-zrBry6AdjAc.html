today we're going to finish up in
blender and then step into Photoshop to
add some final touches and I to the
scene and just make it look a little bit
more interesting alright so check out
design course comm if you haven't yet
and subscribe here on YouTube alright
get started alright so there were a
couple things that I experimented with
and I want to change up the node
structure for this main texture right
here not the biggest part of our model
so what I'm gonna do is just zoom up
here just so we can get a better look at
what's going on alright so the first
thing I want to do is switch the diffuse
and this an Co tropic I think that's how
to pronounce it never hurt anybody yet
so I'm just going off my own whim I want
to switch both of these reversed some so
ctrl left click oh and do I have my
screencast keys up it doesn't look like
it let me go me all right there they are
alright so let me go ahead and yeah so I
wasn't really happy again with how the
material that was presented we couldn't
really see the image texture at all so
what we're gonna do is just change these
up a little again so control left-click
and we severed those so now it's just
switch both of these and we're gonna
move this one to the bottom shader and
this diffuse is going to go here to the
top now we're gonna change this now we
have two diffuses which doesn't make
sense so what we'll do is just delete
this one shift a and I want it to be a
lot shinier than was so we're gonna add
a shader glossy and connect that up
alright so also I want to reverse the
position of these two so the mix shader'
needs to go on the bottom here so if I
just take control
left click both of those stick this on
the top one and revert this Rousseau's
0.227 will work for this
over here I'm gonna make this kind of
like a blue $1 blue color right around
there will work I zero point I'm gonna
change this to 0.15 we can leave this at
0.5 and all the rest same we change this
from 0.2 to 0.1 and again I did this
through experimenting so there's no you
know whenever whatever this looks this
view looks like up here when you render
it I that's the part of experimenting
basically so you can see it's already a
lot more glossy so up here is where we
want to connect our image texture
alright so roughness is zero all right
so this FAC value we want to be 0.5 that
way we see the texture more alright so
I'm gonna leave that 0.5 all right and
that looks pretty good for now so
there's some other adjustments I want to
make now I'm just gonna pull this down
real quick real quickly I'm gonna take
this outer container right click it I'm
gonna hit s for our sx/4 rather X and
then for just to make it wider all right
just like that and also these little
lights these pixels that are showing up
I want to real quickly come over here to
the render settings we're gonna make
this zero for the direct and the
indirect I'm gonna make it point one
three we can see that seems to do a
better job and then also we're gonna
come over here to the world setting just
make this black again alright so I'm
going to hit zero to get out of that
view and hit 5 on the number pad and
then we lose everything
let's go
back to solid there we go all right
around there all right go back to
rendered okay so that's looking pretty
good for now is switch over to solid
mode and make everything everything that
we're about to replicate at least a part
of the same object so we're just gonna
be joining objects here so the way I'm
going to do this is I'm gonna hit a and
then B and then just select everything
here and we want to make sure we can
deselect the portions that we don't want
to be duplicate or replicated rather so
just I all have to do is shift
right-click a B and do it again shift
right-click this portion we don't want
this sorry I screwed that up again B
select everything all right shift and
right click may have to do it twice to
deselect that and over here we don't
want this big beam portion and for some
reason is only deselecting if I just did
it out here so and then we want to
deselect the area light and that is
right here oops
and if it's doing that he just hit shift
in area right here alright so now we
have all of our lights and our object
here selected and what we want to do is
just duplicate this so shift D enter and
then move it down and we'll do it a few
more times
shifty enter I'm gonna hide real quick
our cylinder I think it's seven there it
is for me it was ice five and shifty
enter shifty enter
and I think right around there is fine
bring back our cylinder right there
alright so I'm going to hit zero and
for some reason I think has to do with
the length of everything if I use my
scroll wheel it's like going up way too
high I there we go if you hit ctrl and
then middle mouse button you get finer
control on that if you're facing that
same issue I want to adjust this so that
and we'll see right around there I'll
see what this looks like at the rendered
view
and let me turn it just a little bit
maybe right around there
maybe a little bit more trying to make
sure this edge kind of just cuts off
over there all right
yeah and I think that looks pretty
decent in and of itself all right
so now what I want to do is switch over
here to the render section and I have my
render at 800 I think I'm gonna leave it
there and I'm gonna render it at a
resolution of 1280 by 720 make sure this
is at a hundred percent and yeah this
should be good to go
so I under performance if you're using
GPU you can change the tiles to 256 by
256 and we'll go ahead and hit render so
this may take a while so I'm gonna pause
until it is finished alright and there's
the image so what I want to do now is we
want to save this so just hit f3 and I'm
going to name this I just actual showed
up PNG save as image and then we're
going to step into Photoshop and one
second let me get that brought over to
the screen right here alright and so now
we want to open that image alright and
this is the full size so if i zoom out
here you could see everything alright so
this step obviously is optional nom you
don't really necessarily have to do this
but I this is just a fun way to come in
and do into some additional work
afterwards and I make it look a little
bit more interesting so I really it's
just a matter of experimenting with
adjustment layers primarily so if we
click on adjustment layers over here go
to windows adjustments I we can start
playing around with some of the settings
so brightness and contrast for instance
we can
make it a little bit brighter maybe take
the contrast down as well alright and we
can also duplicate this layer right
click and hit duplicate or I have a
hockey setup ctrl shift D ok go to
filter blur and Gaussian blur maybe
right around there about 4.7 pixels and
real quickly I'm going to take the
eraser tool I'm going to hide this
background layer or the original layer
and I'm gonna start just removing almost
everything outside of the laser beam
portion or whatever you want to call it
now there's probably more if there's a
more efficient way of doing this and the
compositor of blender but for now
I just going to use a Photoshop and we
can also change the layer blend mode and
we can create some interesting eye looks
on this
as you can see just using the down arrow
to experiment with these and whatever
you think works best just go ahead with
it so I'm just gonna go through this one
more time you can use color dodge seems
to work alright and you can also kind of
create sort of a and artificial no again
this could have been done in blender
through the camera settings by adding
focus but you can add sort of like an
artificial focus on this if you wish and
the way you can do that actually before
I do that I want to make a few other
adjustments you can still really play
around with the these other photo filter
for instance these other adjustment
layers you can see how this this these
different filters will affect the
appearance so if you use your down arrow
key you can go through these and if
there's something that you like you can
decide it you can go ahead and use that
I you can also specify color in which
you can see it's very subtle the way it
affects everything but that's up for you
to decide if that's an improvement or
not I'm not going to use it in the other
one I did but I and I'm not gonna use it
for this one so so now what I want to do
I think I'll go ahead and create that
that blur effect coming over here so
what I want to do is real quickly I'm
just going to group these layers and
duplicate them I'm gonna merge this top
one and hide the bottom one and you can
use the blur tool make it like a larger
maybe twelve hundred and the strength is
right now at one hundred and you'll see
how that kind of works if you just
left-click and hold a little bit
I you probably want it to be a little
bit more subtle of an effect so you can
see if I just click a couple times
that's probably most ideal that way it
doesn't become exaggerated the view of
it alright so this is at 100% and looks
pretty cool so I'm going to consider
that a complete render it's a little bit
different though pretty similar to the
original ash at the beginning of the
first video but yeah that is it
hopefully you learned a lot um subscribe
here at YouTube if you haven't and check
out design course comm for more
tutorials
alright I'll see you later good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
