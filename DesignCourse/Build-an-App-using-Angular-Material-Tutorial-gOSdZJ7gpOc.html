comma today we're going to build a very
simple app based on angular material now
angular material is simply Google's
material design made to use for angular
projects all right so let's go ahead and
check out the project that we're going
to be creating and learning angular
material in this tutorial okay so here
it is in my browser and temporarily I
just added some padding here so this is
more of a mobile sort of layout and this
is based on material design components
so we have the material design toolbar
here with a menu here in certain icons
that we can define along with material
design icons right here we also see some
icons down here this is from a font also
we have these material design cards so
these are based on cards this sort of
gallery that we have here we can like
them and we can change the colors we can
delete these if we wish and then we also
have material design tabs right here and
also a couple of form elements just to
show you and integrating these is really
easy as you will find out if you follow
along in this tutorial all right so
let's get started okay so here in the
command line you're going to run node -
B and NPM - v2 check to see if you have
node installed and NPM installed as well
if not if these goes unrecognized go to
no js' org and download either the
Windows or the Mac version install it
all the way through and usually by
default the node package manager will be
included and then reload your console
your command lines and then come back
and run these and this should give you a
version number and then also ng for the
angular CLI command line interface - V
will also give you a version number if
not you simply have to run NPM install
global which means you only have to do
this once the angular CLI and then hit
enter and then you can run ng - B and
it'll give you some type of output like
this
assuming you're all ready to go our
first step is to
we'll create the project so we'll go
ahead type in ng nu and the project name
for this we'll go ahead and name it
Anji - material now this does take a
little bit time to download and install
everything so I'm going to pause it and
come right back alright once complete
will CD into Anji - material and then
we'll go ahead and NPM install we'll
save it to the package.json at angular
material alright once that is complete
we can go to our code editor and we have
to import angular material to our app
module ts file so inside of Visual
Studio code or your code editor whatever
that may be
we'll go ahead to the source app and
then app module TF now up here we have
all of our different imports and I'll go
just up here and paste in import the
material module from angular material
and then we will also have to add it to
our imports in the ng model decorator so
just after HTTP module Laden material
module for route alright we'll save it
now because angular material has
potential touch gestures worked into
their components it requires hammer Jas
and so we have to use NPM to install
that so let's go back to our console and
we'll type in NPM real quickly NPM
install save it to our dependencies and
package adjacent and then hammer Jas and
then also one more time npm install
we'll save as a dev dependency at types
forward slash hammer jf okay so now
we'll go ahead back to our code editor
and we need to import camera Jas here in
app module PS file so import hammer jf
and then save also we need to go to the
TF config JSON file and right under we
have to add in a property called types
so types pop it up in brackets hammer jf
and then save now when you're working
with material design if you know you
won't be using any material design icons
you can skip this step but if you do
want these icons we need to include the
material icon font in index.html if you
want to browse these icons you can go to
material to i/o four slash icons and
there's a lot of them that you can use
so we're going to use a few of these in
our own project so what we need to do is
head on over to index.html right here
and just right here I'm going to paste
in our font right here I also want to
include a font called
Roboto which material design uses and we
can see we have several different
weights here all right so go ahead and
save that
and now at our console we'll go ahead
and run ng serve and then in our browser
localhost 4200 we can see the current
results now as you can see it's really
ugly but that's expected because we
don't have anything going for it yet so
now what we're going to do is switch
back to our code editor and we're going
to create a data dot JSON file now this
of course is not mandatory when working
with ng material but for the purpose of
emulating a real world environment such
as a real project we're going to create
a data JSON file for declaring a list of
thumbnails and descriptions this could
be you know it could be a blog post in
our case it's just going to be a list of
thumbnails and descriptions and that's
about it
just basically screenshots for some type
of game browsing app so later on we'll
iterate through this using ng4 in the
template and place them within angular
material cards so let's go ahead and
create a file not named data jason
inside of the source folder so I'll
create specify the name here data Jason
and I'm going to copy and paste this in
here and save it now I grab this of
course from the course set row tutorial
page it's a written tutorial for this
tutorial and so if you want to head on
over there this is linked in the YouTube
description if you're not already
looking at it that way you can just
easily copy and then paste this in okay
so next up we need to import a material
design theme and material and angular
material offers multiple they offer one
called indigo pink deep purple amber
purple green pink blue grey silly names
but we're going to use the one that's
called a deep purple amber so we need to
open up the source styles.css and we'll
import that right here go ahead and save
and then we also need to start off by
creating the angular material toolbar
okay so we're going to hop into app
component HTML we'll get rid of this h1
and to create a toolbar through your
material design we do MD - toolbar we're
going to give it a color attribute and
make it primary and go ahead and close
that off and then inside we're going to
give it a span which is going to be for
a title and we'll just name it
game viewer alright save that now let's
go ahead and also add a material menu so
over here you can see I have the browser
window just so we can see what's
happening live so we add in span class
equals spacer and we'll define this in
our
or CSS and a little bit and then also we
open up the button MD - icon - button
and then we do property binding of nd
menu trigger for equals menu and then we
close the button and inside of it we'll
put in MD icon and then we specify the
name of the icon which you can get that
from the material icons page that I
showed you earlier
and this one is just the three vertical
buttons
let's save you'll see I it's going to be
right next to it instead of right
aligned over here and this is where we
define the span class spacer in the
style - CSS so we'll come here and put
spacer I'm just going to copy and paste
this in real quick and the space on a
flex box right here layout and so by
adding this here in the middle it's
going to take up any space between just
these two elements so if we save it
you'll see now it's over there now if we
click it we can see nothing happens
because we don't have any menu items
inside of it so let's go ahead and add
that now so instead of me typing all
this out because it is quite a bit I'm
just going to paste it from the tutorial
page and just to describe what's
happening here basically we have in the
MD - menu I bound binding menu to MD
menu here and we have a button for each
item that we want to show up and they're
all contained within buttons and so then
inside we also have an MD icon and again
we're getting these names from the
material icon font page this is a
fingerprint for a login and we also have
an announcement for issues and then
notifications off or disabled or and
it's just to show you what something
looks like when it's disabled so we'll
save this and momentarily it'll load and
we can click this and there we go we
have our icons along with the labels
right here now we click them of course
nothing happens because we don't
have any type of quick event binding to
them okay so moving on we're going to go
ahead and create some angular material
tabs so just underneath our tool bar
here right in this section let's go
ahead and I'm going to put an MD tab
group and we'll close that off and
inside depending on how many different
tabs you want we specify MD tab label
equals we'll make this one gallery and
then close this off we'll copy this
paste it right there and we'll make this
one maybe like a settings page so if we
save it you should see fairly quickly
what this looks like and you can see the
styles are already applied to it and
it's very smooth
so now let's displays a gallery right
here and it's going to grab this
information from the data to JSON file
that we created and we'll use HTTP to
fetch the results from the data JSON
file so what we need to do I'm going to
open this up all the way just so we have
some more work words from a room to work
with here and we're going to go to app
component TS and the first thing when
you do is to import HTTP from the
angular HTTP library just like that and
then after that we have to create a
property I'm going to remove this
default one here will make space screens
you can name this whatever in two
screens if you want I of type array any
and then we have our constructor and
inside we're going to use dependency
injection for our HTTP up top that we
imported then we can use it inside and
say this HTTP GET and
and this is where we reference our data
JSON file and then we map response to
response dot JSON and we'll grab
screenshots from it and then subscribe
res to this space screens equals res so
we'll go ahead and save this all right
and now we'll come back here and nothing
shows the course because we're not doing
what we need to do in the HTML right
here yet so now we have to iterate
through these using ng four and we're
going to embed these in material design
cards so to start off with this will
have MD - card and ng for let space
screen of space screens I'm going to
open this up just a bit right here and
then also a semicolon because we want to
get the index let I equal index and
close that off and then inside of there
we're going to have first the image so
image MD card image source equals and I
have the source of the images just
embedded right inside of the data JSON
file and so through interpolation with
screw a pair of squiggly brackets we
have space screen
IMG and close that off to save it here
and as
working images because I haven't yet
imported the images that it uses inside
of the angular material source assets we
need to create an images folder so you
can either create that here through your
code editor or just go into your folders
here make an images folder then I'm
going to paste in the three images I can
use and by the way you can download the
project file to access these and make
sure just name you know the same name
space one two and three we'll go ahead
out of there let's go ahead and refresh
and there we go okay so continuing on
let's go ahead and keep on adding so I'm
going to paste in right here the section
for a description so it's md card
content we have a paragraph tag with
interpolation of space screen
description and then after that we also
have empty cards actions and inside of
there we place in our buttons so we'll
have a button of md button click event
which is event binding to a method
called like me and we'll pass along the
index here which is why we had let i
equal index and then inside of there
we're going to put in an HTML element
class equals material - icons MD 18 this
is a size class and then class red -
color property binding to space screen
dot light here equals one and then we'll
give it a MD icon of the favorite icon
and then close out the eye and we'll say
like so what's happening here basically
when somebody clicks on this button
right here it will call like me and we
have to create that will create that
momentarily and what it will do is
toggle on and off this class here based
on a property values on space screen
whether or not if it's uh if it's 1 or a
zero all right so let's continue on
we're just going to copy this real quick
we're going to create like a delete
button alright so we'll change this here
to just delete me just to keep things
consistent right there and we don't have
to change I'm not going to change any
type of property or their color rather
so I'm going to get rid of that this one
is going to be named delete and then
we'll change this to delete all right
and then we'll go ahead and save and
we'll see what this looks like
there we go okay now let's hop into the
component control B here go to our
component file and let's create those
two methods I'm just going to paste them
in real quickly here so we have like me
passing in I and this is just toggling
on/off probably do this through a
ternary operator and I have a for now
just like that and then delete me all
we're using is splice just to remove I
the item here based on which whoever one
was clicked which is the purpose for
passing in the I argument ok let's save
and we'll come over here
now this nothing's going to happen we
have to add a class of red color so what
we'll do is go to our Styles CSS and
we'll specify red dash color color red
save it
this will reload and let's click it
there we go
so of course you would probably in a
real world environment do more than just
change the icon color the purpose of
binding it to a
method in our component is so that for
instance we could pass along the I and
then we can persist that that preference
that the person liked in some sort of
database you would do that in here but
obviously that would go beyond the scope
of this tutorial so what we want to do
now next is I create the settings
content so we have that tab over here
and it's empty so oh by the way check
out the delete just to make sure that
work works here and it does all right so
let's create these settings content so
we'll go back to our HTML and down here
we have the tab settings I'm just going
to paste in what I have here from the
written tutorial and this is very simple
we just have a heading h1 tag or element
rather and then just a paragraph and
then a label the label would be
associated with a let's see over here
some type of form element right now it's
not a style but we'll do that shortly
and so now just to get some experience
working with angular material form
components let's go ahead and add in a
slider the way we'll do that it's just
underneath here we'll put in MD - slider
and then we have a bunch of values that
we can pass through and you can check
out the angular material documentation
for all the possible attributes that you
can add here so show takes equals true
is one of them by the by default that is
false so we're going to make it true max
is say for example if you want to go
from a hundred from a min of zero we
could specify that step equals one some
label equals true value equals eighteen
and we can just going to give a default
value from which to start in real world
scenario if you were saving this in a
database you would fetch this and in the
database and put it there through
binding of some sort
all right and let's I closed that off
save first I do need to close this tag
right here so MD slider and right here
we have our slider very ugly we'll fix
that though and then let's also add one
more just died right here and this one
will add a toggle so that is MD - slide
- toggle some setting of a label here
and then close it out as you can see
it's very simple to define these things
all right now let's go back after saving
and we have our toggle working okay so
let's go ahead and give this some Styles
just a few of them and our styles of CSS
and there's just three of them and I'm
going to copy this and paste that here
so we have the empty slider horizontal
class here the label and also page
padding all right
the page padding we have to add this div
ID so let's go back to right here I
forgot to add it right here div ID
equals page padding just because it
looked like things are a little bit up -
up against the the sides there for my
taste so I wrapped everything inside of
a div here so now we'll save it notice
how it's pretty close like that do not
like that so we bring it in that way so
now this is 100% and things are spaced
out a little bit better better label etc
okay so now let's go ahead and obviously
in a real world scenario you may want to
customize the theme based on the color
theme of whatever company or project
you're working for so the way you do
that is to create a custom sass file or
SPSS
and we can define your commonly used
colors or your projects theme based on
that so we have to create a custom theme
CSS in the same folder as our Styles at
CSS so I'm going to go ahead and create
that so it's going to be named custom
theme s CSS not CSS remember and I'm
just going to paste in because there's
quite a bit here and I'm going to save
this but what's happening here is we're
importing our angular material all theme
and at the MD core and then basically
your customizations go here so we have a
primary accent and Warren and we're
declaring palettes here so for our
primary color scheme right here we have
MD indigo for our accent we have pink
and so you may be wondering where is it
getting this information from or what is
it at all so just to show you real quick
this is at the material Daioh guidelines
for styles and so if we come down we
could see the color palette and so for
instance if we go to indigo we'll see
it's this kind of blueish team obviously
indigo color and we have different
values here in terms of saturation that
we can pass along so we can change this
to any of these names here and they
should work so that's how that works and
after that you pass along your
customizations here to MD light theme
and then finally you include this app
theme variable right here so if we want
this to work we have one more step and
we have to go head on over to the
angular CLI JSON file and we add this
under styles so we put a comma here and
then custom theme dot at CSS and we save
this group
to the command line we hit control-c and
hit y to terminate and then run ng serve
again and I will reload it and we'll
come back and just minimize this and
there we go
so now we can see that this changed
colors here if we go to settings we can
also see we have the pink accent color
here and this works on you know these
certain types of elements that are using
it so if we go back here to custom theme
and also go back to the color theme
let's try making the primary palette for
instance this teal color so we'll
specify eel and we'll save it and there
we go
great so of course we only touched on
just a few but really the most important
fundamental factors of working with
angular material but if you go to
material dot angular geo and go to
components you'll see the full list of
what they offer in these five different
categories for form controls navigation
layout buttons icons indicators pop-up
modules etc so you know they have a lot
of really interesting things that you
can use here and integrate very easily
into your apps and there's API
references here and there's also
examples from which you can click over
here to view source and view the HTML
the typescript code here and your
component you know to achieve whatever
this result is here as well as any type
of CSS that's needed alright hopefully
you enjoyed learning angular material
here obviously there's a lot more to
learn but if you enjoyed it make sure
