calm today we have a quick tip video
tutorial and we're gonna be focusing on
a site called tiny P&amp;amp;G calm and what it
allows you to do is to take all of your
websites PNG files whether the 8 bit or
24 bit and upload them and it will
compress them down usually between 50 to
80 percent of their original size while
still maintaining the same level of
quality all right so basically if you
haven't yet check out design course comm
subscribe here on YouTube and real
quickly I'm going to go over the service
and there's also a photoshop plugin as
well that you can use all right so get
started
alright so this is the website tiny PNG
calm and all I have to do is just buy
groups of 20 dragged on to this area the
PNG files that you want to optimize so
basically I in Windows here I have the
Explorer out the file explorer and this
is the images folder for my website and
so what you want to do is basically sort
it by type so I have PNG files I think
there's like 42 or yeah 42 right here I
just copied those and I created two new
folders originals and new and basically
paste of all the PNG files into the new
folder and this will also allow you to
right click it go to properties kind of
see what I what the file size is right
here it's just 65.9 kay alright so what
you want to do is go into that folder
we'll get this in here we sort by list
and you can only I upload 20 at a time
so what you want to do is just hold
shift that's 35 items so oops no there
we go 20 right there alright and just
left-click and drag it on there and what
it does is gives you the file name the
original file size here and then the new
file size and then it
you the file size the the decreased
percentage basically and so I must have
uploaded one too many on that last one
many has you can see it really saved
just from those 20 files 22 KB which is
huge so what you would do is just click
this a bunch of times and it would
download all these into your downloads
folder whatever you have set for your I
your actual browser so now what you
would do then is just go back to the
file explorer and select the rest and
drag it on there and then the same thing
will happen so I did this earlier and
what I found is that it decreased the
file size of those 42 files and down
from 65.9 KB to roughly 22 Kb so it's
saving over 50 KB per visitor so that's
obviously kind of huge so especially if
you have a lot more images on your site
so I also come over here to photoshop
there is a plug-in that they have as
well and it does cost money though it
allows you to export to PNG and that is
it basically so this is something that
I'm going to basically use from now on
and it's just like a no-brainer I detest
these optimized images are up on my site
design course comm so I the logo and all
the graphics for the form and such these
are all basically already optimized and
you cannot tell any type of difference
and it also works with 24-bit alpha
transparency so that works alright so
yeah just a very quick tutorial here and
I'll see you guys tomorrow with a new
video if you haven't yet check out
design course comm and subscribe here on
youtube if you haven't alright goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
