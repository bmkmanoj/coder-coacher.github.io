course calm today we're going to do our
final mock-up in Photoshop and that's
going to be the actual interface where a
person is logged in and they could see
potential matches for bartering alright
so if you haven't yet check out design
course comm and subscribe here on
YouTube ok so let's go ahead and open up
basically any of the actual eye or my
adhere yeah home step 1
so the first mock-up that we made we can
open that up and what we want to do is
save this as a new document and we'll
call this eye what's call this login
home like as in logged in and this is
going to be the first page I see not
this but you know what we're about to
design so I basically we're going to
have three links over here for the menu
it's going to be edit my barter my
account and then log out so we don't
want to center align this logo anymore
we'll left align it so we'll go ahead
and get our grid out with the move tool
you can deselect auto select as long as
well let's see here one second oh yeah
we'll go ahead and click this icon here
to lock that so we so we can't move it
rather or select it so if we click on
here we'll have layer 1 should rename
Matt's logo we'll move that over right
there ok and then at the top here let me
go ahead and hide the grid temporarily
and we'll go ahead and put my account
and then put a few spaces we'll do this
with margin and CSS and then logout and
real quickly I'm going to right align
that and let's get our grid out again
and we'll move this right there
and then before this portion well first
we're going to get in there and copy
that space between those letters paste
that in here control V and then put edit
my barter all right so let's hide this
again oops and we'll get rid of let me
get 100% here we're going to get rid of
all the underlines for that portion
because I really want edit my barter to
stand out so we'll give it a different
color as well so let me go to characters
or window character and take that off
and we'll also make it bold and we will
change the color here to this green
except a little bit darker right around
there
all right so let me go ahead and zoom
out just to see what this looks like so
far oh forget about that portion all
right
all right looks pretty good all right so
now I I'm going to delete some of these
layers so with auto-select layer on and
move tool so I delete some of these this
one go ahead and I'm going to make this
a group so I'm going to take I this this
and this
hit ctrl G well let's call this button
and hide this temporarily and I what
happened here
there we go and basically I want I you
know each of the matches when it comes
to the bar doors I want those to kind of
stick out a little bit so I'm going to
give the background underneath this
navigation area just a very light gray
so I'm going to come down here at the
very bottom and I'm going to take the
rectangle tool and we're going to change
the foreground color to something
lighter
you know maybe right around Edie Edie
Edie for the hex code we'll hit OK and
I'm going to hold all and just left
click and drag and just down here around
that size all right and then I also want
to hit ctrl shift n or command shift
then for a new I layer mask so click
that and this is going to be search bar
I guess all right so hit OK and we'll
take the rectangle tool again except
this time the color is going to be
pretty dark so - a - a - a I think that
will work well and then just just above
this area we'll hold the Alt key and
then just drag to the right roughly
around that size okay take control H
twice if you have those bounding box
views so up here is going to be the city
state a area where they can a check box
where they can specify ignore the
location and then a button that says
update results so let's go ahead and
design for that real quick I'm going to
zoom up here
alright the width of it in terms of the
grid is not going to be too important so
I'm not going to worry about that I so
I'm going to make the color white here I
hope that doesn't change that first I'm
just going to take the rounded rectangle
tool seven should be okay for the border
radius and just right around here I'm
going to hold all and just drag out
roughly around this size alright I'm
going to change the foreground color to
white and I'll take the move tool just
move it and adjust it with the up and
down arrow keys and inside of it make
sure you hit ctrl H twice so that the
bounding box is not view visible and
then just click in here we'll left align
it I'm just going to put in a city name
and let's go ahead and that city will
base of whatever is filled here in this
text box will be based on their location
from that second step alright and then
I'm going to take these two ctrl shift D
or right click and duplicate both of
those move them over here and this is
going to be the state so I'll just put a
oh hi oh and that is going to be a
drop-down selection so over here I'm
just going to take the pen tool real
quickly and just put it down
icon holding shift for each of those
three and if it's a little bit off you
can take the direct selection tool of
course control H here and just select
this and just adjust them adjust them if
you need to I to make that even okay so
we'll go ahead and put this over here
make it maybe like a lighter gray color
again this isn't exactly what they're
going to look like so this is just kind
of you know just for the mock-up just to
get an idea alright and then we're going
to have a check box over here to the
right and by default it's not going to
be checked so just take your the regular
rectangle tool and hold alt and just
make a and shift and just make a you
know the size of like an average HTML
check box
make it white and we're going to make
the text here right to the right of it
ignore location and if that is checked
off then it's going to show them matches
that are not based on you know city or
state and also I am going to make it so
that they can just specify a state
without specifying a city that way that
gives them some leeway in terms of
filtering results alright so then over
here we're going to take a and just put
a button and it's going to we're going
to label it update results so I let's
see here we'll get out our button that
we hidden we hid from earlier which is
right here we're going to have to scale
it down and mess with a little bit so
problem now so I'm going to zoom up here
100% and so let's see here what we can
do is let me take that down first I'm
just going to update it to update
results and then I'm going to take
everything take the whole group hit ctrl
T hold shift and scale that down roughly
right around here alright and lures that
I write here okay I that's a stroke so
the stroke needs adjusted we're going to
put like one for the stroke width or
maybe like 1.5 all right that's better
and I'm going to take the direct
selection tool select on button control
H just select the right side use your
key and kind of just push that over a
little bit with the arrow keys alright
so now I let me zoom out see what we
have going so far alright so far so good
okay so now what we want to do is take I
say it took me a while to figure out how
I wanted to lay this out so I had my
wife come up to help me think about this
but I so basically there's going to be
two sections where it lists out
potential
matches for barters the top is going to
be 100% matches and that's going to be
people who need what you have and have
what you need essentially and then
beneath it is going to be 50% matches
that's going to be they are there have
what you want or they either want what
you're offering and the reason I guess
the idea behind that is you know if you
forgot to leave out something you know
like you're you don't want to mow grass
for example but you might be willing to
based on you know what they need so it's
just going to list out two areas here so
if anybody has a better way of coming up
with that you know let us know although
just for the purpose of this tutorial
I'm not going to be too you know crazy
about it so I up here I'm just going to
change this text right now to 100%
matches and I'm going to left align it
and I'm going to scale down the size
just a well actually let me just leave
it there temporarily for now and then
over here I'm just going to put like a
parenthesis and people who need what you
have and have what you need yeah I'm
going to take this and make the size
more like to try 28 take this 100% match
this part and make that bold all right
and then we're going to move it over and
we're going to put an icon there and
it's just going to be like a hundred
percent
I like circle here ellipse so just take
your ellipse and hold shift scale it
around there make the color our green
color control H all right and let me get
rid of this text down here so just
delete that okay so I let's see what we
have okay so down here we're going to
have the way I have you know I set it up
is each of the potential matches are
going to take up four columns so there
will be three on each row
basically so we'll take the rectangle
tool and we will simply hold alt and
drag out right around this size all
right we'll make it white for the
foreground color control H get rid of
that hide the grid let's zoom up here to
100% and we want to give it a stroke so
I'm going to come over here put in
stroke and make it one take the stroke
color right around here D 0 D 0 D 0 okay
and hit OK alright so inside of here
we'll go ahead and put there once the
size of that is a little bit too big so
I'm going to make it maybe 20 and then
underneath it we'll put in exercise
machine babysitter
whatever and let's format that text
differently so we'll make this just a
light make the size I
let's try 16 here all right see what
that looks like maybe I put some space
in between those two lines so we can
take this over here try like now try 24
and let's um that looks pretty good you
can move it in so the padding here is
even from left on top and then I what
else I was just going to duplicate that
control shift D is the shortcut key I
have set up for that will put their
offers right here and we'll put it down
here I lawn-mowing I I haven't come up
with this yet so I'm just coming up on
top of my head let me see here
and I have a nasty mind I'm not going to
do it um
we'll just lawn-mowing I general
housework there we go I maybe will put
another one here how about what are
things people willing to do in exchange
for an exercise machine or babysitter
general housework mow the lawn aye me am
I am i stalling okay fine
tickle feet that's how demented I am
okay so now we'll take it all so real
quickly what I just did there this is a
huge tip if you ever want to select a
layer when you don't have auto-select
layer you can just hit your ctrl or
command key hold that down and then just
left-click and that will select it and
the eye when it comes to this text it's
going to be separate text I will take
this right here just to just for
purposes of just make it auto there we
go I had to pause by the way because my
child was like knocking on my door out
there um all right so basically what we
want to do down here is create a new
layer ctrl shift N and then we'll take
the use previous layer create clipping
mask and we'll just hit OK sorry I just
had to pause again to handle something
all right so we have this eye clipping
mask here we'll take the rectangle tool
and right around here hold all and drag
out ctrl H twice to get rid of that
won't take the color of this and make it
a gray that's slightly darker than the
background so if we get that right there
actually I don't know do it like that
yeah right there just very slightly you
know ii ii ii ii ii ii alright so over
here we're just going to put a button
arm let me go ahead and take this text
in this text actually then i just take
the whole button group control shift d
deselect all sock layer and just bring
it over here and we're going to put in
contact this purse
now if you wanted to you could put in oh
i'm eyes on
I shouldn't be lazy I'll put a custom
icon over here real quick but let's
extend the width of this to a hundred
percent just to make it easy I so let's
get the yeah
alright so control H take the direct
selection tool select the right portion
of that and then just drag it over
roughly right around here control H
right there and let's take that button
cop copy here I I'm a fan of trying to
keep margins even from left top right
and bottom so you can see there's more
margin right here or padding what we
could do is I just take this this layer
right here control D RT and just drag
that down take this control T drag it
down again and we'll take our button
copy group up here right around there
alright so I of course that's incorrect
so let's get rid of this these two
layers and you know what I may just
Center this text I and in this case we
don't need an icon so so just keep
everything pretty simple alright and
then one final piece of information will
be I let me come over here posted
actually I'll make it all caps here
posted 15 hours ago Warren Oh H alright
so let's go ahead and take the color
let's scale that down quite a bit and we
put it right around here alright so of
course we'll use PHP to calculate you
know when it was posted and all that
stuff I think there's a function that I
found that I well you know if it's a
week ago or 10 days ago or two years ago
it'll put it in based on the time stamp
alright so I
now what we want to do is I want to make
everything here its own group so I'm
going to zoom out real quick just so we
can get a better view of what's going on
we'll rename this to contact button
alright so what we want to do auto
select layer is selected let's go down
here to the bottom we don't want to
select any of these so we'll select this
ok so now if we just take everything and
hit ctrl G yeah put it wait a second let
me see what's going on here drag that
out yeah we don't want the 100% matches
stuff so where's that at just kind of
get in this group correct that looks
good
all right so now we'll just call this
offer I guess and when you hide a show
it that's the only thing that should be
hidden so let's go ahead
yeah the contact button group didn't get
put in there that's no big deal I'll
just delete that all right so let's get
the grid out deselect auto-select layer
ctrl shift d and to copy that or
duplicate it rather and then do it one
more time all right so I let's hide this
pretty cool now of course these would be
all different you know information I'm
not going to bother with adjusting that
I'm going to ctrl T this layer so we can
get a little bit more room we're just
about done but we need to take
everything here and then duplicate it so
what we'll do is take auto-select layer
again select everything ctrl shift D or
right click and duplicate and put this
down here and this is going to be 50%
matches so 50 and this is going to be
changed to they either have what you
need or want what you're offering
okay and also I do want to change this
text I don't want to be sticking out as
much as this portion so we could just
die right around 70 70 7e and just copy
that hex code and do the same thing up
here real quick paste that in alright
and then to denote 50% we'll just come
over here select it
control-shift-n for a new layer make
sure it's a clipping mask just hit OK
take the rectangle tool right around
there and we'll change you know I think
we'll leave the color right around there
control one alright so there we go
pretty good I think that's going to be
it so you know once we have this
actually coded and you know people using
it or not you know they'll either only
show one here sometimes males show four
so the thing to remember is you know we
also need to put something in if there's
no matches which is likely going to be
the case you know when the site starts
out I so will address those issues as
well um so all right
that's basically the design for this
main page right here so alright so I'm
not really certain wanting to be
tackling tomorrow yet I think we're
going to start getting into HTML CSS
actually so alright so if you haven't
yet check out these nine course comm
subscribe here on YouTube alright
goodbye
