wet feet really easy at the sign of any
bad news that has to do with your
cryptocurrency well I'm gonna show you a
way to force yourself to huddle with an
aetherium smart contract so I'm going to
switch it to the browser real quick and
this requires using a plug-in called
made a mask for Chrome install it and
then you will see once you load it up I
by default it will won't have this page
yet but you want to choose the robson
test network if you want to follow along
and see how this works in a test
environment all right after you do that
you're just going to click on buy or the
there's a there's a faucet where you can
request this these ether and they're all
fake it's not real only takes like 30 to
60 seconds for it to show up in your
account here after that you need to
visit remixed etherium gorg I'm going to
provide you with a link to this smart
contract the actual smart contract that
makes everything work and function is
right here alright so let me just
increase the browser just a little bit
more so you can see exactly what is
happening because I'm going to describe
pretty much each line here so first we
have the contract recording at a capsule
kind of like a time capsule and we
define an address so this is a type and
we're gonna get name it owner next we
have an unsigned integer and we're gonna
name that one amount this is the amount
of ether that you want to force yourself
to hold and not be able to touch next is
the very important part I forgot to add
a comment here we have an unsigned
integer of unlocked time and it's bound
to the current time right now plus in
three minutes this could be also hours
as soon here this is from the official
solidity documentation it could be days
weeks or even years alright so just for
testing purposes I'm leaving it at just
you know what I'll make that two minutes
alright so next we have a function and
this right here gets called once the
contract is created
name of the actual contract and we set
the owner to the message center or the
person who created it and so that store
is just an address and then an amount
and this is also specified when we run
it over here and a little bit under
value next we create a modifier in a
modifier is just something that we can
place on to an existing function as we
are here and we're requiring two
different conditions and this is very
important first we're saying whoever is
trying to access this send function
because we're applying this modifier on
to the send function that they must be
equal to the owner so that's what
prevents you know somebody else with a
different a theorem address from trying
to come in and hijack your you know your
theorem and then we also require that
unlock time which is defined up here is
less than the current time so if we say
two minutes from now and I try to access
this send function where it's maybe just
now plus a minute after it was created
it's not going to work as long as these
two conditions value or validate to
truth then we run whatever is inside
this function which is simply
self-destruct that means it's going to
basically change the state of the smart
contract in such a way that it will no
longer function and then we pass an
owner and any of the etherium that is
being stored in that smart contract
which is the value that you specify when
you create it will we get dispersed back
into your account all right so let's go
ahead and give this a shot real quick
you have to make sure that you're
currently connected to your robson test
net right here and you actually have
some ether to test this out with and
notice it says account that is not
showing up so let's just refresh this
real quick all right now we have our
account that's showing up and we're
gonna put the amount that we actually
want to force ourselves to hold not be
able to touch or sell or anything
so we have 1.5 I'm just going to put in
one next we hit create and then this
little window shows up the amount is 1
as we specified which is currently
equivalent to 475 bucks and then we hit
submit so it's going to take a little
bit of time and remember this is just a
test network this isn't actually
happening on the alive aetherium
blockchain
so we see this has one pending
transaction and momentarily it's going
to show up here and I will try to access
the send function and you'll see what
will happen
and then we'll access it after two
minutes and you'll see that our
aetherium will show back up once this
approves this is going to change from
one point five five six to zero point
five five six all right all right so
here it is there it is it updated to
zero point five five and it's not
actually six because it does take a
little bit of ether for the the miners
to actually mine it and so now what we
have is the amount and we which will
provide you with a current amount and
then send so this is the function that
we want to call to destroy the contract
and get our etherion back now has it
been two minutes so watch what happens
when I click on Sen all right it's
giving us an error this basically means
that right here one of these conditions
was not met now I am using message
sender I'm using the same account so
that one actually value you know it
evaluated to true this one however did
not so I'm gonna wait over two minutes
all right I'm fairly certain that two
minutes has been up although I'm a
terrible judge of time at times so I'm
gonna hit Send there we go this will now
show up and we're going to hit submit
notice it's showing the max transaction
fee will cost just a tiny bit and
get your theory and back submit and
we'll see momentarily once this
transaction confirms that we will have a
1.5 a theory and back and that my
friends is how you use a smart contract
in a really clever way to deal with a
sort of a psychological problem that
some of us have to deal with by the way
I use the same exact smart contract over
a month ago when the theorem was $300
and I stored about 50 bucks in there
this is also last month when there's a
lot of there's a few big bad news
stories regarding etherium about a lot
of people got out early when they
probably knew deep down it was still
gonna be fine and it was gonna shoot
right back up all right so check out
corset sir calm just earlier this month
I released a etherium smart contract
development course that was 100% free
I'll try to remember to link it here but
it's also available at course cetera com
alright I'll see you guys real soon I
have been working really hard on that
new course which is using electron to
create desktop apps I'm almost ready to
upload it I think maybe a day or two and
we'll be golden alright see you guys
real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
