today I'm going to be designing a real
basic emblem and this is going to be for
the upcoming design course comm premium
order page alright so I want to make
sure that this design is consistent with
the current design course comm a visual
identity and so that means it's going to
be simplistic and I'm going to be using
Adobe Illustrator to do this and it's
gonna be pretty straightforward and
simple all right so I've included the DC
a letter mark logo the design course
logo I in the project files if you wish
to follow along alright let's get
started alright so the area that I want
to put kind of this emblem will be right
here to the right of the billing
information section and so this is at a
hundred percent of course and so it'll
just occupy maybe half of this available
space and so I basically screenshot it
here in Photoshop so I'm gonna switch
back to illustrator and I have the
design course logo already open I've
included that in the project files if
for some reason you want to follow along
I so I'm gonna go file new eight sixty
by six hundred that works well for this
current resolution and RGB here now
we're dealing with anything that's gonna
be printed so hit OK control one will
get us to under percent and ctrl V to
paste that in alright so very simple so
because we're dealing with it's in order
like an emblem logo or icon we're gonna
use the ellipse so just come in near the
center hold shift and all left-click and
drag all right so now what I want to do
is get rid of the fill so they just
click on here you can't see it cuz it's
off screen but if you go to the left
you'll see a red slash that gets rid of
the fill and then the stroke we're gonna
make black alright and then turn to
stroke up just a couple notches I'm
gonna take everything well just for now
I'm going to leave it lower
it's not gonna actually be the size is
gonna be smaller too but just so you
guys can see I'm gonna leave it at his
size I'm just gonna make this block as
well okay so now what I want to do is
I'm gonna make this live this wine quite
a bit larger actually by holding shift
and all and left clicking and dragging
and then I'm going to duplicate it so
we'll see ctrl F hold shift and I'll
bring it down maybe right around this
size right there take the type tool hold
alt + left click you'll see how it
changes the icon and we hold hit the Alt
key this is where the satisfaction text
is going to be put so I have the caps
lock on set satisfaction and I'm gonna
do change if I select the move tool I'm
gonna use a font that I bought I like it
a lot called trade gothic and you know
you don't necessarily have to use this
you know I'm gonna come up maybe to a
size right around here and then also I'm
going to click on character right here
and then the letter spacing the tracking
I'm just set to something like around
400 something real spaced out here just
so it has good legibility all right so
I'm gonna leave that there for now and
then what I'm gonna do is hit ctrl C
ctrl F that will replicate it and I want
to you see you down here there's this
little line that's kind of coming or
emitting from the ellipse if you'd left
click and then drag that inwards you
could see how it will take this text
down here and put it to the inside or
align it's at the inside of the ellipse
so that's what we want and then we can
rotate it down here and then double
click and then over here put a
guaranteed just like that very simple
now the problem with that is when you
align to the center it doesn't align
with the weight space on the outer
portion compared to the top text so what
you want to do is just select it and
hold Shift + Alt + left click and drag
and get the top portion of the path
lining to the top
the text all right so that way it now
aligns now one issue with that is is it
also increases the font size of the
guaranteed so if you click on this it's
an easy even twenty-two points off of
the satisfaction text so we click it
back to this and as you can see is
twenty four point eight so just at
twenty two and now we have everything
lined up with the same font size and
good to go
alright so now what I want to do is take
our line or ellipse out here control C
and control F and hold shift and alt and
bring this one down right around there
and we're gonna take the size down to
two controls exceed control F the outer
one again right around in the center of
the text alright so now what we want to
do is hit stroke and specify dashed line
and we'll try something around twelve
points for the dash here yeah that'll
work pretty good alright and so now we
have to get rid of the stuff that's you
know overlapping or the text so all we
have to do is go select it and go to
object path and outline stroke so now it
converts it to an outline and then all
we have to do and this world would cry a
little bit of adjustments so it's not
that big of a deal is with the move tool
left click and just right up to the
upper left a little bit and just select
only the portions the dashes that you
want to delete now of course this will
select everything else so what you can
do is if you find an area between up
here between the actual dashes like
right here
hold shift left click and drag you will
now deselect all the other layers oops I
forgot about something I this by default
these dashes are grouped up into a group
so if you click on it right click you
can specify release compound path we can
now select them individually so let's do
that again select them all and come out
in the middle hold shift
there we go so now just delete all right
and luckily for me the spacing looks
pretty even between the side of the N in
the s between the first dashes I if
yours isn't I'll show you how to fix
that so do the same thing at the bottom
here select the thee'st yeah we will
have to make some adjustments that's no
problem
hold shift oops it's right there yeah
now if you didn't select it one second
I'm gonna back up here oh crap redo redo
there we go okay so no now what we want
to do is we can see that there's a lot
of space a lot more space between this
GART or guaranteed here cart and this
products and compared to up here so what
we can do is let me hit control one
first of all to get 200% let's group all
those again so I'm gonna select pretty
much everything and then we'll take this
oh well we there we go
decent like that now just once you have
everything I selected it controlled G
and then I want to make an adjustment
here I on the guaranteed text and just
move it over slightly or rotate it like
that and then what I want to do is I
want to make sure that the space between
here and here is equal to the space
which you eat in here in here and so
there's more down here than it is up
there so what we can do is select the
satisfaction text and we can bring in
the tracking a little bit so we'll try
350 instead of 400 and then rotate it
like that so you could do that until you
have everything you know looking how you
want
- so for me I think that is pretty good
right there alright so what I'll do is
take everything and I'll group it ctrl-g
come out here in our layers where did my
layers go all right there and for my
face all right and so we have this
grouped up go ahead and in oops ctrl C
and ctrl F that real quick hide that one
that way well I won with all the text
layers an editable type of layer so what
we'll do now is take everything of the
one that we duplicated and hit ctrl
shift o and that will convert to
outlines and then go also object path
and outline stroke so now everything is
on a path so we could see that it works
pretty well
outside this will probably be around the
size that I use I think so what we can
do is just a ctrl C and copy that and
switch back to photoshop and I'm just do
them out a little bit ctrl V is a smart
object and I think yeah that's probably
a pretty good size right there so you
definitely want white space and there we
go so this is just a satisfaction
guaranteed I think I'm gonna leave it
all black maybe I'll change it to blue
or maybe just this portion of blue I and
then to the right I'm gonna have I just
maybe one sentence kind of describing a
30-day money-back guarantee policy or
something like that anyhow yeah I
thought you guys would be interested in
seeing how I designed this pretty simple
and straightforward
I though you know this technique can be
used you know when it comes to creating
the circular texts and stuff I and
illustrator it's definitely handy for a
lot of different purposes including logo
design so alright check out design
course comm this is going to be ready
very soon design course premium so yeah
definitely stick around for that alright
I'll talk to you tomorrow with a new
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
