course comm adobe has released its new
CC 2015 update and with the updates
include something called adobe preview
CC and this is something that I'm
excited about now unfortunately it is
just for iOS and not Android hopefully
they will extend it to Android devices
in the future but basically what it
allows you to do is to take your iOS
device whether it be an iPhone or an
iPad and install their Adobe Preview CC
app which is free then once you're in
Photoshop you're able to connect your
iOS devices and it can be multiple at
the same time using a USB cable or a
Wi-Fi connection once you have them
hooked up and you have the app launched
you're able to see what the mock-up
looks like exactly in your iOS device as
you're designing and it updates live so
I'm going to show you how to use this
feature I'm going to switch over to the
desktop and I'll see you then alright so
basically what we have here on the
desktop is a an art board and it has two
different canvases we have one for iPad
slash tablet and we have one over here
those which could be four they can
iPhone or just basically a smartphone
which I haven't populated inside this
iPad slash tablet is a mock-up in this
mock-up is specifically for a full
desktop version so it hasn't yet been
adjusted for the viewport of an iPad or
a tablet okay so looking over here from
the video camera we can see I have my
daughter's iPad here it's an iPad air 2
you can see a bunch of games anyhow
right down here is the eye is the Adobe
preview icon launcher and if I click it
you'll see there was an initial screen
and it kind of flickered and went away
and what that was is telling us you know
in order to need connect this and get
this working you have to either use a
USB or the cable or a Wi-Fi and because
I'm currently connected to the same
Wi-Fi connection as a computer it
automatically connected and it's showing
exactly what this basically mock-up here
in iPad / tablet looks like on the iPad
now if I make any changes or updates
this it's going to pretty much within
like a half a second update on the iPad
so let's go ahead and make some updates
to this to make this design a little bit
easier to see on this tablet because
remember right now this is a desktop
version alright so basically over here
on the desktop I'm just going to make a
few adjustments so what I'll do is just
die I'm going to select this area right
here I'm going to move all this stuff
down currently it's in its own group and
I'm going to just drag it down maybe
roughly right around here and you'll see
it automatically updates and we'll take
this layer right here these two I'm
gonna hit ctrl T maybe scale it down
maybe around here or maybe more like
here we can make adjustments as we need
to and then we'll go ahead and take both
of these we'll move them down right here
we'll take the iOS and app development
right here and we'll Center it and we'll
make it much larger alright so as we can
see everything's coming along a little
bit better and I'm gonna zoom up here
just a bit on the desktop and we'll take
this portion right here well Center it
as well and remember when we're doing
this we're thinking about how the codes
going to be I structured with our
front-end framework which ever we're
using we'll go ahead and make this a
little bit larger as well so we'll take
that 24 point font maybe turn it up to
30 right around here and then we'll go
ahead and take this enter your email and
move it over maybe down just a bit
and this is well there's three layers
there get that lined up pretty decently
right around here and
all right so having looked at the the
basically the iPad kind of bending over
it's not really facing me it's facing
the camera a little bit more I probably
make sense to increase the size of those
four just so we could see it a little
bit easier and hit apply we get that
email right here right here and get that
centered right around there and that
looks a little bit better let's take
those two layers they didn't get moved
over correctly and I think instead of
doing that now that I'm able to see it
on the iPad probably makes more sense to
do something like this that way you
don't have all this empty space to the
left in the right and so looking at this
I think I like that a lot better than
what we initially had which was just for
a desktop version so I make some final
adjustments right here and we'll take
all this and get that group and move it
up and there we go we have basically
with the help of the iPad I was able to
make some decisions that maybe I
wouldn't have otherwise if I was looking
at specifically just at my desktop when
designing in this area right here all
right and so that is the usefulness of
the device preview right here and of
course you can have multiple devices
like an iPhone as well and you switch
back and forth between them into or
artboards and you're good to go all
right so I check out design course comm
if you haven't yet there's video
tutorials there on a lot of different
design topics and also live one on one
design training and also of course as
always subscribe here on YouTube all
right the back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
