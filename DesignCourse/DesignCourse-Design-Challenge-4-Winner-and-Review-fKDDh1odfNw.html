today I'm going to go ahead and pick and
review the design course calm design
challenge number four which is designing
GUI or graphical user interface elements
all right so I'm going to go ahead and
switch over to the screen to do that
alright so I'm going to click here on
the challenge for do I elements design
so of course it must include a
horizontal slider vertical taco buttons
and a radial percentage loader and I
linked here just to a few different type
I guess you could say designs for
inspiration basically what I'm looking
for and so let's go ahead with the first
entry which CLG portfolio who has won a
contest or two before and I like this
right off the bat there's good contrast
here between the elements that have
loaded I versus not loaded so you know
we have this I I guess you could say
kind of like a fiery orange / yellow
color and then of course here is a
darker color so the contrast is good the
consistency is good as we could see
through all these elements I she's
remained consistent in terms of I you
know keeping the same color scheme um in
terms of simplicity I like it as well um
it could probably like to see a version
of this not perspective ski but that's
fine that's not a big deal it's not
really a mark against you so yeah I like
this I'm going to come down here too BTW
dl and so I think maybe one of my gripes
with this might be you know there's I
could see that there's kind of like a
diagonal gradient for the background
that's going down here I probably
would've liked to see that you could
probably i'll keep that but maybe not
make it's so dark for this bottom color
picker of the gradient um maybe you know
you can leave it this light up here
maybe just take this up a few notches in
terms of lightness
because it kind of changes the overall
feel of the elements themselves when you
have a gradient that's going from light
to quite a bit darker I guess you could
say over here it's a little bit better
it's not so much more noticeable um but
I but yeah in terms of the colors I you
know I like the the contrast between the
buttons you could tell that there's a
clear contrast like for up spin sense up
here we have a dark portion down here as
a light portion which is good for
highlights and emulating you know what
what is 3d and I would say for the the
up here the actual text i would say
instead of making it white which is the
same color is this but overhear the
background getting rid of the outer glow
and then just make it black and just
make it a lot more simple to read
especially this per set the percentage
sign here which is a little bit smaller
and it gets a little bit cluttered I so
yeah I would just make this a flat black
color probably and that way then the
amount of contrast is is good I the
green loading portion I would say that
probably would have a slightly better uh
it would stand out a little bit better
like for instance if this was maybe
almost black so you could see it more
because you can't really see it on this
side of this side or even on this white
portion and so maybe even changing up
the color of this as well would make it
seem a little bit by more consistent so
making it green for instance maybe a
darker green and then having a light up
here would make it stick out a lot more
just my opinion otherwise it's good all
right so let's move on down here to
Brian and I like this but I think
there's probably one extremely simple
step that could be taken to make it a
lot better so because the elements
themselves I like it you know
everything's I the layers and the subtle
colors to highlight up here along with
the the portions in which you would you
know grab over here these three marks
right here everything's i really like it
in terms of the detail and how it stands
out but the thing that i think that
would really really just I
bring these elements out more and make
it more visible as by simply making the
background a little bit lighter because
right now you can't really tell too much
of a difference between these the full
bar the full vertical bar versus the
background so I would take the
background here the whole background and
just lighten it up and that way these
elements would stick out a lot more they
would be a lot more noticeable because i
like how cool these elements are design
and so I would even probably instead of
if this is off I would make like an
off-state make it look like it's just a
an empty glass thing right there but
yeah I like it though I just a minor
critique maybe if you can I make it a
little bit maybe just a couple shades
lighter it doesn't have to be like you
know this color anything I you can be
close to this color a bit a little bit
less and I think this would stick out a
lot more I like it I come down here BTW
be to dl I pretty much have the same I
critique when it comes to the background
in the contrast I also with the bevel
right here kind of looks like these are
default bevels like for the layer styles
if you double click on the layer styles
in Photoshop and then bring up and just
check off the bevels it seems like maybe
not much what's changed about that and
so it kind of has just as default I look
of being the default bevel from
Photoshop but I but yeah I like the idea
of having knee this is definitely unique
having this portion down there the
screws and such but but yeah like the
contrast I would say is one of the areas
that I would probably try to prove its
butt and also these I these look like
horizontal and vertical sliders here
maybe make this thicker they seem real
small it would in terms of usability
would be kind of hard to grab them but
I'm going to come down here we have mad
here eos I always try to pronounce and I
always get wrong over here this
background color for some reason I'm
just not a fan of like a dark of like a
mid grey background color for some
reason either be dark or a lot lighter
but I in terms of the design you know
it's simple
there's nothing too elaborate going on I
I might want to make the on and off
texts may be bold or stick out a little
bit more and again you know the
background color be in this color and
then this over here I would probably
prefer to see this portion where it's
the off portion over here or the on
Porsche over here be darker in here that
way it would stick out a little bit more
same thing with this would be a little
bit darker in this areas and everything
would just kind of stick out at a bit
more or if you didn't want to adjust
that just make the background lighter
and I think it would work well I don't
need it does work well as is but these
are just critiques of course all right
and yeah I this I would say it's kind of
an improvement over all I from this over
here because the inner second entry is
just a darker version I like how you
used I with this radial I guess you
could say ovals right here or rounded
rectangles that's definitely cool
especially how they change so I like
that when it comes to the background
again probably seeing almost the same
grape that I have over here they don't
stick out too much when you're comparing
with the background that you do have the
what do you call the the highlight right
here which is definitely good but I
think you could just take it a step
further by other than making this darker
or the background just a hair lighter or
darker that way you know they're not
almost kind of clashing but that's minor
this is actually pretty good so I so we
have this chris and do you stick out
pretty well so you know as we don't
really have the issues with contrast
when it comes to these portions and you
can't pretty pretty clearly see you know
the portion that is you know highlighted
or up to eighty percent with the blue um
so yeah i really don't have too much to
to say about this in terms of critiquing
these seemed to work pretty well maybe
make this slightly darker but that's not
really that's really not that big of a
deal I don't like it I like that you've
entered like a couple different options
that's always good and yeah everything's
go to contrast the color the consistency
is good so this is good all right LG
portfolio they enter to or seen or two
so yeah the same type of skews going on
here I I I would say I mean contrasting
this one with the first entry it's
submitted I definitely kind of just like
this more everything kind of stands out
but I just for a different look this
isn't this isn't really bad i would say
this kind of seems to the brightness
verse this and in here like this outer
edge and inner edge they kind of clash
or there's not much contrast rather so a
quick fix would be to make this lighter
right here or a different hue of blue or
something like that but that's a minor
critique really i would also say
probably another minor critique would be
the font size of on and off there's not
much white space around here in this
portion although that's just being real
nitpicky i mean probably get away with
this is just fine in the same thing with
the seventy percent but then over here
we have kind of like a warcraft type of
design i like it i wish you would have I
be able to see it like at the actual you
know the regular resolution in
orientation but you tell a lot of cool
stuff going on here and it was very game
rishabh viously so I like it definitely
interesting hi but yeah I just wish
you'd seen the the regular version you
could post it if you want if you have it
so yeah not too much to critique it's
kind of hard when it's skewed like this
actually but any coming down here to
hike cake or whatever um this kind of
feels a little old school I I mean not
to say that's a bad thing just with the
tune and all this um I'd say yeah I
could see that it looks like tried to
apply some sort of like blur on certain
portions on that's not bad I may be a
little bit less so because it
in terms of it being realistic a
realistic 3d environment I don't think
you would have I the stitching on
leather for instance going you know so
blurred like that in our perspective I
over here I I mean I like it it's kind
of cool like a like like I said it's
sort of like 80s vintage type type of
design would have been cool to see a
switched or flip the version of this
like this one to this one being flipped
up or this I turned off or one of those
on this is kind of small I so maybe just
it could have probably increased the
size just a tad bit of these elements
but yeah overall though I like how the
you know the lightning seems consistent
and I yeah maybe i would say on the
chrome portions maybe slightly just take
those down maybe opacity on that
specific layer style and just drop it
down at a bit it seems like they come
out a little bit too much but that again
that's just maybe a personal preference
and that is it so I liked all the
interesting entries i was expecting
maybe to get lesser quality because this
is more of a elaborate sort of design
contest with designing all these
interesting elements but I if I had to
choose a winner which I guess I have to
because these are challenges um i would
go between this entry right here and
possibly this entry right here I if it
was just me and if that background color
was just kind of you know what I'm going
to try something real quick just for the
hell of it I'm gonna load up Photoshop
real quick I wasn't going to do this but
I'm going to try to at least and just
see if I can get a general idea of what
this would look like with the background
slightly lighter now you scale is down
get this back into view and all right so
file new
paste that sucker in now if we take the
the paint bucket tool make the tolerance
like three or something we'll get this
color right here and just go up a hair
see what happens here I mean it's not
going to be perfect because I'm not
working with individual layers obviously
that's a little bit too bright yeah
everything kind of pops out right away a
lot better just with that very slight
adjustment in terms of you know the
background color so yeah that would have
been cool I mean it is cool maybe it's
just a very quick and very minor
adjustment can make a big difference in
my opinion so I so yeah I just for that
minor I'd say background issue i'm going
to go ahead with a LG portfolio who also
won last week's contest so you know this
is the person you're going to have to
gun for deep and one once I I come up
with the design challenge number five
which I'm not really sure what I'm going
to choose yet but yeah congratulations
and thanks everyone for entering that
these design challenges are going well
so yeah we're going to have a design
challenge five coming up pretty soon and
hope you enter all right so check out
design course calm if you haven't yet
getting very close to launching a design
course premium and I'm working on it in
the background so if I click on this ID
for example as all of it these are all
videos and the project fall Long's where
you see that I'm designing full visual
identities and then mentor is the one on
one design training and it's split up
into two different sections so right now
i just have back here just viz ID for
visual identity design which is all
things logo design and like corporate
identity um in the future i'm going to
have more such as mobile design app
design / also website design and
mentor will be a product product product
or service that you can use in
conjunction with all of these different
projects I need to be releasing in the
future and initially viz ID so go to
mentor you'll see that these are his ID
projects that you can tackle basically
and if I click on one of these like
here's one jewel so there's a company
called 1 jul I have to fix this there's
no space at the bottom still a work in
progress I and it tells you basically a
brief about the company and your job is
to come up with a visual identity design
a logo a business card in an identity
guideline and you learn how to all due
to tap you learn how to do all the stuff
in the VIS ID course over here with the
videos and then you come over here and
once you learned you know what you've
learned it through the VIP those videos
and following along you can tackle
trying to do something from scratch on
your own and so once you've done that
you can attach the project image whether
it be the logo the business card the
identity guideline you can provide a
comment and then hit submit once you
submit it shows up down here in this
area and then I provide a response based
on your individual submission and I
address areas that you can improve on
through video and also through texts so
that's what mentor is and so this will
be available for all future I projects
or so viz ID that's the first one
there'll be another one for say for
example when I have one for website
design there will be fictional projects
down there and so the whole purpose of
mentor is I you know once you've watched
those video courses now it's time to try
to put what you learned into practice
and then further refine what you've come
up with because I just watching a video
I mean it's great those are great for
learning you know the very basics but
I'm sure you know this is something I
faced I when you go to actually design
your own project though it's hard to
replicate the same level of quality as
when you're just trying to follow along
through you know a project step by step
so this is what mentor is all about and
you could also say for example you know
if you join up
coming up I'm trying to get this done
within the next 20 days and all launched
say for example you you want you join
what I launch and there's only your
visual identity projects I but you need
help with maybe a banner design or a
website design well you could submit a
personal project over here and so you
submit a project make it the title maybe
like my portfolio design you can attach
the mock-up image and submit it and then
I'll also come down here and I will
provide you with basically guidance
about how you can approve or if there's
any areas that you need proof so yeah
now that's going to be launching very
soon I'm hoping within the next week and
a half or two so look out for that and
check out also the YouTube channel and
subscribe there if you haven't yet and
i'll see you tomorrow with a new video
alright goodbye
