calm and today I'm announcing a new site
that I just launched yesterday and that
is ctrl f dot IO and this site allows
you to search through almost at the time
of recording this thirteen thousand
different courses from four of the top
online education networks and that is
Linda calm pearl site tuts+ and skill
share in the teacher i may add more
alright so i'm going to show you what
this site looks like and of course you
should visit yourself and your own
browser so again it's ctrl f dot IO and
right now you can see we have 12,000 789
courses in the database 90 we're added
yesterday 39 today and you can see we
have just these four columns here and we
also have a bunch of categories we'll
get to that in a second but basically
you can search for anything you want to
learn now why did I make this project
well whenever you're trying to learn
something new well you'll go to google
and you'll type in maybe angular 2
courses for example I or you'll go to
each network like Linda calm angular 2
cores let's see what they have to offer
you have to go all these different
websites so I thought it would make
sense to bring everything together into
a single database so that you can just
search in one unified system so let's
say if we want to learn react for
instance well automatically we have 40
results 21 from pluralsight and eight
from here none from scale share and 11
from hut to visit them directly you just
click this little button right here and
I'll take you directly to the course
page hosted at the site if you want more
more information you click title we can
see these beautiful page transition
animations happen right here by the way
this is built using the mean stack and
that's one of the reasons that I wanted
to make the service so I got good
experience developing a mean mean of
course is an acronym for mongodb Express
jas angular 2 and node and that's going
to be something that I'm going to be
teaching on this channel very shortly as
you can if you recall i just did the
anger the two fundamental series so
we're going to be leading into all this
and you
more advanced topics in development and
actually developing whole projects with
angular 2 as well as the mean stack and
ionic and all that good stuff so yeah I
encourage you to check it out you have
these I just kind of predefined search
terms over here like you're going to
learn foundation or you wanna learn
stylist etc I you can go ahead and check
these out so yeah pass it around book
market it'll be a site definitely in the
future if you're not trying to learn
anything now that will be come in very
handy so all right I look out for new
videos very shortly I'm going to be
teaching a kind of intermediate to
advanced angular 2 and also full
projects from start to finish from all
the way the full stack development all
the way from design to back-end coding
and run in and everything else alright
so I'll see you very soon see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
