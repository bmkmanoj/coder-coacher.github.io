in this video we're going to continue on
with the design of our homepage for logo
design SEO and again I feel like a
broken record recorder or whatever but I
hopefully you're using your own project
for this that way again you can kill two
birds with one stone you can just kind
of I mean if you follow the layout a
little bit how I'm doing it but you're
making it specific to your service you
know that's fine that's no big deal I
don't really care so in this section
down here this may be a little bit
tedious we're gonna create six custom
icons for six areas that will outline
the different benefits and the features
of the service so those six would be
fully vector control panel turnaround
time full full ownership unlimited
revisions and additional services and
each one of those headlines will have
basically just one sentence of text
underneath it further elaborating on the
information and so alongside each one of
those the copy there will be a I con so
we're going to use that blank circle
which is right over here and let me just
drag it down I know it's up there
somewhere there it is and so real
quickly so we can bust these out I'm
just going to create six copies of these
real quick so I'm going to duplicate the
layer take these to duplicate them again
and once more okay so the first one is
going to be four fully vector and the
text for that is all files are delivered
in fully vector formats which is
obviously a necessity if you're a logo
design company so in this first one I
just want to illustrate just a very
general idea that pertains and relates
to fully vector so sometimes you can be
literal sometimes you could be abstract
I so in the case of vector I'm just
going to put like two square pixel
things right here design much in the
same way as the first one we did so if I
take this again I'm going to make sure
we have our correct color here
in the foreground we'll zoom in here
take the rectangle tool just hold shift
for a perfect square
and then we can duplicate that and
really you should be using a shortcut
for this but right now it's interfering
with one of my the Camtasia shortcuts so
I'm just duplicating it manually let me
get to 100% I want to scale that down
just a little bit apply and again I want
to do the same thing where I cut out an
edge of the blank circle see it right
around there okay so now if i zoom out
that's our first icon so let's move on
to the second and that's going to be
control panel and the best idea came up
with this was just to kind of show kind
of like a browser window obviously very
simplified so I'm going to use the
rounded rectangular tool and radius I we
have set at 15 I think I'm going to use
something more like 4 and I'm just going
to draw out and hold alt there and drag
this up top here we're gonna make the
foreground color just white and then
we're gonna double-click on the right
side layer to bring up the layer Styles
hit stroke we're going to choose inside
actually you know what I mean you just
leave that outside and in the color we
can specify right there hit OK now I may
want to adjust this a little bit
different it's a little bit too square
for me so if I just go ahead and take
the top portion rather I'm gonna take
the bottom right here and use our arrow
key to squeeze it up just a little bit
all right that's good and then I kind of
want to put just like an address bar so
right here
put one right there
and then just a circle for like a submit
button or something okay I'm gonna zoom
out and just see what this kind of
roughly looks like I think I might want
to make the stroke a little bit thicker
so I'll select layer we'll go back to
stroke and we'll try four big five works
better all right so we'll take those
three layers like this hold shift move
them down and in just slightly alright
and so we'll take this eye circle and
delete those all right so our first two
are done let's move on to our third and
this is going to be an icon for the
concept of turnaround time so we're
going to use like a clock right here so
we'll take the first thing I have change
this foreground to white holding alt and
shift to do this basically just want it
to be a quarter of the largest circle
and a quick tip I we want to add this I
the border or the stroke around it so
instead of doing that all again manually
we can just I click on this right click
hit copy layer style click back to our
white circle right here right click and
paste layer style and it's a little bit
bigger than the other one so I'm going
to scale it down just a little bit and
then we're just going to have to quick
layers here of a rounded rectangle tool
let's make sure this is the correct
color well duplicate this pick ctrl T
and just move it down there roughly we
could use our arrow keys to further
align it and I think that looks pretty
good alright so we could take this and
we're going to use an ellipse elliptical
marquee tool and just right around the
center I'm gonna draw up actually well
let me hit delete and just see how that
looks
yeah there's a little bit more white
space in between here so let me do that
again to make a larger using my arrow
keys I just hit undo for that alright
that looks a little bit better so we got
three out of the way so let's continue
on fourth one is going to be full
ownership which means you own all the
rights to use the creatives as we
deliver so this is just going to be one
of those judge gavels or whatever just
to illustrate the idea of legality so
what we're going to do is just create a
real simplified version I'm gonna use
two just for the border radius make our
foreground our turquoise color and I'm
not even going to bother trying to put
it inside yet I'd say roughly this size
and then we'll take the rounded
rectangle tool create the handle and
then we'll just create a couple of white
notches let's see here
right here
make this white we'll duplicate that
layer break it on to the other side all
right right there looks good so now what
I want to do is take all these layers
and this is the first one
take this and these two hit ctrl e oops
hit ctrl G rather just a group then then
hit ctrl T hold shift so that's at a 45
degree angle let me drag this above and
let me just zoom out real quick control
one this needs to be a little bit larger
so I'll increase the size there all
right that looks pretty good position it
a little bit better I'll go ahead and
take this layer actually since we have
it's at an angle here it wouldn't look
right why it right if we used a circle
or a square just to cut that part out so
what we can do is use the pen tool make
sure path is selected up here and then
we could just draw out a rough area
around it and then right click make
selection hit OK and then hit delete all
right so we got two more left and the
next one will be for unlimited revisions
I and so basically it says regardless of
the package you order we will work we'll
work with you until you're satisfied so
we have to illustrate the idea of
revisions or unlimited so the best thing
I could come up with was just to go
ahead and take this shape over here and
duplicate it drag it over
and then right-click duplicate it again
and then maybe one more time
and use my arrow keys and I might want
to take all three of those layers and
ctrl T scale down and I may also want to
change the stroke on one of them because
they're a little bit thick since there's
a several of them will just try down to
four right click copy layer style select
these two layers above right click paste
layer style alright so now we have all
three of them selected I'm going to
select the circle and delete right
around there all right and then we just
have one more and that's going to be
additional services which will allow
them to order out the things aside from
just logo design I and for this I I'm
just going to put like a tool so just to
illustrate the idea of multiple tools or
multiple services so with these turquoi
in our foreground let's go ahead and I'm
going to take the pen tool and just so I
can line things up correctly I'm going
to view show the grid and I'm going to
start right up around here
oops actually messed up we need to make
sure shape is selected
put a notch in right around here this is
gonna be like a screwdriver
we'll make this two layers I'm just
gonna do the handle up here I'm going to
real quickly just take these three
points and just pull them in with the
arrow key and then I'm going to take
this I duplicate the layer edit
transform we're going to flip horizontal
alright and then real quickly take our
pen tool
right around there all right so we have
three layers right here and I'm going to
hit ctrl G to group them ctrl T make it
at a 45 degree angle and scale it down
we're going to try that just for now let
me drag it up oops
make sure a group is selected let me get
hit ctrl H now there's a very slight
white line in the middle so let me hit
ctrl H to view everything many of you
show I don't want the pixel grid and I
don't want the grid to show okay so what
we can do is if we take this and we drag
out and we put add Anchor Point tool I
if we add one just right here and right
here we can take the direct selection
tool just move that in both of those
points all right so let's go back to
hundred-percent
then the final thing we need to do is to
take the circle
we'll use the pen tool again here for
and make sure it's path selected first
we want to select our layer let's hold
ctrl and select it
actually that's not even
all right make selection hit the Delete
key all right and there we go
so now what I want to do is make sure I
just want to take all these each into
these individual icons and put them
basically just flatten them down so let
me go ahead and let's see here
the background I want to make sure this
is locked so I can't select it when we
have auto select layer so that way it
won't select anything except for what
I'm selecting here and if I just hit
control G we'll make this a group here
we'll call this vector or icon vector
take this pick control G icon control
panel
okay icon t82 around time
and we'll call this icon ownership I
know this is tedious we're almost done
icon revisions and icon services alright
now that we got that all the way if we
go here it had here in select group for
auto select will select the whole group
instead of the individual layers so I
now what we want to do is get these all
positioned and get the text in so we
need to view our grid and basically each
one of these I it's going to extend
we're going to have three I on one row
and then three on the next so I select
this first one and get it into position
right around here starting there and we
want to make sure these are all on the
same path so let me undo that and take
these first three
put them right around there and I'll
take this one it's going to start right
here just right around the ape and then
this one right here it's gonna start
right here around the fifth all right I
and these well let me go ahead and get
rid of this or hide the columns let's
put these down here for now and now
we're going to go ahead and put the
titles so let me just let's take this
one up here right-click duplicate that
I'm just going to drag it up here to the
top for now
we're close to the top at least and this
one's going to say fully vector you can
extend this and left align it and of
course that will be bigger so the size
let's try 24 I think we can go a little
bit bigger than that so let's try 27 all
right and then underneath that we're
just going to have some other text
so I'll duplicate this the size let's
try to let's use 16 all files are
delivered in fully
vector formats and if you can't see it
because there's a little plus so we just
pull this down I want to make that
slightly larger it's go to 18 all right
so let's take these two and just
duplicate those and duplicate them one
more time and it's changing to the
appropriate text control panel
maintain direct communication with our
custom control panel turn around time
obviously you can fast forward this
because I'm not doing anything that's
remarkable right now I'll turn around
times from primary concepts to delivery
are stated and if this happens you can
just adjust that real quick all right so
now what we want to do is we could take
each of these six layers right click and
duplicate them pull them down it's right
around there and then we'll auto select
a group and get all three of these
selected want to make sure it's in line
with those all right and let's pull this
one over here and this one oops
let me find this one manually real quick
there it is
all right i full ownership unlimited
three visions and additional services
now I'm just going to I have this text
already off to the side so I'm just
going to take each one of these copy
them
and because I'm pasting this coffee 'no
source the line height is adjusted
differently so I'll fix that manually
real quick and I kind of like the line I
hear a little bit better so if I get my
character pound out we'll see that it's
just that Auto so we can select these
three make sure layer selected select
all three and just change this to Auto
there we go alright so that is pretty
good I for now and let me go ahead and
check out the space beneath this from my
other document that's to the left that
you cannot see I for now I think that's
a pretty good point to stop this because
I that took rarity out of around 25
minutes so beneath this we're pretty
much almost done I think we have only
about likely only about maybe 20 25 more
minutes until we get this whole thing
ready to go
so I when that next video is released I
hopefully you'll watch it alright I'll
see you then good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
