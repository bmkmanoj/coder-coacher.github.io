today is January 26th and we are going
to take our design from Photoshop from
yesterday and go ahead and make it in
animated reality in after-effects so as
always check out design course comm if
you haven't yet we're going to have
courses there and also all of our videos
are there for free of course as well and
the project files are available for free
in the description below this video and
youtube and also for sure if you haven't
yet go ahead and subscribe to the
youtube channel alright let's get
started alright so get I Adobe After
Effects open go to composition new
composition and 1280 by 720 I three
seconds long down here and we'll call
this breath and we'll hit okay all right
so I'm just gonna zoom out here
50% works pretty well from my resolution
we want to import our necessary files
and mine was called let's see this is
one I'm gonna hold ctrl and then left
click the other ones and those three
important our perspective view is the
one that we want to start with here so
if we put it down here and we scale it
hold shift that's too much
yeah right around there is good to start
then what we want to do is create a make
sure nothing's d selected we'll go over
here create a rounded rectangle tool
hold shift and make sure that radius I
think it was for that we had it at
actually then we delete that I got to
make sure this is correct
yes is zero oh wait that's for the eye
I'm sorry the stroke
yeah hold shift will select it doesn't
the size doesn't have to be specific
just just around this size and what we
want to do is and that border radius
does work out because that's basically
the same as our other one so what we
want to do it now is pre-compose this so
that basically it's like putting it in a
layer group so you go layer pre-compose
we'll just call this UI all right so now
when you double click on this it opens
up a new tab and this is where we're
going to create our UI reason we did
that is because we're going to use in
effects an effect called corner pin to
get this on here I ended correct
perspective so I'm going to take you I
hit T to get opacity so we can turn this
capacity down so we can see underneath
it and now we have this corner pin thing
and this is going to be tricky so it's
gonna be tough so over here we have
these four little circles that are
around here we have to use these to get
everything in here correctly I and if
you do this as you see it doesn't work
quite correctly so we have to kind of
pull them out even across the screen
until we can get this thing properly
into view here you may have to move
things around it's a pain there has to
be an easier way I just don't know about
it unfortunately and I was using my
squirrel just to you know see that other
one so I'm Suman up here and this
doesn't have to be perfect because
ultimately we're not going to be using
that at this layer this is just kind of
a placeholder ruling so we get the
correct perspective all right so that
looks good okay
all right so now if we go if we
double-click on UI we bring this up we
can see that this hasn't been distorted
itself so that's good now what we want
to do is recreate some of those elements
so I'm gonna go over here and select the
ellipse tool and hold shift and yeah
just shift here and roughly around this
size we'll take the fill change the
change that to a radial gradient hit OK
and then up here we can edit that
radiate irradiant gradient to I the
proper green color and I'll just hit OK
so now if we switch back we can see that
is right there although that looks bad
because we have that layer showing so if
we hide it we can see that that looks a
lot better now and my mouse is about to
die so let me pause this alright I
plugged it back in now if we just select
right here you can see this a little
dragger thing that's for the gradient
it's so hard to see I basically if you
zoom up and you hold your spacebar you
can get a better view and now you just
pull that thing in and we'll go back to
breath and that way it looks better and
not so you know sharp alright so I may
want to increase the size of this thing
I'm just holding shift that's better and
maybe move it well let me zoom out here
we'll get our container layer back yeah
that's fine here
all right so the fun part okay so I'm
going to basically come back to
photoshop and what I want to do is hide
these layers create a new one underneath
control-shift-n we're gonna make it
black it already is
well maybe I'll make it light like a
dark gray just so we can see underneath
here alright so if i zoom out you know
this is real large what we want to do is
take everything all those layers hit
ctrl T scale it up quite a bit now the
one thing that we're going to be
importing is this ring not this stuff in
the middle so I'm just going to get rid
of those all right now when you scale up
in something's a stroke in Photoshop it
won't scale it proportionally so just
come back here and scale this back up to
round there alright so the idea is is to
take this this ring and we're gonna
create two of them one's going to be red
and what we'll do is create this so that
when we bring it into as an image or a
Photoshop document into After Effects I
will use an effect that will reveal it
in a radial fashion so I what we want to
do is come over to photoshop and I'm
going to take the mask hit ctrl H oh so
we can see the points and view if your
grid showing up don't show that okay so
now I'm gonna take this down just so
this it's a little bit more correct in
terms of the angle alright and what I
can do is right click this
we're gonna go rasterize and i'm going
to create a new layer right
I'm underneath this one hit okay take
the brush tool want to be pretty big
maybe not that big 800 I think I will
work well and we're gonna color drop
this color right there
and we want to make it slightly darker
hit okay and then just click right here
might be able to go a little bit darker
over here and that way it just kind of
gives us some like it like a gradient so
once we've done that I we can take these
three only shift hit group control G so
this is going to be good as in you're
under the limit right click this
duplicate the group or hold ctrl shift D
this is gonna be bad and we're gonna
change the color here by going to image
adjustments hue and saturation oh let's
take both of those actually real quickly
before I do that I want to take this
because obviously this will go higher
and control H you know what I'm backing
up sorry about that I want to have it be
able to distinguish that this is the
safe line if you're under you're good if
you're over your bad but also depending
on how much a person is over well they
want to know that too so the way we can
do this is take this and take that asset
e down and we'll create a new layer
control-shift-n and then just tap space
for that i clipping mask and then we'll
create one that goes right here right
here and this one's going to be black so
now once we take let's see here
I think we just take all them I control
II image adjustments hue and saturation
and now we didn't want we basically want
to get to a red color what's happening
there is a slight if I hit colorize
is that just my eyeballs or is there a
very knowing thing going on down there
let's see no not nothing that I can see
you pause it
yeah that was just I think an illusion
because I don't see it if you get an
image adjustments hue/saturation you do
not see that or maybe you didn't get to
see it in a video but I certainly saw it
right around there it okay I go back to
zoom out all right so this is our second
one so what we want to do is I'm gonna
take I'm gonna hide this group take this
just select on group hit ctrl e and
we'll take this oops
hit ctrl e alright so we have our two
layers good and bad so basically hit
ctrl a and then ctrl c ctrl a will
select everything and then ctrl c copies
it will go to file new alright and then
we will save this and I'll call this I
you see I already have this up here ring
good I'll just overwrite that and then
my mom things being slow okay and then
we'll go ahead ctrl a ctrl C and then
we'll go to ctrl n enter ctrl V so we
don't want we don't want to say for web
just hit control s and then reading bad
hit yes
now switch back to after-effects got a
project file new and or import rather
what am i doing and then we'll take ring
bad and ring good import now we want to
import this ring good right here now
it's too big so let's hit shift and
scale that down right around
and there we go looks like crap because
of the by its bottom layers showing up
alright looks a bit better alright so
now what I want to do is add an effect
this is kind of called I'm just gonna
type in wipe no wait no no I'm gonna
type in radial we see transition radio
wipe and we'll put that on there and if
you go to transition complete and play
with this you'll see how this will work
in a way but it needs to wipe
counterclockwise there we go so now what
we want to do is go ahead and we're
going to add the numbers first so I'm
just gonna change that to zero and get
back this layer over here just to get an
idea of where I'm at
take the type tool type in zero our
point zero our point seven four how's
that okay change this here to click on
this and take right around there hit OK
source sans pros when i'm using i'm
gonna i'm gonna choose extra light and
then bring in the letter spacing a
little bit all right it's a bit bigger
all right so now we have to create an
expression and i found this on the
internet i'm just gonna copy and paste
the thing in and so i'm going to provide
in a link if you look at the description
below this video there will be a link to
probably a service like pastebin where I
copy and where you can just click on it
and you can copy it and then you can
paste it where I tell you okay so once
you have that copied go down here and
we'll click on that click on text then
we have source text so what we want to
do is alt click
right on that little timer icon and then
control V to paste that in and I what do
want to make a change you mean have to
do this because I probably pasted it in
the correct one basically it would have
like I let me pull this up you have
variables so you can specify the
duration and also the end account so
what we want to do is take this 130,000
and put it to 74 if that's already there
and that cut the text you'll have to
worry about doing that part just click
out of there and what we'll do is let me
go ahead and bring this back down you'll
see it now counts for seconds it gets to
74 okay
so let's add another text this will just
be that period get it into position
yeah use Maya down arrow key that looks
good and then we'll create another text
BAC blood-alcohol content change this to
light yep I think I had this white all
rights move some things over long shift
and selecting them both this the text a
little bit too close together I'll just
pull that out all right let's go hide
this background and let's go to breath
okay all right cool let's go back to UI
and now we want this to line up the
animation you know based on this right
here so basically we're gonna have to
set a keyframe right at 74 based on
where this transition complete part is
so to do that what we'll do is
select yeah make sure it's selected
we'll find it here and that's called
ring good pull this down and well
actually let's go ahead and set a
transition first right there and then
click right here to create a keyframe
come down here and hit you and that
shows you any keyframes that you have
associated with that layer and then over
here we'll go to the beginning and then
we'll change this to zero wait no 100
sorry about that 100 and then real
quickly to show the rest you don't
really have to do this to show that
black part but I'm going to I'm just
going to hit zero so let's go back to
breath here and zoom out a little bit
now I'm gonna hit zero on the number pad
and it's going to get this ready to
playback so it's going slower than it
actually would be so this is it at full
view let me zoom up alright pretty cool
alright that's how you do that then so
real quick what I also want to do is add
in some other text good to drive all
right change the text to green right
around there hold shift
all right and then let's scroll up to
the top here we want this to show maybe
right around here so we'll drag us over
here we'll hit t4 pasady set a keyframe
change this to zero and maybe change
this to a hundred all right so now if we
hit 0 on the number pad we can see how
that will slowly fade in cool and then
another thing I wanted to add it's kind
of like a gradient so let me bring this
back here and we could probably use this
in and of itself to create that radial
gradient so let's change the fill oops
over here to a radial let's drag this up
right around there and I'm gonna change
the color here you know what we could
just change the opacity so where's that
at
oops
no it's down here what am i dealing yep
I will hit T now we're gonna to
basically maybe we'll start right here
creating animation so at zero when it's
at zero we're gonna create a keyframe
there and then maybe boost it all the
way up I'm gonna put at 20% just see
what this looks like there so we'll go
ahead and animate that
all right and this is the actual result
perfect all right so now what we can do
is we're going to have to duplicate some
things so I'm going to pull this up so
we can get a good view of all our layers
and collapse them and so basically I'm
gonna take all these layers composition
now go to layer pre-compose like we did
before we'll call this good UI and then
we're going to duplicate this so shift D
or control D rather I'm going to switch
back up here to the project view now
where it says good UI we want to
duplicate that as well so control D so
this is called good UI to what we want
to do is with this top selected here and
this selected over here hold alt and
drag it over so now we have a duplicate
version and we can edit good UI too
which is actually bad get rename that if
you want to bad and now we can change
everything to red and also replace the
foot this footage to eye
where was that ring bad so we'll do that
first so we'll select this ring good
ring bad
hold alt hover over sweet and and I
think
yeah when we're right about here we want
to make sure we're directly over this
real quick over this wait what am i
doing it's looking at the wrong one
sorry about that we're gonna hit you
with ring bad selected yeah there it is
and you want to make sure you're
directly over that and we'll go back to
effects by this is transition complete
actually
that's why okay what we want to do
before I edit this sorry I'm being slow
we're gonna go over here to that 74
layer get down that source text we're
gonna scroll up here and count we're
gonna put it like 94 that means like
they're over or whatever so there's that
and let's take this right opacity here
oh wait no sorry yeah this right here
I'm gonna adjust this so that make sure
I'm right over it we want to adjust it
so that I the aunt the transition
complete is actually right here they're
all right so I'm gonna take this layer
and I'm going to zoom up here and this
one make it red PACA we're gonna leave
there now change that text to don't
drive make this red take this change the
gradient to read and and then finally we
actually have this thing down here make
this red it okay alright so now if we go
back into the UI we have both of these
and they're gonna play at the same time
we don't want that so what we want to do
is just move this forward and maybe to
right around there alright so let's see
well first we have to just drag this
around here we'll take the opacity put a
keyframe there
go forward a little bit at zero and then
this one will put right here hit T
capacity will be zero and then it's
going to go to 100 all right hit zero
it's going to render out I'm just going
to pause it until it gets all the way so
we can see it you know when it's ready
to go and this is the actual speed
all right cool all right so that parts
done
I now what we want to do is first real
quick I kind of wanted to push these in
at a bit I think it stayed there a
little bit too long and then just put
this right around here okay all right
that's good now what I want to do is so
what that would be like the first scene
so what we'll do is back here on our
main composition we're gonna hit s for
scale and we're gonna create a key faint
key a key for any one of my key theme a
key frame right around here and we're
gonna scroll just to where that is
finished and put another one right there
and what we want to do is go from small
to larger so the way this will work is
yeah actually you know what I'm going to
delete that we're gonna take both these
layers hold shift go to layer pre
compose and call this first view and
then we're also going to hit f4 and
click on this little middle icon right
there actually click it just to show
unclick it rather just to show you what
that does I if we scale this we wouldn't
see anything else but if you click on
this you see everything else outside of
the composition alright so basically we
want to start the animation right around
this size right here so we'll go to
click on first view hit s put a keyframe
there that's actually 120 it's gonna
look distorted so let me
actually no I was wrong one second let
me get 100% yeah we're gonna scale that
down let me go to 25 again sorry right
around there and then I'm going to go
here to the end and scale up just a
little bit to right around there that
way there will be some movement all
right so now I'm going to go to layer
new solid and just hit okay and this is
gonna be like a transition type thing so
we're going to move this over here just
before there and then I'm going to take
a pasady hit T it's going to start and
it's going to hit a hundred percent
around there go to the beginning hit
zero and come out right around the same
area and hit zero so this is what
happens so once we have that right there
take the end of this and just get rid of
it right around that same area so if we
go all the way we can make sure it's
right on that frame so now becomes plank
a blank after it looks like it doesn't
fade with backgrounds white too so now
what we want to do is go back to project
and put in top view we'll scale that
down and leave it right around there now
in my first video that I did when I did
this project I had just some text in
here you can add that if you want I'm
not really going to worry about it you
not to do that
so we're gonna move this over well-hit
come on over there now we want to go to
tea actually I'm not sure if that's
necessary
yeah well drop this beneath there we go
and then what we'll do is scale this up
so we'll we'll take I guess we'll put
one there maybe right around there yeah
I think that might be too much if you
double-click on one it'll bring you up
the scaling properties I I have a
starting at 75 I'm just gonna put 80
no maybe 78 okay control D you do this
again and let me go over here oops I'll
actually get this and pull in so we can
see it oh wait it's right around there
no no sorry all right so
basically want that to end right there
and then we'll do the same thing for
side view drag this in right around
there
oops
let me go ahead and just take this in in
size and we'll drag this beneath here
and we'll do the same thing with the
scaling here so we'll leave the let s
put a keyframe there and come out to
around here and then just barely alright
so now what I want to do I'm going to go
to move things out of the way and now
I'm going to render this I'm going to
hit zero and I'll pause because it has
this way to go all right and here it is
at the regular speed
all right just very subtle scale in size
here that's quick
you'll have that so what we can do is
kind of change some things around over
here this is where it changes so what I
want to do is remove this back maybe to
around here move this back over here
we had this one up here this layer
it looks good and there's an issue here
that's coming in too early there all
right so let me go ahead and hit zero so
here's a full speed
you'd probably be worth having this sped
up a little quicker
but that's fine that's no big deal
okay cool okay so I now what I would do
is this is the song file so I linked to
that I in the description you would just
drag it in and if you wanted to have
your own voice over let me drag this up
you would want to take the audio down
just a little bit maybe it's a like
negative 8 decibels and so now when you
play this I don't know if you can hear
that through my speakers or through the
system audio or not but and then you
would record your voice talking and
saying whatever you want cool alright so
I to to basically export this I you can
go to first of all you want to make sure
you take it your timeline down here and
you drag this wherever you want it to
end
oh you know what I forgot about one
thing I forgot about the text up here
that's kind of an issue so let me I mean
you I would imagine you know how to do
that already because we've done it once
but it's worth finishing so let me go
ahead and get things into view here
there's not enough room up here let me
see if the size of this can be adjusted
at all I'm gonna get rid of the scale
here
yeah that's like the best we can get
away with probably because I didn't
position that right I think we just add
a one line of text up there and be fine
so I'm gonna back up control-z we're
gonna get our things back and then leave
it right there and we will go ahead and
type what was it I forget what I had up
there yeah no your limit will make that
white text
maybe it would look even better right
there oops yeah and then what we would
do is I hit T and then for a pasady we'd
make it zero creaky frame 100 all right
so now we zoom out pull this stuff down
move this over zero and now let it run
through
and then it will stop and the scale and
then that will come down there cool all
right we are almost done with the full
mega tutorial tomorrow we're gonna get
started with creating the actual website
design for this product in Photoshop so
that will be fun alright as always visit
design course comm subscribe here on
youtube if you haven't yet and I will
see you tomorrow bye
