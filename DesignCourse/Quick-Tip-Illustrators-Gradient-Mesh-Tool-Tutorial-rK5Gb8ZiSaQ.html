going to be talking about the gradient
mesh tool and it's just going to be a
real quick tutorial that shows you how
to use this very simple tool so first of
course we'd start out in Adobe
Illustrator by creating a new document
and then using the pen tool or one of
the shape tools to create a basic path
so in our case we're going to be
creating a the end of a calligraphy pen
or something like that so as you can see
we just I use the pen tool to draw out
the points real quickly and then once we
have our shape ready to go we can use
the gradient mesh tool located right
here in the tool bar so once you click
it with your path selected the way you
use it is just to find a areas and just
click left click and that is it once you
have it clicked and specified for your
first gradient mesh point all you have
to do is change the color I based on
whatever you want to use in the swatches
panel and so once you do that it will
automatically create a gradient based on
the gradient mesh that was created and
this depends on a number of different
factors it depends on how many times you
use the gradient mesh tool to create
anchor points within the mesh I but yeah
you can experiment with it and it can
create some really interesting results
though you do need to be mindful not to
create too many gradient mesh points
because there will be some distortion
and that is it that's how you use this
very simple tool check out design course
dot-com slash premium where I help you
become a better designer with one-on-one
training and other design related
projects alright I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
