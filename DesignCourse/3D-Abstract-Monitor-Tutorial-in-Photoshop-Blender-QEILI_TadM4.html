today we're gonna be stepping into
blender 3d which is a free 3d graphics
application you can download it's very
lightweight it's only like 60 or 70
megabytes from blender.org and also
we're going to take the final render and
take it into Photoshop and just make
some adjustments for it alright so check
out design course calm especially design
course calm slash premium where I
trained you how to design awesome things
one on one and also there are full video
courses and other goodies in there as a
design course premium member alright
let's get started alright so if you've
never used blender before the way you
move around in this 3d space is by
holding down your 3rd mouse button and
it's moving around to zoom up you use
your mouse scroll wheel to pan around
you hold shift and that third orbital
mouse button like that alright so
secondly if you want to delete objects
it's very simple as hit to delete and
enter which we're not going to do
because we're gonna use this cube to get
started for the monitor so that's the
only introduction I'm gonna do I'm just
going to kind of describe things as I go
along alright so what we need to do from
this cube here is create the basic shape
of a monitor and I'm not going to get
real specific and try to get all the
exact dimensions down I'm just gonna
eyeball it because really we're not
gonna have any other objects around it
so the exact proportions aren't you know
necessary for this particular
composition so what we want to do
obviously is flatten this a little bit
so the way we do that is right now
currently we're in object mode that
allows you to do things like scale
things up the object as a whole
rotate them move them around etc but if
you want to actually deform the shape
you were selected on you can hit tab and
now you're in edit mode okay you can
also so I switch to edit and object and
all these other modes right in that
little menu there alright so to make
this flat we basically have to we can do
it in several
different ways but the way I before I
get there I wanted to describe something
real quick right now all of the vertices
are selected we can see the whole thing
is highlighted in orange kind of eye we
have three different modes you have
vertex select mode you have edge mode
and to select objects in object mode you
just right-click by the way it's kind of
important to select your edges you
right-click them to select your vertices
you could right click them and then you
also have face modes so you have those
three different modes that's phase side
and vertex select eye to select all by
the way just hit a and a that will
basically toggle between select all and
select none all right so what we want to
do is scale this in this way we're going
to assume that this is the front of the
monitor all right so to scale something
all you have to do is hit s and you'll
see by default it will scale it along
all three axes well if you only want it
along the Y for example you just hit Y
very simple so most Brett eye monitors
unless you're working with one of the
old-school CRT monitors are pretty thin
all right so what we want to do is scale
this in so that it's real thin if you
need to I make it a little bit thinner
you could just hit s again Y and scale
that sucker in right around there all
right so now we need to make this wider
so the way we'll do that is the same way
so s and X and then just drag it out
roughly right around there and that
looks like a pretty accurate size of
maybe like a 1920 by 1080 type of
monitor or 16 by 9 all right so very
simple so far I another thing I do is
I'm just gonna move everything up here
all right and I also want to scale the
whole thing down just a little bit all
right
and another thing that I want to do is
go ahead over here in this panel so we
have all these different tabs we want to
add what's
called a subdivision surface on this
alright so you just click Add modifier
and subdivision surface will see that it
turns it into this crazy-looking thing
so the reason we want to add this
subdivision surface is because the
monitor on the backside usually on most
monitors are kind of rounded so you'll
see how we can achieve that effect here
I shortly so what we want to do also
before I go any further we could have
done this before this step is hit ctrl R
now what that does is add what's called
an edge loop if you left-click once and
then twice without moving it you'll have
it set and so if I back up real quick
just to show you if you hit ctrl R again
and you use your mouse scroll wheel you
can add a bunch and the way this works
is since we just want one once you add
them left click you can also place them
wherever you want so there's two
different steps when it comes to adding
those edge loops so we want to do it so
that it stays right in the center we
don't want it to move so ctrl R and then
enter on your keyboard we'll make sure
it's I won't move on that second step
alright so once we've done that because
what we're working with is kind of
mirrored like we have the right and left
over here we can go to the vertex mode
and we're gonna delete this half and we
want to make sure that this right here
is selected then we're going to hit one
on the number pad on the keyboard that
gives us to the front view and the
reason I've turned this on if we turn
this off for example we hit a to
deselect and then we hit B B is kind of
like a lasso tool in Photoshop and then
left-click and drag and select it's only
going to select the front vertices which
is not what you want you want it to
select both that's what this does
basically so when we hit one again
make sure this is turned on hit be left
click now it has selected both of them
so now we hit delete vertices so now we
only have half of it we're gonna add
another modifier and this is called
mirror and the mirror modifier makes it
so that whatever you do over here it's
going to be mirrored over here and that
just kind of saves us with some work
basically I what's also cool is we can
add another edge loop right here hit
enter and then we can also hit a to
deselect B delete vertices and then we
can specify Z sorry about that I didn't
see it and I was wondering where it was
while it's down here and that's because
the origin point was set right there so
if I take everything up here and I drop
it we can see that now we have it closer
together and if we turn on clipping
right here and we move it together we'll
see that it doesn't intersect when we
add them all right so now we have it so
that the I whatever we do over here is
going to be mirrored on these other
three corners down here which is handy
all right so what we want to do now is
turn up the view subdivisions and
renders as well and when you do this it
will make it smoother so I'm just going
to specify 3 for mine all right so now
what we want to do is go ahead and hit
ctrl R to add an edge loop right around
there will work ctrl R to add an edge
loop over here and push it up right
around the
all right and then if we come to the
side we'll see that normally when it
comes to a monitor I the flat portions
right here and then the portion where it
kind of just curves down is in the back
so what we can do if we come over to
this side is hit control R we'll add an
edge loop along this portion and bring
it forward so now we look at this
we'll see it has a much better
appearance or more realistic towards
like a TV or a a monitor in this case
all right all right so far so good
so now we have this issue here and this
is created from the subdivision surface
get control R now to edge loop right
there
I mean control R and then an edge loop
at the bottom we will make it go away
basically all right pretty simple stuff
okay so now what I want to do is
separate the very front of this because
this front face is going to be black
around the edges at least and then this
back portion is gonna be like his silver
sort of glossy / chrome slash metals the
type of appearance or material all right
so what we can do is now that we've had
this basically modeled how we want it to
be we can apply the mirror modifier and
so if you ever used Photoshop you know
this is where you're basically
rasterizing that's the I guess you would
call that the equivalent to applying a
modifier so once you hit apply you can't
really update it anymore so you have to
do in also object mode so switch to tab
to object mode and hit apply all right
so now we have this applied and now what
we want to do is hit tab and you'll see
now everything is all here all the
verses and
what I'm gonna do is switch over here to
the face select mode we're gonna turn
off this limit section to visible and
the reason is is if you have this turned
on and you go to right-click and select
a face sometimes you'll select the back
one by accident so that prevents that
from happening you can click it anywhere
it'll only select those front faces I an
easy way of selecting all these would
just be to hit one on your keyboard for
front view and then hit a to deselect
everything and then hit B and select all
those all right so now you only have
this front portion selected all right
simple enough so now what we want to do
is hit shift D and then left click or
hit enter so what that does is it
duplicated that selection so if we move
this forward which you can just watch us
you don't have to do this you'll see we
have a copy all right so it's in the
same spot what I want to do now is
separate it if I hit P uhit's that means
to separate by selection what it means
when you separate something is no longer
is it going to be a part of the object
it's just separated from this object so
now if we go back to object mode we can
right-click this and this is our main
object that we've been working with but
also right-click this and that is only
our front so what we want to do now is
make this kind of like a black glossy
texture and so this is the point where
we want to switch to cycles render and
so I always use cycles I've actually
never used blender render I'm a little
bit late to the blender game so cycles
render is superior and what we want to
do is now come here to the materials tab
and click on use nodes and nodes is
basically what cycles uses for its
material system so you'll always do that
step and we'll go ahead and make this
just black just for now
and just so we can get a view set up
real quickly let's go ahead and get some
lighting and a plan like our floor and
then I some emission planes as well so
right now we're all we've only been in
solid mode but if you switch to rendered
we'll see it a quick view of what
everything looks like alright so what we
want to do is first yeah I think what
we'll do you can do any number of steps
first I'm just trying to think of what
would make logical sense what we'll do
is I yeah we're gonna switch to the
render settings over here and if you
have a graphics processor you can use
GPU compute if you don't see that option
go to file user preferences and go over
here to system and see for compute
device select CUDA if the options
available it will be available if your
graphics card has a graphics card
processor so I up to five to GeForce GTX
580 s and you'll see that option now
that basically makes everything like a
thousand percent faster when it comes to
rendering and previewing alright so
second here um I'm gonna leave that
there this fee this 50 percent when we
go to actual render that means it's only
gonna do 50 percent of your x and y
value here so I just make it a hundred
percent that's not the nothing we really
have to worry about at the moment though
sampling I the higher you have this set
the longer it'll take but the better
look
so render probably a thousand or so
preview I'm gonna choose about a hundred
previews what we're doing here by
selecting render this isn't a final
render when you finally render you go
can click on render I so the other thing
we want to worry about when it comes to
rendering is the tiles if you are using
GPU 256 by 256 again that's something
that we like that's you really worry
about during cleaning when you click on
render all right so now I want to do is
add a floor so I'm gonna switch back to
solid view I'm going to make sure we
have both of our objects selected so I
have my front face selected I'm gonna
hold shift and right click and then move
this
up and then hit shift a mesh plane and
I'm gonna hit s for scale and I'm gonna
put in a value of I'm gonna try 40 so
it's gonna scale it up 40 times and hit
enter
all right so then what I want to do I'm
gonna come out here I'm gonna give us
some light so I'm just gonna come out
maybe right around there just above it a
little bit shift a mesh and then plane
right now it's facing downwards so we
can hit our for rotate and X on the x
axis and then 45 for a 45 degree angle
so now it's facing downwards on to our
monitor and scale it down just a little
bit I think so yes and just move your
mouse a bit and I'm going to add three
of these shift D will duplicate and you
can move it around wherever but if you
hit X it'll only move it along the x
axis and then actually before I do that
I'm gonna delete that one I'm gonna set
up the material so you click on
materials hit a new surface we're gonna
use emission which is right up there
strength I'm gonna try 24 now the color
is white and just so you can see what
this looks like
selectively rendered alright so when
you're in rendered mode you can't see
what you're selected on I but you could
still work with objects so if you hit
shift D enter and then hit G and that's
the shortcut for a move X so G and X and
then move your mouse and then shift e
enter G and X
yeah right around there it'll do well
all right
okay so now if I go back to solid we
want this to have a separate material
than the front so the way you do that is
because right now they both have what's
called this one that's called material
with this one selected the front face of
it we're gonna change this to front
screen for the name and then on the
right are in the back rather hit this
little plus sign that will basically
replicate it but it becomes now a
separate material for that object so
we're gonna call this back screen
alright so remember we don't don't just
want our surface to have a diffuse
texture we're gonna add what's called a
mix shader' and which allows you to add
a couple different shaders here so the
way we do that is come up over here
choose mix and by the way if you want to
preview what it looks like when you're
making these changes you can switch to
rendered and we want to go to shader
here and so this is the first shader of
our mix shader' this value basically
means how much or how less of the first
one that you want to edit so the first
one we'll just make a diffuse just down
here and real quickly the reason that's
happening is because the the front
screen is kind of intersecting with the
the same portion that we duplicated so
all you have to do is with the back
screen selected if you hit G yeah hit G
and then Y that way it only moves along
the y axis if we move it just a tiny bit
you'll see that now it's appearing as it
should and there's a little bit of space
in between it for now that's not really
a problem I'm gonna worry about okay so
now it's not really I what you what I
would call a reflective so that's only
because we don't have the second shader
down here so we're gonna change
this one too glossy alright simple
enough also we want to make this plain
here that's sitting on we want to make
that black hole along with the
background so the background the way we
could do that it's the world's tab right
there we'll see it's this grey color
right now make that completely black and
then we'll right click to select the
plane make sure that's selected we'll go
back to rendered and we'll select on the
materials give it a new one and we'll
make this a mix shader' here oops
mix shader' and we'll make the other one
diffuse the top one diffuse the bottom
one glossy okay and for the colors drop
these down to gray the top one this one
will be a little bit lighter
alright so there this side one we
right-click it notice you can see the
individual faces real quick I forgot to
real quickly if you make sure you have
it selected switch over to render it
again choose smooth right here and then
I'll make it all smooth which is much
better alright so now what we want to do
I'm going to switch back to solid we're
gonna make sure we have both of our
objects selected so the back one
selected the front one hold shift right
click now we're going to move this up
off of the floor a bit right around
there looks good and now we want to
create this stand all right so the stand
pretty simple the way we'll do that is I
hit 1 on the number pad left click to
make the origin somewhere just right
around here in the center near the
bottom and hit shift
and plane all right so our ex and 90
will flip it 90 degrees on the x-axis
hit s for scale and scale it down right
around there and we want to move it to
the back now we also want to give it
some thickness right now it has no
thickness so the way you do that is in
the modifiers add modifier and we'll
select solidify I mean you do that it
gives us a little bit of thickness and
the thickness is adjusted right here in
this value you can increase it by doing
this or just left clicking and dragging
maybe somewhere right around there
all right that's a decent thickness okay
so then what we want to do is adjust it
so that it's a little bit taller so s
and Z and we want to I we're not going
to have a back view in this composition
so it's not real important what it looks
like in the back here but we want it to
kind of just come down here and then sit
on the floor and so we're gonna add real
quickly another modifier the subdivision
surface I'm gonna put up to three hits
smooth so our some shading smooth just
so we don't forget about that hit tab
and we're gonna hit ctrl R and
left-click and move to the left ctrl R
move it to the right and I'll have click
then you want to make sure back face is
turned on vertex select mode a to
deselect B and now we can start
extruding so to extrude something you
hit e so if we hit 3 on the number pad
we'll go to the side view just to see
what this thing looks like so E and you
can hit Z to make sure it stays on these
D axis you can also move it out like
this
and also yeah based on where the current
plane is you'll see it kind of go
beneath it too far which obviously you
don't want but we'll worry about that in
a second
we'll hit again X oops e Z I mean sorry
not X and push this one out just a
little bit and then again Z move this
one in maybe right around there and then
e and then Y it'll come out a little bit
further right around there alright so if
we go to rendered we'll see it's above
it a little bit so what we can do is
right now it's currently selected so we
hit G and Z and just bring it down just
a tad bit and we'll want to do the same
thing for these two this line right here
so a or a rather to do select B and then
hit B again right around there so now
rendered view shows us this alright so
for the thickness I think I want it a
little bit thicker than that so what
we'll do is turn this up I'm going to
try just 2.01 and let me go here to
solid alright
and actually we're gonna change that to
0.1 actually maybe 0.2 see what that
looks like
all right now that's a little bit better
in terms of thickness so if I hit a B
pull those up just a bit right around
there
all right that's good and then if I hit
s in X we can just enlarge it a tad bit
all right that looks pretty decent in my
opinion so check it out rendered all
right and let's I get out of object or
edit mode go to object mode and with
this selected the back portion here
let's I go to materials it's called back
screen let's give that the same material
so you click on this now we have that
material right there you know I may
actually want to change it a little bit
and yeah bring it down just a notch in
terms of the grayness all right
just checking this out
yeah I think that looks good okay all
right so now what I want to do is I want
to add the actual portion where you have
the viewable area in the screen so let
me see something here real quick good
like the solid so yeah when you go to I
when you view most monitors the the
outer portion might be black or some at
least not most but the one I'm going
forward will have a black border around
here and then the actual portion where
you view you know whatever it is you're
viewing will be in here so the way I'm
going to do this I first real quickly I
want to make an adjustment because we
could see there's space here in between
this front face so if we get in there
real close bring it in make sure we
didn't go one way too far
all right that looks good okay so now
what we want to do is I go to solid hit
1 and right here in the center shift a
plane are X 90s and this is where we
want the thickness to be adjusted or the
from the height so I think this right
here maybe just a tad bit more s and Z
all right and then s and X
click right there it looks good alright
now what we want to do is make this so
that when we're viewing this the eye we
have to unwrap it so that we can place
the whatever is going to be in here
which is going to be a Photoshop
interface will be on it so what we'll do
is in order to get an image on there we
have to left-click and drag from this
little icon here and that will split the
screen
over here we can change the view to the
uv/image editor
we're gonna hit new and make sure you're
set at 2:04 8 bytes to 0 for 8 hit OK
and you can use your mouse scroll wheel
to zoom out so you can see everything
over here hit 1 on your number pad and
then go to edit mode so hit tab with
that selected hit you for unwrap and
we're gonna choose project from view hit
s.g and somewhere right around there
alright so now we go to UVs and we go to
export UV layout alright
so I've created a new folder I'm going
to call this eye front UV and we're
gonna make it a PNG make sure all UVs
has selected down here PNG export UV
layout
alright so now this is where we switch
to photoshop alright so I'm going to
load up Photoshop and I have it loaded
and with the file open and front UV is
what we want to open and this is a
pretty large image layer 0 we see here
is where our UVs are placed
control-shift-n for a new layer hit OK
drop it down beneath it and we're gonna
make it black for the foreground and
then with the paint the fill tool just
left-click so now we could see this area
where we can place anything inside of it
that we want to appear on that screen so
what I'm gonna do is
maximize my window I have a 1920 by 1200
resolution so if I double-click this the
interface is kind of gonna go kind of go
away because I'm not recording my full
screen but what I'm gonna do is I get
this off screen real quick and I'm going
to go ahead and hit alt and print screen
and that will copy to my clipboard you
know whatever current application Oman
and so if I drag this back here and I go
back to the size and go to control n for
a new document hit OK oh no it did the
wrong thing are you kidding me one
second get this off all right so I
paused and I made sure I did that
correctly and Oh file new paste that in
and my free chording application
Camtasia that has these stupid green
things right here so all I'm gonna do is
just take this real quick
hold shift and these are all the same
color edit fill and then do the same
thing over here get that color right
here and then edit fill alright so now I
for some reason it also kind of eye has
stuff outside of this so what I'm gonna
do is make sure I only select the
application here with the rectangular
marquee tool and then ctrl C to copy
come back here
ctrl V to paste that in and I'll drag it
above and now we want to make this a
line so that it's right there on the
edge of that UV layer all right so we're
gonna have to scale this down and I can
take the opacity down a little bit so we
can see if i zoom out holding alt and my
mouse scroll wheel
we'll see that it gets a little bit too
large the screen shot so we hit ctrl T
come down here hold shift we can get it
to roughly around the right size hit
move tool hit apply and then take the
rectangular marquee tool select a right
around here because we see it goes below
I want to get this bottom stuff here and
I'm gonna take the move tool hold it
just left click and hold it and then
hold shift and then drag it up there now
it's basically in the size of our UV
portion right there so now we're gonna
do is hide this UV portion make sure
this is 100% and again so we're hiding
the UV the layout layer and everything
else can be the same you leave this
black one right here and then save it as
a new file file save I'm just gonna
choose save for web I use that off then
and then JPEG 92 quality's fine hit save
I'm gonna call this front - texture I'm
going to go back to blender and now
we're gonna switch back here to what's
called a node editor alright so you'll
have a blank screen there at first and
what we want to do is we can come over
here to render just to see what
everything looks like and we're in a
material section hit new and we'll see
these are what they're called nodes so
we have the material output and then we
have our diffuse right here so you can
adjust materials over here or over here
over here kind of gives you more fine
control in terms of how the it looks so
we want to add that image onto this
diffuse portion right here so we hit
shift a text your image texture connect
these the color to this color and it's
pink or purple basically because there's
no image selected yet then you hit open
and we want to select our folder front
next year and there we go
so now if I right-click right in this
middle area and hit join area we want to
join this over here so left click we
could see we now have our awesome
monitor pretty cool we can get up there
and yeah alright so now what we want to
do is fix something that's been annoying
me I you look under the side there's
like a deformation right here see it in
the back to its long here and that's
from our clipping that we had applied so
if we go back here to solid go back to
edit make sure you have this back
portion selected and if we go to edit
mode hit tab and we want to make sure
we're on vertex select right here reason
that's happening is because there are
actually two sets of vertices along this
line because we had that clipping option
selected I so we want to delete one of
them because it's affecting the
subdivision surface so the way you
select one is just right hit alt and
then right click that will give you a
selection of just one of them and then
you hit delete vertices so now it should
be completely smooth right there we have
the same thing happening up here as well
so alt right click and I think this
should work with delete and try yeah
that me
I think we have the same thing over here
as well let's check and see what this
looks like here real quick unrendered
alright that's much better
alright so now everything is looking
good this would be a good time to save
what you're working on by the way so I'm
gonna go over here and call this project
alright looking good so now I there's
one thing I want to change real quickly
go back to object mode tab we're gonna
right-click and select our base this
should probably be coming out a little
bit more alright so what we want to do
is go into edit mode and I'm gonna hit a
B you gotta look a little bit better
right there alright so now I go back to
object mode and go to rendered all right
so far so good
so now what I want to do is create kind
of like a a path so in Photoshop or
illustrator for example you have the pen
tool and that allows you to create paths
I'm sorry I kind of want like this path
that's coming from the screen I'm
wrapping around it so the way we can do
this and create basically a wire I will
go to solid mode here and we'll hit one
in the keyboard left click wherever we
want the thing to start coming out hit
shift a curve and bezzie a now what that
does is add this real simple curve line
right there I let's bring it to the
forward here and we want to move this so
I'm gonna scale it down a little bit so
we can work with it a little bit easier
and we can rotate it a lot so R and Z
will rotate it R and
why we'll rotate it that way and there
we go alright so the way we're going to
do this we're going to play around with
this a lot basically so if we go to a
tab we have the option to you know
really start adjusting the actual points
of this alright so we have this one
right here now if you right click and
hold you can check the angles and really
change them around so I we're gonna have
to do that
with some of these left click will make
sure it's set and so we kind of want it
to come up or from here and then wrap
around all right so if I hit 3 we'll get
a side view it's coming out way too far
so I'll move this in coming out around
near the floor
okay and then if you take the last point
right here you can hit e to extrude it
and just move it over here so if we go
to three we'll see the side view you
want to come up and around and then you
hit R you can rotate it hit one go to
front view all right and rotate this
and you can see I'm just really playing
around with these
oops left click all right and take this
one we're gonna hit again
oops stick this in
trying to make it look natural and like
kind of like a natural ring going around
so like I said you're gonna have to play
around with this likely and I'm gonna
keep playing around with this until I
get mine correctly so you don't want to
sit here watching me do this whole time
so I'm gonna pause and then once I get
it aligned right I'll come back alright
so this is what I have so far
and what I want to do is I give this
some thickness so you can see what this
looks like this path so the way you do
that just click on this curve section
and the offset right here or the depth
is what will give it some thickness so
if we put a zero point zero zero two
maybe we'll see I have some thickness
and if we switch to rendered we'll see
what that looks like
alright so this portion I had looking
pretty good although up here it needs a
little bit of work I'm gonna apply a
subdivision surface on this and we'll
try two and three and so now that we can
see what it kind of looks like we can
adjust this on this area for mine it
doesn't look very good so what I can do
is I switch back to solid try to make
the adjustment so that this is looking
smoother all right so I paused and I
adjusted it a little bit and this will
work for now all right now what I wanted
to do is go ahead and give it a material
I'm gonna hit new and select up here
where is it at
I can never find it there it is I don't
even know how to pronounce it I'm just
going to call it metal
so yeah I Roughness turn it up a little
bit this basically makes it look like a
metal type of image and I also want to
add a spotlight so if it got a solid go
back here to edit our object mode click
up here in the back maybe up a little
bit higher there we go
and I hit shift a lamp spotlight see
it's currently facing down VR and move
it there that actually looks pretty
decent and if you go to rendered see
it's not sticking out too much though we
can change the strength through
something like 500 and we'll see it more
alright that looks pretty decent alright
so now what I want to do is also add
kind of like a little direction or
instructional pencil anchor points where
you can see the Bezier curve directions
and so to do that I'm going to go solid
by the way make sure you save your
project here and I want to add a cube
right on this line so if hit 3 see where
it's at hit one alright should get added
right near the center of that line so
shift a mesh and cube it's gonna be huge
so hit s just get that thing down a lot
right around there it looks like it's
pretty good
if we hit one
all right all right that looks good it's
going right through it so now what we
want to do is I give it a the same
material for now I that we just gave
here before so any other one so if we go
back to rendered we could see it based
on how small it is I we may want to
increase the size maybe just by twice a
s and to that increase it that's a
pretty good size right around there all
right so now what we want to do is go
back here to solid get our origin point
right around there okay shift a and
curved path this is a straight line so
the s scale it in and then we're going
to come around two three and the side
view you know I let's see here but we'll
do one first we're gonna hit our for the
front view three hit our yeah right
around there
okay so that looks like it'll be pretty
decent right around that angle and then
we can come over here and give it a
little bit of depth so zero point zero
two no that's too much
Oh point one up sorry about that 0.01 an
actuary poise 0.007 I'm going to be a
little bit better and give it that same
material yeah that's still a little bit
too thick so come back here point zero
zero four all right that's better
it's sticking out a little bit too much
but so what we want to do is I click on
this right here and this is user four
and we'll just make the color a little
bit darker all right so now what I want
to do is go over here to solid we want
to add spheres on the end because that's
how they're designed shift a UV sphere
eight by eight will work fine it s
alright so we hit one here looks like
it's in the center three it looks pretty
good yeah there we go and then we're
gonna hit smooth for shading and then
choose z03
see what that looks like on rendered
that looks good
shift D and left-click and then we want
to drag it to this other portion so at
the end of this tail up here so hit
three hit one
three
alright that looks pretty good and then
we want to take all these objects so
shift right click the middle portion the
cube and then this sphere hit shift D
and enter and then we want to move it
down and create another one over here
so what we'll do is get this moved over
here we'll go to 3 on the side view
we're going to hit our come over here
around 1/3 let's go to 7 real quick 7s
to top view and then hit our alright so
you want these to intersect if we go
back to 7 and come to 3
and this is in the center this is not so
if I right click and hitch I shift I'm
gonna do this twice here one second I
just want to select those three right
there move it down right there in the
center alright so let's go to rendered
all right pretty cool okay so I let's go
ahead and make a couple of adjustments
here gonna take the floor and I'm gonna
make this darker yeah I think that's
good I'm gonna come down here I'm going
to drag this down and get our spotlight
I'm gonna try 800 and I may also try
moving it real quick
so if you hit G you can place it
specifically
and I think that's good right around
there that should be fine
I'm not gonna be too nitpicky about it I
all right
in a previous tutorial and I'll try to
remember to link that here I had my we
took God with the design course DC
letter mark logo and we made it 3d well
I'm gonna I include that in the project
files with this and you can go ahead and
you can check that tutorial on how to
make your logo 3d I'm gonna open mine up
and copy it real quick so this is it
with it selected this DC right here
right click to select it just hit ctrl C
notice a copy selected objects to buffer
go back to our project and I did
something really stupid I didn't save it
before I open that so we're stuck with I
rendered it the only thing I didn't
change was the lighting that's back to
where it was but that's fine then so
real quickly I'm gonna make that darker
again okay alright so now I want to hit
I click right around there control being
paste that in and then just hit R and
start rotating this on different
accesses to get it kind of in an area
that makes sense you can scale it down a
little bit and move it up
around there and if I go to rendered it
doesn't have a material right now
actually looks kind of cool like that
it's like real reflective it's actually
reflecting this screen right here so let
me let me hit this plus right there
we'll call this logo texture see if I
want to experiment with some of these
this is diffuse I oh okay well one
second let me see what I have selected I
have this alright so I have this
selected all right so this is the actual
SVG matte it's called I just gonna hit
plus one right there and see if I can
experiment maybe with the color a little
bit no I like that alright and you know
what I'd also just realized when I
opened up this right here that got rid
of my directional things that I made so
I'm gonna make those really quickly
don't you just love it all right there
we go I had to recreate them again
fortunately you think I blender would
kind of notify you that hey you don't
have Save Changes before you open up a
new document but oh well
they don't right now at the moment
anyhow I see I'm gonna rate click back
on this mat or this floor and I make it
a darker color yeah maybe something like
that will work ok and let's see og and Z
G + X no why
scale it up a little bit and I'm just
really just playing around with this
okay so I now what I want to do is I
yeah I do want to give it some color so
if I change this color that doesn't
really affect it too much so if I change
this here to mix real quick
moving on emission mix where are we at
there we go
change this one to diffuse change this
one to glossy all right so we got like a
blue color here actually you know what I
change that from glossy - it's an co
tropic or whatever it's called and just
the FAC value more towards the metal cup
texture alright so G X oops Gian X or Z
and I think right around there looks
cool all right so I'm going to consider
maybe I won't lens say I'm gonna check
these things I select all three and I go
back to rendered and right now their
strength is 20 don't try 50 just to see
what happens here okay we get a little
bit brighter just for the fun I'm gonna
try messing around with the color yeah
man that's not cool let's make sure this
is I white
alright go back to our floor here
so the higher this one is the more
reflective it will be okay and if we go
back to our lamp our spotlight and I
let's see what happens here if we adjust
this again
1:05 yeah actually I think I'm pretty
happy with how it is so far so what I
want to do now set up the camera so hit
zero that will give you into camera view
hit n oh let me turn on the screencast
keys just go to user preferences you
don't need to do this by the way but if
you ever wanted to know how to do its
tutorial in the future with the
screencast keys this is what you do we
go to add-ons screen you type oh there
it is it's already on so make sure
that's checked and then start display
there you go hit n hit on again though
make sure you have locked camera to view
we're going to zoom up here and hit and
again to hide that and this is going to
be whatever is rendered so you can move
around here I think right around here
will work alright so go back to rendered
now remember our samples we have set a
thousand I'm gonna choose 1500 actually
and hit enter I have 1920 by 1080 I'm
gonna change that to 1280 to 720 because
that's what I'm currently recording at
and I real quick if you hit 0 again your
number pie can get out of there I make
sure everything looks pretty good here
yeah and it does alright so what we'll
do is actually you know what no it
doesn't this is too bright so those i
emission planes up here kind of washed
out the interface here so what we want
to do is with those selected try 30 yeah
that's a lot better
alright yeah maybe even back to 20 I
don't know yeah that's better
ok so right around there is good so now
control s and save it and hit render so
this may take a while depending on your
computer and your specs and what you put
your samples at for me I
I'm gonna pause until it is finished and
this is what my produced which I don't
kind of like it because I this is too
thick this line and this is a little bit
too thin so I'm going to hit escape if
you wanted to save that though you hit
f3 and just say that as an image your
render but I'm gonna adjust mine a
little bit my settings so I'm gonna come
over here solid I have this selected
come back over here and try 0.04 go back
to rendered and see what that kind of
looks like and then same thing with this
one 0.03 and change this one as well
all right so if we hit zero
all right so I'm gonna hit render it
again all right so that's just a little
bit better so I could probably play
around with this a lot more I'm gonna
leave it at that so when you have what
you like for a render hit f3 and we'll
save this as render save his image and
then we'll switch back here to photoshop
and we will open that up so let's see
your render alright so we're at 66.7%
alright and so I'm gonna create kind of
like a cool glow effect that goes along
this and the way we'll do this is with
the pen tool ironically enough and we're
gonna make sure we have path select
instead of shape so we're gonna create
some lines that kind of go along our
path like right around there and create
a new layer drill shift enter hit enter
and we're that way and we're gonna
switch back to the brush tool and make
sure the size we're gonna use I think
three so a feather brush hardness zero
three and the foreground color is gonna
be white and then right click back on
the pen tool right click over here oops
not make selection stroke path make sure
simulates pressure is on and hit OK
and then right click and delete the path
will see you now it ad kind of like this
eye trail of sorts I guess you could
call it and so we're gonna do another
one create another layer control-shift-n
hit OK right click stroke path simulate
pressure hit okay and then delete right
click and delete path and so we can keep
on doing this as many times as you want
so I'll do one more time and right up
here
yep and then we'll go to stroke path hit
okay right-click and delete so well I'm
gonna pause I'm gonna do a few more of
those alright so you can see I have a
number of these now and what I want to
do now is kind of create like a glow
area or it's kind of like a fight like
this orange right here so we're gonna
say take the pen tool make sure shape is
selected this time and we're going to
come out just a little bit wider than
our little flares here and start around
here and then end up right around here
by left clicking and dragging and then
just come around here and I'm just
holding alt and clicking these things so
that there and then just basically
create that shape and it over there and
then we'll right-click and rasterize the
layer and we will also go to filter blur
Gaussian blur right around right around
twelve point seven pixels and then take
our layer blend mode just left-click it
twice so it's outline and blue and use
your down arrow on your keyboard and you
can experiment with the overlays on this
to see how it looks so you can see you
have a lot of different options to
create some interesting effects and
we're definitely not done we're gonna
adjust it a little bit more so I'm going
through these again real quickly and
trying to see what kind of makes sense
I'm gonna take the eraser tool and
create a large brush because I don't
want it to look like it does now in
terms of just being this one long blob
yeah right around here
maybe just like that and still going to
experiment here with this and you can
always duplicate the layer as well so
right click duplicate layer let me also
erase part of this alright that looks
kind of cool and another thing we could
do create a new layer ctrl shift and hit
enter we're gonna make a white make sure
path is selected we're going to click on
just one of these flare areas actually
no we're gonna do this differently sorry
about that
I we're going to delete that path real
quick that I created we're gonna use the
brush tool and size may be right around
50 will work and just left click once
like that
ctrl T and hit alt hit alt again select
apply and then we can rotate it on the
edge just like apply so now we have
parts of it that really stick out and
glow which is pretty cool so you can do
that again ctrl T alt
we could do that as many times as you
wish right around there and then to make
it look a little bit more realistic in
terms of I like a shadow that's
reflecting off this surface take the
this color here we can just left click
up here first you don't want to get the
edge getting cut off ctrl T
select the move tool hit apply you can
drop down the opacity something maybe it
right around there yeah yeah cool all
right and that is it so yeah that's
basically you know the process that I
use to create the one I did initially I
showed on Facebook before I record the
tutorial the results are pretty similar
actually one other thing I wanted to do
i do saturate the top of this and that
so to show you how I did that
let's create a new layer on top of the
initial control-shift-n
we get the eyedropper tool get this
color right here and and I just block
out that top portion and then change it
to luminosity oops
no you don't one second take this layer
blend mode and experiment forget which
one I used color there we go that's the
one I was looking for so it'll just
avoid any of it of color I kind of gives
it an interesting effect like that
anyhow yep that is it
