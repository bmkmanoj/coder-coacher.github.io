calm today we're going to do a photo
manipulation tutorial and we're just
going to be working with two images the
first is going to be Niagara Falls and
then second is going to be a giant ass
nasty spider so we're going to combine
the two and the idea that we're going to
make it look like the spider is coming
up and out of the Niagara Falls and it's
going to be massive some type of mutant
monster spider so basically it's pretty
simple tutorial you'll learn a lot
though we're going to be packing
everything within 30 minutes and we're
going to be using adobe photoshop CC to
do this though you could probably use
other earlier versions I so yeah let's
go ahead and get started alright so at
this point all you need to do is visit
the two links in the description in
YouTube and basically these are both
from deviantart and we're free to use
these read up on the terms link and
credit me for this one if you use it and
put it out there and so basically just
want to download the large version so
you click on that brings up this big
window here i'm just going to right
click here in chrome and copy image i'm
going to switch back to photoshop and
control n for a new layer well let's
call this spider falls all right and ok
and paste that in there and then just go
to image image size and we're going to
make it fifty percent of the size just
so we can have something manageable to
work with for this tutorial alright and
then we'll get out the second image and
let me go over here and that is this
image right here click download and let
me right click copy image close out that
are openly mana I'm maximized it and
then go ahead over here wait will create
a new document first control n hit enter
and ctrl-v to paste and we need to cut
this guy out basically so first I'm
going to take this rectangular marquee
tool and we'll just go around roughly
that size ctrl-c to copy and we'll go
back over here and ctrl-v to paste it
now as we can see this thing is massive
so
real quickly what I want to do is take
left click our left click and drag out
and take the magic eraser tool and
basically go ahead and just left-click
once and you'll see it gets rid of
everything pretty decently and do it
again over here oops over here over here
in between there a few times alright and
I guess that's fairly decent for now and
now what we want to do real quick this
is annoying me I'm going to get rid of
that so it's switch back to layer 1
we'll just call this waterfalls will
call this one spider and we'll switch to
the waterfalls layer and we will use the
background eraser tool I mean no no no
no no sorry we will use the clone stamp
tool and the size around 78 will work
and then just hold your alt key left
click once and if that happens just do
it again they could tell nothing was
ever there alright so now we want to
take this do this spider and go to edit
transform flip vertical oh and of course
we got this stuff down there so all you
have to do is take our magic eraser tool
get rid of that I think we're going to
have some of the top as well no we're
not okay good and then finally what we
want to do is go ahead and ctrl T and
we're going to scale down here roughly
around this size and we really want to
make it look like he's climbing up out
of that situation there and make them a
little bit larger and I think the right
around here pretty good so select the
move tool and hit apply all right and
now you can see we still have quite a
bit of work to do the Lighting's off and
all that
I so what I want to do now is put an
adjustment layer so you can go to window
adjustments and we can put a brightness
and contrast on the spider now right now
if you to adjust the brightness contrast
it would affect everything as you see
but if you click this little button it
will only affect the spider so for the
brightness we're going to kind of just
bring it down a little bit but for the
contrast really right around there we're
going to experiment with these based on
how things look so this might not be the
final I values basically but I'm going
to take the hue and saturation as well
take the saturation down a little bit
and let's click on that button again
yeah and right around there so we have a
negative 36 for the saturation and
lightness at plus 13 all right so it
looks a little bit more a part of the
picture right now at this point and what
we want to do now is I want to get rid
of everything that should be behind this
waterfall line right here and by the way
this is Niagara Falls but now so let me
go ahead and zoom up a little bit and
take the pen tool here and what I want
to do is we're going to make sure path
is selected
actually one quick adjustment to make we
want to make the spider here the ax
pacity will take that down and we want
to follow a line along this edge and we
want this leg to be in front but these
in to be behind
alright and we can right click make
selection for me it inverts a selection
so I've a control shift I to invert it I
can hit the select the spider and hit
delete and let's see where else i want
to go right there's good for now and i'm
going to do the same thing over here
because that leg showed up on the other
side right click make selection ok
control shift i delete all right now if
we take everything back up to a hundred
percent that's what we have so far now i
want to make it look like these legs are
in the water up to take a certain point
so I'm going to work on this leg first
I'm going to create a new layer mask so
make sure this is selected and hit ok
I'm going to take the eyedropper tool
and just choose a darker color right
around here a watercolor and then take
the pen tool make sure shape is selected
and right around here we want to put an
outline or a shape that kind of makes it
look like the point where it starts
going into the water basically and then
i'm going to change the blend mode
basically you experience you can
experiment with the blend mode by
clicking this and then using your down
arrow key and you can see what looks
most natural and what look look most
natural for me i believe was soft light
and then taking down the opacity you
know around 30 so percent and then what
I wanted to do also is just to kind of
use the eraser tool to fade that
Bonaparte alright and so I'm going to do
the same thing down here take the
I'll go ahead and create a new layer
ctrl shift n I just hit tab and then
space to select that real quick to
create acrylic p clipping mask and then
same thing change the layer blend mode
to soft light and that looks pretty good
as is so i don't have to adjust the
opacity or anything and I do want to
kind of fade that bottom portion alright
and then finally this one over here will
do the same thing with two layer mask
real quick we're going to get rid of
some of this crap around the edges that
shouldn't be there and go ahead and
selects off light this one needs to be
down quite a bit say around 25 maybe and
then I take the eraser tool now we don't
want to select this portion so we can
quickly take the pen tool switch to
shape and come down around here right
click make selection hit OK ctrl shift I
or command shift I if you're on a Mac
and kind of fade that in right there
alright so now what we want to do is I'm
going to focus on trying to get rid of
some of the blurriness crap around there
it does not look good at all so I'm
going to go ahead try using the
background eraser tool so if I left
click drag and choose this one in the
middle here I have mine set at eight
hardness is at 44 and if you hit alt and
select that we could try to remove some
of this you want to make sure that
Center cursor point is not in like on
this portion because it'll end up
deleting it
you basically just kind of want it to be
on the color portions of where you're
trying to delete
and you could probably spend a lot
longer time kind of going over this now
these are quite obvious down here now
for this one since it seems like it's a
little bit more defined you can actually
see there's not too much stuff in
between it i'm going to try using the
pen tool with a path selected and so the
way we'll do that is start right around
here and you don't want to delete
everything because there's like little
hairs on here and then it just won't
look natural really
so if I come back around just probably
go up here as well all right and select
that right click make selection control
inverse and delete that off so now that
looks better and just for the sake of
the tutorial i think i'm not going to
worry about this side it almost looks
like a every guy like kind of like a
high late anyway so at this angle so
just to save time if you wanted to do
that you could you know further refine
it alright so now i also want to kind of
create some shadows here to make it look
like you know this thing actually exists
there so now what I want to do is I
select on the waterfalls layer create
another layer ctrl shift n and it won't
be a clipping mask it doesn't need to be
and then we'll take another watercolor
something maybe a little bit darker
around here and that color code is to be
3733 and it's going to zoom up here and
basically we're going to try to make
this look as natural as possible so i'm
going to start on this portion of the
leg and then just kind of go down and
you want it to really look like it's
flowing with the water for it to look
you know realistic of basically end it
right there and then just come back up
maybe like that oh you know what I did
and have that switched over to shape so
then so I'm kind of screwed up well you
know what just to save time because I
already did that real quick I think what
I'll do is actually kind of fill that no
I can't well what I'll do is this
right-click and just make selection ctrl
shift I and i will just paint bucket
that thing in there Oh that'll work
alright so i'll come down to a soft
light again and um that doesn't look
like it's kind of like lining up early
actually it begins right there so that
was kind of screwing me up that's fine
and then take down the opacity kind of
like that you know I want it to stick
out too much and then I same thing over
here this time will you shape make sure
shape selected and come out this way you
know we can't see you over there and
take make it Oh stuff light
okay all right and then this one will
create another layer actually when you
have shaped layer selecting you just
click it automatically creates one so
that's not too important and as you can
see I'm not really being too specific
you could really get in there and try to
cover every little water blip or
whatever over soft light yeah that's
right and then this one will have to
come down quite a bit right around there
twenty-eight percent is good it looks
like all right and then I think I'll
create another one right here just like
this
take overlay hit ctrl H to get rid of
the bounding box thing and yeah that's
fine right around there just first you
know maybe this heads on there alright
so now I now what we want to do is I
want to make it look like some mrs.
coming up over here but we need to make
sure it only affects a certain area so
let's take the pen tool with shape
selected and we will come right or long
here and we want it to kind of match
this area are this line and we want
basically to only have an effect
everything that is kind of outside of
our beneath are inside this area so
we'll just come up and round here and
then come up real high like this then
we'll go ahead and get rid of the fill
like that and then we'll double click on
it and for blending mode opt for
blending options default deselect this
blending clip layers its group and then
select blended blend interior of exes
group and basically what that allow us
to let's create a new layer clipping
mask I it allow this to come through the
following effect that we're about to
apply and I have just have some type of
like smoke / fire brushes and i'll link
to some of those that you can use in a
real easy just double click on them
they're automatically loaded into
Photoshop and basically i'm going to use
just one of these and I how about this
one yeah that might work and then I kind
of just click right here or maybe click
a couple times yeah like that Network
kind of well alright and maybe one more
time down here just make it look like
there's more happening there at the
bottom all right and because if you
wouldn't have made that change over here
I you won't be able to see it so
here's what happens I'll show you it
hides it's like where did it go well
that's what happens when you get rid of
the fill so just a quick tip all right
okay so now what we're ready to do is
really play around with this image in
terms of adjusting the blend modes and
stuff so I'm going to come over at
waterfalls and add a brightness and
contrast and let me get this thing out
of the way so I can actually see the
image take the brightness down a little
bit contrast we'll take that down as
well and then I want to do I another one
and this one actually now that let me
double click on this yeah that's only if
we want to only want that one to affect
their and then also at the top I want to
add a another one and this one is going
to be kind of universal on it's not
going to just affect everything so this
time we're going to bring the brightness
up
i'm going to add hue and saturation and
play around with lightness turn that up
just a little bit going to leave that
there and keep on playing with this turn
the contrast way up now I'm going to
come back to the spider and see if we
can make some adjustments I think it's a
little bit the saturations a little much
on the spider so I'm turning that down
and ultimately it's all about at this
point it's just kind of about eyeballing
it to see what you think will really
work best and I this leg looks too
bright right here same thing with this
one as well so i'm going to create a new
mask right here on the top and i'm going
to see if I can kind of make that darker
so let me get out take change the
foreground color to a darker color right
there and then use a feather brush about
maybe that size and see if I can make
any adjustments that will make sense
here okay I want to go darker than at
and we'll see if that we could play
around with the blend modes real quick
see if we can make a little bit darker
soft light once again seems like it will
work and then you can of course always
use the eraser tool to a race where
if it looks like it needs erased I think
that's fine right there so without it
with it looks a lot better basically and
we could do the same thing over here I
let me switch to or this tool that's
fine right there and I let me see though
where's
yeah they're going to hide that one all
right so you will probably work with I
see a little bit of you can see the edge
right there and that just does not look
good so I'm going to quickly select the
spider layer
and then just quickly go around that
portion right click make selection here
k ctrl shift I and delete and yeah you
could do that further I'm not going to
worry about it anymore and basically
that is our image so yeah just a quick
photo manipulation tutorial hopefully
you learn something I and if you have
any other suggestions or if you want to
share what you came up with head on over
to design course com / forums join up
real quick and you can showcase your
work there and I think it would be
creating new forms for showcasing follow
along tutorials alright because I don't
yet have that but yeah anyhow I probably
create that tonight I also this we can
see that is an issue let me find that
real quick because that's annoying me I
just notice that that is this so if you
select the direct selection tool you
want to make an adjustment to any of
these that's how you do it has to be a
shape layer though very simple is there
anywhere else I control one
and you know what let me also you find
this thing and just to make this look a
little bit more natural not over there
though they're all right just like that
all right so that is it I'm your
assignment of design course calm and if
you haven't yet subscribe here on
youtube and check out these on course
are calm alright see ya
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
