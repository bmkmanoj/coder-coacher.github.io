and today we have design challenge 21
wordmark logo design for a fictional
electronic cigarette company called pure
sick so these are called these companies
are called e-cigs or vaporizers
basically it's a new and very popular
form of smoking without ingesting actual
tobacco and these things have been
popping up everywhere so I just decided
maybe we'll do and focus our design
challenge based on around that type of
company and if you're unfamiliar with
what a word mark logo is well we have
some inspiration examples down here
coca-cola pencil spoon and Metallica
these are just one of many examples of
word marks so you can see they're
heavily focused around the type in the
name itself without very little external
symbolism okay so basically the
requirements are no external symbolism
make it relevant if I somehow conveying
the idea of smoking or vaporizing or
something that's just relevant to this
business I threw the letter forms which
is pure cig which can be you know title
case or lowercase or uppercase make the
document at least 500 x 500 pixels and
center the logo design and give a good
white space between the logo itself in
the document edges so don't if you make
it 500 x 500 don't make the width of the
height of the logo or the word mark
itself like 480 you know make it a lot
smaller so there's a lot of room for it
to breathe without being smashed up
against the edges and then the
submission deadline is a week from the
day Thursday for 21st at 12pm eastern
standard time you can submit as many
entries as you wish but if you do try to
focus on them making quality don't just
submit garbage and try to stay away from
all the crazy effects you know try to
stay away from drop shadows and embosses
and bevels and excessive gradients and
all that trying to make it very simple
you can see some of the biggest I'll
coca-cola Metallica you know they're
very simple and they work in one color
so that should
your goal all right so I go ahead and
submit submit your entries any time and
look forward to the review and
approximately a week and a half or two
all right I'll see you then goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
