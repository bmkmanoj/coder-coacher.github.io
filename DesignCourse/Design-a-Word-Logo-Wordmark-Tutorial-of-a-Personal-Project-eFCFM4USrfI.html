today I actually wanted to do something
that I wasn't planning on doing from
this week's preview just yesterday I
actually wanted to do a logo because I
have a personal project I'm going to be
working on and developing in my spare
time that has to do with crypto
currencies as you know I'm kind of a fan
of and also kind of combining the idea
of slack so real-time chat plus
cryptocurrency live kind of a price
charts and such like that so I found
myself needing a logo so I decided you
know what I'll make a video about my
thought process behind this logo that
I'm going to create and you could follow
along because it's a just a real cool
sort of technique that you can use to
create a word mark style logo alright so
I'm gonna switch over here to
illustrator and I'm just going to choose
this default art and illustration option
alright and by default when I you know I
get out a new artboard I want to make
sure it fills up the whole screen just
so I have a little bit more real estate
to work with so it's going to hit the
art boat artboard tool here if I can
talk and then just drag it out right
around there okay so this logo you know
I decided you know I wanted it to be a
word mark solely so you know if you're
unaware a word mark is simply just the
type portion of a logo there's no
external symbol alright sometimes when
you have a symbol plus a word mark it's
called a combination logo we're not
gonna have any of that I just want to go
strictly word mark all right so the name
is Crips type in the name Crips is going
to be the name I'm merging the idea of
cryptocurrency and real time chat with
charts and all that sorry my throat is
like all jacked up right now and so the
name of course is short for crypto or
cryptocurrency and you know I guess it's
kind of a play off of you know the whole
Bloods versus Crips gang thing watch me
get killed or something but that's about
CR IPS this is CR y PT s so at this
point you know you could do a few things
you know I know that I want just a word
mark logo which means there's no
external symbol sitting over here or on
top of the logo it's on a combination
logo it's a word mark logo and so with
that said being that we only have to
focus on the name or the type I to get
ideas of what you want to do with this
you can you know type in all caps or all
lowercase and just go through your fonts
if you go to window character and use
your keyboard up and down arrow keys
just go through all these different
fonts these I don't store many fonts on
my machine however an alternative
approach is to go to a site let me get
this over here and I put in something
like dafont.com or you could go to
google.com slash fonts and you can
search through all of these fonts and
you can even customize the text so if I
want to type in Crips Crips apply to all
fonts
there you go you can just browse through
all of these to get a potential idea
that helps you formulate you know how
the the direction that you want to take
this wordmark logo do you see something
in there in terms of the shapes that the
individual characters create or even the
white space you know the space between
them that could signify something unique
and relevant based on the purpose of the
business alright so I ended up finding a
font actually through fonts google.com
and you could do the same thing here at
de font there's other ones like font
squirrel I'm as well I and it was called
I think it's called mo NT yeah
montserrat okay I suck I don't know I
have no clue how to pronounce that but I
found this one you can down you can
search for this font and download it
from Google or you search for on Google
and find some site that I think it's
fonts grow that allows you to download
this and I got it like a heavier weight
so that's the one we're gonna use here
so it's monserrate bold and I really
liked this sort of type when it is all
caps like this all right now this is
it's a nice font there's nothing really
interesting happening here I wanted to
make it unique so that we can make this
logo our own um yeah the type ended up
self like I said it's nice it's nice
bold font but there's nothing unique
about it you need well you don't need to
you should really want to make it unique
so that people will remember it so that
it's something that can be immediately
identifiable in terms of your business
all right so what I decided to do is
control C control F and that way I just
have a copy sitting up here in case I
need if I screw up on something and I
just need to grab the letter back I
could do so and then I also want to take
the letter spacing in just a little bit
it doesn't really matter we're going to
join all these together to create kind
of like an interesting really really
unique cryptic that's where the relevant
part comes in presentation or
representation of this word Crips and
the letters between them so at this
point in order to really work with these
letters and shape them we have to get
out of type mode so we have to convert
it from a type layer to a shape layer
service so we can get control shift in
oh so now it's all converted to outlines
or paths and we can also right-click as
you can see because it's currently
grouped up it selects all of them right
click in ungroup alright so we the way I
wanted to approach this is to kind of
try to create a continuing flow between
each
of the characters as much as possible I
want them to connect and to join and I
also want to do it in such a way that
it's a it makes sense and it's
consistent and and the letter spacing
and the angles so let's try to connect
to see in the are alright so to do this
we're really going to be playing around
a lot with window Pathfinder and this
helps us just I do different types of
intersections and and it really allows
us to work and shape with these letters
so you'll see how what I mean
eventually here are just in a second so
if I take this rectangle and let's try
to connect the top of the C with this R
right here so what I want to do I don't
need this whole right side of the C so I
take this hold shift and then select the
C and then hit this one which is minus
front so now we just got rid of that top
part now let's also make another
rectangle that gets rid of all of this
so we only want just this part we don't
care about this leg right there so hold
shifts like both and there we go next
we're going to move this over just a bit
and then we're going to take the direct
selection tool and this allows us to
select individual anchor points now
we're going to hold shift while
selecting both of those and move them
over oh no what the hell happened here
that's not cool all right so you have a
few different ways that you can try to
fix that as best as possible so we could
for instance take this and scale it down
just slightly like that and even doing
that it still gives us a little bit of
an issue where we have this part right
here you could instead to try to even it
up take this down or take these two
anchor points and drag them down just a
bit and even get closer by holding alt
in your scroll wheel and even matching
them
right around there just to get a general
idea or not idea but just an area that
connects twel connects well with it and
so I'm gonna leave it like that that's
fine this could potentially present you
with an issue if you want everything to
be exactly the same width but really
just to give us an idea for
brainstorming this is completely fine it
doesn't have to be perfect okay so now
we have our C in our are connected but
this looks a little bit weird right here
doesn't it yeah it does you know what
would be cool is if we simply took this
line right here and just want to make it
we made it go straight up so let's take
this with the direct selection tool
still selected let's delete that Anchor
Point
let's also delete this one as well all
right and I'm going to drag this in so
that it matches up as best as possible
with this angle here and eventually you
can just get rid of that middle one
altogether take the Anchor Point or the
pen tool select on it and then connect
it back up because there's no path
between those okay now next notice how
these two this this line right here in
this line as well they're kind of
converging we kind of want them to be
along the same angle all right so if I
take the pen tool and just click on this
from here and I I want to flip this
around so that it's at the same angle so
if I right click I got a transform
reflect vertical hit okay and then right
click transform reflect it's probably
quicker way of doing that and also by
horizontal we now have that same angle
right there so now we can hold shift and
select both of these and minus front so
now these are both the same angle all
right they're also kind of far apart so
all ways to do is go back to our direct
selection tool move this sucker in right
around right there looks good so now we
have a really cool unique we've
basically taken this C
this our and merged it right there okay
let's try focusing on the why now by the
way I if your your head spinning from
all that crap that I just did don't
worry I mean if you're new to the
Pathfinder and the pen tool and anchor
points if you just keep working with it
especially going through drills like
this it'll come naturally it's really
easy okay
so I'm gonna move over so how can we
connect this Y here to this are alright
well if you can try to move it over here
that's just okay that's crap you can't
do that I mean way too close I don't
like it
Plus this is the angle this why this
left portion of the Y I don't even think
matches up with this angle so instead
how about we just take our pen tool I'm
going to kind of outline this area right
here okay so now we've created a new
shape that follows this same path right
here so if I just get in close and I'm
gonna go just to where these two areas
meet right there and I also want to
bring this in or out to this area I
don't want to go all the way because I
want these to be as close to possible
let's close as possible in terms of
width here so now I'm gonna take this
these two with the direct selection tool
and bring them down we want to maintain
the same area so just make sure you get
that lined up as much as possible I'm
just gonna come down somewhere around
here I think this guy just get them down
here we're not gonna use it now we're
gonna take this control C control F
which replicates it we're gonna
right-click and reflect it on vertical
hit okay and move it over alright
hopefully you're still with me so now
let's get this guy over here just so we
have a point of reference we can take
this these two anchor points bring them
up right it's snapping to that edge
there we go right there
now I'm gonna take these two down here
holding shifts liking both and make it
match that baseline point right right
here there we go
all right so I think here's the problem
this y is coming down too close for my
liking so the way we can fix this is if
we move this over it's gonna bring it in
a little bit more plus these two points
are converging so I can just take this
and move it up and there we go
sweet I kind of like that so far all
right so now let's connect the P to the
Y let's do the same thing we did before
so we're going to take this we're going
to minus front take this take this again
just the direct selection tool is all
I'm working with here move it in around
there and then bring that guy we want
like an evil evil an evil amount of
space no an equal amount of space
between this right here and these two
elements right here everything like here
is pretty pretty consistent so we want
to maintain that consistency and it is
there already pretty close I think I
have to drag in it maybe a little bit
more maybe one pixel or something like
that
all right so see our Y P we have so far
now let's get our T the T I think I'm
just going to connect from the very top
like that and then maybe bring this in
slightly all right and they asked the s
there's be gonna be a tough one because
first of all it's the s for this
particular font is slightly bigger sort
of problematic so we can scale this down
just a tad bit there we go
and I also want to do something a little
bit different here these are actually
not I don't think I'm going to have them
connect but what I want to do is extend
this out maybe around here all right and
actually maybe I won't have it come back
I'm going to take it right here here
take this in right around see right here
all right
and notice how this is not as thick now
what I want to do is to increase this
thickness we can add a stroke right here
all right so if I scale this in and by
the way it's the same color so it's kind
of hard to see it's take the stroke
we'll make it red and I will also take
the opacity down so we can see what's
happening it's just a little bit not
quite there
all right that's a lot closer all right
so now once we have the opacity or let's
get it back to 100% we make this black
well now with the new thickness working
we'll go to object path and then outline
stroke and then click this one unite so
there we go
so now I'm going to take a rectangle
just over the middle part where these
intersect
along with those two only shift and -
front actually it do I want to do that
no on one second
I think what I'll do instead real
quickly is we're going to go back sorry
about this this is this is the process
unfortunately and go find yourself doing
this a lot let's see here we're gonna
make this go out and bring this back in
alright and then I think I'll just take
both of these and this one just one
right here okay okay so now and by the
way we can match these up there we go
perfect alright so now what I want to do
is I'm going to take just a white color
for now and I'm going to trying to find
where these two just barely meet so I'm
going to come up right around here I'm
trying to follow this angle right here
so I'm going to come down
like that except we're gonna take the
truck selection tool move this in right
around there I wanted to have just kind
of a barrel Isis a little tiny
separation between both of those maybe a
tad bit more so I'm gonna take both of
them there we go
all right so now I'm gonna take this and
this and we're gonna merge them they're
gonna take this and then minus front so
then I'm gonna take this and move it
over and there we go
finally I also I'm gonna take this this
and move them over move this over a
little bit out maybe around here and
then based on this angle all right so
right here here here let's make this
white I'm gonna make it I want it to go
all the way right until this edge right
down there all right so now I'll take
this and this
oops right-click and ungroup those
and I will - front like that let's group
those ctrl G and then one final this
angle is kind of off a little bit you
know so what I'm gonna do is we'll just
first oops this one is slightly off
there we go again these are just I this
is kind of like a rough sort of logo you
wouldn't really want to make sure
everything is perfectly aligned as much
as possible
oops that was connected to the original
on second here I just want to make sure
all these lines meet up as much as
possible or match up there we go so now
I'm gonna take this intersect it right
at that bottom edge right there and then
just i we have to ungroup this for this
to work - front all right so now
everything is much more even alright so
we've gone from essentially and by the
way you see all these paths here in the
middle we can just take everything and
merge them right there just by uniting
alright so this is the kind of like the
rough logo that I'm going to use for
that project so we've essentially gone
from you know a nice font to this
something that is kind of cryptographic
it I mean it's not entirely too hard to
read but it's still very fluid I and it
really speaks to you know this type of
industry or this niche and that it's you
know I kind of cryptographic yeah and
it's kind of its own logo as well which
is really really cool alright guys so
hopefully you were able to follow along
a little bit you probably weren't
sitting in there following every single
step because I was really moving fast
but again you'll see
if you keep up with that pen tool I know
that's a lot of times and also working
with those shapes in terms of the anchor
points and all that it'll become on a
second nature and really getting down
and understanding your keyboard
shortcuts I was using a ton of those
that's also going to help quite a bit as
well
all right so make sure you subscribe
here on youtube check out course cetera
comm and I will be back with another
tutorial either today or tomorrow this
week I definitely want to get into
angular cloud firestore and firebase
authentication as well as electron
alright I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
