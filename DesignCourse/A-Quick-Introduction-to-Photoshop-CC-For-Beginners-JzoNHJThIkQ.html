comm today I'm going to do something
that I don't usually do and now that's
going to be creating an absolute
beginner tutorial for Adobe Photoshop CC
so as most of you know who have watched
this and follow the channel I'm doing a
video every day of the year of 2014 I
think I've done like 140 or something so
far and I've had people come up in well
not come up physically but email me and
say you know I would really like to be
able to follow your tutorials but I'm an
absolute beginner so that's what I'm
going to try to remedy in this video I'm
just going to go over a lot of the most
common features that I use in Adobe
Photoshop throughout all my tutorials
and give you a basic understanding of
them alright so most of you who follow
this channel you're not going to get
much out of it you probably just click
out of here I but for those who are
absolute beginners this will be a
perfect video for you alright so check
out design course comm if you haven't
yet and subscribe here on you alright so
when you load up Photoshop this is what
you're presented with there's no
document currently open so you can't
design anything alright so the first
thing you have to do is go to file new
so we're going to name it intro and I
write here you have presets I usually
just use custom and the width by height
these are by default it pixels although
you can change this to inches and all
these other units of measurement the
width I'm just going to use 500 by 500
and you know depending on what it is
you're designing the width and the
height are kind of important I because
if you're going to use Photoshop say for
example for having something that's
being printed like a business card well
it's important to set the document up
right from the beginning so generally
speaking when it comes to eye designing
something that's going to be displayed
on the web you use a resolution of 72
pixels per inch now if you want
something that's going to be printed
like on a business card I generally you
would change this to inches
and you can specify 3.5 by 2 inches
although you also want bleeds and all
that and you know whoever you're using
to print your business cards through say
for example they would offer you usually
most of them wash offer like a PSD or
Photoshop file or at least tell you what
the dimensions used to be usually it'd
be a little bit larger this then is for
the bleeds but anyhow by just for this
tutorial were going to assume we're
working with something that's going to
be web-based so I'm going to use 500 by
500 pixels and it's web-based so 72
pixels per inch color mode RGB this is
also for print so usually we're not for
print I prefer web I so usually if the
resolution you have set at 72 the color
mode you're going to be an RGB sorry I
got interrupted but yeah RGB is for the
web and then CMYK is generally what you
would use for print
alright so kind of important
and then background contents that's
whatever when you hit okay do you want
the background to be transparent or
white usually I leave the mine at
transparent
all right then hit OK so this is the
document and you know it's transparent
because these little white and gray
checkers right here that means there's
nothing that's filled in into the
default layer one so real quick I'm
going to go over just a couple things so
to fill this in with a color we would
use what's called the paint bucket tool
alright so you see these two blocks
right here these squares we have a
foreground and then we have a background
which ever and you can see we can toggle
between both of them
all right whichever is currently on top
that's the one that the paint bucket
will fill in alright so let me just fill
it in with a white color if we click on
it we could specify the color here and
that is hundred percent white it gives
you a color code over here which happens
to be the hex code for white six FS you
can see it changes as we change over
here so we're going to make it white and
hit OK very simple we can also see a
little preview of this layer over here
so
what are layers okay well they're
exactly as they sound you can have as
many layers basically as you want and
each layer by default when you create it
if you come over here hit new layer or
hit ctrl shift + N or command shift + n
on a Mac you'll see that we have the new
layer dialog and you can give it a name
it's usually good practice to give it a
name just because if you have a ton of
layers it's easy to look and see what
it's called I don't have any purpose for
this layer so I'm just gonna leave that
layer too and we'll go over clipping
masks later though but then you just hit
OK so as we can see we have two layers
now and this one is currently empty as
we can see from the checkers means trend
there's nothing in it all right so let's
say for example we wanted to add some
type of shape onto layer - well very
simple we come down here and we have
these different type of tools so we have
a rectangle tool rounded rectangle tool
ellipse and a polygon a tool line and
custom shape tool so if we wanted to add
a side like a rectangle we could do that
but as we could see it's white so we
can't really see it too well so let's
change the color we'll make it just a
blue and if I left click and drag we'll
see how it kind of behaves I if you hold
shift it's today's a perfect square
all right now I'm still holding I
haven't let go of the left mouse button
if you hold alt wherever you initially
clicked that's where it's going to
originate from and then you field
shift and control it'll keep it a
perfect square but yeah that's just some
different ways that you can you know
manipulate and use these tools and this
isn't just for the rectangle tool - the
other ones as well all right so now we
can see we have two different layers
very very simple stuff obviously all
right so to rename a layer double click
on it just type it in you know type
whatever you want that's how it works
and when it comes to layers
there's a lot of different things you
can do so if we double click on the
right side of the layer we will see the
layer style dialog box come up and this
is just for this layer currently we can
see it's selected and we have all these
different layer styles so if we go ahead
and click on say for example bevel and
emboss we can see it automatically
created this interesting bevel effect
all right so you could play around with
all of these settings over here and you
can change the style to an outer bevel
you could come down here you could
change the lighting direction
and so you just have a ton of options in
terms of how you can customize this
bevel effect now you can also add a
bunch of these layer styles
simultaneously just by checking them so
stroke just as a stroke you can place it
inside change the color you can even
make it a gradient stroke as you can see
here and you can specify the colors by
clicking on gradient and you have
presets up here and you could also move
these around and create your own very
interesting simple stuff hit OK alright
obviously this looks very ugly but I'm
just trying to show the different things
you can do I'm going to deselect those
in inner shadow will allow you to apply
an inner shadow you can specify the
distance the size and the choke and the
angle as well and the contour will
change the appearance of this as well
and give you a lot of different options
so basically the name of the game here
is just to experiment based on what you
need same thing with all these other
ones inner glow sounds exactly you know
as its as it is opacity turns up to
normal I make it really come out there
or we make it white even so you could do
just so many things with these layer
styles gradient overlay
change the angle and once again you can
edit the gradient use a preset by
default double click on these color
stoppers and you can do a lot of
interesting cool things be out very
simple but also very powerful if you
know how to use these things correctly I
as you wish so my computer's being slow
there we go drop shadow one thing I
would have to stress though don't
overuse these a lot of new designers
attempt there they're so eager to use
these they be used to overuse them way
too much and that's bad for general
design but anyhow those are layer styles
let me apply one though real quickly um
just add like a gradient overlay hit OK
will see beneath it we have the effect
so you can toggle this I up there down
gradient over light so you can hide
individual so if you had like multiple I
great effects you could hide and show
them very simple stuff I so I'm going to
just hide that real quick alright so
right now this is called a shape layer
because we used this over here the this
one of these tools so we used rectangle
but it applies for any of these other
ones it's called a shape layer and
what's interesting it are unique about
it is you can scale this layer up to any
size without having any type of
pixelation occur so let me just show you
what I'm talking about because this is
very important to understand so I hit
control T by the way to get that up so
that's just another tip there to be able
to size.i
things and scale them you hit ctrl T
with that layer selected alright so
let's start off with a square right
around that size select the move tool
and hit apply all right so I'm going to
take over here the rectangular marquee
tool so you're probably wondering what
is the difference between these things
over here and these over here well this
right here this rectangular marquee tool
that allows you to select areas of
layers and you could do with with this a
rectangle it
and so if I hold shift left-click and
drag just a size that's roughly the same
as this and then I create a new layer
hit OK and then fill it in with my paint
bucket tool we'll see we have two layers
that look and hit ctrl D to deselect
well here we have two layers that look
pretty much identical but they are
different types of layers this one right
here we can see this little icon this
square with these little points on each
corner that's to denote that it is a
shape layer but this one doesn't have
that so actually a better eye shape I
probably could use was an ellipse but if
I hit ctrl T you're not going to be able
to tell too much with the pixelation
because these are straight lines
so let me real quickly hit ctrl a delete
and then get out in ellipse here because
we'll be able to tell much much more
with a circle all right so now if I were
to hit ctrl T and scale this up real
large select move tool and hit apply
we'll see that the corner it just looks
all blurred out and just bad okay so if
we created a an ellipse with a shape
layer the shape tool let me hide this
one and I hit ctrl T we could side we
could scale this thing up to any size
imaginable and it remains perfect all
right so that's real important to
understand the difference between a
raster layer which is this right here
and then a shape layer which is this
alright okay so let's move on into some
other things I let's talk about filters
a little bit hit apply now most of the
time when you try to add a filter to a
shape layer it's not going to Rhett I
work correctly so if I got a filter blur
and go to blur it'll tell you this shape
player must be raster mat rasterized
before proceeding do you want to
rasterize a stick so what this means is
it will take this and it's going to
convert it to one to the other type of
layer I was talking about that we showed
when we're in which we scale it up and
became pixelated so you hit OK and now
you go back to filter blur and Gaussian
blur and now you can apply an effect and
so all these effects there's a lot of
them I do all different types of
categories you have a lot of different
types of blurs lens blurs motion blurs
we add that we can specify the distance
and the angle very simple and really
it's just all about experimenting with
these i but please do not add a lens
flare
oh I remember doing that in late 90s so
yeah don't add less colors but anyhow I
so that yeah you have filters but you
know usually apply those to rasterize
layers all right let's talk about some
more of these tools I the magic wand
tool allows you to select either inside
or outside of whichever part of the
layer has design in it I and for
instance if we wanted to select this
delete it you could do that very easily
I go back a few times this over here the
lasso tool will allow you to select a
certain portion of it and you can hit
delete or you could fill it in with
another color and it will only fill in
the part that you have selected on this
layer otherwise if you want to back up
I'm just hitting ctrl Z for that ctrl
shift and for a new layer and then you
fill that in and it fills in all the way
so it's kind of important to understand
these very small differences in terms of
how you work with layers alright so if
you ever wanted to merge a couple layers
together very simple you select both of
them hold shift hit ctrl e or right
and merge layers like that I'm going to
back up all right
and let me think about some other things
we can talk about there's a lot more the
eraser tool so over here we have all
these different options I you have
different brushes that you can have then
I have a lot of custom brushes as well
but these ones are soft brushes with the
hardness set to zero so the size right
now is 261 pixels so if I were to select
this and you just left-click around
you'll see how that works what the
harder it is the more it's going to look
like that very simple all right and we
have the type tool this is where if you
ever need text this is where you type
I'm in my pink font and you select back
on it change it to black you have all
your different fonts that you ever had
it installed so you can visit a site
like da font comm and find a ton of
different fonts to use I over here you
have your aliasing options so if we
select none make this bigger ctrl T old
shift to bring it up select move tool
hit apply you can see how it looks
pixelated when you have anti-aliasing a
a set to none if you want to sharp this
is generally what you would use if you
were trying to emulate what it looks
like on a webpage and then smooth just
makes it really smooth i and then you
have your font options like you know
bold bold italic blah blah blah and then
you have your size over here which you
can always adjust by just taking the
move tool with the layer selected ctrl T
and scaling it that way you can also
rotate things very simply if you just
dress if you take your mouse outside a
little bit further and it'll turn this
way you can hold shift to make it stay
on a very specific type of degree so you
want a 45 there you're at you can see
that little 45 marker just like that all
right
don't apply all right so of course when
it comes to type layers you can apply
effects to those as well so drop shadow
please don't do this though in most
cases I see a lot of new designers I
drop it because there's it just looks so
cool but the thing is when it comes to
design and especially web design the
whole drop shadow thing has been used to
death way back in the late 90s even so
that's something you will kind of want
to stay away from it but you it still
does have its place drop shadow if it's
used correctly but you really you want
to try to stay away from it as much as
possible like let me show you a suitable
use for the drop shadow effect real
quick gonna create a new layer just make
this like a darker desaturated sort of
blue all right and let's say I come over
here let's make the color of this text
kind of color it right around there all
right if I double-click the right side
of the layer and I hit drop shadow we
can see can't really see it looks like
crap etc I'm going to change the blend
mode to normal at the very top you can
see it was cut off in screen opacity to
100% the angle to 90 up and down and the
size to zero and the distance to one and
then change the color if I get this
color right here and then almost like a
white but a very light blue and then
maybe hit inner shadow make that normal
100% opacity and change the size to zero
distance to one and this time we'll get
that blue color again make it a little
bit darker
control-t really make this big so we can
kind of see what's going on see that's
that's an instance where you can use the
drop shadow in one of the instances and
it looks pretty good and not cheesy all
right I see yeah what else can I cover
here I mean there's so much but in terms
of web design at least when it comes to
these other tools I pretty much showed
you most of the tools that you would use
oh except the pen tool so the pen tool
is something almost every new designer
fears I move this to the top so the pen
tool you have two different modes you
have path and shape so if you want to
have a shape that's created from a pen I
you would leave it on shape path is a
little bit different I so if I just
start make a white color
left-click and we can see we can create
interesting shapes like this very simple
all right so I'm going to back up we can
also left-click and drag to create
shapes more smooth shapes and we can
also edit them afterwards
so by default these do create shape
layers except you're just not use them
one of the presets here so if you take
this over here and take the direct
selection tool you can take and click
individually each one of these and make
adjustments you can also take these and
it can also affect how it appears very
simple stuff and of course anything you
create you have all these layer style
options another thing I wanted to talk
about is layer blend modes okay so each
layer if you select it by default it's
set and normal but if you take this
drop-down you look at it we save all
these other options and this affects how
it interacts with the other layers
beneath it so let's say for example let
me delete this ugly shape here and let's
get our high guys thing over here so
cheesy I and we'll get a
Circle and let's also make it I like a
light blue hit okay alright so by normal
we could just see we can't see anything
behind it now if we take this we hit
dissolve nothing really happens darken
it slightly changes this what we can do
now just to experiment work quick is use
your down arrow on your keyboard and you
can see all these different ways that
this layer begins to interact with the
layers behind it so very interesting
things that you can be done just through
that alright so yeah I I'm trying to go
through all these yeah we also have the
gradient tool you can't apply a gradient
to a shape layer it has to be rasterized
so if we want to rasterize i'm going to
delete this one so if you want you can
also camp apply it to a type layer
unless you use the layer effects and
specify gradient over here alright
but type layers as well as shape layers
can also can be rasterized so if you go
to you right-click it and you hit
rasterize type now it is rasterized
although the effects are still here and
you can toggle this on off or you can
right-click it and rasterize layer style
and that will bake basically the effects
or the layer styles that are in it into
the actual raster so i now i could for
example do that although it stays
entirely on this actual layer so now
this layer consists of this gradient so
you can't really edit it too much you
don't really want to use it like that i
like say for example you wanted to
create a gradient that only stays or is
only visible within this type right here
so what you would do is create a new
layer
control-shift-n use previous layer to
create a clipping mask alright hit OK
and now you can see it's pointing down
to the layer beneath it so now we could
see it only stays inside of the type
we can also do cool things like play
around with the layer styles so I'm
using my down arrow key and we can see
it does all sorts of cool interesting
things and you can have multiple layer
clipping mask layers so if you control
shift and again check this off hit OK
and it doesn't even have to be a
gradient you can put any type of design
in here as you would any other layer so
I elipse see very cool and simple stuff
I so we talked about filters a little
bit now when you do filters and you add
them through this menu it becomes a
permanent fixture or part of that raster
layer I you can do what's called an
adjustment layer though so let me show
you what that is let's go ahead real
quick we're going to take all these
three layers hold shift and select it
and hit ctrl e that will merge them so
now that's all one raster layer so if we
want to change the hue of this for
example we could do that right here or
go to windows if you don't see that and
go to adjustments and that brings this
up we can change the brightness and
contrast levels so let's just try
brightness and contrast when we change
that and we try to plant changing the
brightness and contrast
we'll see this it selects every single
layer a puff that's right here but if
you only want it to select the layer
beneath it you just select this button
right here so now we can change the
brightness contrast of just that layer
okay and you can add multiple ones of
these so human saturation select down
now we can change the color and the hue
very easily and so what's cool about
this is you can adjust these layer on so
layer and did I say layer later on so if
you double click them it'll bring up the
properties and they're dynamic so that's
really cool so they're non-destructive
as it's called alright so yeah that's
just
a ton of stuff I went through a crash
course I think there's a couple other
things yeah when it comes to the
gradient tool you up here you have
presets and the first one is always your
current foreground and background color
I also have foreground to transparent so
if you click on this and I we use it it
goes from this color to transparent and
we think if there's anything else that's
major that I'm missing I mean this is
such an elaborate program that I it
would probably be kind of easy for me to
miss something we also have a whole
other world of 3d I'm just putting some
text there and the reason we don't see
it is because it's a layer I clipping
mask so we just drag it up to the top
right click and where's it at or
actually you just drag it down real
quick that kind of solves that issue you
can drag it back up it's no longer a
clipping mask I take this 3d and you
could do I new 3d extrusion from
selected layer so this is a type layer
we're adding this to and it may take a
little bit of time I but we can see now
it has made it to 3d now there are full
tutorials all plenty of them either
available that cover just the 3d aspect
of Photoshop I there's a lot that you
can really get into if you experiment
with these things
I when it comes to 3d so you have your
own 3d tab you have all this stuff it's
like what the hell is going on but
really it just takes practice and
experiment with I experimenting with a
lot of these I you have just so many
options I don't even really want to
cover it at this point just because I'm
trying to keep this simple but yes you
can do 3d in Photoshop I think I do have
a few a couple tutorials on my channel
and he's on course comm but yeah you can
check that out but I'm not going to
really go over 3d too much i but yeah I
think I've covered just about as much as
I want to
you know you have the image section up
here you can do things like adjust the
canvas size which is the size of this
that we made 500 by 500 so if you wanted
to make it smaller or bigger you could
do that or if you wanted to take every
image or all the layers in here and
scale them proportionally you would do
image image size and change that so if
you did if you wanted to go to like 900
that happens you can see it's a little
bit pixelated because he's a raster
layer so it's something to always keep
in mind you don't want pixelated layers
let's see what else is there anything
else that is pretty major that I'm
forgetting I don't think there is really
I mean most of the tools that I've
showed you as I'm looking through you
have interesting ones like clone stamp
if you select this and you can also
change the size over here and select say
for example this hit alt and left click
we can clone things very interesting I
try to think of anything else yeah I
think that is probably we're at 30
minutes already so that is just a very
quick crash course and how to use you
know the basic functionality of
Photoshop cc alright so yeah I'm doing a
ton of tutorials I've done one for every
day of the year of 2014 so far I think
it's like a hundred and thirty nine or
something at this point but yeah
subscribe to the YouTube channel to get
notifications for that and also check
out design course comm in the forums
introduce yourself and I will attempt to
say hi
