calm today we're going to quickly wrap
up our four-part photo manipulation
video tutorial and if you need access to
any project files they're available for
free in the description below this video
check out these on course com if you
haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube alright let's get started
alright welcome back so we're going to
finish up this photo manipulation today
and we're going to add some we're going
to start by adding some odd text so all
right the way we'll do this is take your
type tool and I'm using a font called
trash in Orchard John I don't mean know
how to pronounce it whatever i'm going
to go to the very top layer I'm going to
left-click and drag out right around
here its center and we're going to type
in caps lock if war is hell alright so
we'll make this white just so we could
see it going to make the size quite
large I think 70 no that's not enough
i'm going to try 90 right there and then
we're going to make some more
adjustments so double click on the right
side to bring up the layer styles for
this type layer and we're going to add a
gradient overlay take and click on there
for the grading editor and that's a
header editor and double click on that
first color picker and we'll choose a
yeah right around there 6-4 6-4 6-4 and
then the second 1i i'm just going to hit
okay we'll leave it up white and then
we'll do in inner shadow so take the
blend mode make it normal make it white
for the color i lo moving fast but
you're going to have the deal with a man
so size is zero distance is one alright
so we could see how we want to adjust
this maybe I yeah right around there
that angle is good all right and if you
want to you can add a stroke let me see
if i want to or not yeah we'll leave it
at one pixel or two pixels just drop
down the opacity a little bit and head
okay all right and then I'm going to
duplicate that layer so ctrl shift D
move this down hit ctrl T well actually
we can adjust that differently I know I
don't want to get I just screwed that up
what we'll do is just take this throw
down the flag all caps lock control a
and then we'll take the size try 30 I
think I might want to do 50 oops now 40
m and then also I can take the character
or go to window character and increase
the width there mine was already have
200 so that's something you would
probably have to do yourself I'll try
creasing it by 400 alright and then i
duplicate that control shift D and then
take this down try 25 and adjust it in
this a and embrace your fellow man okay
take that letter spacing on trust 600
alright so I'm going to take these I
with auto select layer in a move tool
and just I move them around a little bit
holding shift and left clicking and
dragging all right now what do i do is
take this a 4 is hell layer hit ctrl
shift n make it a clipping mask right
here hit OK and then over here we're
going to double click on layer beneath
that the actual type layer and deselect
blend clip layers as a group and then
select blood interior effects as group
and i'll tell you why did that one
second let's take our red color we're
going to get a brush out here
for blood I'll try this one and yeah
we're going to take that size down quite
a bit select on our layer 16 make that
size a little bit larger and then take
the blend mode and go down with your
down arrow key I think multiplier will
work well for that I so yeah the reason
you do that is if the default option is
this and when it's this you if you try
to apply a layer mask I to a object that
has like a gradient overlay it won't
show it so that's the fix that took me a
while to figure out all right so I yeah
this looks pretty good so far I still
some adjustments i want to make these
guys over here there's not enough
contrast so let me find that adjustment
layer you can add multiple adjustment
layers here if i can even add another
one
Yeah right around there looks good all
right and let me see here now I just
want to zoom up and see if there's any
other adjustments i want to make and I
want to take these two type layers real
quick the ones beneath the main title
and make those regular so they're not as
thick all right I think that's pretty
good so you know the idea of course is
too and I've reiterated this at the
beginning the first video basically to
try to get people to realize the nature
of countries in governments and i'm
going to be sharing this on social media
my priority did because I finish this
all in one day so you know the first
part of this video tutorial just got
done probably like an hour or two ago
but I yeah I will share the results with
putting this out there on social media
and seeing how many views it gets like
on facebook and such on the various
groups that would find this image
interesting it is a little bit
controversial but I yeah controversy
sells so anyhow yeah that is it for
today and if you enjoy this tutorial
