salmon net and design course comm and
today we're going to design this iOS app
icon I so our work primarily will begin
in Adobe Illustrator cs6 and we're going
to start by going to file new change
units pixels change width and height to
512 we'll hit OK and also to note I'm
going to be talking quick because I want
to get this done within around 15
minutes or 15 to 20 minutes so I'll be
talking fast but you can always just
pause stop rewind and follow along so I
one of the things we're going to start
with here is the rounded rectangle tool
and one thing we need to do is go to
view snap to grid view show grid I and
then what we can do is at the very upper
left hand corner double click and we'll
get this rounded rectangle dialog box
and we can set the exact dimensions of
this ragged rectangle and make sure
corner radius is 80 we'll hit OK and
then what we can do is remove the stroke
to zero and we're going to give the
foreground color a gradient radial now
hit G key and right around here we'll
double click and I'll give us like a
spotlight effect basically now I don't
want it to be that bright so we'll
double click here and change it to right
around that lightness okay and now what
we'll do is create a an ellipse and
right around here in the center we'll
hold shift and alt and drag out right
around there hold the G key and we'll
redo the gradient holding shift alright
and then we'll give it a stroke of 6
we'll click stroke and align the stroke
inside will click over here to select a
stroke and give it a linear gradient and
we will change the radius to 120 now
we'll just adjust the colors here to
give it the effect of Chrome and yours
doesn't have to match what I'm doing so
you can experiment with whatever you
want all right and maybe one more over
here
make that a little bit darker
all right and we're going to duplicate
this so control C control f holding
shift and alt down we will drag in just
a little bit and change the stroke this
time to something larger
we'll try 12 and we'll adjust the
gradient just a little bit more
and again you don't have to be perfect
alright now what we're going to do is
take this inner one control C control F
shift and alt drag in change the stroke
to to hit enter we'll remove the
foreground color and we'll also adjust
the gradient here just the two color
Pickers and something a little bit
darker to just barely noticeable okay
and I'll cut you to control C control F
again to duplicate and drag in to right
around there and this is just barely
visible all right ah now what we're
going to do is take this I enter one
again ctrl c ctrl F well large it and
we'll remove the stroke and give the
foreground color at radial gradient and
the G key selected so we'll take this
one right here and make it white double
click this one we'll leave it there and
we'll change it to zero opacity oops and
it'll change the transfer the opacity
right here to around 70 okay now what we
can do is select this the first ellipse
we created and duplicate that drag it in
use the up and right arrows just to get
it selectable
and position it right around there and
change the stroke to will try three and
then we're going to change the gradient
to a red so select RGB double click this
one make it slightly darker
all right and let's go ahead and create
some reflections with the pen tool first
let's select the glare that we created
or the glow and then we'll select the
pen tool and create some reflections and
if you don't know how to use the pen
tool there are plenty of tutorials that
will show you exactly how to use it and
you don't know the pen tool you
definitely need to know it I'll change
the opacity here to yeah 30 percent is
kind of good we'll duplicate that and
just resize it slightly and we'll keep
it right around there and then we're
going to create a real quick sparkle if
you will now I'm going in ctrl Z to undo
now because I'm going quick I'm not
going to make this perfect obviously it
isn't but just for the sake of moving
along will I accept imperfections I okay
and then we're going to take this right
here the inner glow duplicate that scale
it in put it right around here maybe
make it a little bit brighter okay I
what's one last thing we'll take one of
these reflections duplicate it scale it
down a lot and drag it over here and
make it stand out a little bit more
that's fine
now we'll leave the blind mode normal
let's go to gradient and yeah that's why
we want to change this one from black to
white and then adjust the right back
time around 40 okay all right so now
what we can do is I will save this and
we're going to export it also as a PSD
I'm just going to overwrite this one I
created earlier and will be exported as
a PSD we'll import it into Photoshop
I'll just name my app icon too and make
sure right layers is selected and screen
is at 72 we'll hit OK and then in
Photoshop I will go to file open and
open that file we just created and I'm
going to adjust the canvas size here too
let's see here of 850 by 600 I'm going
to select the paint bucket tool first
expand this layer group create a new
layer ctrl shift n enter and put at the
very bottom and color it white and then
create or take the elliptical marquee
tool and right around the center we'll
hold shift and alt and drag out and
we'll create a new layer control-shift-n
enter and we'll drag it up top here and
we'll color it a bright blue and then we
will hold the Alt key and hit the Delete
key then what we can do is go to filter
blur Gaussian blur
right around there and hit okay and then
we can experiment with the blend mode so
select up here twice and then you can
hit your down arrow key to start
experimenting with different colors so
I'm going through each one to see if
there's one that I like and I did see
one initially which would be this one
right around here and I'm going to
select the brush tool and make a pretty
big brush
control-shift-n for a new layer and
select once and then yeah I think I like
the linear burn on that one and then I
am going to take this free leather
texture which is linked in the
description of this video and I'm going
to right click it copy image and then
selecting this down here the very first
layer we created in Illustrator
control-shift-n and make it a clipping
mask and then ctrl V to paste ctrl T to
resize and then hold shift and alt down
to scale it down proportionally select
move tool hit OK apply and then we'll
change the blend mode of this as well
and I'm just going to experiment to find
one that I kind of like this one isn't
too bad neither is overlay again a lot
of this is all just about experimenting
with the different blend modes I think I
might use that one which would be
divided and with the opacity at 35% all
right so I one more thing I'm going to
hit ctrl shift n hit okay take our brush
tool change the size down a little bit
make the foreground color white and make
it a little bit larger
and maybe one more smaller one down
there actually a little bit smaller than
that and create a new layer
maybe a big moron and as you can see you
know you can add a lot of different
touches and which will ultimately really
affect I how this looks very quickly and
easily and basically this layer group
contains our icon so then you can take
it you can flatten it if you want
control II I'm and then you can copy it
and you can actually create your your
your icons there so that is the tutorial
I hope you enjoyed it it's pretty simple
as you can see it's very easy to create
a pretty good-looking app icon obviously
you'd want to spend more time than I did
because you can do so much more with
this but that is it so the security
