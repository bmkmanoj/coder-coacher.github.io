letter and design course calm and today
we're going to take a look at layer
masks and what they are so let's just go
to file new with 800 I'm going to choose
height 500 resolution 72 pixels per inch
hit OK zoom up to a hundred percent real
quick up here and all right so I'm going
to create just a real basic cool looking
type of image here real quickly I and
we're going to use it I with layer mass
or create it with layer mask so with
this tool selected gray here which is
the custom shape tool just left click
and drag out to get it we're going to
choose up here a heart these are
predefined shapes all right I'm just
going to choose red for the foreground
color hit OK and then hold shift and
drag out to a heart around that size
then with the move tool just move it
over here to the left just a little bit
okay so the idea had is instead of just
being this heart being a solid color say
for example if I wanted to put an image
inside of here well we would do that
with a layer mask so first we need an
image and the image right here I just
went to google images into type thai
paradise HDR and the second image and
this may be it may be different results
for you based on whenever you did this
is this image right here really you can
use any image you want if i right click
click copy image and i'm using google
chrome by the way for the browser i
could come in here and create a new
layer and then right here is where we we
create a clipping mask
it is checkbox hit okay neg see this
layer has a little arrow that's pointing
down towards the base layer which is the
heart I now I can go ahead and hit
control V to paste that image now
because the image really big I'm going
to hit ctrl T 2 and then he'll chipped
to scale it down so I'm just going to
bring it over here scale it down a
little bit more maybe even more all
right select the move tool and hit apply
okay so really this looks I pretty cool
in and of itself if we look over here in
the layer we actually see the full image
I but because it is using this base
layer as a mask we only see this heart
shape and that is the base of basis of
what a layer mask is um let's go ahead
and add another layer here on top of
this mask because we can add an infinite
number of layers here so if we go to a
new layer check that again hit okay we
can see we have another one on top of it
so if we use the type tool and type say
for example love first we're going to
choose a white color for foreground just
click in there and type lov we don't
want we don't want to eat yet now i'm
using Arial black now i want to use I
the move tool hit ctrl t hold shift and
we're going to scale this thing up a lot
right around there select move tool hit
apply all right now let's create let's
right click duplicate layer hit OK and
now we want to just put an e over here
now if I drag this down
there we go it's no longer a part of a
mask here so if I also move it over here
change the colors choose the type tool
change the color to say this blue and
then just put e oops well there we go um
we kind of like just a cool design say
for example we wanted to continue this
image right here well we can make it a
mask as well so let's create a new layer
select this button here create another
layer mask here and then hit control V
again and then ctrl T to scale it down
because it's a really big still that's
that one right there so alright select
the move tool and there we go I looks
pretty cool if you ask me I and that's
just I the very premise of how you can
add layers masks now we don't always
have to just be it's not limited to
photographs or text we can just add
anything we want and play around so
let's create a new layer hit ok ok so
it's just I above this I paradise image
just below the LOV now I let's add a
gradient for example so let's make sure
up here this second one foreground to
transparent is selected and let's change
the background color let's choose this
blue sky right here and then make it a
little bit darker hit OK and then take
our gradient and there we go as you can
see it still stays within
anything we do obviously will stay
within the shape as long as it is a mask
and we can do any number of things
obviously I could change the blend mode
of the layer experiment and see how that
I'm just using my Derek down arrow by
the way how it affects it and there we
go we created a pretty cool-looking
design very simply very quickly with the
use of layer masks there's obviously an
infinite number of possibilities that
you can use layer masks for and really
it's just knowing when to use them it's
just a matter of practice and experience
all right check out design course calm
if you haven't and I will talk to you
later all right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
