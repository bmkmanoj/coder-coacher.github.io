Ken this is kind of sort of for another
test for the streaming but I do have a
project of mine
great we have an issue
one second got to fix this what's up
everyone I'll get started soon there we
go oh great it's not showing your your
usernames what's up everyone I'm gonna
switch over here
yeah what's up yep I unfortunately the
I'm looking at my other stream info over
here I have this monitor right here this
is my Cintiq it's on the big s an
extension arm that I can move around I
want to be able to see your comments as
I'm designing so that I can respond to
them I think what I'll do is one second
yeah drinking alone yeah like always
 me and I just lost a comment let's
yeah I'm gonna have to get up the old
school way over here one second yeah
okay I see your comments now I want to
make sure I get all these well yeah you
know I wasn't I wasn't sure if I should
call it an infographic but basically the
point that I want to make damn just
can't see me here the point that I want
to make is just trying to visualize the
concept of what is called rxjs subjects
if you've been following along with the
the recent stuff that I've been doing
the tutorial stuff then you know it's
kind of a difficult concept to grasp
between the four different subject types
and how they emit data so I thought it
would be a cool idea you know if nothing
else just for the channel to try to try
to create or something that looks well
it's a good solid design fundamentals
but also most importantly illustrates
helps people easily understand what the
distinction is between these four
different types of what are called
really there are four different types of
observable slash observers so let's go
ahead and get started so you know the
way I thought about doing this is I'm
going to let's see here yeah we don't
want to switch to that we want to switch
to my desktop so we'll do cut right here
all right and so
um hopefully you're seeing what I'm
seeing cool all right awesome
all right so rxjs not that if we go to
the main manual and go to overview and
we go to subject right here this is kind
of what let me increase the size big
time because I am working on the 4k
resolution this time so make sure that's
big alright and so this is kind of
important to go over so subject it's
gonna sound complex especially if you're
not a JavaScript person or a reactive X
person as you can see over subject
there's four different types of subjects
subjects what we have just a regular
subject we have a behavior subject
replay and then async I want to try to
visualize that and here's the thing I
did not at all pre design this so this
is gonna be off the cuff and I I hope I
don't you know just bomb it you know I'm
gonna make my mission I don't care how
late I have to stay up it's what its
10:52 p.m. right now Eastern Time I'm
gonna make sure that you know it's
something that's decent that I oh I'm
sorry I just switched back to that
stupid thing let me do this correctly
real quick and we'll start let's see
here there we go okay so now if I switch
back there we go cool all right okay so
what I'm gonna do is we're gonna get
started here in Photoshop and now you
may be wondering why use Photoshop for
something like this why not use Adobe
Illustrator but that is because I really
want the total freedom if the case
arises where I want to integrate some
type of raster based imagery which I
couldn't do with an illustrator
otherwise alright so I need to make sure
that
I'm looking remembering to look at your
chats okay all right so I'm just gonna
get some type of neutral background here
to start I don't know what color I want
to start with and let me know if I want
to go lights or dark or whatever I'm
just gonna start light and like a d
saturated something like that okay
whatever I may change and completely to
something entirely different now when it
comes to this subject of observables and
rxjs switching back here and they have
what are called marble diagrams where is
that at it's somewhere around here and I
think I'm going to use that same concept
except I'm going to expand on it a
little bit more so if I could rxjs
marble dire diagrams
we'll see if we go to Google Images
hopefully something here yeah these are
marble diagrams it helps people try to
understand what's going on so I'm gonna
use this basic concept and hopefully I
can get something get something that
will work well alright so yes this will
be on the channel later by the way
okay so I'm just gonna we're gonna work
in the horizontal fashion just to get
started and by the way this is a 4k
resolution so it's quite large I know
I'm not gonna go larger than that so
again that that's one reason I have to
worry about you know doing anything
that's vector or whatever so let's go
ahead and take this alright I'm just
gonna start off with line using a
rectangle tool alright and again this
may vastly change and it usually does
like if you know because when I do
tutorials and I release them on the
channel they're obviously if you want it
to be a decent quality you have to do
the project beforehand and I almost
always have a written version I'm
following along so there's no screw-ups
this is gonna be very different this is
gonna be me messing stuff up changing
stuff left and right it'll probably
tedious however it is indicative of the
actual process not going through this so
okay so there's actually 46 people
watching now no it's not too bad so late
and so one of the first things I want to
do is get out the ellipse tool all right
okay for some reason I have it in my
mind that is want to take the same
background color and just give this a
stroke so I double-click on the right
side of the layer and of course it's
showing up on the other side on the
other monitor that I can't even see I
have three monitors let's see here there
we go and we'll give it a stroke alright
so we'll do use stroke
now we'll do outside blend mode normal
and the color will be the color of our
line there we go
you know again this may completely
change 17 all right here's the pop-out
chat that's good okay
alright I'm just looking at the chats
right here
alright cool so where I'm thinking of
having yeah just for primary dots that
somehow illustrate the concept of each
like what a subject is what a replay
subject is how an async subject differs
from a replay etc so I'm just gonna get
out type without thinking of too much
stuff right now so I'm just gonna type
in subject do I want to be just regular
title case or upper case well screw it
I'll just go with upper case here you
know I really like this font it's called
monster written or montserrat or
whatever but I hate the J oh well let me
make sure by the way that you guys are
looking at the same thing I'm looking at
alright good
looks like it alright cool get this back
up there we go okay so again this looks
like crap right now by really have plans
to make this look really nice so don't
worry don't worry too much all right so
so we have subject let me just get out
the four types here real quickly
alright so subject behavior subject
replay subject and async subject okay
all right so I'll get out a text area
here and I'll just put in some lorem
ipsum stuff for now we'll keep with the
we'll put that there for now we changed
the type here so when it comes to you
know a headline and sub headline or
description like this you know you have
all those several different ways to
create what's called us a visual
hierarchy between the two the obviously
the most important subject here in
design is is the subject itself is this
title then secondary to that description
so we already have it at a smaller font
size we can also create more separation
through changing the font weight like
regular all right there we go zoom up a
little bit all right obviously the the
letter line spacing is completely off
let's just put that to auto for now all
right so this is just going to be a
description in in short you know like
maybe one sentence about what the
subject is in and of itself so alright
by the way is anyone still there I just
want to make sure my crap still working
here
all right good thank you all right
so for subject let's just let's get this
up here I mean I know what a subject is
but I want to make sure I use something
that's very specific and consistent with
the official definition so what is a
subject it's a special type of
observable that allows values to be
multi casted to multiple to many
observers okay so we can multi cast to
many observers range so every subject is
an observable and every subject is an
observer yes yes yes
I'm just looking through here trying to
formulate my ideas still
all right you know actually a really
good source for this of course would be
my site where I wrote about subjects
what's up technical white hacker all
right
nice yeah I think it's going to catch on
a lot more still early days for rxjs a
lot of people simply you know they they
think it's an angular only thing which
obviously is not true one second guys
I'll get back to it I just want to
really make sure I'm creating the right
distinction between these four
yeah that's right okay so when it comes
to just a plain subject these the second
observer doesn't receive the first thing
that has been sent but only the values
emitted after it was created all right
the second thing okay all right and then
the behavior subject
now I personally haven't worked with
these four different types of subjects
myself so I'm giving myself a refresher
on exactly what the difference is
between the four in terms of how the
values are emitted or the data is or the
events as it's technically referred to
us alright so so when it comes to
observer two right so observer two will
emit the last value whereas up here I'm
regular and that's for yeah four that's
for a behavior subject and there's a
regular subject is the first thing yeah
okay so when one subscribes to a regular
subject it only receives right here
okay right so it'll receive anything
after it subscribes and then the
behavior subject will receive the last
value the previous value that has I was
sent great wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait I want to make sure I'm not
screwing that up yeah yeah yeah so
behavior subject will send the observer
- I'm actually designing for a code type
of eye issue I'm just trying to create a
visual representation of these four
different types of subjects through some
type of like I don't know if you want to
call it an infographic eye it's probably
not really an infographic there's not
enough data really but just something
that represents the differences between
these four different things so we'll get
to the design so I want I need to make
sure I have this I should've did that
before I started recording with so yeah
looking at this
number two is about to subscribe yeah it
gets that all right and then replay
subject is the third one and this allows
you to specify the number of previously
emitted values before it subscribes so I
know that one and then finally the async
subject simply displays the very last
emitted value all right now it's all
fresh in my mind again and I think we
can begin to work on creating this
representation so right now this is um
this is pretty this looks like crap but
but don't worry aliy want to make it
look snazzy you know something you could
put on dribble or Behance or whatever
alright so um let me take a drink real
quick how many programming languages do
you know
I would say I'm definitely less of a
programmer than I am a coder even though
I do consider myself a full-stack dev
guy but I started off with I don't want
to get I don't want to digress too much
but I started off with Visual Basic
actually in the late 90s and I was
making a well progam where I hunt people
offline yeah that's how I got my start
actually kind of silly and then I really
got into PHP heavily and in front-end
stuff and then from there JavaScript and
etc alright so subject let's kick let's
get to this
so I here I'm going to have the
description I'm thinking initially this
may change then down here I'm going to
try to represent it in terms of the data
that's being emitted and and how these
four change over time so alright so
let's do this subject I'm just gonna say
receives and again this I may change
this let me zoom up here receives I
don't want it's not the last emitted
value so we're talking about once a new
ABE observer which could be a subject as
well but once a new observer is
subscribed to a regular subject it will
only receive any of the VAT or events or
the data that's emitted after it
subscribes receives events after
subscribing maybe any and if there's a
better way of demonstrating this
anybody's watching just let me know so
okay and then I have to think about a
way of how to how to represent this down
here this concept alright so for now let
me just take this I'm going to duplicate
it and I'll pry out the space ease out
differently to make sure all for fit
behavior subject
you know what that's too long what we'll
do is behavior and then we'll put
subject underneath it and a second line
and I know that looks like garbage one
second all right right there this one
probably move up here there we go so we
have behavior subject and this is going
to receive receives the previous emitted
event I guess we'll just say something
like that
we'll go to the next one which is replay
subject and this will be what yeah what
is TDD it sounds familiar but I'm a
newbie I guess replay it receives the
previous emitted events based on what
you spaced on how many you specify but
I'm not good as they say that word for
word test-driven development yeah so
replay or receives the previous immunity
event and this would receive I don't
know do I want to put receives X
previous events alright I want to change
this receives the last emitted event
I'll put that this one will be receives
the do I want to put X because that
might be confusing receives X previous
events that's when I'm do I have to put
it emitted that's a little bit wordy you
know I don't have to do that
well I'll leave it like that for now I
don't want to sit here screwing around
too much let's duplicate that and then
finally we have a sink subject all right
so we're getting your type it's it's not
it's not like an absolutely terrible but
it's gonna it's gonna be much more
shortly so let's go ahead and I'm gonna
yeah that's locked already I'm take
these four and just move them more
towards the center there we go and then
a sink simply receives see I don't want
this getting confused with behavior
subject
all right so receives the last event I
will admit I am more of a designer so
acing subject we receives X previous
events
so behavior subject really receives the
last event plus future events
thank Sharma
I don't want this to get too wordy -
that too wordy so I I know I'm gonna
change this I'm just gonna put this for
now I'll just put this in quotes that's
so stupid
I'm just gonna put it in anyway just for
now I want I want to continue on these X
previous I'll just put that alright okay
so I now I want to I want to do the
thing that will down here that will
represent what this column means they go
subject and then behavior subject how
can we represent this in a visual manner
all right so that's going to be the
challenge I don't know how I'm going to
do that yet so we'll see I'm gonna move
this out of the way I want to make sure
where's my where's my stuff at get out
of there
there we go make sure everything's still
working here yep there I am cool all
right
you know this Cintiq is pretty awesome I
hardly ever use it though it's like a
drawing tablet three or four people
still watching cool all right I think I
know never to do one this late again
well I kind of expected it when I did
one yesterday I had 140 people watching
but it's a Saturday and I uh whenever
people are very sleeping at this point
um all right so all right so it receives
events after subscribing all right so
how do I want to you know this right
here this little circle could
potentially represent the point at which
there's an observer that has subscribed
so maybe I can do this I just came up
with an idea all right so I'll take this
down just a notch and what we'll do is
I'm going to copy this lips I'm gonna
fill it in for now we'll just say the
same color whatever it may change and
let's replicate this you have something
like that now maybe one more time all
right so these all these all represent
you know the different events or the
data that's being emitted from a subject
and this is the observer that's
receiving them so this is the point at
which this this filled in or this not
filled in the stroke circle that's the
point at which they have subscribed this
is the data that's what they see they
don't receive anything before it because
that's how a regular subject works okay
so now I'll take those and I'll
replicate all four of them
move them over here haha yeah I gotta
watch myself with the beer and I uh I
used to drink a ton especially when my
my first business started to fail oh god
that was so stressful
I was horrible alright so elaborate that
I'm but let me describe what's happening
here so the idea here is a behavior
subject this is represented by these
dots right here so it receives just the
last event and this is how this is
represented I think that's a pretty
solid idea yeah so but here's the thing
I'm gonna need to restructure things
just a bit to fit these all on and I'm
probably not to scale them down just a
bit alright so let me do that real quick
something like that
all right so auto-select layer take
these four get those centered up alright
so take these
there we go all right and then I'm going
to take these duplicate the layers all
right and so replay subject receives the
X previous events and future events so
what that means is we can take this
duplicate it I really wanted to do three
here though and this isn't even equal
there we go and by the way I'll take
these three down here we have more space
below
so I'll duplicate those oh are you
serious
take these take these and here we go all
right click duplicate there we go and I
may even do it one more time so
duplicate layer all right cool I'll
party maybe I will fade these off I'm
not sure we'll see because this looks
stupid wouldn't it growing so close
there's not a lot of white space down
here and you don't want that especially
when you have a lot of weight space up
here that will throw off the design what
I'll do also to make more space
take these move them up because I really
want to get three
okay all right good we're kind of
getting there here we go
a sink subject receives only the very
last emitted event so how would I even
and I pray we'll have a key of sorts
like this right here the the stroked
simply represents the point at which in
the they've subscribed and the filled on
are the actual events I'm thinking out
loud so
maybe I'll just do this and take this
let me know if I'm not making if I could
demonstrate this in a better manner by
the way
we have these all over how they need to
be what's up how would you pronounce
your name Kevin Kevin I don't know all
right so let's see here by the way I'm
gonna be drastically changing this up I
want to make it a little bit more
interesting looking I'm gonna I'm gonna
delete these oops don't want to do that
yeah they maybe meet that maybe that is
a good point
so make a video on making a degree in
graphic design or visual effects all
right well what do you mean making a
degree or get you mean getting a degree
are you inside like a college of sorts
or maybe I yeah maybe I can get rid of
you know what I'll do that's a good
point so I don't think I'm going to
remove it I think we still needed to
have to have it there instead we can
give it less importance by changing the
size so I'll just try that 36 or
something yeah maybe a little bit bigger
than that
I think that might be a little bit
better so yeah - why are you currently
in college I'm sorry I probably asked
you a couple questions there I'm just
going to redo this
this is replay
yeah this is probably not what you would
call an infographic
all right so yeah I think this would
probably work well right here why I have
a I have counterculture views when it
comes to college I personally did not go
and that's a lot a lot of that has to do
with I the fact that like I was kind of
a self teacher even when I was probably
in seventh grade six or seventh grade I
really started hardcore and like just
trying to learn I played a lot of games
of course and but I also I was getting
into coding and stuff as well and I even
had job offer so I was like yeah I'm not
going to go to college now if you're not
a self teacher then even still I'm not
sure if I would recommend going to
college and painting a ton of money gets
a lot of times the content is out of
date let me minimize this over here I'm
a little bit reluctant on switching I
want to make sure that my streaming
software I'm new to this it's working
correctly one second
yeah there we go sorry this is so
unprofessional of me moving this dumbass
monitor around alright there we go
that's that's kind of better alright and
so really if you can teach yourself and
you can also and you can also there you
build a portfolio through real work and
when I say real work I mean these days
most employers they've wised up before
they really wanted you to have a degree
now fortunately they did wise up they
understand it's all about the work it's
about your experience and if you could
do it that way and you can you you can
there's a lot of ways to get work too I
mean it doesn't necessarily have to be
paid when you're first starting out and
I don't even think they would care if
you're an employer and you're in their
position you only want a person who's
gonna be able to complete the job having
a degree does not mean that now I'm not
sure where you're from I know in some
cultures you know the parents are really
gonna push the kids to go into college
and if they're paying for it fine go
ahead but I wouldn't only rely on that
that degree no way I would you know
because depending where you're going a
lot of the the content they give you is
just it's it's garbage so I would
regardless is whether or not you go to a
school and this is for any field with
computers this could be internet
marketing just give me anything make
sure you build up real-world experience
on your own with your own projects
that's my advice okay
oh we're gonna we're gonna keep going
here all right here we go so right right
right
no I understand
yeah okay so I'm not happy with this
obviously um I have the general idea but
now I really want to make it look better
and so what I'll do is yeah buy another
piece of advice yeah another piece of
advice is you know go to the sites like
behance and dribble and you you look you
look on the top trending designs if you
can't produce that or if you're looking
a lot a lot of that stuff and saying wow
I can't produce that copy it and I don't
mean it copied just to use for your own
portfolio copy it so that you can get
muscle memory you will slowly get that
muscle memory to the point at which when
you go to do your own unique original
work on it its subconscious it will help
you in a sense it will help you simply
going through the motions of what it
takes to recreate some of these pieces
that are you know everybody thinks is
are awesome it will help you when you're
going to create your own projects of
course that doesn't mean you're not
gonna have your own style or you're just
kind of blatantly copying somebody but
it that's one thing that does help
people who are new and are self-directed
and self guiding in terms of trying to
learn
all right so what I want to do here is
give this some color so I'm gonna change
the background up a bit and again I'm
not sure if I really don't wanna stick
with these descriptions it kind of
stupid but I'm gonna keep moving on so
I'm gonna get that gradient tool and is
it I want to make sure one second hell
was my mouse oh there we go I have three
monitors sometimes the mouse gets lost
especially when I can't see the second
monitor let me see here all right I was
using an interval right so it's set
interval at oh wait that was the wrong
one all right
I'm not sure if it would make sense to
put it above I wish I could test because
if it knew you know I'll take your word
for it
yeah I addressed that I was a cake Haven
at the beginning probably before you you
I wanted to do this in Photoshop just in
case I wanted to introduce some type of
raster base of effects and this is
already 4k I'm not gonna want to go
higher than that but I have so much
experience in Photoshop that I know I
can you know everything I'm using here
by the way is shape layers which
technically isn't there what do you call
it's technically it's not vector but it
still can be scaled up to any size
imaginable and not lose quality but yeah
sometimes I may want to do something
that has like raster based textures or
something and so that's why I did it I
know no I think I want to put it in the
future
simply because it doesn't save anything
from the past does that make sense
all right all right so going back to
this background I want to do a real
subtle gradient I want to see how this
looks something that's kind of has color
so let me um for a while it was kind of
doing this thing where we have like a
little something like light let me just
do foreground to transparent
you ask the same damn thing create a new
layer
oh yeah Joomla is quite old I never
actually used it or got into it
just because I never really had the
chance or it's never had a need to use
it
you know what's crazy I was at a a wat
indoor water park that's two hours away
with my my um my family my two daughters
and this is two years ago my wife and I
saw a guy who had a Joomla t-shirt on
I'm like hey what's up he's like he's
like yeah I am I when he was like at
that time one of the biggest like
outside like third-party developers for
juma he made like polygons of stuff and
had a very successful company crazy as
that know right now that I feel I kind
of like this this background here it's
it goes to this little girly pink color
to this blue it's a nice transition but
now it's throwing these things off
because these are filled in with a solid
color of blue so these one over that's I
don't like that so we need to we need
this to be transparent however I don't
want to rasterize it I want to try to
keep as much as I can without
rasterizing so what I can do is I
haven't used this at anchor point to and
quite a while actually what I can do is
this I know what I do
it'll be a little bit tedious but it'd
be worth it
I'm going to take this
I'm not sure about the code snippet
thing we'll see I could always try it
yeah I'm just doing this so I can get
rid of the fill for those circles for
the ellipses all right there we go so
now I can take hopefully I can do this
all in one bow and I make this so that
there's no fill there we go so now
there's no fill on these and I just Jack
that up let me take that
this isn't let me select it with the
hell ears of that right there there we
go
all right I'm still not happy with this
I want I want it to pop out a little bit
more so let's let's keep on thinking
here whoa this is obviously intended for
developers so I'll look at the the
official documentation to see if there's
something very small maybe I could
include so we'll see all right so what I
want to do now I think if I wrap all of
this stuff in a group and apply a very
soft shadow it could bring some depth to
this yeah I may not keep it but we'll
see
go ahead try oh I moved this gradient
there we go let's lock that layer when
it comes to shadows I usually stay away
from I always advise new designers don't
touch drop shadows and stuff like that
because they always get it wrong but
they can be used correctly so let's try
it so we put it in a group and then we
do a drop shadow yeah see a lot of new
designers they would just keep that and
think it's good you know don't do that
you want it to be extremely extremely
subtle almost to the point in which you
can't even see if you're going to do it
which I still may not I think the size
is too big is a little bit too blurry
I'll leave this for now and I'll see if
I want to keep it because I'm gonna go
downstairs in a second to get another
this girl yes beards my wife bought and
have my own and usually is taking a step
away we'll help you understand with
fresh eyes to be able to see oh okay
that was stupid why did I do that I'll
leave this here for now
why not already I have to remember
people keep on joining in the middle of
the stream yeah I chose Photoshop just
in case if I wanted to integrate raster
effects that I could plus I knew this is
already 4k resolution plus right now
everything to date right here is these
are either type layers or shape layers
so it could still be increased to any
size imaginable without losing quality
or anything like that this looks boring
to me though I don't want to just end it
here I had higher aspirations than this
let's see we definitely I think I need
to integrate a key so that people know
what these dots actually are I think
most people would understand who we're
developers so but I still kind of want
to still want to do that so what I'll do
is take one of these and one of these
right click and duplicate them make them
smaller oh I can tell you know I guess
go to window
yeah absolutely so straighter because I
know when you want to scale down effects
with or not facts but um paths to have a
stroke on them and it doesn't change the
stroke there's a setting there's a
checkbox under the window transform yeah
that's why I'm going to I'm about to do
a key right now or a legend or whatever
where the hell is that see when you hit
control yeah because if it's not going
to scale down the yeah it's yeah I
wanted to scale down the strokes as well
when I change the size because if I
didn't increase them like this
see how it stays the same I know how to
do an illustrator I completely forget
how the hell and where that option is at
and Photoshop son of a bitch
you would be under properties but
there's no transform to her piano like
there was an illustrator well this is
what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go to
Google
alright Photoshop maintain scale weight
stroke width scale why is it showing me
After Effects I mean I know how I could
do it if I convert it if I rostered it I
don't want to do that though then again
there's a really matter because I know
I'm not going to use this
all right so this is 2014 yeah this is
showing me after effects like is that Oh
what I'll do is right-click duplicate
them group them up one second here there
that that panel showed up off the side
of my screen will still do that yet will
 bastard
all right well here I go the evil
rasterized layers oh okay you have to
rasterize the stroke the effects - I
forgot about that
there we go
well yeah Giovanna oh by the way hobo
thanks a lot
yeah Giovanna that's the reason you do
mock-ups and this is a common question -
the reason you do them is because if you
go straight into HTML and CSS without
having an idea I guarantee you almost
almost a hundred percent of the time the
end result that you come up with is
would be less appealing and less
functional than if you were to spend
time coming up with an actual prototype
of sorts it doesn't have to be it
doesn't have to be a hundred percent you
know detailed pixel perfect but you
should definitely do some type of a
mock-up of sorts so this is subscription
created I'm not gonna leave a damn drop
shadow on this that's sure now you have
to get it outside of this group
yeah the dots the the ones that are
hollow are representing when the
subscription is created on to either the
async replay behavior or subject so
that's like when a news new observer
subscribes the filled in ones represent
data that is being emitted from the
subject
hopefully that understands I we in our
WI n yeah it's what is it
it's 11:47 p.m. I have this really
bright light in front of me and it's
it's a studio light so it's gonna
messing with my head - it was like Jesus
but if you look at there I'm not sure if
you can see the window over there but
it's pitch-black outside if you only
need a mock up then why the amount of
detail well a mock up in and of itself
can either be you know just like a
wireframe
at least that's how I perceive it or
something that's pixel perfect I
personally prefer to go to be as
specific as possible that way it helps
helps you have a solid idea of
especially if you're working with a
developer who's or a code or a guy who
does HTML CSS but he's not an actual UI
designer sometimes he had that arrayed
into it this is going to be a vent slash
data I think that would make sense
alright let's try this an additional
thing by the way I should save this it
would be my luck that Photoshop crashes
Australia I'm so jealous I live in Ohio
and it sucks really went out of here
no yeah these are my folders for my
youtube I guess you could call them
episodes this would just be live think
yeah I moved to LA that place is so
expensive expensive insanely expensive
maybe some type of vertical line here I
make the line thickness damn it's almost
12 let's see
actually let me uh I'm going to delete
that do I like that I don't know
is this necessary yeah it is time for
bed maybe I'll bring to the top I think
people understand that these align
yeah where I live and well I'm in Ohio
Northeastern Ohio we're near what are
called the Great Lakes and then they're
basically the largest lakes in the world
I believe or something like that and so
there's constant we're an hour south of
it there's constant overcast almost it
seems like on especially during nine
months of the year there's a lot of
overcast and so it looks like doomsday
skies all the time and in terms of
temperature because we're northern North
America it's pretty cold with exception
to them what the the summer months so
for a lot of the times it's cold shitty
to be outside and it's it's very gloomy
so we have a high suicide rate here it's
like God sucks but you know we laid down
roots as they say my daughters are eight
and five there we homeschool them and
their life is like dance their dance
studio they're like oh we can't leave
dance I Christ come on all right so uh I
like this so far I'm gonna I mean I'm
going to experiment a lot of times when
you're experimenting with this type of
stuff you don't necessarily keep what
you're doing and especially we're
getting to the point which if you try to
add two more it may take away but I'm
going to experiment anyhow so I'm just
gonna take a selection right here and
again this could be done with a shape
layer so that it's it's raster but I'm
not really that means that's not raster
but I'm not really too concerned I'm
just gonna try something yeah nice
weather to the code
this is gonna look stupid I think where
we can come from the other direction so
I'm just undoing this and I want to try
to get this direction right yeah that's
gonna look real stupid on ya cause it's
like right up against that text let me
move this over slightly right here come
at it from this direction no that's just
plain stupid I'm not doing that
hey I could possibly create some more
separation between these elements these
descriptions and um maybe change taking
the capacity down just a bit like that
I'm still trying to decide if I want to
keep those drop shadows here let me
toggle them back on and off
maybe we'll take the opacity down even
more like that
hmm it does seem plain but it is
effective
it might be yeah we guess if it's the
only thing that's really popping out mom
was wondering if I can if it makes sense
for the the titles to be a different
color that way it can give a little bit
more everything's pretty monochrome here
so I've selected all four
you know what rxjs does have a killer of
an official color scheme and it's this
eye pink purple color wondering if one
second here I'm going to hit okay for
that nut for now if I can drag this on
there hello
yeah it's a Hashim right her it's not
Hashim right see I'll just grab the
color like that here we go
there we go we should probably get the
logo in there too I of course this here
these are all my where's my free courses
there we go
rxjs beginners I have the logo somewhere
actually you know what I'll do I'll just
get it from the internet I'm gonna be
done shortly by the way guys
is this transparent
one second here
that's transparent
there we go all right where would it
make sense to stick this maybe right
there
pretty good how are you I'm tired
it's a it's 11:58 I usually go to sleep
around this time I think of a good place
to put this yeah maybe right there kind
of fits nice and neck section well
you're right about the one thing the the
live viewing audience is low but if I
this really isn't meant to be a tutorial
if it were a tutorial and something I
really wanted you know people to see I
would upload it like a normal video
which is how I normally do it
everything's very scripted in a sense
this I'm just experimenting with a
different format seeing if it's
something I want to continue to do so in
a probably will be
now I don't like how these are kind of
the pasady is low so I'm going to put
those back up and I'm wondering if I
want to take down the opacity of these
little rectangles yes something like
that now it feels like this all this
stuff should be moved over with
exception to this law and let's see yeah
this line oh wait those should be moved
over to
that way we give the logo a little bit
more space and I'll extend this out I'm
gonna submit this to like maybe a reddit
or something or 4rx or whatever maybe
bill don't reach read it
whatever all right
you know what guys I think I'm pretty
happy with this I mean it looks decent
this part is good the the descriptions
it's a little bit too wordy
like they all say receives receives
receives I'm gonna rethink this I'm not
gonna do that now though yeah I don't
really have any specific tutorials that
show you how to go from mock-up to HTML
or CSS especially something that's very
unique like this this wasn't really
intended to be HTML or CSS it would be
really cool if it was interactive though
that would be awesome but that wasn't my
intention going into this this is more
like just to be kind of like a poster or
just you know an informational graphic
yeah I kind of like it
yeah this is probably confusing if
you're not a coder or never touched rxjs
this is just an infographic for um a
specific topic that can be confusing for
people who are dealing with reactive X
programming these are just four
different concepts really when it comes
to observables and so I was just gonna
show you showing you the whole purpose
was to show you how to create a visual
representation of something that's
somewhat of a complex concept alright I
like that yeah I if I can remember I
will post the final result here maybe
even with the PSD file and then YouTube
is going to automatically make this
video available sometime in the future
in a few hours or something um so yeah
alright cool hopefully you guys found
value in that and I am going to head out
now I'm starting to get tired I am
alright I let me check something though
real quickly before I head off still 34
people watching our 16 minutes
alright guys I'm gonna head out now and
I'll see you later alright goodbye now
if I could just figure out I closed the
damn thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
