net and design course comm and today
we're going to design this logo right
here and to those of you who are new to
illustrator or design in general this
will look like it's kind of complex but
it's actually extremely simple to do so
I'll show you how it's done so I'm using
Adobe Illustrator cs6 and I'm going to
go to file new width and height 850 by
600 points and you can use whatever fits
you're springing well going to hit OK
first thing we're going to do is create
a sphere so left click drag out and
select the ellipse tool and for the
stroke we're going to remove that so
let's put 0 and for the foreground color
we'll just select red for now hold shift
and the Alt key together and then left
click and drag out now we're going to
duplicate this layer and hit ctrl C and
ctrl F to duplicate it as you can see we
have two paths here now and we're going
to change the foreground color to this
top one to white so select the
eyedropper tool and click the background
then select a move tool and we will hold
shift to scale down just a little bit
and then we will go to object path
divide objects below now what that does
is the object below I gets divided it's
obviously pretty self-explanatory and
let's select this sphere right here and
delete it and now we're going to take
this and rotate it just up to right
around here actually I'll adjust a
little bit more
all right there's good and then we're
going to take the rectangle tool and
draw straight over it right around there
now we're going to go to object path
divide objects below
then we're going to take the top portion
that we divided and hit delete the
Delete key so now what I want to do is
give this a radial gradient so we'll
select radial hit the G key and adjust
it right on the edge to the center point
we'll take the white color picker and
we'll select RGB up here in the corner
and we'll also go to file document color
mode RGB color and we will change that
color to a red slash oranges color and
then over here we'll double click on
this black one change the RGB and that's
pretty good for now we can adjust it
later actually I'm going to just real
quickly right now by moving this over
left clicking to add a new one and then
just make this one a little bit brighter
of a yellow all right so now we're going
to take this and we're going to
duplicate it by hitting ctrl C and then
ctrl F as you can see we have the new
one here and I'm going to move it over
to around the center point of the
original and then I'm going to scale it
just a little bit by holding shift ok
and then I'm going to select this top
one object path divide objects below so
now we have two different paths here now
we're going to take the one to the left
hit the G key and drag out from the very
upper left hand corner so what that does
is give us this 3d sort of appearance
now I'm going to take the magnifying
glass and zoom up and sometimes when you
divide objects you get a very very faint
sort of eye white area and so what you
can do is take the object beneath which
is right here is a very first
one take this anchor point and just move
up a notch or two with your arrow keys
and that gives or that gives I gets rid
of that annoyance all right so now what
we can do is take both of these paths
and group them so hit ctrl G and it
creates a new group right here now I'm
going to take this right here this group
and duplicate it control C control F
will select the bottom one and if you
don't want these blue lines and these
anchor points here you can just hit ctrl
H to hide those all right so we're
taking the bottom one and I'm going to
hold actually I'm going to use the right
arrow key on my keyboard and just move
over to right around there okay and I'm
going to change the color here of this
and I'll do that by going to edit edit
colors and then I can go to adjust color
balance and this will allow us to
experiment with the hue of this object
so what we can do is go to preview and
we can start playing around with these
red green and blue Pickers you can use
whatever you color you want I think I'll
just go kind of lick with a yellow color
right there and then hit OK and then I'm
going to take that one right there and
duplicate that again ctrl c ctrl F
select the one at the bottom use my
right arrow key and we're going to
change this color so go to edit edit
colors adjust color balance put this up
here hit preview
I think that pillar is pretty good right
there and hit okay so now we have these
actually don't want the end points right
here I kind of want it to end
behind this red arc right there so what
I'll do is zoom up just a little bit put
the magnifying tool and I'm going to
take the pen tool and click right around
here
I'll hit ctrl H to view what I'm working
with and then left-click and drag out
right there and just go all the way
around and end up right there at the
original point now hit ctrl one to go
back to 100% view and I'm going to
select this blob that I just created
along with these two layer groups then
I'm going to just move them down and
away from that original one select this
go to object path divide objects below
then I can take the direct selection
tool and just hit the Delete key so now
I can take these both and move them back
up here and that gives us that effect
all right so now I'm going to take the
type tool with a black foreground color
and I'm just going to type right there I
just kind of made up this name for the
tutorial it's like a move tool and hit
hold shift drag it up and I'm going to
change to a font that I have that I like
called tre gothic and take the letter
spacing in a little bit maybe size it
down
actually in the original I had it placed
over here hit control shift and O to
convert the text here to outline and
that is basically it now sometimes I if
you're designing a logo for a client I
always want to show them you know a
version just with a white background and
also a version with just 100% black and
white but sometimes it's nice to
showcase it in you know a different type
of background that they wouldn't expect
so we can go ahead and do that real
quick and I'll show you a cool way to
create on patterns and so we'll select
these three layer groups and we'll group
them actually first we'll duplicate them
control C control F and then group them
and we'll put it at the very bottom so
now let's move this up and I'm going to
scale it down a lot control H so we can
actually look at it now what we can do
is go to object pattern make hit okay
alright so now we're in this new pattern
edit mode and what's really cool is we
can make changes here and I'm first
going to select all three of these
groups and group them again and now we
can also let me move that over real
quick and these are our pattern options
i we can play with these a lot let's see
here grid we can change to brick by row
you can see kind of staggers them and I
can actually scale this down and you can
see they're not so close to each other
anymore and we can also change the width
here and the height so that they're
spaced out even more
let me just how about hundred twenty
and then over here for copies let's do
nine by nine and then we can go to odd
or now edit edit colors adjust color
balance and actually going to hit cancel
I'm going to go to edit edit colors
saturate hit preview and I don't want it
completely desaturate but just a tad bit
so negative ninety percent I hit okay so
now we can hit done and you can see that
whole area goes completely away so what
we can do is create a rectangle over
this entire area we'll move it to the
bottom and we'll this is our new pattern
that we just created if we select that
that gives us the pattern now it's still
a little bit too it sticks out too much
so I'll go to transparency and take it
down to around 30% then we can also lock
this so we can't select it and then
further we can actually I'm going to
take that and duplicate it control C
control F lock that one and we'll give
this a gradient a radial gradient and
I'll change this to white change this
one to a gray
and let's see here maybe increase this a
little bit and there you go that is the
logo design Matt obviously you can see
it's very easy to create something that
actually looks like it was potentially
complex to make so I hope you enjoyed
the tutorial check out design course
calm and that is all thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
