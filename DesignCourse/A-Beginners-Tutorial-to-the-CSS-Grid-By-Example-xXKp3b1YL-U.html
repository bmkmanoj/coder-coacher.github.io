hey everyone Gary Simon of course at
Rome and today we're gonna be looking at
the CSS grid now when I designed my very
first layout in the mid-90s I remember
using HTML like tables to structure the
layouts with the aid of image slicing
tools like fireworks then we moved to in
lines and floats for quite some time and
after that came flexbox and now we've
arrived at the CSS grid now the CSS grid
soft layout problems that no other CSS
solutions can handle well so in this
tutorial you're going to learn how to
build a layout this one right here and
get your feet wet with the CSS grid now
remember this tutorial is really no way
going to be comprehensive it will just
serve as a quick starter that will
hopefully facilitate your eagerness to
explore the full potential of the CSS
grid so this is the layout that we're
gonna build I kept it pretty simple so
that we can breeze through this with
relative ease it's just a fictional
layout meant to espouse some of my
snobby libertarian views I like to mix
things up so let's go ahead and get
started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
com where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it I have my code
editor here Visual Studio code open with
a 100% blank empty grid project folder
so go ahead and create that and just
open up whichever code it or you want
and we're just going to keep things rule
16 and precise as possible so that means
I can include any frameworks or build
tools we're literally only going to work
a single HTML file CSS and an image file
so if you're watching this on YouTube
make sure to visit the project the
written version and that way you can
just copy and paste the code under
project setup that we're about to do so
we're going to create a new file called
index.html and I'm going to paste in
this just very starting point over html5
so nothing really happening here except
we're importing a source sans Pro font
from google fonts and then also we're
linking an index dot CSS file right here
so let's go ahead and create that file
as well let's keep that blank and then
finally also go ahead and download a
lead we're gonna have the single graphic
it's that little icon that you saw
earlier this is the URL actually right
here
s3 Amazon ad FS comm course cetera logo
dot PNG that's all it is so make sure
you save this somewhere just right click
and save image as in your in the same
project folder alright so here it is
those are our three files so let's go
ahead and start defining the actual HTML
so we're gonna work here in the body tag
and control B to get rid of that sidebar
and coming up here we're just going to
put in a header element with a simple
link now ordinarily you would probably
have you know a navigate a navigation of
some sort alright but we're gonna keep
things you know quick and easy and then
also a div class of container and a div
ID of content and then we're going to do
an h1 down with a state and then also
I'm going to copy and paste real quick
just from the referenced HTML in the
written tutorial so I don't have to type
everything out this right here alright
so it's very simple as you can see and
this simply handles this section so this
is the header and then this is the
content section that we just added we
have to add this as well though one
second so after that we're just going to
have a simple image source to our logo
dot PNG alright then next we're just
going to consider the stuff down here
part of a footer so we'll wrap
everything in a footer element and then
we'll put it we'll just denote these as
unordered list items
all right and then I'm just going to
paste a couple things really this is
just filler text and then we'll just
copy this actually copy just like this
and I want to copy this and then make
things easier actually we can just do
this real quick copy it like that like
that and then just copy these three I
actually want to have six of them
alright just like that so now let's
collapse this whole thing all right so
that's all the HTML is that we need to
worry about
so now let's focus on just fun you know
defining some basic CSS rule sets and
we're not going to mess with the CSS
grid just yet we want to get the
aesthetic stuff out of the way so by the
way if we go hit control B right click
reveal an explorer I can open this up
and this is what it looks like so far
without any CSS okay so let's go ahead
and get started here now we're going to
go to the index CSS file and I'm gonna
do just instead of typing everything out
just copy and paste from the reference
written tutorial again this is the body
we're just changed ending define or work
in the background color margin zero blah
blah blah we're going to reference the a
elements the links again nothing
exciting happening here in fact this is
a little bit silly I'm just gonna paste
the rest in here and you can see there's
not too many just about forty three
lines of rule sets you know we have our
image here we have our header that we're
setting to background color the
container giving some padding footer
background margin zero I don't you know
nothing is really happening here too
much see ya now let's get to the part
where it's actually going to structure
the layout so again at this point this
is what our page looks like
alright so obvious
it doesn't really quite look like this
yet you know this needs to float over
here
these need to float next to each other
how do we do that using the new CSS grid
okay so let's go ahead back to our code
editor and before we do that though I
wanted to kind of give a breakdown of
what's happening in this layout so
essentially we have this outer section
here that's outlined in this yellow
border and this is what we would place
on in the and the container element
which is container class the display
grid property all right so that's how
you define a grid it's very simple it
used to be display inline or display
block or display flex this is display
grid now we have to ask ourselves next
with inside of it what do we have in
terms of you know our layout positioning
well we have this section over here and
then we have this little logo graphic
over here so when it comes to the grid
do you think in terms of columns and
rows so this right here we just have one
row going on and then we have two
columns one and two so it's up to us up
to us to use the specific grid rule sets
to define what's happening here so let's
go ahead and do that so the first step
by the way just to look at the reference
we have our div container then we have
two child elements we have our content
and our logo these are going to serve as
both of our columns so to do this we
find our container and we're going to
say display grid save it and at this
point what happens nothing it's because
we have to add another property so that
property is grid template columns all
right so I'm going to put in for the
first column a value of say 66% and by
the way you can use any other of the
other standard values
and then for our second column which is
the logo element I'm going to put in
simply Auto so this defines two columns
because we have two values separated by
a space and then another value so let's
go ahead and save this and see what
happens there we go
very very simple as you can see alright
so what about this part down here
everything's just kind of floating on
top of each other yet we want to have
reverted back here three columns with
two rows alright so let's go back to our
UL element because going back to our
index we'll see we have our footer and
then we have our UL the UL is probably
or the unordered list element is where
it makes most sense to place the display
grid property on because we have our
child elements inside of it so we're
gonna put in display grid and then also
grid template columns now we could just
do because we want three remember and we
want them of equal width auto auto auto
and then also grid template Rose auto
and auto now Rose of course we didn't
have to add this one up here there's
simply one row now grid template rows we
want two of them so we split things up
into two and what we'll do down here
alright so now we can see we have these
bullets we can remove that momentarily
but we can see now they all float less
like it looks a lot obviously closer to
the mock-up very simple as you can see
by the label let me add
list-style-type:none alright so this
right here isn't that little bit
repetitive and this as well
well there's a shorthand way and we can
use repeat the number of times
is the first parameter so we'll say
three and then the value of what the we
want them to be which is Auto do the
same thing here
repeat two Auto Save and you'll see we
have the same result very very very very
simple okay so going forward let's go
ahead and take this element over here
and Center it appropriately all right so
the CSS grid allows children or items to
be aligned quite easily and we can use
justify self so coming back up to our
image justify self and then where do you
want it Center save and there we go all
right so let's talk about nesting the
CSS grid and template areas so you can
of course it would be ridiculous if you
couldn't nest the CSS grid so you can
have grids within grids so let's do this
by actually making the body element its
own grid so here's what I mean we'll go
back up here we're going to say display
grid so now what's going to happen is
the children of the body tag right here
here and here we could see there's three
of them are all now going to be affected
by this body being a grid so let's also
put in grid template columns Auto we're
just going to have one and then we're
going to have grid template rows we're
going to have three of them because if
you look we have one up here one right
here and then one right here so we're
going to put Auto for the first one
which is the header 60% here and then
40% and then we're going to define area
so grid template areas
now this is going to look a little weird
if you've never seen this before so
we'll say header body and footer all
right so what is happening here well
basically this grid template areas
allows us to position the various grid
areas which we haven't yet defined by
referring to their name in situating
them in the value of this property so we
have one right up here at the top this
one and this one
all right so in order for this to work
we have to use the grid - area property
on the actual children and give them the
appropriate names so we do this we'll
find our first one which is header we
named it a header up here or we referred
to it as header so we're gonna add grid
area header now we have to take our
container we're gonna call this one body
and then we're gonna come down to our
footer and this was grid area footer now
if we save this you're gonna see not
much will be changed
actually nothing changes what happens
however if we change we make our footer
the header and we'll take the header at
the bottom look at that that was
previously never possible with just HTML
and CSS so let's revert this and now
let's I discuss the responsive CSS grid
so this you this means using media
queries and then using the grid to
adjust things and properties so let's
say for instance I on you know smaller
mobile devices or whatever we wanted to
change a grid template area or just
change things around sometimes it does
make sense to do that depending on how
your layout situated so let's go ahead
and then to just paste a media
query right here this is saying that
viewports at 500 pixels are smaller will
say body and we'll take our grid
template areas property and we'll say
header before it was body I'm gonna say
footer here is now and then body all
right so let's save that we're gonna
refresh its back how it was normally and
we're gonna drag this in until we get to
500 pixels there we go awesome now this
looks like crap obviously because these
shouldn't be floating lefty to each
other still so how do we fix that very
simple well reference right here our
under root list and container and we'll
say grid template columns is auto grid
template rows is auto as well and we'll
save it let's refresh and scale it in
and now they're all on top of each other
because we define just one column in one
row now let's go ahead and Center this
text because it looks like crap
come back and refresh and there we go
and that is really all there is to it
now however we have only just begun to
touch the possibilities of the CSS grid
there are plenty of other properties and
values that give you an immense amount
of control over your obviously more
complex layouts so I suggest taking a
look at this right here this is from CSS
tricks
snippets CSS complete guide grid and it
gives you for instance basics and
browser support this is real important
and also down here properties for your
parent which is the grid container or
where you display grid and then
properties for the children and you can
see that there's quite a bit of them and
there are some things obviously that we
haven't touched on but this was just
meant to be a real short and quick
starter just to get your feet wet
alright so hopefully this quick crash
course will be enough to intrigue you
going forward with the CSS grid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
