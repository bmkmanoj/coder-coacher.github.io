and today is january 5th with our fifth
video of 2014 we're sticking with the
365 videos and 365 days thing and today
you're going to learn a little bit of 3d
so we're going to download an
application called blender and it is
100% free
it's only about 50 or 60 megabytes I
forget which it is it's very small and
the installation process is very easy as
well so I'll tell you where to go get
that in just a few minutes but first I
what we're going to use this for is to
showcase logos in a 3d environment on a
glass surface so in about a minute or so
I'll show you the end result and it
looks really awesome so I'm really
excited about this and definitely do it
don't let the fact that it's a new piece
of software discourage you stick with
this video and by the end you're gonna
be really impressed and maybe even
really inspired to learn something new
such as 3d alright so before we begin as
always visit design course comm I put in
your email check out what's there and
also the source files and the project
files and everything are available for
free in the link in the description
below this video so let's go ahead and
get started this is what the end result
will look like
okay so if you don't have blender
installed go to blender.org slash
download and you'll see this page here
and depending on which operating system
you have go ahead and download the
installer version depending on whether
or not you have a 64 or 32 bit operating
system and go ahead once after download
install it the installation is very
quick and once you have it installed
loaded up and you'll be presented with
this view right here so the first thing
right off the bat I want to do is just
save this project so we're gonna go to
file save and I'm gonna call this just
showcase 3d top line alright so right
off the bat there's a few things that
you need to know if you're 100% new to
blender the way you select an object is
by right-clicking it not left clicking
just right clicking so by default it
puts in this light source right here and
a camera in this cube to rotate the view
you hold your middle mouse button and to
zoom in or zoom out you use your scroll
wheel and then if you want to pan you
hold shift and that middle mouse button
like that so I'll be using that and
really it's just a matter of muscle
memory so if it seems like I'm moving
fast you can just posit it and the only
way to really get good with this stuff
is to just by practicing it quite a bit
so anyhow now what we want to do is just
delete this cube so we can hit Delete
key or X I'm just going to hit delete
and enter and we want to add a plane so
if we go to add mesh plane it will add
that and we can also access that same
menu by hitting shift &amp;amp; A which I will
do from now on so you see it adds this
plane right here what we want to do is
rotate this by 90 degrees on the x axis
so to do that we hit R and we hit X and
then we hit 90 and hit Enter
alright so I'm just going to move it up
along the z-axis real quick
and then I want to duplicate this so
this object right here this plane is
actually going to be what where the logo
is showcased it's going to be a glass
panel basically so I want to have a kind
of like a wall behind it so to do that
we're gonna hit shift D to duplicate and
if we just move this around don't click
you'll see that it doesn't stay on the
axis so if we want it to stay on this Y
axis we hit Y and there we go so we're
just gonna have it maybe you know pretty
close maybe right around there and then
we're gonna scale it up so we can hit s
and we can just drag this up however
high we want or you can put an actual
number value to duplicate it or
replicate it that many times or multiply
rather so I'm just gonna go rake around
here it doesn't really matter if you're
you know perfect there and now we have
our two planes and we can see our first
one here and then the big wall behind it
alright so now what I want to do is give
both of these a texture so if I take
this column over here and drag it out
we see all these different tabs the one
we want is this one and with the wall
selected we'll go ahead and first make
sure cycles render is selected from this
menu up here we'll hit new and we'll
just leave this at a white color and
diffuse and then we will go ahead and
right click to select our glass and do
the same thing so now I want to set up
our camera view so to get to the camera
view right now you see we're in user
perspective mode to get to camera view
we'll hit the zero key on the number pad
and basically everything within this box
will be rendered so what we want to do
is go to view properties and then over
here click on lock camera to view and
you'll see it becomes a red outline and
then go to view properties to get rid of
that window and basically this allows us
to move the camera view exactly how we
want to so basically we want to be right
around here when we render so this is
the glass panel basic
that will be rendered when we do this so
if we want to render we can go over here
just to see what everything currently
looks like I and I'm gonna make a few
adjustments first I'm gonna change my
device to GPU compute that makes
everything go a lot faster because you
used it uses both of my graphics cards
to render instead of the processor and
I'm going to go down here to sampling
I'm going to change render from 10 to
100 basically the higher this number is
the better the quality however it will
take a little bit longer so now we're
going to do is just hit render and this
is it it's not all that impressive at
all you can see our well it's not glass
yet but this is what it will look like
so I you can hit the Escape key to get
rid of that and I'm going to switch out
of the camera perspective by simply
hitting the zero key once again and that
gives us basically to our last point so
if we hit a camera view again it goes
back to wherever we left it all right so
now what we want to do this part's going
to be just a little bit difficult I've
but I'm gonna back up real quick
first we want to go to world and just
change the basic it's this color to
white so the change that that makes if
we go back to the camera view hitting
zero and hit render everything is a lot
brighter now okay so back to that
confusing part if you've never used
blender and this is your first time
you're probably gonna get discouraged
but don't worry this is just for the
purpose of this video I in in this
tutorial and this is something you know
once you do it once you'll be able to
reuse this project file for showcasing
future logos or whatever you want in the
future so what we want to do is get this
eye glass panel actually looking glass
and actually displaying a logo so doing
it requires tampering with what's called
the node editor so let's go ahead
real quick and do that I'm gonna hit tab
or not tab rather I'm gonna hit 0 to get
out of here and I'm going to take this
little icon you can see when we hover
over that and left-click and drag to the
right now that gives us basically two
different views and it basically
duplicates whatever view you pulled it
from so they're both right now exactly
the same I
if we come over here this will allow us
to change what is displayed over here so
what we want over there is the node
editor so if we use our mouse wheel we
can not kind of zoom up here and I'm
going to push this over here a little
bit more so we can get a better look at
what's going on this right here we can
kind of see we can move this round I
these can actually get very large and
they allow us to basically control the
appearance of whichever object we happen
to be selected so if we wanted to select
this background wall we can see it has
its own and then this one as well so I
when I first saw this when I started
learning at blender which really was
only about a month or two ago I was like
what is this you know because it looks
so foreign so don't let that deter you
basically we have to set this up and go
through a number of steps in order to
get this to work correctly so if we hold
ctrl on the keyboard and we left-click
and drag that will just basically
separate this connection we want to add
a shader so we go down here and we go to
add shader and we want to add a mix
shader and we're going to put that right
around here so basically a mix shader
will allow you to add two different
types of shaders and we want to connect
this shader here to the surface right
there alright so next what we want to do
is take the diffuse we're going to put
it down here and we're going to take
this point and connect it to the bottom
right there now we want to add a glass
shader so we go over to add shader and
then select glass and we'll put it right
here so we'll connect this portion to
the bottom right there so now we have
our two different shaders worked in here
so let's just screw over here a little
bit and now we need to add our image
texture so this would be our logo that
we want to add so we go to add texture
image texture we'll put it right here
and we want to take the color and drag
it down here to diffuse and then we want
to hit open to open up our Dayna logo
dot PNG which will be linked in the
project files which you can access in
the description beneath this video and
once you have that open now we want to
take alpha and we want to connect it all
the way to this FAC pointer on the mix
shader' now there's only one more that
we need to add and that is add input and
texture coordinate now I know this all
sounds insane you have no idea what's
going on but that's okay all right we'll
go to UV and connect it down here to
vector all right so that is all we have
to do for this setup right here so it
looks like alien like I said I don't
have to worry about it right now if you
ever want to reuse this this project to
showcase logos or whatever you know just
save this and you're not gonna have to
worry about this stuff and of course
there's tons of tutorials on YouTube and
if you do a Google search on you know
how to really figure out how all this
stuff works but just for our purpose
this would be good enough so you don't
have to have a great understanding of it
now what we want to do I'm going to
combine these windows here so I'm going
to take this and just drag it over here
to the right and you'll see that arrow
that kind of overlaps and go right there
so you would think okay maybe now if we
go to render we'll be able to see our
glass texture or whatever that's not the
case though what
just real quickly I will hit dye zero to
get into camera view will hit render and
nothing shows up it is a glass texture
but the actual decal isn't set up and
I'll tell you how to fix that so if we
escape and we go to I'm going to hit Z
or just to get out of there and make
sure making sure this is currently
selected by right-clicking it will go to
edit mode and you can get there also by
hitting tab and if you hit a in a again
you just make sure everything is
currently selected and it will be if
it's all orange all right and what we
have to do is scroll down here and we
have to go to unwrap and then select
unwrap all right so now if we get out of
edit mode we'll hit tab just to go back
into object mode and we hit zero on the
number pad and we hit render now we'll
see I this image right here so it
doesn't look quite right though because
it's kind of a up against you know the
edges of this so we're going to go ahead
and fix that so what we'll do is hit
scape to get out of there and we're
going to get a photo shot so go ahead
and load up Photoshop and we're going to
go to file new and we have to make sure
the width and height are 1024 by 1024
we'll hit okay and it's obviously a
pretty large image I'm only at 50% view
and if you if you do have a white
background you can just delete that or
just go to file new and where it says
background contents usually by default
it's set at white or your background
color change that to transparent all
right so you have a transparent
background and then we want to open up
that logo which is Dana logo hits to
control a and then ctrl C and then ctrl
V to paste it in here and hit ctrl T and
hold shift and alt and we could scale it
down right around here so basically
anything that's going to be inside of
this
container here this image will be
displayed on that glass piece so let's
go ahead and save for web so say for web
we see the shortcut here and I'm gonna
make it
png-24 transparent and save this Dana
logo we'll just call this - and it'll
wait my hard drives being a little bit
slow alright and now what I'm going to
do is go back to blender and now what
I'm going to do we're going to go back
to that UV or the node editor rather and
I'm just going to zoom up here real
quick and we can just click this icon
under the image header image texture
node and Dana's logo - - that's what we
want
alright so let's get that back over here
and now let's hit render and now it's
set on there much better okay so while
this results is pretty cool I we can do
some things to improve it so I'm gonna
hit escape and now I'm gonna go to hit
zero and zoom out here a little bit I'm
gonna add a emission plane so I'm just
gonna click click rather I the left
mouse button right around here kind of
by the camera and I'm going to go to add
mesh plane and I want to rotate it so
it's kind of facing our glass portion so
I'm going to hit R and we're going to do
see if X is it yep X and then 45 in hit
enter
alright so over here we're going to give
it a texture and our material and hit
new and we're gonna choose emission
which is right there so emission we have
a color option and I'm going to leave it
at white and
strength which is one which is kind of
not very strong so I'm going to choose
ten all right so if we hit zero on the
number he'd go back and we hit render
you see it slightly lightens things up
but also let me escape out of there hit
zero if we want to drop this down a
little bit on the z axis we'll see what
happens then we'll render it again
usually I have a reflection on here but
I think I have to adjust things a little
bit more let me escape okay and I just
pause the video so I could play around
with getting that into the correct
position so we can see a reflection of
that light source of the plane emission
and I was able to get it to show kind of
right up here I so if I hit zero on the
number pad this is kind of where I moved
it you may have to play around just to
get that same effect and I we can even
add multiple planes up here so if we hit
shift D and we move this on the x-axis
by hitting X to put one right there and
go back to the camera view and hit
render and we'll see we have the second
one showing there that's this way just
kind of gives us a little bit more I
guess realism if you could say you could
choose to leave that out if you want
although you have to realize it when you
do duplicate that you increase the light
strength so that's something to keep in
mind so let me escape out of here and
just zoom up once by using my mouse
wheel I think it looks better if i zoom
it up here just a little bit more
alright and I just want to show a couple
other things that we could do and really
play around with and make this so cool
so if I hit hit escape and we get back
to user perspective I
we can do a couple things so let's
select the actual glass and if we go
into edit mode and hit tab or we go we
choose it manually there you'll see that
basically we zoom up here this is just a
very simple it has no depth to it so we
can actually create some depth by
hitting the e key which means extrude so
now we're giving it some depth
so depending on how big you want to make
it if you make it real thick you may not
work out as you want but if we make it
pretty thin and hit basically the left
mouse button to solidify that selection
we go back to tab and we hit zero and we
hit render you can see what sort of
happens here basically I by giving it
depth it creates kind of like a shadow
on the back portion of that glass piece
now if that's something that you don't
want you can kind of leave that step out
I just wanted to show another thing real
quick go back to zero let's say for
example we wanted to add something that
made it look like this is actually
connected to the wall like maybe like
little fly for little cylinders so we
can do that real quickly we're gonna I'm
gonna click right around here by
left-clicking and like right here okay
so basically wherever this little cursor
is that's where a new object will be
added so if we hit shift a and add a
cylinder as you can see it's real big so
if I hit s and scale this down quite a
bit and we want to rotate it so it's
facing this way
so our Y a X and 90 and then hit enter
so now right now it's kind of it's it's
a lot fatter than I would want it to be
so let's go ahead and to s
and scaled up down quite a bit more and
then if we s again and we'll choose Y we
can scale this up just to right around
here alright
so real quickly I if you use your number
pad and you hit one that gives us a
front perspective and I also like to hit
five on the number pad and that changes
us to front ortho
if you hit seven we're still in ortho
mode basically that means whenever
you're trying to model your what you're
trying to work with I modeling something
it allows you to select a versus in an
orthographic mode opposed to a
perspective mode and if that's confusing
you don't really have to worry about
that right now I but anyhow at the top
top view is seven and then three is
right so by switching between these
modes we can use these anchors to really
position it a little bit better and also
if we wanted to switch this to a
wireframe so we can see things so if we
go to like one for example we want to be
able to see this because but in the
solid mode because these this light
source right here is in the way so
that's just something to keep in mind so
if we get a wireframe we want to move
this around so it's kind of more even we
can do so and now we want to do is give
this an actual texture so if we go over
here we hit new and we can go ahead and
we can just give this a try giving a
glossy and we'll try like right around
here like a gray all right now we can go
ahead and duplicate this shift D and we
will keep that on the z-axis by hitting
Z and then shift D again and hit X go
right around here
and I'm just panning remember by shift
and your middle mouse button and then
shifty once more and hit zero and click
right around there
okay all right so now we switch back to
solid here let's go ahead and hit the
zero key and let's go to render you can
now see it has these little you know I'm
not sure if you would actually want to
use that but really I'm just trying to
show you guys some just cool things I so
with a very little amount that you
learned here you actually learned a ton
because I you can do so many different
cool things with what you learned so for
example just to show you another thing
if we hit escape and hits here to get
out of here if we wanted to change the
color of these two things hold shift and
right click both of those and go over
here to the material we could change our
color let's try like like a blue right
around here like a light blue and we'll
go back to zero for a camera view and it
will render this and see what happens
you can see now everything kind of has
more of a bluish tint whether or not you
like that I that's up to you but as you
can see you can just play around with
stuff so much and it makes it look
really cool so just one final thing I'm
gonna get out of here I really don't
like those cylinders so I'm gonna select
them all real quick and just delete them
delete and then I'm going to change both
of these back here to white and then for
the final render you know when you're
really ready ready to render a good
looking image you want to make sure you
come debt back down to where's that at
sampling and for render for something to
get something really good I mean a
thousand would be ideal so I'm gonna hit
1000
and I'll leave it at that I'm going to
hit the zero key to get back into the
camera view and then I'm going to go
ahead and render this now because I
selected a thousand it's going to take
quite a bit longer for this to get going
so I'm just gonna pause until it's fully
completed and then I'll unpause it and
this is what it came up with though I
should probably tell you that I adjusted
a couple things I while I was pausing it
because I first let me hit escape here
what I realized is when I changed these
two colors over here I only changed this
value this was still over here as blues
to make sure if you want to go to hex
just change that to 6s and that's the
hex color code for white and I also
removed the thickness that was on the
glass because it just gave this shadow I
didn't really like it so yeah no big
deal there so another thing real quickly
on to show so I that looked real good of
course with that logo just to show you
what it looks like with a different logo
if you bring up Photoshop again and go
to file open here we'll try the DC logo
that's in the project files ctrl a ctrl
C to copy that and then we'll go ahead
and ctrl a and delete everything there
by hand delete key and then control V
control T hold shift and all and scale
that down save this by saving for web
I'll just do this shortcut here save and
we'll call this DC logo - - and we go
back here to blender and we get out of
there the way we change that again is if
we select our here let me it's hard to
see they're like the same color
if we select us again bring out our
other window go back to node editor zoom
up here with our scroll wheel
hit open DC logo - - to get this back
over here hit zero go back to render
although I want to yeah I'll let it
render for the high 1000 samples and
then I'll just I'll pause this and
unpause it once it's done and here it is
after it got done rendering and really
that took about a minute and a half or
two I and once again it looks pretty
freakin awesome
so I once you have a render that you
like and you want to save it you just
hit f3 so we'll just call this final DC
render and it gives you the options to
change you know write down set PNG if we
change this to they could jpg put the
quality up to 100% or whatever you want
and then just hit save as image and then
you're you're done you got your image so
I hope that was this was a good video
tutorial introduction kind of to blender
although they're probably better more
generalized introductions like you know
understanding the interface and all that
stuff than this video but you know in
the context of using it to showcase like
a logo or a decal or anything I
hopefully this was a good tutorial so if
you like this do me a big favor
if you haven't already please go to
design course comm check out what is
there right now the official course
relaunch is not ready but if you're
watching this down the road and it is
you know please check it out also check
out in the description in different
social networks that I'm a part of
please like them on Facebook Twitter
Google and of course here on YouTube
please subscribe alright so if you have
any questions go ahead and just post in
the comments and I will try to comment
alright thanks and until next time I
will see you then good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
