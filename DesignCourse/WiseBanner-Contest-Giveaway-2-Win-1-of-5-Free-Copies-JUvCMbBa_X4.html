calm and today we're not going to do any
design because I've been so damn busy
usually at the end of the month I have a
commitment that I need to fulfill and I
record a two-hour minimum video course
for envato stutz plus com so that's what
i've been doing so i just don't have the
time today to really focus towards
recording some type of tutorials so
instead i'm going to do something that
it did last month i'm going to give away
5 free copies of my wives banner com
product so wise banner is basically
something i made it's a set of PSD
action I and script files and basically
it makes the process of designing
multiple banners for display advertising
very easy so just check out this video
to see what it is imagine browsing
through a catalog of beautifully
designed banners for every niche and
style imaginable then once you've found
the perfect banner template you're able
to use the full power of adobe photoshop
to finalize the design then imagine if i
told you all it took was a simple click
to duplicate the banner to over 15 of
the most popular banner sizes in seconds
you might think up crazy but I'm not
it's about to get better though not only
does wise manner produce static banners
it's also able to produce animated gifts
within seconds with a vast collection of
amazing banner sets all fully
customizable beta creation just became a
breeze all right so now that you know
what it is in order to win one of the
five free copies all you have to do is
to very simple and quick things just
visit the facebook page or the Twitter
page which is linked below in the
description of this video in youtube com
and like it on Facebook or follow me on
Twitter and then once you've done that
just respond here on YouTube and if
you're viewing this on a design course
calm page just click on the YouTube icon
and then you'll see the comments section
below
and let me know just provide me with
some feedback in terms of what you think
I should approve or what you think I
should cover just anything that comes to
mind that might be relevant to help me
make a better show alright so basically
I depending on how many responses I get
I I may reveal the winners i'm going to
choose the winners at random live I and
it may be a day or two we'll see how
many we get all right so obviously if
you were one of the five winners before
you can't win together but you can still
provide me with feedback all right so go
ahead and do that and I'll see you
tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
