calm and today I'm going to show you how
to create a chat app using angular as
well as firebase and firebase offers
something called angular fire - which
allows you to hook into angular 2 and
hopefully here as well as angular 4
coming up in March I so this if it
something does break with it I will
update the article so there is a fully
written article step by step that goes
alongside this video at core central com
watch a link here in YouTube in the
description also check out corset recom
for other angular courses I'm going to
assume that you know angular
fundamentals before doing this course if
you don't there's a 100% free course
where you can follow along and I'll link
that as well so let me go ahead and
switch to the desktop is show you
exactly what you'll be making alright so
here is a quick preview of the app in
the browser and very simple as you can
see we have just a login with Facebook
if the person is not currently logged in
and then the chat which just features
five of the latest messages starting at
the bottom so I just to show you let me
go ahead and click login and I'm logging
into my wife's account here I'm going to
continue as Stephanie it automatically
comes back and now we have a chat here
message that shows up now let me just
show you I'll just type in what's going
on we hit enter
and there you go so let me just show you
side-by-side in two browser windows with
two different accounts and one is just
in Internet Explorer over here on the
right and then we have chrome on the
left and there's this two different
account so you'll see it's instant we
have two different names here okay so
let's kick things off by going to
consult firebase google.com here in our
browser or just go to google and type in
firebase you'll find the same page and
you'll make sure you want to log into
your Google account as it uses your
Google account and create new project
alright so for the project name name it
whatever you want
going to call mine chat app er I don't
know why I I already used my chat app
there when I was creating the written
tutorial and here we go here we go here
we go alright great so now the next step
we want to add firebase to our web app
so if we click this it eventually loads
and gives us our credentials and you
want to save these five right here we
don't really have to integrate or use
these script tags or anything like this
the only thing we want is just the
information to these properties or the
values so we want to copy just this and
just open up I like notepad or whatever
and save that off the side we're going
to need them in a little bit so let's go
ahead and close and then we need
authentication and sign-in method and
here's all of the different ways they
allow you to log into your app so we
have just a straight out email password
for a custom option we have Google at
Facebook Twitter github and anonymous
okay so the one we're going to use for
this tutorial is Facebook although you
know you can use the same process for
pretty much all of these especially when
we're integrating the authentication and
the angular to fire so let's go ahead
and choose Facebook and then enable and
now we need our app ID and the app
secret which is available in Facebook so
if you head on over to developers
facebook.com and choose an app from the
write pulldown menu that shows up over
here I have just some random one I'm
just showing you for demonstration
purposes i we have our app ID right here
you want to copy that
and then also the app secret which you
can show and I believe it prompts you
for your Facebook password in order to
reveal that and don't close this yet
because you're gonna have to go back and
then we'll switch back over to firebase
and you paste those two bits of
information in alright so I pasted my in
and what we want to do now is under here
it says to complete
set up at this 0:03 direct your eye to
your Facebook app configuration so we
click on this little link to copy it
automatically to the clipboard and we'll
go back and if you haven't yet added the
product of facebook login we click on
add product and then get started for
facebook login
we'll choose web here click Save and
continue
and let continue continue all right so
now we'll click on settings here and
right here where it says valid redirect
URIs this is where we paste that right
there all right so just Save Changes
all right and there we go we're done
with that we can close that out and we
click Save here Facebook enabled next
we'll go ahead and click database and
we'll click on rules and right now it
says default security rules requires
users to be authenticated so for the
purposes of development make our lives a
little bit easier we're going to change
this and I'm going to copy and paste
this right here to read and it really
only changes just the properties right
here this is also available if you want
to copy and paste it real quick on the
course set or calm tutorial written
tutorial for this and let's go ahead and
save or publish right there and it will
give us this big red thing that your
security rules I had to find this public
now anyone can read and write to the
database so of course you'd want to
change these back after the app is
finished ok so now let's get started by
setting up the project and we need to
make sure that you have a couple things
before we proceed so we need to check
whether or not first if you have node J
s and NPM installed so at the command
line we'll go ahead and type node - V
and then also NPM - V usually if you
install nodejs by default it will have
NPM installed for you so if it's went
unrecognized
then we simply need to head on over to
node.js org and we'll go to downloads
and then choose Windows or Mac installer
and then install it once it's ready to
go
and just go through the installation
process as you know you normally would
just Next Next Next Next and you'll find
that at the end it does ask you or it
doesn't ask you but it shows the
different assets that's going to install
and the node package manager is one of
them just make sure that that is enabled
and will be installed then you can close
out your console and come back and run
these and they should give you
diversions all right now we also have to
make sure that we have the angular CLI
or the command-line interface installed
and to check for that we simply type in
ng - V and it should spit out something
similar to this and if not we'll go back
to the browser to see Li Cheng Euler I
oh and this shows you how to install it
and also get a new project run which
will do so npm install - g for global
and angular - CLI and the - g flag all
that means is you're only going to have
to do that once on your machine so it's
only a one step process and so then once
you have that installed remember if you
do do this at the end you can hit ng - V
just like I did and you'll be good to go
ok now we're ready to rock so so to
start a new project we're going to do ng
new and I'm just going to give mine the
same name as before although you can
name it whatever you want and this does
take a little bit of time so I'm going
to pause and then come back alright once
it's finished we'll go ahead and CD into
that folder - chat app er and then also
we're going to run npm install
angularfire 2 along with firebase and
we'll save it to our package that jason
as a dependency alright great so
now that that is finished we have to
open up our code editor I'm going to use
Visual Studio code which is a free code
editor by Microsoft and we're going to
add the firebase project settings to our
app module ts file so in our code editor
I have open the project that we just
created
and in the source app folder we'll have
our app dot module ts file okay so we
need to do three different things the
first we need to import the angularfire
module from angularfire 2 which we
installed with NPM so to do that I'm
going to copy and paste that right here
and by the way you can grab all the code
from the website at Coursera calm and
follow along and also we have we have to
include our config for firebase so right
here I'll paste that in and this is
where we're going to use the information
that we saved in a notepad or text file
with our API key domain database URL
storage bucket and messaging sender ID
all right so I'm going to pause and just
enter those in real quickly and just for
making sure I don't get hacked or
anything I removed it but make sure you
put those in leave it there and also we
the third thing we need to do is go
ahead and add the angularfire module to
our imports alright so what that looks
like right after HTTP module we'll go
ahead and add that just like that
alright so of course this is showing up
not there because I removed all the
config but of course you won't have that
red squiggly line if it's there and now
inside of our App component is where
we're going to spend most of our time
here we need to first import necessary
firebase modules so underneath here of
the import component we're going to
actually instead of me just typing this
I'm going to copy and paste this real
quick it's just one line but there's a
lot of different members here that we
have to import so for
we have angularfire which is needed as a
primary angularfire member contains all
the functions that we need for the most
part we also have off providers and off
methods and then also firebase lists
observable which allows us to fetch all
the chat messages essentially alright so
the next step we're going to have the
required properties here defined an
export app or class component so let's
get rid of title here and the first one
is items firebase lists observable and
then a type of any and again this here
is going to fetch essentially all of the
chat items from our firebase project and
then name up type any and this name
property is something what will set the
check if the auth is successful or not
and then also another custom property
will name it message Val of type string
equals just empty initially and we're
going to be using this for property
binding which will allow us to clear the
text input field after a user hits enter
which I showed during the demonstration
at the beginning okay so now we're going
to work within our constructor and we're
going to use dependency injection to get
angular fire working so constructor and
inside we'll make a public AF and then
cool an angular fire all right and then
next we're going to create what's called
a list binding and this is going to grab
all of the chat messages from in a
section called messages that will define
when we actually send the chat messages
so this items going to be bound to AF
database dot lists forward slash
messages and then we'll add a query and
this is optional and we're going to add
a property called limit to last and
we'll set it to 5 so that will give us
the last 5 messages that were sent again
you don't have to add this but I want to
do that just for the UI
wiser to scroll way down okay so after
that we're also inside of the
constructor here we're going to add this
dot AF dot auth dot subscribe ah - and
we'll open this up if off this name
equals off ok so what's happening here
this is basically saying once a user or
after a user clicks on the connect to
Facebook or log into Facebook button if
the connection is successful then we'll
set this dot name property to the auth
object and this is going to provide us
with their name for example and we'll be
able to send that along to firebase
alright so now in this section outside
of our constructor we're going to define
a method and this method will go ahead
and name login inside of it we're going
to say this dot AF dot auth dot log in
provider is off providers dot Facebook
and then method will be auth methods dot
pop-up now what's happening here
basically when somebody clicks on our
login to Facebook button it's going to
be bound to this method right here login
all right then what's going to do is
this AF dot login is going to call which
provider through auth providers Facebook
this could also be dot Twitter or github
etc I've listed out the other ones here
in the article and then also the method
will be off methods pop-up and that
means it will pop-up otherwise the other
option is redirect and that will take
the user entirely away from your app in
the browser and direct into Facebook to
do the same process but I like to pop-up
better just because it keeps the app
present in the background
and now finally we'll create one more
method and that's going to be Chat sense
chat send and we're going to add in an
argument of their message of a type
string and inside of it will say this
dot items dot push and inside will say
message is their message which we passed
as an argument and then name is going to
be this name Facebook dot display name
right there let it cool and at the N or
semicolon and then also will reset or
clear the input text field with this dot
message Val which we defined as a
property up top equals just empty
alright you may be confused about this
section right here that this dot name
dot Facebook display name I basically if
you were to console.log this dot name
you would see all of the potential
properties that you would be able to
hook into and this is just I a display
name is a person's first and last name
that's associated with their Facebook
account ok all right now that's it for
our app component EES logic now the rest
of this tutorial is very simple alright
so let's go ahead and go to our app
component HTML and I'm going to paste in
some HTML and I'm grabbing this by the
way from the tutorial at Coursera calm
and just a real quick run through the
div class row columns these are classes
that are predefined by the foundation
six flex grid so we'll be importing that
shortly in index.html down here and if
you're unfamiliar with foundation 6 flex
flex grid in short it simply allows you
to quickly structure layouts and so
these are just predefined classes for
that and then our button here is using
event binding which is defined by
parentheses and on the on click and we
bound that to our login method that we
created very simple then we're also
using the ng if conditional to designate
whether or not this button will show if
the name property exists or in other
words if they're logged in it's not
going to show which is
designated by this operator right here
and then also we have a input text field
and this also uses the ng-if right here
so if it does exist or if the person is
logged in it's going to show this chat
message and then please have simple
placeholder attribute and then we also
have another event binding designated by
the key up enter so if they hit enter
it's going to call the chat send method
and it's going to pass in the event
target value or in other words it's
going to know whatever they have typed
in is what is going to send to tap to
the chat send method and then also we
have two-way data-binding here with
ng-model at message val and so this
allows us to clear the text input i want
the hit enter okay
then coming down here finally we also
have ng for to iterate through right
here all of the items and we're also
using the async pipe and right here
we're using interpolation and what
exists on these is the item name and
then the item dot message and where is
it grabbing these from well if we go
back to our app component we have them
define right here when we do this items
dot push so we have the message and then
we have the name so this stuff is stored
inside firebase okay so let's go ahead
and save that and now we'll move on to
the CSS I'm going to copy all that and
paste it to our app component CSS I'm
not going to run through all this and
describe it that's not much here but
basically what's happening we have our
input message we're styling quite
different properties on this text field
just to make it look quite different for
the UI we have our check container we
also have our pseudo selectors event
child so that can make them fade I let
me just show you real quick so as you
can see right here we have full opacity
this is full opacity as well and then we
use those pseudo selectors to kind of
fade these out so this at
is 80% 60 and then 40 and not that much
of a big deal and then just two more for
the chat container for styling the
message and the name okay and then
moving on we're going to go ahead and go
to our source styles.css to define just
some of the global styles and there's
only three of them really and that is
body and we have one for all just to set
the the font family and then the button
here so we're going to save both of
these and after that we're going to
import foundation and a web font to our
source index.html so click on this and
just right here I'm going to paste that
in so we have this linking to a CDN on
CloudFlare I to our foundation flex min
dot CSS file and then I'm using this
railway font from google fonts and
believe it or not that is it so now the
only thing we need to do is test it out
by running the angular firebase chat app
and we'll do that with ng serve and in a
couple seconds it'll give you this which
is localhost 4200 just where you want to
go in your browser and this is where I'm
at in the browser and there we go
because I already logged in I was
already logged into Facebook it doesn't
even show me the button I but everything
should work hopefully so testing chat
message hit enter clears it as you can
see and adds it and there we go now you
can of course take this further I the
next probably logical step would be to
add a logout button somewhere and again
I if you just analyze the template HTML
we go back here to our code editor and
just do a little bit of reverse
engineering if you're kind of unfamiliar
with angular itself I you know you use
event binding on click-to-call methods
in your app component and those methods
of course can do certain things like
login or for instance log out so a log
out method would simply
look like this and then in your app
component HTML you create another button
that uses the ng if conditional that
only shows up for instance right here if
name exists and you can name it a button
that says log out and call the log out
method so as you can see you can take it
a lot further on your own and if you
want to visit the github repo which is
linked here in the article as well as
YouTube you can get started real quickly
and you can start customizing any more
features etc so make sure you check out
corset recom we have a lot more
tutorials planned for this year as well
as courses and free courses that are
already there that you can check out
especially if you want to learn more
angular alright talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
