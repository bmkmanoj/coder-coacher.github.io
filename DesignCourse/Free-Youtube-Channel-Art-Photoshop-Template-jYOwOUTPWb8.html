course comm today I'm offering you a
100% free Photoshop template and this is
going to allow you to design your cover
art your channel icon and your video
thumbnail templates all in one mock-up
in Photoshop and it uses something
called smart object layers and basically
this is much better to what most people
do who have a channel they separately
design their channel icon their cover
art and they separately upload these
things and then check out to see what it
looks like so this gives you the
advantage of being able to see it as you
design your entire channel so if you're
new to photoshop I'm gonna show you
exactly how to use this Photoshop
template and if you want to download it
it's hundred percent free check the
description here in YouTube to download
all right so I'll see you later
okay so this is the template right here
and as you could see it looks like just
your ordinary eye YouTube interface so
if I screw a lot or zoom out rather you
can see the whole thing right here so
this initial layer as seen here is just
a layer that if I had everything else
something I screenshot it from my own
channel and so basically the way this
works is we have all these layers here
and we can see the ones that have this
little document right there these are
called smart objects the others are the
ones that you can edit so if we take a
look at the cover art and we double
click right here on the Edit cover art
layer you'll see it opens up a new
document and it has you know I quite
large document size it's only at 33.3%
and you can see that it doesn't really
match up to this dimension right here
and that's because google makes you
upload a cover art graphic that's very
versatile in that it can be displayed on
TVs like Smart TVs that have access to
YouTube so if you look at the size of
this the image size is 2560 by 1440 and
I also included a guide layer that is 2
by default hidden but if you turn it on
when you're designing your cover graphic
you can kind of see where the profile
the channel icon is along with how it's
going to look on the desktop at least
alright so you can make any changes to
this like say for example changing the
background color and removing the text
or doing whatever you want adding your
photographs you save it just hitting
ctrl s and you can see automatically
updates here okay so let me back up just
you save that and then additionally you
have the channel icon so the channel
icon is right here you double click it
and it's an 800 by 800 pixel document in
which you can specify whatever you want
here and save it it works just like the
other one right here I this part here is
pretty much optional this is the
featured video section this is the one I
screenshot of myself and the feature
video section allows you to if we open
up the layer group here you can specify
the text like the title if you wish the
title of the video and the description
over here you can also change the screen
shot that will show up right here if you
want to do that this is again this is
something that you don't have to save or
export obviously because it's based on a
video but if you just want to get a good
idea of what it looks like you can go
ahead and edit this as well and this is
1920 by 1080 and then finally down here
we have the uploads and this is going to
be perfect for those of you who want to
have a kind of like a themed thumbnail I
for your different shows or your
different videos that you have out there
so for example if we take this we have
the upload section here we have video
thumbnails you can also specify the
titles if you wish down here and if you
edit one of these all of them are going
to change so let me just show you if I
hide the text for example hit save
you'll see they'll all basically be the
same and that is essentially yet and
what's great about these is in this
document is you can go ahead and hit go
to file save for web and actually use it
to upload because this is based on a
1920 by 1080 you know if you're
uploading something that's I smaller
like a 720p
YouTube will automatically scale that
down so you have to worry about that
same thing with the the channel art the
cover art up here all you to do is make
your changes because it's already a
perfect size you go to file save for web
and you can save it as a JPEG or gif or
whatever you wish based on your needs
and if you're good to go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
