tonight rather it's Friday night I'm
sitting at home doing this I'm going to
be doing my very first live YouTube
stream and in doing so I'm going to be
judging some of the recent entries from
the first design not designed but
corsetry com design challenge alright so
let's get started and I hit the wrong
 guy alright so anyhow what I
want to do is switch over to my desktop
here and basically we have a number of
entries that I have not yet rated and so
I thought it would be helpful for those
of you who have participated in this
design challenge to kind of get a video
/ audio representation of my thought
process in terms of how I'm writing
these designs and by the way I've also
worked in pagination or pagination here
so it's no longer listing these all out
on a single page so we can see this here
I just did this a few hours ago all
right so that's a scroll down here real
quickly and this is the last one I rated
so I have about 22 rate I probably not
great all 20 of them now but also if I
happen to be writing yours and you're
watching this whether it be now or in
the future I'm not going to be leaving a
comment because I'm going to be talking
through anyhow so no big deal okay so
the first one right here oh by the way I
only me or myself I can see the rating
system down here this is how I rate
based on simplicity relevancy uniqueness
versatility and color and contrast real
quickly i'm just going to pause what I'm
talking about and come over here to make
sure everything is going well with the
live feed and it looks like it is
okay so looking at this all right so I'm
going to go through these I one by one
so in terms of simplicity if we're
looking at this logo right here and I'm
going to make this large so we can see
it this is actually not a very simple
logo design even though it's only two
colors that's good that's very simple
but in form it's actually a little bit
more complex name we would prefer
because we have a lot of different
elements at play when we're looking at
this symbol right here so first we have
the overall apple shape we have the
apple leaf we have a stem and then we
have the droid eyes here and then sort
of an elaborate mouth not too elaborate
but we have four different shapes when
you combine all these aspects together
you're not exactly being very simple
it's definitely a lot more simple than
some of the entries we received already
which we have about 45 but it's
definitely not the most simple so if you
think of the most successful companies
and their logo these eyes and their
identities out there think about you
know Nike it's just a little swish one
element that's it I think about fedex I
there's a ton of others where the most
successful companies they're actually
all quite a bit more simple than this
representation here so I'm going to rate
this a little bit lower on the
simplicity side so I'm going to get a 4
out of a 10 relevancy it's definitely
relevant so that's a positive because we
need to work in the idea of nutrition
and health which apple an apple is
commonly associated with that and the
bot aspect which we have taken care of
here with the eyes so the relevancy is
pretty decent uniqueness ok well judging
by the other entries you know a lot of
other people went with this sort of
concept so it's not exactly the most
unique in terms of thinking about having
apple just with some droid eyes in the
center so not exactly the most unique
versatility
will it scale down well this isn't too
bad it's not the greatest especially
this font here or this typeface the a
that will get a little bit lost if it's
really scaled down quite a bit so the
versatility I'll put on for I believe
and then color and contrast there's not
too much happening here you can't really
judge it one way or the other because
it's kind of monochromatic with
exception to the background so I'm just
going to leave this out of 5 all right
and let's go ahead that was a double or
duplicate entry out to delete that and
then come on over here we have I need to
fix this I broken image issue of here I
breeze Peters ok so i hope i submitted
this correctly they said and it did and
I tried to keep it extremely simple
alright so the biggest issue here is
this is not extremely simple I know
there's no effects like drop shadows
gradients and glows etc and that's a
good thing but in terms of the form in
the shape definitely not the most simple
thing occurring here because we have
first the character and the stroke width
and the wait is it varies all over the
place we have thick over here coming
down to thin over here then the thick
right back down here we also have the
let me scale this up just a tad bit more
we have the feet down here and this is
varying and stroke with I comes up here
with these eyes that again their varied
in stroke weight as well and then the
antenna up here which is intersecting
this line right here with this red heart
all those things combined it's actually
makes it more of a complex shape so I
know the intention was to keep it
extremely simple but it's actually not
especially it again when you compare it
to some of the most major iconic symbols
and logo designs out there this is
definitely a lot more complex and then
also considering the flabby text right
here the type I it's not the most crisp
consistent sort of typeface and then
when you add a very strict saps not
strict but thick stroke to it I this is
comply
as well so the main issue with this is
its complexity definitely so the
simplicity we're going to turn this down
you know maybe the three relevancy I
don't really see too much of a health
indication here at all I see more of
just a penguin with a heart there so the
relevancy is going to be low as well the
uniqueness I mean it's a penguin with
you know I our heart here in the symbol
top i would say we'll leave it at five
versatility I don't like the fact
there's a tiny little piece of white
space right here I we're going to
probably put this down here for and then
color in contrast I this doesn't even
look like a solid block to me it's like
more of a cat dark grey eye and it
doesn't really say these colors together
don't really say health at all or an
artificial intelligence do you know the
purpose of the company so I'm going to
braid it right there for all right and
then we also have a another entry here
okay so I love it it's a they love their
concept that's a good thing I guess it's
a combination of the chat box and the
Autobot alright so looking at this and
just also just to preface this I haven't
really looked at these before doing this
video so this is my first time and I'm
just kind of winging this but looking at
this my first initial impression is I do
not see a chat box here I know the
intention was probably to have this
little portion down here be that iconic
thing that kind of hangs off the other
the main chat Porson portion but I don't
I still don't see it I it doesn't seem
that obvious to me so if we're talking
about complete by some simplicity over
here this is actually pretty complex not
to say that it's necessarily bad I think
for the most part it's pretty well
designed but there is in terms of
complexity there's a draw
there's a little shadow here it's a
darker color a shadow here we have a
glycine asan top over here so it is more
on the complex side the type is pretty
simple and that's a good thing but for
the simplicity I'm going to break this
probably just at an even five the
relevancy again I know the intention was
to show that this is a chat icon with a
bot but it's not very obvious to me so
I'm going to leave that probably out of
for the uniqueness well we have a bot
with a chat or at a chat kind of icon
which is the intention with a bot right
here but I'm going to have to say in
regards to uniqueness you know there's
nothing profoundly unique units just
kind of taking too obvious concepts
sticking into one so I'm going to leave
that probably be around a for
versatility you know if you scale this
down as is to a really small size you're
going to lose some of the detail it may
become a little bit blurry or pixelated
in these areas as is right here so I'm
going to probably leave this at a four
or a three and then color in contrast it
contrasts pretty well except right here
we we have just the certain areas that I
think are definitely a necessary that
we're designed in the symbol I know mean
sure what these are exactly but there's
not much contrast with between these
elements so i'll leave this Prairie at a
four all right moving on I'm just
looking here I'm looking at the live
comments right now we have a few so I'm
just looking at this all right I'm gonna
move to the first page so these are all
unjust so far all right so alessandro
cariola i think that's how you pronounce
it whatever um ok we have unfortunately
a lot going wrong with this particular
submission so where do I start all right
um okay so let's start you know the
thing that immediately pops out
to me without thinking about any of
these down here is the color in contrast
this section right down here and this is
going to get a 2 or one I when you look
at the gray background here that they've
chose to put it on I think in the future
going to put a requirement you have to
show it on a white background I but I
didn't put that requirement so people
are putting all types of different
backgrounds unfortunately but this
medium gray right here when you look at
the really bright saturated green in
this section right here it really looks
sorry I'm trying to increase the size so
we could see this better it makes it
very hard to see the form in the shape
so this was bad color usage right here
in terms of the gray against the green
so there's not much contrast and it just
looks bad you can't really see it I with
that said moving on the type the type is
really bad unfortunately I know you know
you tried to make it seem like for
example yeah this is kind of like a
robotic or bought type of font or robot
font but it is pretty hard to read and
so if this were scaled down it would be
hard to read either certain areas of
this type base where you know it's just
I too thin in areas and it's going to
get blurred when it's scaled down such a
small size looking at the rest of this
proportionality wise you know this
symbol is real large in relation to the
size of the the type so I would scale
down probably so it wouldn't be very
versatile in its usage so let me bring
this back down here so I'm going to go
ahead and rate this real quickly so the
simplicity probably more on the four
maybe now the type makes it like a three
because it's too complex for the for the
type the relevancy nothing about this
says helped me except for you know this
portion and it's just not obvious enough
because it's supposed to be like the
heart rate monitor scan lines or what
so relevancy of for uniqueness nothing
very unique about it just kind of coming
up with concepts and mashing them
together without trying to make them a
single uniform shape so you probably for
a three versatility again it's not going
to scale well and it also it does not
there's not good contrast so
unfortunately lower score on that end so
if you're watching this alessandra just
look through the higher rated entries
and see what they're doing right and it
takes time just to get good at this
stuff that's okay though all right so
let me take a break here all right
people are chatting I'm just looking
through this does a help sign all right
well I don't want to take too much time
reading the comments as I coming through
next person all right okay so the
biggest issue i'm looking at this right
here is the type it's just too childlike
it wouldn't be relevant so it suffers
definitely in the relevancy category
looking at this further not exactly sure
why the f is made in this lighter yellow
kind of mean it draws attention to it
but does the attention really
necessarily need to be drawn towards
this F right here you know what is the
significance of that I probably just
keep it the same color as the rest or
keep them all yellow looking at this I
definitely a rookie mistake was made
because I'm not sure if you can see on
your screen but there's a very soft
black drop shadow that's outlined the
entire thing never do that in logo
design just avoid it entirely trust me
it's something that's overused and it's
just added to try to give it a more you
know an extra effect but it takes away
from the most important elements of a
logo so don't do that I so get rid of
the drop shadow and looking at this I
you know I think it could have been
executed better I like the concept you
know what you were trying to reach for
and display you know the idea of having
a heart possibly with a chat box right
here I in this section and then trying
to illustrate the concept of a bot or
robot I with
circuitry so coming down here simplicity
I'll leave at five everything is pretty
simple maybe even a six relevancy pretty
relevant I'll leave that a six or put at
six and in uniqueness again if we look
at all the other entries so many people
have thought of you you know the
circuitry I so I'm not going to rate
that very high i'll leave that of as a
five versatility you added the drop
shadow I don't really like that
unfortunately um so we'll leave that may
be at a four and then color in contrast
I don't like what you know the color
that occurred right here so I'm going to
take that down maybe two three overall
not a horrible on tree but it could
definitely be improved by just making
some small adjustments okay moving on to
the next all right so looking at this
one definitely unnecessarily complex we
have issues with alignment I am white
space and complexity essentially
everything just kind of fit seems real
thrown together and it's hard to make a
distinction between the symbol itself
right here and the type so I would
separate these more I in terms of
simplicity and looking at the symbol
itself definitely it's pretty complex
you know we have a barbell here a lot of
people have been using a barbell concept
unfortunately I we have the bot we have
the eyes we have to stroke around the
eyes we have this sort of white outline
I'm not sure what that's supposed to be
right here and then we have the antenna
right here very complex even though it's
simple I mean it doesn't take a long
time to do it's very complex that's
probably the biggest thing people have
been the biggest mistake people have
been making on this i this this
challenge they're making everything
unnecessary unnecessarily complex with
the shapes you don't trust me stay away
from that um so because simplicity i'm
writing a to relevancy just purely
looking at relevancy
I health nutrition and associating that
with barbell it's not very close so I'm
going to rate this party of three I the
uniqueness again on the lower end of the
scale just because we've seen so many of
these entries already versatility I it's
not very versatile I'd with the logo
with the the symbol plus the word mark I
especially with the the the plates on
the barbell right here there's not much
separation with them it's going to get
blurry so it's not very versatile in
that sense because it doesn't scale well
I'll put four and then color and
contrast you know the colors clash right
here I hate when two colors meet like
this then when there are such opposing
colors right here and there higher in
contrast the stroke right here I don't
like that there's a lot of complexity
and even though there is just two colors
which is definitely a positive you got
that right you used green which is
commonly associated with health so you
got that right so I'm just going to
leave this out of five all right moving
on to the next one okay so this this
concept right here just aesthetically
speaking and design wise was really good
I this is definitely somebody who kind
of knows what they're doing more so than
the previous entries which is a good
thing looking at this and see if there's
any no explanation given that's fine
simplicity wise this is pretty simple do
one thing that they did very well is
they maintain a consistent stroke weight
across the whole thing everything is the
same stroke wait right here weight means
width basically I one issue I just
noticed right here is this kind of
sticks up but that's no big deal um the
type very consistent I everything's bold
the strokes are bold so you have a lot
of consistency in this design and it
makes it just appear and look better as
opposed to some of the other entries
before where there's everything seemed
dynamic in terms of stroke weight color
I orientate
alignment everything here the the white
space between this I container right
here is very consistent very
mathematical and it's pleasing to the
eye so there's a lot going right here I
we definitely see a bot of some sort we
see a robot I but I don't necessarily
see any indication of health I mean I
see the green looks like a brain I want
to assume it is but that doesn't really
say too much to me about health so this
is definitely to be rated higher so let
me go through the simplicity I will keep
this added seven relevancy that's going
to be the one area where this lacks I
think and that's going to be a for I
uniqueness definitely higher on the
uniqueness level versatility this would
probably scale pretty well everything's
done pretty well here so I'll keep that
up maybe around eight color and contrast
I really like the colors associated with
this so put that it as eight as well all
right i'll do a few more of these and
probably hop off here okay now this one
unfortunately we have some work to do I
looking at this one second I'm going to
pause yeah this is my backup alcohol
drink because I already drink this beer
here all right so I tried to combine
food and bought together in one design
okay that's what they said okay all
right so the biggest issue with this is
contrast in color sorry i was reading
the comments over here all right so
color in contrast if we look at flabby
down here it is so hard to read I mean
if you're comparing it to if this is
black versus white this this darker sort
of green over here clashes with the
orange right here definitely want to
avoid that you want more contrast
because this is very hard to see um
continue on on looking at this so
simplicity it is definitely more simple
although you know these are kind of
complex in terms of the the stripe
pattern right here the eyes here and the
antenna up here so i'll probably leave
this out of 5 for simplicity relevancy
I'm not sure if we would really it would
be smart to associate popcorn with
health and nutrition especially like
this type of pot looks like a movie
theater you know you're usually picking
out in a movie theater so maybe not too
relevant so I'm coming down here to four
um uniqueness I haven't seen anybody use
a popcorn concept but we have seen the
two eyes in the bot so not too relevant
I'll leave it at or the uniqueness i
mean i'll leave that at five versatility
I the size of this symbol is really
large in relation to the size of this
flabby down here so if you scale this
down quite a bit if you scale it down
too much the flower will not be seen
anymore or you know we will not be able
to read it so that's an issue so I'll
take this down to a four color and
contrast that's again this this you know
if you made just a small changes like
change this get rid of this gradient
make it white make the background white
and then change flabby to this darker
gray color and then the coloring
contrast would probably be more like a
six or seven but because of how its
presented has to be something lower like
a three thanks for the entry though all
right where am I at yeah something just
happened i was like screwed up all the
way unnecessarily there we go all right
I somebody just asked if i would rate
there's so i'm going to do a ctrl f for
your name
and i do not see it so if you asked me
to do yours let me know alright so I'll
just keep on going and then if they
respond i'll be able to resume i just do
a review of there's real quickly alright
alright so i've been running 24 minutes
32 people watching yeah not too bad
especially on a friday night ok I'll do
Joey and then onto yours ok alright so
flabby ok Joey Mason no comments left ok
this stuff one is definitely more
abstract and I like that I don't like
the color necessarily on this darker
gray background with this we're pretty
saturated green I but ignoring that just
looking at the symbol itself it is
definitely definitely more unique so
uniqueness I'm going to turn this up to
8 because I see what they've done
they've taken the F and flabby and this
is a common tactic tactic that technic a
tactic in logo design to create a symbol
out of the initial of the business name
and that's called a letter mark up here
a letter mark symbol I so they made the
F and they kind of made it look very
electronics last circuitry and I think
that works pretty well it could probably
be improved in some aspects it is kind
of complex with all the different shapes
here but I actually do like it I think
it would be it would be a lot better and
look a lot better if this was just you
know white background with black we
could really see it stand out more so
yeah I actually like this so simplicity
maybe a six relevancy we'll turn that up
seven uniqueness yeah definitely hi
it's very unique we haven't seen an
entry like this before yet it does make
sense and people remember you it's very
important for your looking to be unique
people remember things that are unique
so versatility I yeah it would get kind
of pixelated here between these two
areas so I probably just extend things
out you know make these eye circles to
hear these three circles further apart
from each other so you don't have this
tiny area right here I'll put that in a
six and then color and contrast I'll
leave it five good entry though and then
the next person let's see here we have a
my name is Pedro okay let me just do a
ctrl f on okay all right let me scale
this down a bit all right no comment
left but i am going to i'm going to just
completely annihilate you and just make
you feel horrible now i'm just kidding
all right so okay so looking at this my
initial thought is definitely simple so
in terms of simplicity you know you're
more on a six or seven I would say I the
relevancy I would say you have the Apple
here which people commonly associate
with being health related which is a
good thing I and then they bought thing
the only inference that you gave to the
bot or artificial intelligent aspect of
it are the three circles right here if a
person didn't 100% know exactly what
flabby was about and I chose a name
flabby just because it doesn't it's not
literal it's kind of a very abstract
name it could mean anything I if they
had so therefore a person who doesn't
know already about the company what it
means if they just looked at the logo
would they be able to even in an
abstract manner understand possibly
this company is about I probably not
kids listen being abstract is definitely
better than being literal when it comes
to your logo design like you know
sometimes I'll see local businesses for
example maybe like a plumber business
I'll see them you know they'll talk
about or I'll see the side of their van
and their logo is you know a plumber
tool it's so damn literal I especially
when it comes to other types of
businesses like a technology business
like this an artificial intelligence
company I it's great to see something
that's literal but if it becomes so or
abstract I'm sorry if it becomes so
abstract to the point at which you can't
make a connection at all then it's more
on the negative side so I love the
simplicity on it simplicity is probably
be a seven relevancy I'm going to leave
it a five uniqueness I this fact that
it's so abstract and does make it more
unique although we are using you know an
apple of sorts I'll leave that as six
versatility this would scale well this
is actually really good I you'd be able
to read the text on the size of the the
symbol I would probably prefer to be a
little bit smaller I i'll leave at a
seven and then color in contrast this
area is a little bit d saturated for my
taste I probably like to see a more
saturated red I be still nonetheless
nonetheless pretty good so I'll hit
judge there alright see if there's
anybody else here who wants a review
I don't see anybody else who requested
there's I'll just keep on going screw it
so I need to go back down to my last
rated one right there I'm going to do
one more this one and then I want to try
to find a better one so that I can show
you guys you know more of what's going
right as opposed to wrong so looking at
this all right this is my first attempt
at designing a logo all right well
that's great just popped his or her I'm
sorry I don't know how to pronounce this
i don't know this is a girl or guy
probably guy there there first logo
design cherry so okay so you can
definitely tell this this person
probably hasn't designed a logo before
or very many at least so simplicity this
is quite complex the typeface alone very
complex um it's kind of hard to read all
I see is flap I don't really see the eye
because we have this character coming on
top of it so I'm going to take this down
to like a two unfortunately relevancy
the I see the bars right here but that
those aren't necessarily you know robot
or artificial intelligence type of eyes
so that doesn't really speak to me at
all in that regard so we're gonna have
to take this down to 22 again uniqueness
again not very unique unfortunately it's
just some text on the line with a very
very overused symbol abstract symbol of
a human form which I understand a lot of
people associate this sort of you know
jumping character as me health you know
and all that stuff I but not very unique
unfortunately so we're going to take
this down to a three versatility not
very versatile because you know you've
taken this character right here the
symbol and you put them over on top of
this I and while you can see the
difference when they're two colors
sometimes
when it means to be versatile and you
need to be shown you can sometimes you
can only be shown in black or white so
if this is if everything was black on
this logo design here then this I and
this little human form becomes combined
so then it becomes like what is that
thing hanging off there because they're
all it's all black or whatever so it's
not very versatile in that regard so I'm
going to take it down to a three and
then color in contrast I mean if we're
looking at color and contrast alone
their day is actually high contrast here
we have a white background black text
and you know we have a pretty decent
usage of an orange here so the color
contrast I'll actually put up to seven
if we're looking at at that alone all
right so I'm going to hit judge I'm
going to look over here why did the F
logo get high relevant score all right
somebody asked why did the F logo get a
high relevant score well because it
might be hard to see if it's relevant or
not because it's very abstract so the F
right here of course has to do well
you're really right because this says
nothing about health at all is aside
from the coloreds people commonly
associate green sometimes with health or
red like the eye what's it called like
the Red Cross logo red associated with
health usually but green could be health
as well but aside from that there is no
inference of or hint of I of health here
so you're right I'm going to take that
back down more to like a four alright so
thank you for noting that it might be
because of this you know I'm not very on
my game right now okay so I'm just going
to come and look at this the chat area a
little bit more to see Oh what's up oh
yeah Bradbury it's been a while
talk before alright cool I'm going to do
one more and I'm going to try to find
again I haven't really gone through
these at all before doing this video try
to find maybe one net i think is done
has been done very well if not i know i
rated a few already that we're done
pretty you know they were higher up on
the scale like eighty to ninety percent
in their back here so i'm going to go
down here to page four we had some
pretty good initial entries yeah those
two were good no definitely not i'm
trying to think if there's anything this
one was pretty good as well not
extremely unique this one wasn't bad
alright so one of the 2i descent more
simple ones i'll choose this one right
here alright so this one I already rated
I but it's definitely more in line with
the type of concepts that I would
consider to be successful for this given
project I so you look at it immediately
very simple um you can tell that it's a
hamburger which means that there's an
inference of nutrition to it nutrition /
health I probably should have put by the
way in the requirements that i wanted it
to be an inference of just you know
robot / bot / artificial intelligence
plus not health but more nutrition
because this is supposed to be a
nutrition but that was my fault I
up I but you could definitely tell this
has to do with nutrition because it's a
hamburger right there and in terms of
simplicity definitely knocks out of the
park because now you could tell here in
the the hamburger portion between the
two buns you have I the eyes right here
of what you would commonly associate
with being a robot of some sort or bot I
it's in the you know the darker portion
looks like kind of like a head between
the two buns and so you can clearly see
these two ideas in a very simple
relevant shape I and that's ideal in my
opinion when it comes to load designs
and creating symbolism behind I certain
companies that focus on you know either
one or two different areas I in this
turn in this case it's a company called
flabby who does is it's a bot it's very
technology oriented and it provides
nutrition information and so that's what
I would consider successful and that's
the type of concept i want to see as
opposed to the ones that are very
complex and they make the common
mistakes and you know if you're new you
make those mistakes no matter what like
even if you're a really looking great
designer or you're very raw artistically
talented you when you're first starting
out it's still difficult to make good
logo designs usually and that's even for
some of the best people so it takes
practice let me switch over here to the
main screen or whatever but i'm just
looking at that here and want to make
sure there's anything else that I need
to give address here all right so yeah
38 minutes a live video is my very first
one I decided to do it because my wife
and kids were out of town or are out of
town rather and maybe i'll be doing more
of these I don't know I hopefully after
this video is uploaded the quality isn't
crappy because I don't know what the
quality looks like right now I set on my
vmix software which is what I'm used in
to do the live broadcasting the
resolution to be 720 so we'll see if
that's what you tube ends up uploading
it because it's going to upload this
YouTube this video after the fact
anyways so I'm rambling now so I just I
guess I'll just shut up no for any of
you who are interested in entering this
challenge is still going on for three or
four more day tents three days from now
I should probably put the actual date
you know my bad I but it gives you all
the information right here challenge
