design course calm today we're going to
be just announcing the 16th design
course calm design challenge and this
time we're going to focus on logo design
in the form of a letter mark and it's
going to be based on a fictional name
Iron Company idea I came up with I
called kill X which the letter mark of
this of course would be K X and it's a
fictional game based on the main
character who's a hit man so his
objective is to kill certain targets
thus x marks the spot alright so I the
objective here is you know do you design
a letter mark using the letters KX and
try to make it relevant and appropriate
given the description above so the
requirements of course are use the
letters KX I you can include kill X
along with it beneath it if you wish but
you don't have to you just kind of
feature them like these exams polls and
inspiration do about below here I like I
said keep it simple don't try to clutter
it with tons of effects like drop
shadows and gradients really you know
the emphasis should be on the folk the
form and the shapes so make a document
at least 500 x 500 pixels ensuring the
letter mark has a large amount of white
space between itself and the document
kind of like here so we could see I all
these examples here's the document and
then there's I the actual letter mark
don't make the letter mark your design
fit almost all the way to the full
extent of the 500 x 500 it just makes it
hard to see alright so and then finally
just submit your entry by Thursday I
Thanksgiving here in the US November
27th at 12 p.m. eastern standard time
and I also did a letter mark logo design
tutorial which you can find here and
that is it so make sure you check out
design course calm subscribe here if you
haven't and I'll see you in a week or
maybe less if I do it tutorial bit then
bad for that alright goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
