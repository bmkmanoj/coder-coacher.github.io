comm today we're going to look at site
stats for January alright so as many of
you know I have a new revitalized focus
on this channel and also the website
that's associated with this channel
course cetera comm for this year so at
the beginning of this month I started
focusing hardcore on writing content and
putting out videos as well and so what I
want to do now is at the end of every
month for at least the next few months
maybe more I'm going to do a quick recap
video of the website traffic and how
that has kind of correlated to what I've
been doing in terms of producing content
and other stuff all right so why am I
doing this well a lot of you are web
developers web designers you have your
own websites and I thought it might be
interesting for some of you to see what
I'm doing and how it affects the traffic
which ultimately the goal is to get more
traffic when you have a website all
right so I'm gonna switch over to the
screen and I'll show you some of the
stats all right so I this is a document
that I've prepared here in Photoshop and
it just has kind of basically was broken
down into several different categories
so I thought it'd be interesting just
for this videos to do an all traffic of
all time so this dates all the way back
to about the beginning of August I
launched a site in July but it had
basically nothing now one thing that's
screwing this view up is this massive
traffic spike right here this was around
December 12th and this is when I
released that video the Google home
trolling my kids video and it got linked
from Mirror 0uk I believe Daily Mail put
up the video
Mashable comm and I my whole point by
the way in doing that video was for this
to happen and not just necessarily the
traffic the traffic wasn't worth
anything they were just really coming
there just to look at the the video I
but the real reason I do it was to get
those websites to link to my website and
that's one of the cornerstones of search
engine optimization SEO is to get
other websites to link to you and so
this actually helped this that the fact
that I got this traffic here and really
the the links it helped get the growth
up here where is today now this is all
the way to basically present time
now we can see prior to that I did have
another traffic spike I forget what that
was from but you can see is really low
but now it is climbed up there quite a
bit
so by the way these are sessions not
necessarily unique visitors or users a
session is basically somebody can come
by I and do certain things on the site
visit some pages and then come back
maybe the same day or next week or next
month or whatever and that's counted as
multiple sessions so I'm going to come
down here and this is going to be the
January overall compared to December so
I'm just comparing these top three
values right here and what this is is I
this is from January 1st to the 30th so
I'm not even including 31st which is
today but I sessions here 25,000 13 8
and 9 now in December from December 1st
to the 31st
it was fourteen thousand seven and sixty
six so I have a 71 percent increase
which is huge
users 56 percent increase so fifteen
thousand from nine or basically ten
thousand and then also a 42% increase in
pageviews so I went from about fifty
thousand page views to seventy-one
thousand which is huge now this stuff
down here pages per session that's kind
of a no-brainer right there how long
people average are staying on the site
and then bounce rate you want this to be
lower simply means how many people are
leaving the site after visiting a single
page so I the goal of any developer
who's who's good or wet bastard I should
say is to get this number down and
there's a lot of things you can do to
try to do that so I'll be focusing on
that quite a bit coming down here now
this is the main screen that I have been
focused on this entire month and this is
Google traffic and so people go to
Google they type in us
search term for neo in our case it's
going to be something like angular or
ionic or something like that
to solve some sort of problem or find a
tutorial or our course and they end up
on my site so trying to rank high is the
name of the game so for Jeremy first two
xxx I this right here is just a Tuesday
so I think it was January 3rd
had 165 not very much but then right
around the 8th is one I started
releasing the first tutorial the written
tutorial as well as the video tutorial
and we could see as I started about
every three days every released new one
in total I probably wrote around 12,000
words and recorded about two and a half
to three hours of content that I
uploaded to YouTube and we can see all
the way till yesterday which is a
Tuesday I'm at 472 so 186 percent growth
which is absolutely huge I'm it may be
difficult to keep this type of growth up
but probably not and it may actually
exceed this quite a while as long as I
keep consistent with writing the content
doing the video tutorials as well as
trying to find I and really it hasn't
been hard to try to get backlinks
basically all I've been doing is
submitting this to relevant reddit pages
I as well as sometimes I'll submit it to
hacker news if it's a particularly
interesting sort of article and really
that's all I've been doing and slowly
but surely will see that the Google
eventually starts ranking me for these
terms and so the more content I have
again it's like around 12,000 words the
more I'm able to rank for thousands of
different keywords that are contained in
those article content basically alright
so the major takeaway from that was the
hundred eighty-six percent growth from
Google traffic so at the end of February
next month which starts tomorrow I'm so
glad because spring is coming I'll do
another one of these videos and we'll
see how my efforts in terms of producing
content trying to get it out there have
paid off I don't want to make a
prediction but it's definitely going to
be quite
a bit higher I think especially because
yesterday I already a couple days ago
rather I put out the aelion's to
messenger clone app video and I also put
it up as a page on corsetry comm Popular
Mechanics comm linked to that I didn't
mean hit them up all I did was submitted
to a couple Redditt as well as I was a
hacker news or something
it didn't really even blow up there it
didn't do very good on any of those but
somehow somebody from Popular Mechanics
found it and they put an article about
it and they link to my site that I
didn't even talk to them they just did
it which is awesome and that's going to
pay huge dividends in terms of the
impact that it has because Google thinks
to itself Wow Popular Mechanics comm is
linking to corsetry com maybe we should
start trusting it more and ranking its
associated terms that it finds inside of
my key work or my articles a little bit
higher up in the positions in relation
to the other results so alright we'll
see how it goes in a couple days I'll be
doing another tutorial whether it be
ionic or angular I'm not sure yet but
I'll see you then alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
