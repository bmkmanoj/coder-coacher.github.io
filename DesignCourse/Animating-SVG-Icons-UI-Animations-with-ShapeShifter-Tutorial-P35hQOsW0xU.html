do that or how about this one
or how about I don't know morphing
Hannibal's into each other
hey everyone Gary Simon of course zetro
so today we're going to take a look at
designing a custom SVG icon and then
importing it into a 100% free web-based
tool called shapeshifter dot design
which is the actual URL which will allow
us to animate it and export it as an SVG
that we can then use in HTML and CSS to
control the animation and determine when
it starts and plays and all that cool
stuff
all right so make sure you subscribe
here if you haven't yet on the YouTube
channel and also check out corset row
comm let's get started all right so to
get started you want to visit
shapeshifter dot design and I the very
first thing you need just to actually
import something so you do that under
import and then a vector per table
drawable or SVG we're gonna use SVG and
that means we're gonna have to use a
design app of some sort something that's
capable of SVG vector graphics so I'm
just going to use Adobe Illustrator
though you could use anything else that
gives you a pen tool and allows you to
export SVG files and so just to get a
you know I need an idea of what we want
to do something that can be helpful is
to check out material do four slash
icons and you could do a search here for
a specific icon if you want like I don't
know chat or something like that or you
could just browse these for you know a
million different ideas and so I my idea
was to take this something very similar
to this chat bubble outline and kind of
go from this to this and then to this
alright so I showed you at the beginning
of this video the one that we are doing
and so just to demonstrate this again
that's what we want to achieve
so I'm not going to actually use these
because these aren't actual Strokes
these are kind of paths that have
already been expanded and so you
wouldn't want to use those if you if
you're trying to achieve this particular
effect so what we want to do is I'm
going to open up illustrator and by the
way before we get there just to show you
real quickly get back here this is based
on 24 by 24 pixel grid okay so we're
gonna set our document up to match that
so we have pixels selected here so
there's going to be 24 by 24 right okay
so let's I toggle our layers right here
alright so the first thing I'll do is to
create the just the rounded rectangle if
we just left-click once we can just
choose something like 20 by 20 quarter
radius we can change that as needed
obviously 12 is way too much so I'm
going out to here to around 2 and we're
gonna move this into place alright and
then we're going to drag this up just a
bit and then we're just going to modify
this to have this little kind of
triangle section down here so zoom up
here and by the way this is only a
one-point fill we're gonna make it -
there we go and now we can see with the
direct selection tool selected here we
have our two anchor points we're gonna
need to add another one and sometimes
this is a matter of just playing around
with things to get the desired look so
pen tool I'm going to put one right here
to add an anchor point and then I'm
going to take the direct selection tool
select both of these hold shift and go
down alright maybe right around there
and
then I'm going to take this one and just
delete it
bring this down holding shift and then
take the pen tool and then hover over
this one right here and left click and
then we'll combine those and we'll push
this over with the direct selection tool
so just take only this Anchor Point
hold shift move it over and we'll select
everything these bottom four anchor
points use the keyboard up arrow key and
make sure it sits in there nicely yeah
right around there actually I want to go
a little bit higher alright so we're at
20 by 18 I might want to get this in a
little bit guy will make it 18 here by
16 that we have we have a lot of padding
and room to work with here alright so
that looks good to me and this is going
to be the starting point for us and it's
going to be the first SVG file that we
import into shapeshifter
so if you go to file save as you save it
somewhere we'll call this one we'll just
call this outline chat and then we'll
save as SVG right here so we get save
and this little blip will come up and
make your settings match here and then
just hit OK alright so now we'll go back
to shape shifter we'll go to file and
nope rather import SVG and we're gonna
go to file outline - chat there it is
perfectly set in and ready to rock
alright so we can notice that we have a
timeline down here we kind of have an
area where we have our layers and you
can group things up and you can create
clipping masks and all that stuff we'll
get to shortly and then properties are
over here based on what you select in
the timeline
and that's pretty much it for the most
part although there are some other
sections that we'll take a look at so
you can notice we can select this actual
the outline here and it gives us all the
data that's associated with it like the
path data it gives you the fill color
you can change all this stuff by the way
and that's what's really cool it allows
you to animate a lot of different of
these properties and actually if you
click on this animate this layer then
these are everything these are all the
properties that you can actually animate
so like trim path end and start for
instance if we put this to zero
well it's no longer there it's invisible
and that's how you can begin to animate
some of these things so for instance
I'll just show you
I've click on our path and we animate
the trim path end and we put from value
0 to value 1 and by the way this is your
timeline you could drag this and you see
how it effects it shows the end time so
you can just put that you can specify
here or just drag it over here but if
you hit play look at that let me just
deselect that now you can notice it's
really fast it's probably showing up a
little bit jagged because I'm not using
a high FPS for this video but it says
animation is 300 milliseconds if you
click on that you can change that right
here so we'll change it to one second
but just note the longer the animation
is also based on whether you're not
you're going to use the 30 FPS version
or the 60 which we'll get to later it
will increase the file size quite a bit
so let's see here we're back here and
this is currently 279 milliseconds you
know if you want to change that to half
a second you'll see that it'll go a
little bit slower but that looks slick
already so you can create these kind of
cool outlines and obviously very easily
and and fast but we're not going to do
that so just delete one we just select
down here in the timeline just
delete it go back to our path and change
this back to one and we're right back
where we started when we imported it
okay so now what we want to do is we
want to go from this to this and we can
kind of you could do it a lot of ways
really but we're going to basically
create kind of like a wave effect that
rises and this is based on one of their
demos that they had if you go to file
demo and then choose the heart break one
I think it was called you'll see
basically we're going to do the same
thing so it's gonna kind of fill up I
all the way so how would we do that well
let's go back to illustrator and I'm
going to take our pen tool and I'm going
to just click right around here and left
click and drag out a bezzie a and two
right there and then I'm just going to
come down it doesn't really matter
exactly where I'm at
yet but I'm just holding shift and I'm
connecting everything up now this one
will not have a stroke so we're just
going to hit zero there and it's going
to have a black fill all right so the
starting point of this animation is
actually going to be outside of the
chaplet alright and it's going to be
we'll just say it's down here actually
we'll squash it further all right so
it's gonna be real small like that now
if we go back to our layers and you go
to window layers by the way and we come
over here what I want to do now is just
delete this the original path and then
I'm going to go to file save as and for
now I'm just gonna make it anything
because I'm not actually going to save
this actually yes I am we're just gonna
call this fill and I'm gonna hit save
and by the way notice this SVG code if
we click this it will pop up a text
editor here where it shows you the code
associated with this so the important
part right here is this right here this
path D equals
these are all the coordinates that
really make up the shape so we're gonna
be referring to this in a second so just
note that and save this so now we can go
back and we're going to import an SVG
and then our fill looks like crap
doesn't it so that's expected though
what we want to do now is import a path
here the same path from before so our
outline chat and we're going to by the
way it's it's called by the way can I
rename this well probably can I'm just
being slow at the moment file yeah I
what we can do is up here for this path
too which is this one right here the
copy we click on this more options there
and then convert to clip path all right
so now anything after it I will only
show up in this area all right so now
what we can do is we can animate this
right here to grow essentially and we
can change the path data property so
what we'll do is take this I little icon
right there and we'll choose path data
so you're gonna go from a from value we
can see the whole thing right there from
here which is the initial to something
else so how do we change that well we'll
go back to our Adobe Illustrator back up
here control Z and then I'm just going
to drag this up oops
up to here above just so that it will
fully cover everything alright so now we
can delete this file
we'll save as will overwrite it it
doesn't matter but we're not and I'm not
actually going to save it just hit yes
here and then we can get our SVG code
copy the path D property get out of
there and hit cancel
we just back up a few times here and
then go back and then paste this in here
alright so it looks a little bit silly
right now but if we find our path data
where we're at here okay it's not
showing up showing up all the way over
here there you go if that happens just
use I if you're using Chrome hit ctrl
and your scroll will scroll wheel to
change the zoom settings so you can see
everything this needs to be at the
beginning so we're gonna drag that so
now we hit play now let's look at it
without that selected all right and
that's how you would do that okay so
let's make that a little bit further all
right cool so now let's do the actual
lines and just to simulate with that I'm
gonna go ahead and just die yeah we can
hide that and then for the lines let's
go ahead and fill this with a black so
that we can actually see what's
happening all right
stroke we can just we need that now for
the lines we'll go ahead and use the
line tool just coming out from the very
left holding shift and we'll make our
first line you know something right
around there make it a two point fill of
white oops not a fill we don't want to
fill all right so this needs to be white
okay
and you just want to get a setup you can
use the direct selection tool to take
the anchor points and position it where
you want it to be and then once you have
that done we can go ahead and duplicate
that so ctrl c ctrl F move it down with
your keyboard arrow keys and we'll take
the direct selection tool move this in
with our keyboard arrow keys maybe one
two yeah just twice and then replicate
that process one more time control C
control F move it down now this is too
much distance between these so I'm just
going I'm only going to make it one so
move this up one and then this up one
take our there we go alright so now
we're gonna go ahead to our layers here
and I'm going to delete this one here
and as well as this one and I'm also
going to just temporarily delete the
very bottom and middle and I'm going to
save this
all right so ctrl shift + s to save and
we're gonna call this here line 1 and
the reason I deleted those is because an
SVG code it will include that stuff what
you just don't need so we'll save that
and then we'll back up and then just
back up twice the other ones that I want
to delete so the first one that I kept
would be this one so we can delete that
delete this and this will give us the
middle one so I'll save that as line two
and then we'll back up and then delete
these two there may be a better way if
there's a better way of doing this let
me know in the comments all right so now
we have everything we just backup to get
everything that we start up start it up
with I started out with other and then
now we can import those three files so
if we import SVG line one two
three all right so right now they're
hidden because it's showing up after I
the what he call the clip that we have
so if I select them you'll see that I
accidentally exported the wrong one so
I'm just gonna go back and fix that real
quick um this is the one that we want so
I'll go ahead and just delete all this
this one that's hidden alright so this
is actually line three
yep and save sorry about that import
line three all right so now we select
these there we go all right so I'm going
to take these here and I'm gonna move
them up here each one needs move
separately apparently all right so now
they're going to show up over and if I
screw out here just a bit what we want
to do rather is take our path right here
or a clip in this shape and let's hit
ctrl G to group those so now I believe
we can take all those three and then it
won't be affected by that path I thought
you had to move it up but if you just
group them up there we go
but we don't want these right here right
so we don't want these to be show to
show up at the very beginning instead
what we can do is animate the trim path
end portion right here so we'll take the
we'll take each three of these so the
first one here let's move this up so
this is the first second and third so
path three we're gonna take that and
path end will be 0 this one as well
would be 0 and then this one will be 0
as well
okay and then the point at which we want
them to show up which is right around
perhaps right here we can I'll take this
first one we're going to animate the
trim path end from zero to one all right
and pull this out a bit so there we go
so if we hit play cool that's pretty
good to me
and we'll do the same thing so take this
one for path for trim path end zero to
one drag this over here and you could
stagger the animation if you want all
right and then finally same thing for
the last one
all right so we'll drag this over yeah
might as well take each one of these and
drag them out a little bit more all
right so let's it play awesome so now
what we can do is export it so you go to
export by the way you can save these and
they're they're custom files for a shape
shifter so you can save them to your
computer and edit them whenever you want
later on and now we can just export
these as either just SVG vector drawable
animated vector drawable and you know
these are some of these are specific to
you know actual mobile apps formats but
SVG sprite sheet will actually export an
HTML and CSS file with animation along
with a SVG file that will contain all of
the frames essentially so if we do that
it'll download a zip automatically and
if we open that up let me it's off
screen let me drag this over here for a
second all right you'll see we have a
30fps version and a 60 so obviously the
60 would be smoother but larger and file
size so you can see 89 Kb there may be a
way to drastically reduce that by the
way so I would look into that and then
what we can do is just double click on
the HTML and we can see it right here so
now you can see by default it doesn't
stay there but that's based on CSS
properties that you can actually modify
yourself
so let's do that real quickly I'm going
to take those three files that are
inside of the zip file that just
downloaded that them and then put them
into a new folder all right it just
paste them here and a new folder right
here that I will open up in a code
editor and here we are alright so I'm
using Visual Studio code by the way we
check out the HTML all this is is just a
with a class of shapeshifter and play
and a background image set to the SVG
all right so the SVG file of course is
massive so you definitely want to take
into consideration when you're creating
these and if there's something you know
if you're working with a project where
speed is important so do what really
makes this tick though is this sprite
the CSS file basically so it's very
simple we have an animation up here
called play 60 and it basically just
changes the background position on this
play right here so this play class
simply adds the animation name which is
what makes the animation play so if you
wanted to make this something clickable
or you wanted to be able to control when
the animation begins based on you know
JavaScript or some event then you could
do that of course with JavaScript so
just to show you how that would be done
real quickly we can go to our HTML and
hit control B to get rid of that sidebar
and we'll come down here after the div
and we'll put in script and we'll just
use vanilla JavaScript for this just
basic plain JavaScript get element by ID
and we're going to give it an idea
called button and then add event
listener on click function all right
inside of here will simply say this dot
class list and we're going to add a
class called play so that means by
default we're going to remove this from
the class and then also give an ID of
button all right so we'll save that I'm
not done yet I've to go to our CSS file
and let's just I add a couple rule sets
here
padding-top 30 pixels let's see here I
want to get this centered up for us
margin Auto and also let's make it so
that it doesn't reset the animation so
animation film mode will be forwards and
that makes it so that the animation once
it gets to the last frame it won't reset
itself alright and so it's me
cursor:pointer or as well alright and I
think that would be good so now if I
just right-click and reveal an explorer
and double click on it and also zoom up
my browser so we can see this much more
like 500% click on it and there we go
awesome stuff I so really I've only just
scratched the surface of this
shapeshifter tool there are other
possibilities that where you can
actually modify the shapes and it'll
more from two different shapes
themselves and that's something that
will took it take a look at in another
lesson alright so hopefully you found
that useful and if there are areas that
are cuve improved let me know in the
comments but otherwise give it a like
and make sure you subscribe and I will
see you guys soon all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
