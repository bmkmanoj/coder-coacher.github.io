calm today we're going to finish up the
USB stick and blender tutorial video and
if you need access to the project files
again they're available for free at
design course calm and if you haven't
yet subscribe here on YouTube alright
let's get started alright so now we're
going to get into creating an actual
realistic material this right here just
doesn't do it justice I so what we're
going to do is go into the node editor
so left click and drag up here and i'm
going to change this viewport to the
node editor if we zoom up we can see
this is just a representation of what we
did over here so it has the diffuse and
so we're going to get this is going to
be kind of a more complex type of node
or material but don't worry just follow
along and you'll see how it kind of
works so what we'll do is sever that
connection so hold control left click
and just get rid of that and we want to
add a mixed a shader so hit shift a
shader and mix shader put that right
here and we'll connect this over there
and then this top shader will go over
here alright so now what we want to do
for the second share is going to be a
glossy so we'll go to shift a shader and
glossy and that will go right there
alright so we also want to add what's
called a layer weight so I have to
remember where that is at it's like one
of these crazy ones down here or not
here we are it's up there of course
alright i'm going to add that right here
and we're going to connect the facing to
the fac and we're going to change this
real quickly 2.15 and real quick on the
switch just to rendered just so we can
see what's kind of happening so far all
right so if we discover that connection
we can see what it looked like before
and then after and we want to change the
colors here I for the glossy we're going
to make this a light gray right around
there all right and then I want to add
what's called a color ramp you connect
it to the diffuse so we'll hit shift a
converter and color ramp there it is
we'll stick that just around here put
this over here you can see how things
have kind of changed quite a bit and
what we want to do is to move this over
here right around there and for this
color kind of just push it up a little
bit all right and then what I want to do
is add a bump texture and attach that to
our other nodes real quick so it's shift
a vector bump and it's going to get
added to the normal right there and then
the normal down here alright and we'll
go ahead and then we want to add what's
called I think of roni texture so shift
a texture and Verona right there and
we're going to take the fac and put it
right there and then also put it on
haight so you can see like
like is real interesting look and look
but we need to take that scale and
really push it up I quite a bit I'm
going to try to 50 all right and then
finally we want to add one more note
shift a and we want to add a I can find
it here input texture coordinate take
this over here and connect it just the
object all right so now we have
something that I seems to emulate now
you try 350 real quick alright cool
alright so now at this point you know we
have the textures and everything pretty
accurate and I now we need to add the
actual decal so what we'll need to do is
UV unwrapped justice top portion so what
we'll do is go into edit mode first
we'll change this to solid hit tab with
that selected we're going to come up
here we're going to switch to vertex
mode so we will just take one of these
points that's along this inner path a
very most inner path and then alt and
right click then what we want to do is
hit 7 on our number pad so we can go to
the top view and we'll change this view
down here to the uv/image editor we're
going to hit new and we're going to
change the 1024 by twice so 2048 2048
hit OK zoom I here with the escrow wheel
and I'm going to hit you and project
from view to UV unwrap it so we'll hit s
to scale it up all right right around
there as good and then we're going to go
ahead and save that so go to you vs
export UV that layout which are just
done and make sure that when you come
down here you change you make sure all
UV czar
SF I'd and Phillip asset ease around
twenty-five percent so hit export UV
layout all right and then what you need
to do is open out in Photoshop alright
so I've opened that up in photoshop now
our PNG file and what we're going to do
real quick and get a control shift end
for a new layer hit enter drag that down
below the UV layer and we'll choose like
a a darker color for the background just
so we can see this there are you v's and
then what we want to do is open up the
project file for a logo you don't have
to use mind you can put anything you
want in here but I've included in the
project files of design course calm for
this specific tutorial and I have open
here so ctrl a ctrl C once you open that
up and then come at the top ctrl-v to
paste that in then ctrl t hold shift alt
+ left click and drag down I know though
as fast but I'm trying to move quick
here so I left click and use the Move
tool then we'll want to make it white so
double click the right side of the layer
and we'll make color overlay and then
change the color to white ok and ok and
I'm just going to leave it like that you
could probably do a lot more anything
else you want to do you can do so and
maybe i will add some text real quick
how do we know what I'm going to add so
awesome design stuff that's what I put
take my move tool and shift make it
white and maybe like right around there
whatever you know alright so now we want
to hide by these two layers so basically
it's going to be a transparent PNG so go
ahead and file you can save for web if
you wish P&amp;amp;G 24 transparency make sure
that's accurate and then save it I'm
going to go to recent places well no not
that one there we go I'm going to just
call this diffuse
and save that and then now what we're
going to do is go back to our node
editor all right so we have to make a
quick adjustment for this portion I'm
going to go over here and switch
surrendered and for the diffuse I'm
going to move this over I'm going to
sever that connection I'm going to shift
a text your image texture and connect
that to the color portion obviously
there's no texture here so it's blank
going to hit open choose diffuse and
there we go now if you wanted to adjust
the scale of this what you can do is
switch back here to the node no to the
uv/image editor and if you scale hit s
that'll get a little bit bigger but you
don't want to do it too much I'm just
going to hit actually that's kind of
distorted right there I could see okay
so i had to play around with this to
figure out what the issue was you get
weird issues like that when you i just
take a part of a mesh and then try to UV
unwrap it without doing anything else to
the texture so what I had to do is
simply we're right now if hits solid
we're I'm going to go back to edit mode
and what you need to do is just hit a
and then a again to select all hit 7 on
your number pad and then hit you and
then project from view and then take
this back up here go to rendered hit s
to scale g-scale more get this correct
and now everything is correct there's no
distortions in the text or anything
alright cool so now I let me go ahead
and switch I'm going to get rid of this
all right click and hit join area down
alright and then if you want to do a
render of this
you can hit zero on your number pad you
can see whatever the cameras looking at
I'm going to hit n for properties up
here lock camera to view hit and again
to hide it and that way we can just set
up a basic scene right here they can
render so we'll go over our renters tab
or settings and we're going to change
here i'm going to change the x and y to
1280 by 720 that's the video dimensions
i do this so for the preview this is
what you see and we also want to shake
take fifty to a hundred that way it
doesn't do half of those alright and let
me come down here just last check
renders at 100 I mean 1000 and that
should be good to go real cool if you do
this you can kind of like invert things
but I'm not going to mess with that I
yeah so then we all you have to do to
get going to render is just hit render
so I'm going to do that oh wait wait
wait wait I'm going to hit escape twice
to stop that real quickly I'm going to
change performance for the x and y 0 the
tiles to 256 and you could do this if
you have a GPU and you're using GPU
compute now I hit render and I'm going
to pause the video because this may take
a little bit of time and there it is
alright so that's basically the end of
the course you know we could have
probably done a little bit more with
this USB I think I I there they have
more detail than this but that's not
really worth messing around with but
anyhow yeah that is it so I check out
design course calm if you haven't yet
and subscribe here on YouTube all right
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
