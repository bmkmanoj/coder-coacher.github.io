last place during the 50-yard dash in
first grade because you're so chubby
well I'd hate to give you flashbacks but
guess what design challenges are back
hello Gary Simon here of course etro
calm and no honestly I don't know if you
were chubby or not don't take offense if
you were but in this video we're
announcing and launching the very first
contest or design challenge at corsetry
calm and also going to run over how the
rating system and all that stuff works
so what I want to do is switch over to
the desktop and show you where these new
design challenges can be found so
currently i'm just going to have one
challenge per week and this one is right
here design a logo for an artificial
intelligent company called flabby now in
six days from now just one entry which
is a one that i'm going to
delete and then there is a prize
guaranteed and in the future underneath
this challenge right here are going to
be the older inactive one so you can
still check take a look at them alright
so clicking on this it's going to give
us more information this is going to be
the video i'm currently recording and
over here we have the challenge
description prizes design requirements
and inspiration that's relevant to the
contest down here we have the entries
this of course is a boob has nothing to
do with this one I'm going to delete it
you're not going to see it on this page
because it's all but it's just
there so I can describe this stuff in a
second but first I wanted to introduce
the first challenge right here so the
challenge description for our first
challenge is I let's see here you're
tasked with designing a logo for an AI
artificial intelligence company called
flatty so this AI company has created a
chat bot and I've linked this by the way
so you can learn more about chat bots
are going to becoming very popular on
the internets shortly and it gives users
in nutritional information on demand
through chat applications such as
facebook messenger
slack skype etc so a user might say how
many calories are in the DOTA and then
this chat bot will automatically respond
with the answer in seconds simple enough
so the design requirements are you must
include the word mark flabby in the logo
design there must be a separate symbol
in the logo so this is called a
combination mark if you're unfamiliar
about all these different terms and it
must depict two concepts in a unique in
abstract manner in a single symbol and
so those two concepts that you need to
illustrate in that single symbol are
artificial intelligence or BOTS of some
sort with the idea of health and fitness
so make it simple and avoid unnecessary
clutter it must be made with a true
vector application such as Adobe
Illustrator and upload a large enough
previous so that we can see it easily
and that is it those are all the
requirements so the inspiration down
here are just examples of logo designs
that I thought kind of fit the
description kind of well on their own
merit they're simple they're effective
they combine two ideas into one sort of
symbol and you can just use this for
inspiration in terms of what I'm looking
for now the entries will be listed down
here and right here is the rating system
so initially when you submit in entry
there's not going to be any type of
writing it's just going to say no rating
yet or something i forget what i coded
us but once i have time i will get
around to rating it based on these five
different criteria simplicity relevancy
uniqueness versatility and color and
contrast so these are sort of I just
five core design principles that are
applicable to almost any type of design
so we're not always going to do logo
design we're going to do different
things I but these still apply to them
and they really are a good measure of
the effectiveness of a given design so
if you have questions about this
specifically here you can click on learn
more about ratings and it will show you
a little bit more information elaborate
it also elaborates on this percentage
right here like what does that mean well
this is in relation to the
five scores right here which are judged
from one to ten and so a 10 of course
being the best and this percentage adds
these up and then compares it to a
percentage based on a possible a maximum
50 points so if you got all tens you got
50 points you'll be a hundred percent if
you got an average of five they say 25
you'll be fifty percent now if you go
lower than fifty percent this will be
red meaning you kind of failed if it's
51-percent or fifty percent in higher
it's green meaning you did a pretty good
job so your goal should always to try to
be to get to this green mark of somehow
okay so for this contest as well the
winner will receive fifty dollars paypal
better than nothing right and free
access to our Android design and
development course bucket drops which
we've launched about I don't know eight
months ago and that is it so just come
here you have to have an account it's
free I create account is very simple and
easy and then just get to designing you
have six days and six days from now and
submit it it's very very very simple and
these were quite popular back when I was
running through design course calm and I
hope they'll even be more popular now if
you're terrible at logo design don't
prevent that or stop that stop you from
submitting an actual design that's how
we get better so who cares if it looks
like garbage and who cares if you only
get maybe like three percent not a big
deal take it better alright so that is
it I'm looking forward to your entries
and I'll see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
