and go through this really quickly I
have to think it may be a different
system for this in the future if I start
getting more anyhow so looking at this
I'm the very first entry there's a few
kind of big issues with this I the first
issue we have is the right off the bat
the the call to action it does not stand
out enough at all the call to action
should always be of a contrasting color
that's kind of set apart from the
different from the other colors and but
also complements well at the existing
color theme or color scheme rather and
then looking at everything else it all
the type and such is too small so it's
kind of hard to read so I would
definitely improve those aspects of it
and we have a couple of other entries
are pretty good that will I kind of
illustrate what I'm talking about a
little bit better so that those were the
major issues that would focus also white
space there's a lack of white space
everything's very condensed it looks
like this was designed for you know a
very small resolution or like a phone or
a tablet almost all right so thanks for
the entry though all right looking at
this one um see here okay the biggest
issue here I think I is issues with the
alignment for instance we have you know
these two blips of text right here or
write a line to this portion right here
and then we have this portion that's
centered and then we have this width of
the the input you know email address
right here it can extends up to this
size and then this semi my coupon is
like another different angle everything
is just kind of there's not a lot of
structure to it in terms of the layout
itself so that's probably my biggest
concern with this one another concern
here is the enter your email address
it's kind of very small and hidden
almost I would really make that quite a
bit larger just because that's something
that you
people are expected to click in two or
more ideally the text is already there
but you know this that's one of the main
areas that are going to be focusing
aside from the call to action you know
once they actually click it so let me
close that lurk there and so yeah that's
why I would try to stick with more
structure with this also I'm not exactly
sure what's happening here on the sides
either it's kind of hard to tell like if
it with such a small resolution like
this I almost want to be able to you
know maximize it in a browser and kind
of see what you were aiming for but
anyhow that's uh thanks for that
submission alright so let's see water is
better with flow okay so this this as
well has alignment issues you know we
have this over here this text is it the
text itself is centered would you know
what is water is better with flow but
it's also right aligned and that throws
everything off you know there should be
if you're going to have the text at
center like this which is fine you
better have it centered within the
parent container as well not pushed over
here to the right same thing with this
this is centered text but it's push it
over to the left there's no there's no
flow here you know no pun intended I so
really if you're going to center the
text elements you should set under them
well within a parent container secondly
you know the what's your email I in fact
that there's no padding between the text
itself and the container that's a big no
I just because whenever you have text
that's inside of an input container you
definitely want to have more padding or
white space as it's called the way you
do that with CSS is just that by adding
padding like 10 PX or something because
otherwise it gets smashed up against to
the border and just not look good
unfortunately so those are the main
issues I would focus on if I were you ok
next one ok so the alignment with this
one is definitely better than the
previous two so if you guys are still
watching this is better alignment you
know if this this is centered this is
centered I the one big issue though is
I the call to action is way too small so
you have the email here and I could see
you put email address but it's so it's
so hidden yeah I could barely even see
it so you definitely want to make that
stick out more as placeholder text and
then the send me my coupon you know that
their call to action it's still way to
smell small I would try to place much
more emphasis on this and also kind of
get sated because you use the same blue
as this water blue here I do like the
water itself that's a good take on it
and then secondly this also kind of gets
hidden as well just because the font
side is pretty small and it's oh it just
seems it's kind of hard to focus on just
because of all the different little
water droplets I yeah it's just for me
it's kind of hard to see down there
definitely increase the size of this and
probably even get rid of this container
as well I and probably along with it
increasing the size of everything else I
think the size is kind of the biggest
issue with this one here other than that
I I do like it everything else is going
good for it all right so look in here at
skali alright so a lot of issues with
this first of all the whole emboss the
stroke you know the look slike there's a
slight maybe inner shadow definitely get
rid of that it looks too old school
looks like the late 90s design want to
get away from that for sure once you fix
that issue I it seems like there's not
enough structure in terms of or there's
not enough I would say this is called
visual higher hierarchy you have the
call to action right here and it seems
almost like a secondary thought as
opposed to you know this large
filtration system on this text down here
what i would do ideally is move you know
the water is better with flow up here
prominently make it much larger than it
is along with the receiver fifteen
percent off coupon underneath it then
the call to action and then the picture
and such this stuff down here would be
underneath it
ideally all right but I think the
biggest issue that's throwing off is
graphically I way too much use of
effects here we've gotten away from that
in terms of design so definitely stay
away from that thanks for the entry
though all right aurion let's see here
okay um there's a contrast issue with
this I the receive a then the coupon by
you know the blue part that it conflicts
way too much for with this I the water
you know the ocean background the beach
so that's definitely an issue right
there arm now looking coming down here
the color there's contrast issues as
well with with this you know this is
this gray background here for the input
and enter your email and also the kind
of the aqua outline those color kind of
clash and this is a little bit too hard
to reason of contrast there you didn't
do too bad of a job though for the call
to action button because that's big and
it does definitely stand out um but yeah
this portion right here and then this
tagline or the subheading right here
that's what I would focus on improving
right here so thanks for that entry
alright digital art okay looking at this
you know what like a copy image URL make
sure I'm viewing everything as big as
they should be hopefully that was an
issue with the previous ones i was
reviewing so looking at this I yeah the
I would say the biggest issue would be
this text probably should be a bit
bigger and it should probably stand out
more and there's not a lot of contrast
you can still read it but it still just
doesn't really stick out like it should
I orly I feel it should secondly there's
an unnecessary amount of white space
right here especially when you have this
text right here all pushed up this close
so there's a there's an inconsistency in
terms of the white space distribution I
guess you could call it they're
receiving fifteen percent
off coupon that doesn't stick out enough
and then the call to action button copy
you know you don't want to make these
the same colors both white I because you
want a big you want a good distinction
between you know where you click and
then you know where you enter the data
and then when you actually click because
they kind of just both get lost in a
sense so you always want your call to
action button whatever they're clicking
to stick out the most alright so thanks
for that entry let's just go down here
ok so now let's see her ok so this is
the ladies mentioned scale down by fifty
percent so you get here this isn't bad
this this isn't bad I this isn't bad to
look too bad either um this portion it's
too small though definitely like how
you're trying to do something unique
with that I price stay away from that in
this day and age you really don't see
anything you know this unique trying to
you know combine these two but I think
the biggest issue is it doesn't stink
there's not enough contrast with this
button copy so you have the background
which has these blues and this is blue
as well and so it gets hidden so I would
definitely work on remedying that issue
that's the biggest issue with this one
let's see here then other than that I
probably would have gotten rid of any I
would have gotten rid of the bottom of
this glass here and then you would make
this black or like a dark gray or
something I'm oh yeah good an intrigue
aside from that alright john h ok this
is let me hit copy not copy image copy
image URL ok
definitely a very cool sort of image
right here um definitely I like the
layout of this but I think there
definitely is an issue with this side
when you get to the width it's a little
bit hard to read especially if i zoom
out you can see the hot the width gets
kind of hidden so making this may be a
darker blue or something like this or
real dark blue almost black would be
more ideal I think and then coming down
here I just think if you if this were
full size and this is how it was really
going to play out and yet if you have to
scroll down this much though just to get
to this portion here that wouldn't be
ideal try to move things up just a
little bit and maybe take away from the
the white space just a tad bit usually
with new desires which I'm not saying
you're new at least most of the answers
I receive this is the opposite issue a
lot of people cram everything together
this is spaced out so far I think maybe
to the opposite direction I but other
than that everything else I like it a
lot you know the design wise lay out all
that one of the better entries so thanks
for that okay okay so this one there's
an issue you barely see the enter your
email so you definitely want contrast
there so people can see it this sticks
out better this time so that's
definitely better the this text down
here not enough contrast you would
definitely want to bring that out arm
and I would probably move these down
this one down a little bit and then this
one closer up just because everything's
to evenly spaced out here and it just
kind of feels I don't know there's just
something definitely wrong with it I
think when you come when it comes to
like a headline and a sub headlining try
to get them closer together than this
instead of this equal distribution
between these elements right here
alright thanks for that though all right
Laura see here two versions I feel like
an element okay so looking at this one
let me could look at these both here
real quick yeah definitely would not
like this one because this is definitely
doesn't look like dripping water
so I especially with this because it
just looks a little bit strange having
said that or ignoring that I cool little
logo let's see here let me hit copy
image URL so this particular font it's
kind of hard to read because everything
there's not a lot of a letter spacing or
the tracking is way too thin i would say
or too close together to send me my
coupon button you definitely want to add
more padding there's not enough padding
from the left and the right certainly I
if you added it as much as you had up
here which lives like 15 20 pixels you
definitely want to have equal padding at
least on the right and left the enter
your email address here kind of hard to
read again just because of that font
issue other than that you know the seven
my coupon cd8 ctas definitely stands out
so that's good and so coming down to
this version down here right here I like
this better definitely the way you put
this right here all right so you kept it
simple so thanks for that they
definitely had a lot of things going for
that's positive hurlan ok so let me copy
image URL here all right so low waters
better flow ok yeah the only thing here
I like there's a lot of contrast
definitely and I like the the watermark
background so you did that well I would
move the email address and send me my
coupon up above here and then this
information down below I just swap these
two basically having said that the color
scheme is good the call to action I
button is this turquoise teal sort of
color very good it complements this
color well and this is good as well so I
like it
very simple but I'm definitely effective
I think just if we swap these two it
would be better and which is obviously a
very mind your detail I'm coming down
alright so okay I definitely don't need
a password but ignoring that looking at
this I see how this color this green
almost starts to match this screen down
here it gets in the same realm of the
color spectrum you kind of want to avoid
that because it does begin to get lost a
little bit so somehow fix find a remedy
for that by the change in this color
down here or this color right here this
guy called a action looking at this the
rest of it I just assume you should just
be email address right here probably the
same width as to send me my coupon and
that would be more ideal I guess let me
see here yeah and that's all this person
acid so yeah there's just those couple
things I think would definitely improve
it not a big fan at all of the font
right here I definitely would probably
just leave that out and you also the
copyright protected yep you don't want
that either trust me just takes away
from the design and you're you're the up
these are distracting elements basically
especially when it comes to a squeeze
page all right coming down leaf all
right there's a lot of issues here in
terms of contrast and complexity so you
have this complex background here but
because it's basically a photograph that
hasn't been watermark you know kind of
like the entry right here and it's kind
of left as it was there's a lot of
issues with you we have these dark and
light colors and all throughout and then
we have all this text that's on top of
it makes it very hard to read any of
this it makes it hard for the eye to
follow especially with you know enter
your email address here and the submit
button way too much complexity going on
here you want simple simple simple so
which is a good thing because as a
designer you don't have to focus on
trying to do all these elaborate designs
right here it's not effective it's just
not effective in terms of maximizing the
amount of email submits that you're
going to get all right so I would focus
on just returning to some simplicity and
not feeling it you have to overdo things
like this thanks for taking the time to
do it though this is kind of a cool part
this is definitely better design than
what was going on right here I would say
for the features alright thanks for that
entry okay so definitely not a fan I'm
not too big of a fan of this one if
you're gonna use a font like this like
water is better with flow I would
probably only make that of that font
specific to this this text right here
just because it's so unique but if you
start adding it to all the other see you
you used a good font for the semi my
coupon or semi coupon I would definitely
maybe add it to this as well just
because it's such a unique font that
this this hands for font that it begins
to clutter things essentially just
because the type of fun it is having
said that look at the send me my coupon
that doesn't stick out enough again you
know if you look at this color here it
starts to match this color up here and
it just doesn't send out because I stand
out as much as it should there's also a
lack of white space between these
elements everything kind of just flows
together so work on that thanks for the
entry though big and big issues here all
around unfortunately because I could
barely read this text right here so it
clashes too much with the background so
there's not enough contrast makes it
hard to read the email here I already
mentioned this issue you definitely need
to scale down this text so there's more
padding and white space to semi my
coupon it's definitely not unique enough
of a color to that it stands out well
enough I it doesn't really complement
this color up here so there's a lot of
different tools you can find for
complementing color schemes online you
just do a google search for that so yeah
I would definitely work on that an
alignment issue as well there's no
alignment here really it's kind of kind
of just thrown together when it comes to
these type of landing pages
it's if you Center things you almost
can't go wrong but when you start doing
things like this yeah it starts to throw
off the whole design thanks for the
entry though all right so big contrast
issue here you can't really read it so
you definitely want to invert this in
you know use like black perhaps but not
white because this is almost weight
itself um this fifteen percent off
coupon with your email to with your
email right there can barely even see
that so big contrast issues there and
the semi my coupon I couldn't even read
that so definitely want to work on your
coloring and contrast and you really
want people to be able to see things big
time and there's also an issue with the
priority you have you know this section
right here which is done well but it's
one of the least important sections it's
this right here the email getting the
emails the goal but it's kind of shoved
up here to the right so I'm looking at
this it just seems like this is yeah
there's no layout here unfortunately let
me go back up so yeah things just need
to be organized a little bit better
thanks for the entry okay so looking at
this okay so yeah it's nice so this is a
unique sort of approach for the top I
would say though that it's it's too much
it takes away too much from this portion
down here I'm again the primary goal you
know that these people want is the email
address when it shot over down here I
unfortunately it's just it would need to
be worked with in this area basically in
order for this to be most effective
because if they were to test this versus
another example where this has a lot
more prominence the one with more
prominence of course we'll get more
email addresses which is what the goal
is you know artistically up here this is
cool but I just don't think it's going
to be it would perform well in terms of
getting most
mel's one is just kind of tucked over
here to the side thanks for the
submission though all right Tash let's
see here ok so again issue with call to
action it doesn't stand out enough it
doesn't contrast enough with this bluish
background right here so it gets lost it
almost looks like a label too so people
might mistake this as a label and not
even click it so usually if you're going
to have the button the call-to-action
button it shouldn't be to the left it
should be if anything to the right or
underneath it so that people will read
from left to right so then we're here
and then click here or underneath from
top down other than that yeah I you want
to have equal white space as well you
know you have this white space right
here and then you have this white space
down here and it's not even so it kind
of flows flows off throws off the flow
of the design essentially so you want to
consistency when it comes to the white
space thanks for that submission all
right look it down here definitely a
more modern design I yet against once
again the the navigation kind of takes
away from everything at which you just
would have pushed this over the left it
he like right here left lined to the
text or centered it um let me hit copy
image URL just you can see this one in
particular full view yeah so this is a
pretty good design the its simplest it's
simplistic enough especially right here
enter your coupon code even I was
supposed to be an email address um that
this be in the same color as this you
know this stands out on its own already
so it doesn't necessarily have to be a
different color in this type of context
um I am worried though that this might
not be so obvious that it's an area
where you put your code or your email
just because it's a simple line right
here and there would have to be like a
blinking cursor effect so people really
understand that other than that design
wise I definitely like it so thanks for
that submission
moving on all right doesn't look like
there was an area that was specified
just want to read this real quickly okay
so I don't see anywhere for the person
to enter their email so that's a big
issue obviously um in terms of the
background I mean that's fine I think
this text right here probably a little
bit almost a little bit too big it
doesn't seem to be much of a what's
called visual hierarchy with what you've
done with the type basically so yeah we
definitely have visual hierarchy in
terms of this right here the heading or
the headline then there's the receive a
15-percent coupon better in your email
and then just down here with equal size
and text is this information and so the
eye isn't really sure where to read or
where to go so it just seems like a lot
of text even though it's not but your
average person's lazy don't like reading
so I think the big issue there just need
to have the the input for the email and
also this would definitely be underneath
any input or data that they would be
putting in just because you says you
this is where you say receive if it's
fifteen percent off coupon biting your
email but then you have this stuff and
then you have supposedly down here I
would as soon as we're supposed to put
your email so that's an issue right
there and if this is supposed to be a
part of this design right here
definitely feels disconnected and it's
way way far off to the bottom so we
definitely want to rework that if that's
the intention thanks for this mission
though all right waters better if loaf
receiving okay okay so in terms of
getting your content prioritization
correct you definitely did looking down
here it's not so obvious that this is a
button just because it seems connected i
mean it is connected with this so i
prefer to see maybe a different color
here
with this button and maybe separate it
when you try to work them in together
things can possibly get confusing when
you break standards basically having
said that everything else is pretty good
terms of the type in the color and
contrast and simplicity so thanks for
that all right come down here water is
better with flow okay let's see here Wow
a lot going on here and definitely spend
some time on this um ideally because
they're trying to get the email this has
to go up top you can have it again I
guess at the bottom but definitely
wanted at top since you know that's what
they're this is a squeeze page what
they're trying to do is get the email as
many email just as as possible so I
don't move that up here place a lot of
emphasis on it and then that's when you
can add all this you know you can add
your trust factors such as you know
these logos the About section these
blips right here and any other
information generally for a squeeze page
you leave out though things like
navigations and other areas for them to
leave just because this is the primary
focal point having said that looking at
this and your email text doesn't stand
out enough so it's hard to read the semi
mycoupon way too small I definitely
would work that up to the least the size
of this as well but thanks for taking it
a time for submitting that and it look
like this again there's an issue I with
I the font size so you have waters
better afloat it just looks like a big
wall of text unfortunately so you need
to work on you know maybe giving some
space away from the receiver fifteen
percent off with the headline maybe a
little bit more space white space I put
this text underneath it down here
somewhere and then you have your area
where your enter the email and this
portion now you always have to put in
enter your email because some people
they're not very intelligent they're not
going to know it they'll put their phone
number or something like that and then
save me my coupon it's the same colors
everything else I would
definitely make it a different color to
make it really stick out so thanks for
that entry man 28 minutes already oh my
god okay um all right so let's see here
water is better with low receive a fifty
percent off yeah we definitely want to
work this up inside of here because it
seems so disconnected you know this
right here supposed to be a part of this
you know this tells them why this should
enter their email and but now it sits in
a completely different container so
there's an issue with that I like to
design though design-wise it's cool but
I think just throwing it down here is a
mistake but yeah other than that good
design is just kind of like a minor
issue though all right looking at this
okay copy image URL okay so it looks
like the one issue here is again as with
the previous entry they received a
fifteen percent off coupon minor in your
email kind of leave you hanging right
here I then we have the separate
container which then at the very bottom
asks for the email it's kind of this is
pushed down way too far I would push
this up for sure um in that way you know
to enter you email here and get coupon
that that's not lost from this portion
right here otherwise could design thanks
for the entry all right so looking at
this one call to action right here it
doesn't stick out enough it doesn't
contrast enough with the background
unfortunately so and again we have the
padding issues right here you definitely
want to have more padding on your top
and bottom of the button these to be
consistent with the right and the left
because if they touch like this it just
throws off the design consistency of it
and so so I definitely improve the color
in the contrast to enter your email
address
I would try to thicken up as well in
terms of padding in you know really try
to give people are in room to breathe
air you give your text room to breathe
when it comes to containing them in
elements like this this I'm not a big
fan of having you know the white text up
here and then the block text right here
there's an issue of inconsistency I
guess when you're you know you've
changed up the the type a lot because
this goes from real thick and bold to
bold still right here in white to black
and then thin there's an issue with
there with a typography try to keep
things more simple because you're
changing up a lot of elements right here
having said that let's see here I would
also work on how you're presenting this
information right here because it just
kind of looks like it's a slap there I
would get rid of containing these and in
these containers as well that's kind of
an old-school more old-school approach
using containers on all your different
elements I would just make this text you
know dark gray or black or something and
just break away from the containers so
it's not so blocky thanks for the
submission though alright so again
definitely there's an issue we hear it's
not on there's no area to specify the
email address and also the receiveth
fifteen percent off text there's no call
to action right next to it unfortunately
have all this this wall of text here so
that's an issue definitely would have
this right here I think you left out all
water is better flow it's right up there
at the top and almost looks like it's a
part of the logo though so yeah I would
definitely move this down make it much
smaller font size move this up with a
good call to action button and the enter
your email address up here thanks for
the submission okay definitely an issue
with this way too small and hidden so I
would take this move it down take the
receiver fifteen percent off coupon bar
enter your meal email make that much
larger center
and take this as well and definitely
make that much much bigger I so that
people can see it so that's the biggest
issue with that all right let's see your
thanks for the submission though all
right so water is better flow here here
issue right here with this is it doesn't
stand out enough doesn't contrast enough
you don't want to use the same color as
the background unless it really
contrasts with it and this is kind of
like just slept at the bottom is you
know a lot of people have been making
this text down here way too big but this
in this case it's too small it's too
much of an afterthought it almost seems
like a disclaimer or something like that
otherwise everything else was good
though so thanks for the submission see
what this is all right so i pair with
flow yeah this one's not too bad I would
have preferred you know to make this may
be down here but I that's just that's
just a minor gripe this right here this
water why it's a cool effect I think
almost takes it's too much of an effect
and almost takes away a little bit too
much from I the call to action you know
because it is the same color in a sense
especially the darker areas so this kind
of gets lost when you start to scroll
down but that's not a big issue though I
do like everything else ideally I would
just I would honestly I would get rid of
the the very light borders these can
stand well on their own without them but
other than that this is one of the
better entries so thanks for submitting
not all right so looking at this see
here all right so let's see I would
definitely get rid of this underline
here it's just it's unnecessary and it
kind of throws off the flow of design
and it clutters it unnecessarily we
don't need it I would definitely make
this bit a lot bigger as it's a headline
and again this kind of gets lost down
here because it's kind of too far away
from the receiver fifteen percent off
coupon so again
like I said before you on other entries
try to get these two closer together I
probably get rid of this over here it's
kind of distracting especially when you
already have something at the bottom
alright so thanks for the submission
though alright it's looking at this one
alright so it gets lost too much I the
call to action down here and there's
also an issue just with the layout you
know we have this border here this white
border definitely get rid of that and
it's all this is centered in it yet this
text is left-aligned and then this is
started or started over here and it's
left a line and so there's definitely a
big issue in terms of how you choosing
to align your elements and it throws off
the flow of the layout essentially so
this down here you could barely see
enter your email I would get rid of all
the crazy gradients a twosome that's
something you really don't see anymore
that's kind of like a mom and an old
more old-school approach towards design
so in terms not everything has to be
flat but I think this is just way too
many gradients for what it's worth but
thanks for the submission all right so
look at this huge issue with the colors
it's hard to read because they clash too
much because there's not enough contrast
so also the font size that you're using
I it's too hard to read everything's
kind of just smashed together there's
not a lot of white space in between
these elements and the enter your email
let me see here there's no cost there's
no button either so yeah a lot of issues
here unfortunately by so I would
definitely take a look at the ones that
I've mentioned are better and see how
you can approve in that manner or hit me
up for one-on-one training that would be
great too all right let's see here ok so
all right flow waters bear with flow
this is yeah issue here is it's just
tacked on at the bottom and so most
people really want to see it or very few
people would bother to enter their email
address you want definitely want this to
be up top
in your flow in their flow oh man I am
tired as how it's been all day at a
water park but anyhow yeah it's just
this water is better if low of the
headline you definitely need to make
that larger make that something that's
you know really the focal point because
this is almost the same font size as
this right here and it sticks out even
more just because there's more contrast
so I would definitely work on trying to
prioritize you know what are the most
important elements and so you would
definitely shrink this down probably
move it down bring this up make the this
color stand out more so it's not the
same as this basically and it would be
much better just with those changes all
right so looking at this see here just
kind of reading all right a couple
things are throwing off the design for
me is I just with it encased in this
design right here there's not a lot of
white space in the elements like the
text and such you know one thing that
throws things off for me is like okay so
you have flow the beginning of the F
here but then this extends off beyond
that and then this is all centered right
here um and there's just not a strong
presence of a layout here I mean you
could definitely see there's two columns
you have this column here and then you
have the glass but generally when you
have two columns like this you probably
should not Center everything in this
column because it flows off the throws
off the flow of the design basically to
send me my coupon that doesn't stick out
enough unfortunately i would use just a
completely contrasting color but
something that called them as well again
the semi my coupon the the white space
of the padding should be equal at least
equal on all these sides right here so i
push this out an equal distance from
here just because it looks squished in a
sense all right other than that contrast
and all that is done well so thanks for
that
alright so there's some issues in terms
of this one I like the simplicity but
there are some issues here right here
water is better with flow you know this
is bold and a certain size this is not
bold and then this is this text right
here is large so it kind of almost looks
like you know you're not sure where to
focus unfortunately so you want to
definitely make water is better flow the
biggest element and then receive a
fifteen percent off coupon by entering
your email should all be styled the same
because it's as part of the same
sentence otherwise you make it too
complex to enter your email kind of push
down way too far you know you have a
certain padding up here right like right
here but then you've doubled it or
almost tripled it right here and so it's
kind of throwing off the need the
padding and so it's creating for an
inconsistency with how its presented
other than that I do like the simplicity
of this so thanks for that crumpler
version
the issue with this one here is you know
when somebody opens us up in their
browser and you see waters better flow
received fifteen percent off coupon it
may be the only thing they see currently
on their browser then you have to scroll
down a lot of people might just exit and
say what the hell you know I like the
simplicity of it for sure but then we
have this portion right here and then
this ultimately gets hidden so this is
something that it would be a big no
because you know the it's all the same
color there's no distinction between the
button and the input it's the same color
as the background so it's really lost
here alright so I would work on fixing
that thanks for this mission okay um
let's see here alright so there's no I
email entry unfortunately but I do like
the color of this button it should
definitely be larger though should be
almost the size or the width this text
right here the fifteen percent off
coupon doesn't contrast enough with this
water so it's kind of a little bit hard
to read other than that I do like it I
like to lay out and then the font size
for this and that's all good thanks for
submitting all right this looks this is
the exact same one I think that I
already reviewed yep alright so let's
see here
okay all right so coming down here you
yeah okay so definitely an issue with
the put your email here can't really see
it you can see it but it's kind of hard
to read it'll get lost the semi my
coupon that doesn't stand out enough on
its own and you know I appreciate the
attempts of you know doing something you
know kind of unique here and artistic
but generally I would kind of stay away
from it especially you know you have
everything centered but then we have
this pushed off to the right and that
throws off you know the alignment
consistency in the design so I
definitely make this stand out with its
own background and then you know this
right here this is supposed to be kind
of like an afterthought you know this
should be you know waters better flow
you know and you got that right in terms
of size but justing is moved up here
ideally this would be brought down
beneath this portion right here alright
thanks for that entry all right so this
is a I don't even know how to pronounce
the name but he's always given some
pretty good submissions let me go ahead
and copy image there paste that in okay
so this is at a hundred percent the one
issue I would say um everything's too
small um just that you know at least how
I'm viewing it if everything was just
scaled up by like thirty five or forty
or fifty percent I'd be able to read it
a little bit better a little hard to
read this stuff this isn't bad and
people the the probably about five to
ten people have submitted call to action
buttons with uneven padding or white
space right here this is how you do it
correctly um let's see here yeah
just see how like even on the iPad
preview how just how small this is in
relation to the size that you do have
available you could extend this out for
sure over here and still have a good
white space that's the only that I would
say that would be the only improvement
from my end that I can see you know that
would be worth integrating in this
design otherwise it is good all right
all right look at this one yeah the call
to action does stand out enough does in
contrast with this this water right here
same i would i'm not a big fan of The
Strokes either in this context at least
it's probably fine to stroke you know
the input but not the call to action
button copy I would just make it a color
that really contrasts well and then you
wouldn't even have to put a stroke other
than that though I do like it you you
have your priorities straight and you
have that working well for you so thanks
for that all right so big issue here is
um you if you're low this up in your
browser again you're gonna have to
scroll down quite a bit just to get to
this section and statistically that's
going to significantly cut down on the
amount of emails you're going to get
which is the whole point you did make it
a good contrasting color so that's good
on that front um this is too big in
relation to this if anything you really
want the button to be bigger ideally
they're probably going to be around the
same size though so i would definitely
scale this down and then put placeholder
text here enter your email just so
people understand even though you're
specifying it right here because a lot
of people aren't intelligent
unfortunately i but yeah a lot of day
way too much white space vertical white
space between these elements though and
that will cause for a lot of fun
necessary scroll so that's how it fixed
there thanks for that we're definitely
wide in this email right here it's a
little bit too small especially giving
the size of the text currently in there
so a lot of people they would enter the
email and then part of their email would
get lost
is it would start screwing over so I
definitely increase that size um I like
the the button the fact that it's its
unique color you know couldn't make
comparison to the blue up here um again
I would try to definitely work this
right here up into here just because
it's you know it's this the focal point
this is what they want is their email
addresses for advertising when you put
at the bottom you're going to lose some
people unfortunately other than that I
you know just changing a couple things
those couple things would definitely
make it a lot more solid everything else
is going good here for you thanks for
that all right so alignment issues here
you know you have everything kind of
centered and you know these two things
are a certain width and such but then
just slapped over here to the left with
nothing over here that throws off the
flow of the design so definitely want to
remedy that issue um sorry my mouse
scroll wheel is going haywire and then
this is kind of just an afterthought
almost like a disclaimer so I would try
to make that a little bit more priority
and yeah I think you did those couple
things it would definitely be better all
right let's go to page three my throat
is like killing me at this point all
right so I the end the email address
right here is getting lost its you know
this there's not enough contrast for
this right here this stroke so n plus
where it says email address even though
you can read it some people with bad
vision might have a hard time seeing it
and I would definitely increase the size
to at least match the semi my coupon so
you got that but incorrect but just this
part is the weak link i would say and
you know just making a couple
adjustments would definitely improve it
yeah you see there's a lot of text right
here definitely move this text below as
I've been saying with a lot of other
entries and it would definitely improve
so thanks for that this there's too much
contrast with this background is it
sticks out way too much I would make it
more like a watermark this is make it
hard to read the
text very few people would sit there and
read this just because it would be kind
of difficult to follow so that's the big
issue with this design if you really
just D saturated this background here
it'd be a lot better not be saturated
but you know really take it take away
from the contrast of it and then you
know these should be probably equal size
and width for sure just because it's
kind of getting thrown off in terms of
the layout of it all right and waters
better with flow receive okay let's see
this right here like I said another
entry try to make sure you you know your
your button your call to action is the
background of the color of it is a
different color than this portion then
the input just so it stands out as
something that you know you click also
this text right here scale that down
definitely and also this background kind
of contrast a little bit too much
contrast in it so I would just kind of
put it inside of like a container a
darkened a dark blue container and then
take this layer take the Apache down by
like fifty percent that way because it's
still kind of hard you get into lighter
areas in the background here against
this white makes it just a tad bit
difficult to read especially when you
have this white and then it gets real
dark right here so it's adding clutter
with a text and I would say I definitely
scale this down because it's an
afterthought so that there's more
emphasis placed on this form right here
so thanks for that all right so this one
let's see here only copy image so the
type your email directs your email here
I it's a little bit too hard to read so
I like that the white space and the
padding that you have going but it
probably needs to be bigger definitely
bigger and maybe stick out a little bit
darker grey send me my coupon a little
bit hard to see just because as with a
lot of other entries you know we have a
blue water and then this blue
you even though there's you know this is
a lot set more saturated it's still a
little bit more difficult to see just in
this aspect so I would make that stand
out just a little bit more other than
that that's good of what you have going
here and then finally last entry water
is better with flow received fifteen
percent off coupon your email again this
issue here same issue is above this one
did send me my coupon call to action
does not stand out enough in relation to
the background so it definitely make
this something maybe like a green or
something that really stands out so
people understand other than that I
probably get rid of the drop shadow here
kind of definitely unnecessary I'll make
this stand out probably make this bold
because that's one of the elements that
we really want to distress in the
headline and then it'd be a lot more
solid alright so thanks for these
submissions ever you want Wow 51 minutes
I was the longest review ever okay
