and today I wanted to revisit a topic
that we just looked at last week with
view router page transition animations
and I wanted to do that for two reasons
first there was something that kind of
screwed up I wanted to adjust really
quickly only like in a matter of a
minute and then also I wanted to
introduce a concept of and if this isn't
new to CSS it's called the cubic Bezier
property and when used with router
transition page animations it creates
for a really cool effect and it allows
you to very easily control the flow of
the animation between the pages alright
so the first thing I want you to take a
look at is because I'm not gonna start
from scratch like I usually do in most
tutorials this is just a lazy Sunday
very quick video I decided to do I want
you basically uploaded the project to
github add it here you can just clone
this repo I'll add it in the description
of this YouTube video and then that way
you'll be right where we were at the
very end of last week's tutorial alright
so go ahead in you know do what you need
to do to get up to this point or just
rewatch that tutorial and once you're at
that stage I'm going to go ahead and
open this up and just go ahead in the
terminal and run yarn serve and this is
what it currently looks like so this is
what we did last week these are the page
transition animations as you can see you
know the URL changes and everything but
we still have a nice sleek animation and
a transition between the pages now this
is just straight-up linear animation
here alright so just to look at the code
real quick just to show you what's going
on here is first in the template we
simply have this transition name equals
let me make this larger for us all to
see is just we have now just close this
out we have the transition name router
annum and that's just a prefix for the
CSS class and then down here we have
router annum there's that name
interactive if it's just defining an
animation with a coming or an animation
name called coming and then a one-second
duration same thing with a the router
Hannam leave active state which is going
and then here's our two animations very
basic stuff it's just a transform on
translate X negative 50 pixels very
simple all right so we're first going to
address that issue that I mentioned
before an individual commented on that
tutorial say hey you don't need to add
position:fixed here to this page class
which is some reference to it's in the
other view here let's see yeah right
here in order to get those smooth
transition our page transitions all you
have to do and I forgot about that I've
used it before but I completely forgot
about when doing that tutorial we just
simply add mode equals out - in there's
also a mode of in/out but more often not
you're gonna use out in and you can you
can experiment with those two second we
can now remove these two properties and
so if I save it sorry that I just really
opened up my email client by accident
yeah I did one second alright so now if
we click between these pages will see
that they now still work oh and there's
a little bit of a delay because I forgot
to remove that delay which is right here
alright so now we save and it now works
without having to make that a position
fixed element alright so that's the
first thing that's not really what this
tutorial is about though this is about
the cubic Bezier function and animation
again it's not new but when we I know
there's a lot of people who don't really
know about it but when used in
conjunction with our paid transition
animations it's not really cool and it
takes something that's simple that we
currently have and just adds a little
bit extra of an element to it okay so
what we want to do is we want to
actually integrate the cubic Bezier
animation we just simply have to add one
property and so we're going to add it on
the router Anam leave active class all
if the do is put animation - timing -
function property and we're gonna
specify cubic and then bezzie a and then
we specify for different values here
that are comma separated within this
function so we're going to have for now
point eight negative zero point four
nine we'll pull it point three six and
one now if you're confused about what
these values are especially if you've
never seen them don't worry let's just
go ahead and save this real quick and
now I want you to look at the animation
when this one is leaving because we only
need only at this point added it to the
leave class or the leaf state rather so
watch what happens when it leaves
instead of just going to the left it's
gonna come out a little bit and then go
back in notice that now it's not very
noticeable based on a current animation
because it doesn't move much so I want
to make some really quick adjustments
and in fact I'm not even gonna make it
just gonna paste over some of this stuff
with the written version of this
tutorial and so just to show you what
I'm talking about I in the description
the first link will be the written
version of this tutorial if you scroll
down right around here and the page
you'll see this part right here this is
everything that I want you to copy and
paste in between the Style section of
the view component now not much is
changing here I'm simply adding two
properties to the page class I'm adding
padding to the nav I've added a
background color to you know one of the
elements you have the page elements
right there so not much is actually
changing here but I don't want to sit
there and like just waste all this time
in this tutorial to do this because all
I want to do with this by pasting us in
is to make it a little bit more obvious
the effect we're also change I only
change to translate X to Y and made it
three hundred pixels so I coming down
back to our example now you can see
we're gonna be showing an example that
really will accentuate or demonstrate
what cubic Bezier does so isn't that
cool so it's just taking a default
animation that's just going from you
x2 why and it's allowing you to control
the curve of the animation so now I can
talk about alright how do we actually
control those values and you know get an
idea of what exactly is happening with
the cube cubic Bezier function well
there's a really handy nifty website out
there and it is at cubic Bezier calm so
let's go ahead and visit that real quick
so right here
so this is cubic Bezier calm and what
this allows you to do is on the Left we
can adjust and manipulate we can even go
down I the beginning and end point of
basically an XY coordinate and you are
able to really adjust this line and then
you can hit go and the bottom one is
just a standard animation without any
type of bezzie a applied to it and this
one at the top is how the animation will
appear or flow I with this property
added so you can adjust the duration if
you want and so let's say we like this
one well we can click Save right here
just copy the four values and then we'll
go back to our code alright so as you
can see when we pasted this in I added a
timing function for the top and bottom
and they're both slightly different but
let's just add the the leave function
let's let's just paste that in the leave
function right there now watch what
happens when it leaves now of course you
could go real crazy with this and I
wouldn't suggest making or using some
type of really elaborate type of page
transition animation cat or cubic Bezier
properties kind of like I have here it's
a little bit too jerky but again this is
just to demonstrate how useful this is
and by the way if you're kind of curious
about how
this is kind of not overlapping there's
another real cool trick is I where's it
at overflow:hidden
that's another property that was added
when we pasted on that I didn't describe
to the app container so overflow:hidden
will make it so that any Content that's
coming in and animating in from a
different page or a route it won't
extend beyond your container if you have
a UI that kind of has a defined
container like this all right so let me
just go back real quick
I don't really actually like those
properties but for an actual page
transition animation this is pretty cool
and of course you can make it come in
from the left or the right but yeah so
that is basically how it all works out
so hopefully you know you're able to
follow that first tutorial and then take
away something extra from this one this
is kind of just a quick you know again
Sunday video so I just to keep you up to
date with what's going on with my n in
terms of course set row I have a new
course that's gonna be releasing very
soon it actually uses the view as well
as this animation I project but it's
going to be so much more than those two
things all right so look on that look
out for that very soon and more
tutorials alright see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
