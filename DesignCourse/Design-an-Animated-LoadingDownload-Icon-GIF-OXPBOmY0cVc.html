and today is January 20th and we are
going to do two videos and the second
video is going to be release a little
bit later today where I announced the
winner of the giveaway contest yesterday
that I had I'm also going to choose the
winners I write on screen so today we're
going to be designing a loading
animation gif that you can be used on a
website when something's downloaded you
can activate it with a Ajax JavaScript
and HTML and CSS but today we're just
going to be working solely in Adobe
Photoshop CC to do this animation as
always check out design course calm and
but in your email is going to be
cautious there in the future and check
out I the Facebook page and know the
other social media accounts are linked
below in this video and the project
files of course as always are available
for free in the description is in the
video alright so let's go ahead and get
started
okay let's go ahead to file a new and
we're gonna call this loading gif I'll
make that capital with 859 by 600 I'm
just gonna leave it at that in the
background contents it's just
transparent and if you have any grids
that show up just hit control age you
can get rid of those and I'm gonna take
this color which is DB DB DB for the
background fill that in rename this to
background alright so now what we want
to do is create a rectangle so we'll
take the rectangle tool we'll click once
here and we will change this to 128 by
128 now when it comes to icon sizes you
know there's a kind of standard size 16
by 16 then 32 64 128 256 512 I if you
were to create this with the intentions
of allowing other people to use it you
could offer this in multiple sizes I for
our tutorial we're just going to use 128
by 128 so let me hit OK and we're gonna
make it slightly darker just so we can
see it eventually we're going to delete
this but I now what we want to do is go
ahead and take the rectangle tool again
and we will just left click right up
here and I'm going to leave the width at
128 and the height I'm going to make 32
now if you take 128 for the height and
you divide that by 4 this is what you
get so I'll explain why we're choosing
132 rather in a second here and I'm
gonna make this color right around there
36 36 36 for that color code hit OK
alright so I want three of these but I
don't want them stacked directly on top
of each other so that's why I two chose
to divide the 128 by 4 just so we'll
have space in between at the three of
these servers so what I'm going to do
now is just focus on designing the
content of this 4
just survey here like some buttons and
you don't want to make it too complex
but we'll just get started here I I'm
gonna go ahead and just drag out right
here now when you just left-click and
you're not pressing any buttons this is
what happens if you hold alt it kind of
keeps it there on that same path and it
starts it from the left so something
just roughly around that size and I'm
choosing six five six five six five four
that hit okay and then what we want to
do is duplicate this so you can right
click duplicate layer or set up a hotkey
for that and I just choose a patrol
shift D that will automatically allow
you to quickly duplicate all right so
now I'm going to take those three hit
ctrl T will just scale that in a little
bit and hit apply and then over here I'm
going to create some real tiny squares
and you'll see what that will look like
I'm gonna zoom up here so we'll take the
rectangle tool hold shift and just make
a very tiny square then what I want to
do is duplicate that and we're gonna be
duplicating this quite a bit and we're
gonna move it down right there and then
take those two first and hit ctrl e to
merge them or right-click and merge and
then duplicate that so I'm just gonna
real quickly keep on doing this merging
them and duplicating them I'll do that
one more time and then we'll take those
and merge them and then pull it down
holding shift and just moving okay we'll
hit ctrl one to get back to 100% alright
and let's take both of those layers hit
ctrl e to merge them and when you can
use your your arrow keys down or up to
get that aligned correctly vertically
alright so
that looks pretty decent you don't want
to make anything too complex so I now we
want to do is rename these I'm just
gonna call this grid and let's take
these we'll merge those as well
ctrl e we'll call these buttons and then
we'll take this let's call this server
all right and then we'll take those
three and group them so control G will
call this server all right so now we're
going to let's zoom up again real quick
and we are going to duplicate the group
so ctrl shift D hit ok and then ctrl
shift D again align this to the bottom
and if you could auto select group with
our move tool we can just automatically
click to select those groups all right
so now what we want to do is get rid of
this because we now know this is 128 by
128 because it was based on that
previous layer all right so hit control
1 and now we basically have the icon
static basically there's no animation we
have it designed though so now to get to
the part where we want to start
designing this thing we have to go to
window and we want to choose timeline
then let me just drag that down quite a
bit and in order to get this ready to be
animated we have to hit click this
button create video timeline so once you
do that you'll see we have a timeline
down here with a representation of all
of our layers in our groups and so what
we're going to want to do is try to
create an animation that gives the
appearance that something is being
downloaded we want to do it in it kind
of like a unique way so what we want to
do is first create a new layer so we'll
take the pen tool and I'm gonna go to
what I sorry about that view we want to
show the grid make sure that's on so
and then go to view and make sure Snap
to grid is on and so I'm going to create
a triangle so I'm gonna click over here
it's just somewhere off the side and
this is going to be a pretty big
triangle so I about just hold shift and
we'll select right here and then hold
shift again and we'll select right there
and then we will close that alright so
now we want to go ahead to view will
hide the extras or just hit ctrl H now
what we want to do is take this will
just call this down arrow and we'll
right click and we'll choose create
clipping mask so you can create a
clipping mask that goes on to a group
and so this particular group is the one
on the bottom and I think I'm going to
move this over here so we'll take this
right click great clipping mask that we
were working with the top layer here
alright okay so now what we want to do
in order to animate this is go ahead and
open up well actually we don't have to
open this but yet just select down arrow
layer and click this little icon there
to bring up all of the properties that
we can animate so basically this is the
one right here you would think it's
position but it's actually a vector mask
position so if you click on this little
timeline icon it creates a keyframe and
if we go all the way out to stay around
right there and then just take I know we
can't see it but it's up here if you
turn off auto select group that will
done won't cause any issues hold your
shift button and drag this just to where
you don't see it anymore actually we
still see it there okay now it's
completely hidden so now what happens is
it creates this animation and so if we
hit play
all right that's actually pretty slow so
I'm gonna drag this in probably about
half the time so now let's hit play here
we can see the actual speed and you
really could eye speed that up a little
bit more take it here to the beginning I
think I'm gonna choose like somewhere in
between there and there okay so now what
we want to do is go ahead and I will
move forward just right around there and
then we're gonna take this and move it
back up oops sorry about that I'm gonna
edit undo that just move it back up my
holding shift alright so now if we play
that we could see what that looks like
okay so now what we want to do we want
to repeat that process for the other two
servers so I'm going to take this with
that layer selected drill shift D to
duplicate that move it above here to
server copy and right click and we will
create clipping mask now we're gonna
have to redo these because they're in a
different location so I'm just going to
take all these three and delete those
all right so oops I think I may have
deleted for both of those because we
have both of them selected make sure you
only have this up here selected there we
go
and let's go back here to the beginning
now we want it to be just above so right
now it's up there now if you just drag
it down we see it's right there so right
there as we want our first keyframe and
then we want these to all match up just
for the time being and so then I'm going
to go ahead and drag this down just to
right around there and then make sure
this matches up and then we'll drag it
back up all right and then one more time
we'll duplicate that
right-click create clipping mask and
come down here delete those real quick
come back to the beginning drag this
down right around there no no I think I
deleted those other two let me back up a
little bit so if you hit ctrl Z ctrl alt
Z you can go back a few times okay there
they are I'm gonna make sure nothing
else is selected all right so let me
just delete those up see that's what
happened there you go
when you make that selection you're
dragging if you go too far
actually I mean oh why did that oh well
they're both there still so that's good
okay so let's go ahead and create the
first eye keyframe there we'll position
it correctly I think it's right around
here we will move it down just to here
and down a little bit further and then
come back up and then pull it up right
there alright so what we can do so that
we can see this looping first of all
we'll come over here this allows us to I
basically focus in on wherever we're at
here in the timeline so just make sure
you can see this area you can pull this
here to the left and that's going to be
the length of the gif now to make sure
that it keeps on looping you click on
this little cog right there you can
specify a loop playback so let's just
watch this oops let me get that better
in view all right so I mean it looks
okay it's a little bit fast
what we want to do is play around with
the position of the layers so that these
aren't all aligning the same
so I'm gonna extend this just a little
bit and now we have all three of our
base of our key frames in view so well I
want to happen is I want this bottom one
which I believe is this layer right here
no look the top one yeah this one right
here I want this one to start first this
arrow so what we would do is take the
other two and we would move the
animations forward so this down arrow
for the top one yeah for the middle one
rather and these two we're gonna select
both of those layers hold ctrl and move
them forward maybe right around there
just a couple frames and then then take
only the bottom one or rather the top
and move that forward as well and so
they're an even distance so now we can
hit play alright and that looks pretty
cool so we could play around with it a
little bit more even so we could take
this I keyframe here and this is where
the arrows goes back up and let's see
here it's the bottom one so I'll extend
this just a little bit leave this one
here and then this one will drag in real
close and we'll see what that does to
the animation
so as you can see we can play around
quite a bit with these key frames to
create different types of animations
basically so that it can really affect
quite a bit the outcome of the animation
so let me go ahead and stop this I don't
quite like that this one is still
visible and this one's not so let me go
ahead hit stop there see this one in the
middle ends pretty quick
alright I think that's better I play
perfect alright so I'm also going to
drag in this just a little bit more all
right cool all right so now we're gonna
consider the animation complete now
here's one thing to note if you wanted
to move the actual layers around that
would throw the positions of these off
these arrows and the animation so to get
around that once you're certain you know
this is what you want and I would also
save this and save a backup copy of this
just in case in the future you wanted to
actually edit the animation because once
we go over here on this little icon in
the bottom and click on it we'll see
this will convert the timeline to a
frame animation so the timeline for key
frames will be emulated in the frame
image but it'll not be preserved so
basically this is a destructive way we
won't be able to reanimate these things
again so just hit continue and now we
have all of these key frames they're my
key frames but frames rather I and if we
hit play it'll go through them kind of
slowly but to see it real time we can go
to file save for web and go to gif right
here and if you hit play you'll see how
it goes through takeoff transparency
oops real quickly I wanted to show and I
wanted to kind of these zoom out here I
wanted to show what this looks like I'm
perhaps like on a web form or house it
would be used on a web page so to design
that we could go ahead real quick select
on the background layer take on yeah
we're gonna leave it on the rectangle
tool and I will create now maybe a
little bit taller around here I'm gonna
take the background actually and change
that
come over here can't see it because it
is beneath and it needs to change here
make this a little stand out a little
bit more
and I want to take all of these frames
holding shift and oops
will select all of these this they
basically all the server layers and
let's position them right here will take
downloading right here
you want to move these down just a tad
bit more and real quick for the
rectangle one layer I'll just do a outer
glow' change this real quick all right
hit okay all right so now if we go ahead
and view this basically I did a shortcut
for file save for web go to gif and
let's hit forever for the looping
options now we can see it looks like we
have an issue on one of the frames
let me find where that's at I can't so
basically you have to find the frame in
which this right there for me it's for
26 I unfortunately have that got screwed
up I'm just gonna take it and throw it
away so now if we just go to safer web
forever and then now you can't even tell
so obviously you wouldn't really save
this this is just for kind of
presentation what you would do if you
really wanted to use it as a loading
icon' what I would do is go to file save
this and then save another copy so I'm
gonna save it over here and then what
you would do is go ahead and take go to
image canvas size change this to pixels
back to 128 to 128 hit OK and proceed
then I would take all of my frames here
along with the layers over here move
these into position all right that looks
good
and then go ahead to file save for web
changes to gif
and then save it out and we see it is 20
KB and you can mess around with the
options here to make that a little bit
less in file size and that is basically
it alright so hopefully enjoy the
tutorial as always check out design
course comm gonna have courses there
very soon if they're not already up and
check us out on Facebook as always all
the links to the social accounts are in
the description below this video
alright so I'm here time and I'll see
you tomorrow
