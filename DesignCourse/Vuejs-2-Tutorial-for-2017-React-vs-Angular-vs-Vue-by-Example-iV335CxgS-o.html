we're going to go ahead and get focused
first on view J s so if you're just
hopping in here without having watched
the first section where we did the
prototype design and mock-up in Adobe XD
then just as a real quick refresher we
basically designed a landing page and
this landing page is going to serve as
the foundation from which we compare
react versus angular versus view so like
I said we're going to get started with
view here first we're going to start
with installation the various
installation methods that you can use
all the way to the HTML sass and getting
actually tying in to a JSON API that
we're going to pull data from and pull
it into our FAQ page that we designed
alright so let's go ahead and get
started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're going to find a bunch
of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost of buying me
like x-pac each month that's it
now also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube to be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on alright let's get back to it all
right so we're going to go ahead and get
up and running and get started with a
view Jas first for our comparison
project now getting started with UJS and
installing it is pretty straightforward
and like other JavaScript frameworks
you're able to install it through
several different methods alright so the
first is installing vgs with a CDN which
is a content delivery network this
allows you to use the HTML script tag to
use view within your project and it's
pretty quick and easy way of getting up
and running
the recommended CDN to use is mentioned
on the written version of this tutorial
which you can find in the description
here on youtube if you're watching at
youtube or on corsetry page where the
course is located at alright so I you
can find the exact script source you
know equals here as well as the written
tutorial we're not going to use this
method though for this course so because
we're going to be using nodejs and we
can install it so the other two options
are installing vgs through NP
which is a node package manager and you
can install through the command line and
this is ideal when you have a more
robust project or an existing project
that you wish to integrate view with as
view is really just relegated to the
view now you must have no js' installed
along with NPM as well so we're going to
need to check this so to check if you
have it installed if you're not sure and
then command-line just type in node - V
and then also NPM - V and it should spit
out version numbers now if not then you
need to install it and you have to go to
node.js org right here downloads and
choose either the Windows or Mac
installer run through all the default
options by default the node package
manager
NPM will be included and install it and
then simply reload or close down your
console your command line and go back
and run these two commands and they
should be there the command to simply
run it after you have installed which
we're not going to actually run it but I
wanted to show you is MPM install view
and then save it as I in your package
Jason if you already have your project
set up now we're not going to use this
method the third method that we're going
to use is installing vgs with the view
command-line interface or CLI and it
makes it quick and easy just to start up
a view project with basic scaffolding in
place and it provides you with several
options that you can also use to set up
routing and such so this is the
installation method that I mentioned
that we're going to use for our project
here so to get started in the command
line head over to where of you store
your code projects at and we're going to
run NPM install global and view - CLI so
the package is called view - CLI and
we're using a the global flag to make
sure that we only have to install this
once on our machine so it's going to run
through I'm going to pause it until it's
finished
alright so it's done here and to access
the CLI all we have to do is type in
view and you hit enter it will give you
commands and options
now the
is not a lot here I so it's fairly
straightforward just to get started so
to start a new project it have been view
in it and basically is the command for
generating a new project from a template
we're going to specify webpack which is
a build tool for handling add sets and
then the project name so I'm going to
name mine simply compare pipe and view
and that's the naming convention that
we're going to use for react and angular
as well for the project names a little
bit later on in this course alright so
when you run this it's going to give you
a series of prompts all right so we can
see in the parentheses this is what it
will enter if you just hit the enter key
so we're just gonna leave these all
typical alright so now we also have the
view build and the one that it's
defaulted on is the run tile time plus
compiler which is recommended for most
users I you can use your keyboards up
and down arrow keys to toggle on between
these we're just going to use the one
that's recommended for most users now do
we want to install the view router
we're going to hit Y for yes simply
because we do intend on having a FAQ
page which we already designed earlier
in the course in Adobe XD alright do you
want to use es Lent to let your code we
don't want linting we don't want any
type of testing so I'm going to hit n
for the next three questions alright and
there we go so after that all we have to
do is CD in to our new project folder
alright and we run npm install as the
CEO I simply generates our package
adjacent based on our information up
here then we have to run NPM install and
this is unlike for instance the angular
command-line interface where it runs npm
install for you automatically alright so
it is finished and at that point your
project is ready to go and we can run a
another command to actually make the
project show up live in the browser and
it will automatically rebuild and reload
the bread
upon certain file changes while you
develop your app so the commander run is
NPM Ron dev which I will have ran as we
develop this project so that we could
see it in the browser based on the
changes so it just loaded up it
automatically launches whatever your
default browser is I'll drag it over
here real quickly and this is our basic
view project right here awesome
so in the next section we're going to go
ahead and get started and actually begin
developing our app based on the mock-up
that we produced earlier in the course
here in Adobe XD ok so in this section
we're going to take a look at the basic
structure of a view project and also
really pay attention to components and
how they work so the first file that's
worth taking a look at is right here at
index.html alright so the thing to
really pay attention to is div ID is app
alright so this kind of serves as the
entry point of the app and everything in
terms of the view its going to place
within this div ID now we also have to
pay attention to the name that ID is
bound to so outside of that let's go to
the source and then the next file we
want to take a look at to understand is
main jas so we're importing view and app
and the router because we did specify we
want the router for our project next we
create a new view app by running new
view and an element is bound to the app
ID and this is corresponding to this
right here and then we're passing in the
router and then the template is app and
the component is app and this is in
relation to this imported line right
here so this is corresponding to this
file right here which is app view
alright so this is a basic component and
this is the entry point of our app so we
have three different sections components
have templates we have this script which
defines the
logic of our app and then we have
styling for our Styles all right
so very simple to understand everything
is contained within the single file for
each component and they are reusable all
right so the thing that we want to do
here I is open up components so we have
a default hello dot view that the CLI
generates and again the same situation
we have a template we have a script for
any of our logic and then we have our
styles so for our app that we design in
Adobe XD just to take a quick look at it
again to help us understand so we have
to look at this layout in terms of their
the structure and how we want to
structure the components so if you want
to think about it this way we have the
main app component that we just covered
which is app view and think of it as
being an all-encompassing component that
will contain everything and then we must
decide okay what about this navigation
or this header should that have its own
component or not I will also need to
think about the fact that we do intend
on having you know multiple pages we
design one of them which is the fact
page right here I basically this content
right here all this stuff is unique as
well as all of this content over here is
unique so each of these which will call
this home will have its own component as
well as FAC will also have its own
component now the header of the
navigation bar up here as well as the
footer are elements that we want to
remain on the page at all time despite
you know which page they happen to be on
alright so let's go ahead and create our
home component and our fact component
and then we'll also a little bit in the
next lesson where we'll go ahead and
start doing the HTML for our header up
here
and we'll see that we'll be able to
declare the template for the header and
the footer right within our app view
because notice we have this tag called
rel router - view and this is where our
components will be put into for our home
and also our FAQ ok so let's go ahead
I'm going to take this hello view I'm
going to right-click it and just rename
it and we're going to call this home now
if you're running the NPM rum dev
command the app will break at this point
because we're in renaming files but
we'll address that a little bit later we
can go ahead and get everything between
these two HTML elements we want to live
to leave the div class hello here as
well as the Tempah template otherwise
they won't break all right so we're just
going to call this one home or I'll just
put in home there just temporarily we're
going to rename it here to home we'll
rename this class to home I don't need
any data right now so we can just get
rid of that all right that's good let's
go ahead and save this and let's go
ahead and also create a new file we're
going to name this FAQ you go back to
our home just going to copy hit ctrl a
and then ctrl C and then paste
everything in here and for this one
again I will just make this fact the
name is going to be FAC will change this
inner text real quickly just to the fact
right there and go ahead and save
alright so next we need to go into our
router so we have a router index file
right here and this is where we define
the paths or the URLs along with which
component they are associated with and
their names so we don't have a hello
component anymore we have home I'll just
copy and paste this here
and we'll copy this and then also import
FAQ all right so this is starting a path
for the root of our app we're going to
make this home we're going to put a
comma after this first object and create
a second one and this will lead to FAQ
and the name of course is FAQ right here
and here and that's it so this is where
you set up all your individual routes a
new viewer to fully build out this app
of course you would have more objects
here do define the other pages so that
looks good right here so let's go ahead
and save and now make sure you have your
NPM run dev command going and here at
localhost 8080 we'll see that we have
just this logo because we haven't
removed it from the template but we see
we have home which is being put in the
router view and then also if we go to
FAQ we'll see it changes to FAQ all
right so that's basically how the view
application works in terms of basic
setup and as well as the router and the
components now of course we're going to
get into much more in-depth topics
regarding those two aspects so in the
next section we're going to get focused
on integrating good Balma CSS framework
and also probably begin writing out the
HTML for our header alright alright so
let's go ahead and get our Balma CSS
framework installed so with Balma you
can include it with a script tag in HTML
or you can use NPM to install it so
we're going to use that method so by the
way Mike the console that I'm using is
called CMD ER right up here if you can
see that the heading there I and you can
right click at the bottom and create a
new console so I've done that already as
you can see right here so I am leaving
this NPM run dev up here open creating a
second one
just so I don't have to keep on running
that I just to run some an additional
command to NPM install our balda so real
quickly in the project folder will type
in NPM install Balma and then save it as
a dependency in our package of JSON
alright so once that is finished we'll
go back to our app here and balm and now
is installed here in a Balma folder and
we don't really don't need to worry
about that but that's where it's located
so to get started we have to actually
import it and where we're going to
import it is within our basic our
starting app here component and so the
way you define this is we have two
different steps to concern ourselves
with so at the very top we're going to
put this command which is at import and
then the location now notice it's a sass
file Balma does also include a CSS
version as well if you just navigate to
the node modules bulma folder you'll be
able to find out the exact location of
that folder but we're going to use sass
so that we can harness the power of sass
if you wish now this won't work if we
save it instead right here in this style
tag we have to add length equals sass
now once we do this we can see that we
have some issues here because sass does
not use these semicolons in these
brackets so we delete these and by the
way we're not be going to need these
anyways but I'll go ahead and just save
it anyhow now if we check out the
browser we see we have an issue module
not found can't resolve sass loader so
because we're using sass we have to run
NPM again to install an additional
package now in order to get this work we
asked to actually install three
different packages so NPM install node -
sass sass loader and style loader so
style loader
save dev to save it as a development
dependency all right we'll go back to
the other console and run npm run dev if
you already have it running just hit
control-c and hit y and then run npm run
dev and it will bring back up our
project
so now Bhama is actually loaded here but
I can't tell but the font does change
slightly okay so I we're going to go
ahead back here to our project I'm gonna
hit ctrl B to get up our sidebar and
we're going to create a new sass file
just here in the source folder so we'll
go ahead and type in mq sass so the mq
is I just short term for media query you
can name whatever you want and right off
the bat we're going to create just a
couple variables and here in sass as
well as I copied and we're going to
paste some different mix ins that we can
use to designate for viewports like
mobile tablet tablet only desktop
desktop only so I first is just a
primary color which is that sort of like
that teal color and then next I'm just
going to copy and paste and by the way I
copied and pasted this from some of the
sass files from the Bhama
folder in the node modules so I'm tablet
desktop widescreen full HD this is just
designating the sizes of all them and
then I'm going to finally copy and paste
in I these mix-ins right here for mobile
tablet tablet only desktop and desktop
only and you'll see how we can we will
eventually utilize these when we start
writing out just a little bit of custom
CSS going on in the future all right so
we'll save this we're going to go back
to our app view and we're going to
import it all right so to import it
again very simple
we'll just go ahead and type at import
MQ alright we'll say that I'm going to
copy and we're going to go to our home
view and again we want to make sure
style Lang equals sass is added here as
well we can just delete all this stuff
for now and we're going to import that
and by the way we have to change that
because we're up one folder there save
that copy this go back to our FAQ style
equals Lang oops sorry
laying equals sass rather and import our
media queries so we'll save alright
awesome so now based on our mock up in
the next section we're going to go ahead
and start writing out the HTML for our
navigation here okay so let's go ahead
in our source and we're going to just
follow right here in the app to view and
this is where the HTML and associated
CSS is going to be placed for the header
portion so this router view we're going
to leave it here however we're going to
get rid of this image source okay so
right now it would be worth referring
back to the Balma CSS documentation to
see if there's any specific elements
that are already in place for something
like a navigation bar or a header okay
so here I am at Balma I owe for its last
documentation overview start okay so if
we click on the Layout tab we can see we
don't have anything here we do have like
a hero section will use that eventually
as well as a footer section if we click
on components though we can see we have
a nav section all right so we did refer
back to this earlier in the course when
we were working with an Adobe XD to see
kind of you know how the default navbar
is laid out which is right here so it
gives you
example HTML to use and to refer to
based on your particular needs so I
pretty much followed this you know
relatively closely however I did adapt
it you know to go from something like
this to something like this up here at
the top as you can see they're basically
the same almost okay so I let's go ahead
and get started writing out our HTML
control B just give er to that side bar
and alright so the first element that
we're going to add is a class of nav so
div class equals nav and a helper class
we can actually add a shadow' with has -
shadow and this is optional you don't
have to add it but it's just barely
noticeable so I'm choosing to add it and
then inside of here we have div class
container and container is also specific
to Balma and it's defined and it adds a
you know a centered container from which
you can place all of your content now
you probably want to add that if you
wanted a fluid width layout alright next
here is also specific to the nav
component so do class it goes nav left
and this is going to hold our logo so
we're going to put in a class nav item
and this is another item or class rather
that we add for individual items like
logo the individual elements for our
links and such so my company all right
so just after the closing tag of nav
left we're going to add in a span class
of nav toggle so span class equals nav -
toggle and this is for the hamburger
icon menu and the way to have that set
up is inside we have three additional
spans which serve as each of the three
horizontal lines that make that icon up
so there's a spans opened and closed so
copy that paste it three times we will I
come back to this though
to make it actually work and add some
view specific functionality there but
we're going to leave it like that for
now so div class oops
div class equals nav right and now pipe
and menu again we're going to come back
to this and that sub I view specific
stuff inside of that particular class
all right and next here is where we have
our four links right here so home about
features and FAQ so ordinarily you would
use like an a href or like an ordered
list or something but for us we're going
to be using some specific to view which
is router link so router - link all
right - and you can think of this kind
of like the href so we have our first
one is going to be home but first let's
add a class of nav item and I'm going to
add my own class of our - item and we'll
define that later on
alright so router link so now we take
this and we copy and paste it we have
four primary links there each one of
these for now I'm just going to make
them all point to fact because I'm not
creating the other pages it would be a
little bit redundant for the purpose of
this course so features about and FAQ
alright and then we also have an
additional button so div class equals
nav - item and again I got most of this
sy this scaffolding if you will from the
example on the NAP component page that
we just took a look at Bulma died oh so
we add p class equals control
and here we have a class equals button
is - primary is for designating the
primary color I that's associated with
our theme here so we're going to make
that that button the primary color and
also is outlined and this is a class
that makes it so that the button is not
outlined because if you recall right
here we made it kind of Hollow
well not kind of hollow it is hollow so
let's come down here and close that a
tag here and then we put in inside of
the button a span class of icon close
that out and also I class equals FA for
font awesome and FA - download now we
didn't actually include font awesome yet
so let's do that just in a second let's
create the actual text which is span
join now and let's save it now if we
refer back to the browser at this point
if you have NPM run dev already ran
you'll see we have the basic structure
here we do have a little bit of a margin
or padding up there we'll figure that
out but we can see we don't have the
actual icon
showing up so let's go ahead and fix
that real quick if you go back to the
Balma io documentation we'll see that at
the bottom we have fun awesome we need
to include this in our index.html so
copy that
you'll be index just I right here just
above the closing head tag we'll save it
and there we go and check this out
awesome
so obviously the color is not correct
but we will correct that and decide top
section right here for God it's based on
the CLI generating some CSS there which
we didn't get rid of yet so let's I go
back real quick to our app view
and all this stuff we're just going to
get it so let's get rid of that now we
go back and we could see that that's
much better okay let's do some real
quick a CSS slash sass to get this thing
working a little bit better looking a
little bit better more consistent with
our mock-up so I'm just kind of dragging
this over and we'll see you can get away
with just doing a kind of a split screen
so you can see how it updates as we
write our CSS so we're going to
reference the nav class and we're going
to make the background and make sure you
indent this correctly as that's how sass
works background color will make it
three eight three eight three eight and
that's you can grab that color code by
the way from our mock-up that's what I
used all right save it you see how that
updates we're also going to add we're
going to reference rather the links
inside of it in the hover state so a
hover hit enter and tab in we're going
to make them grey because right now if
you hover over them like that make sure
you space that up otherwise we won't
work now we're pretty much staying the
same next we also have our let's see
here
now if - left a so we're going to style
the logo and we're going to come in and
we're going to make it white and also
we're going to make it
font-weight:bold there we go
additionally we're going to reference
the links with a class of our - item
which is a custom class that's not
defined in Balma but one that we're
going to do instead we're going to make
the color c1 c1 c1 so we'll save that
just to make these pop out a little bit
more next we're going to give them a
padding so the padding will be 0.5 Ram
on the top and then 1.75 REMS on the
bottom I'll save it so it's going to
space them out a little bit more and
then also just for mobile only or so
we're going to add mobile here with the
plus we're going to make the color grey
and their hover state sorry about that
and cool and hover give us some space
here going to make the background color
really light so f1f1f1 we can't really
see this yet because the navigation
isn't responsive when we can't see that
but I will get to that momentarily all
right so I'm going to go ahead and save
and that's good for now
so in the next section we're going to
focus on getting this responsive
navigation actually working and if you
look right here we could see we click on
it nothing happens alright so let's go
ahead and get this responsive navigation
working we can see it does toggle back
and forth but if you click on it it
doesn't work it's also not styled very
well can't really see it so let's go
ahead and address those issues so I'm
going to expand this just full width for
now and in your app view we're going to
focus on our span class snap toggle so
this is the actual hamburger eye menu
that you saw now we have to add a V on
click and V on by the way is specific to
view J s and it's a directive so V - on
and on what well click and we set a
method here so we'll just call this
toggle nav alright so when this
hamburger icon menu is clicked it's
going to call toggle nav and we'll
define that momentarily we're also going
to add the V - bind directive
and we could choose style or class here
so we'll choose class equals and inside
of this object we're going to make a
class called is - active to show or bind
it to the state of is active and that's
a property that we will set in the
component class so what's going to
happen here is when this is clicked it's
going to add or remove is active from
this class right here and the reason we
do is active is if we refer back to our
documentation of bulma we go to our nav
section so we go to components now it's
going to tell you for responsiveness to
additional classes are available we have
nap toggle for the hamburger menu on
mobile nav menu from the menu that's
collapsible on mobile and we toggle
right here is active which is what we're
doing now in the code on nav toggle
which is just down here right there and
nav menu when nap toggle was clicked
okay so a little bit confusing but
you'll see how it works here we also add
the same thing right here so we're going
to copy this and on our nav menu we're
going to toggle on is active on this
element based on whether it is clicked
or not up here all right so let's go
ahead and save that it's not going to
work yet we have to go down to the
script section which is where the
component logic resides so we're going
to add in two different properties here
and that's going to be data function
we're going to return is active because
that's what we're referencing here in
the template and we're going to set it
to false by initial initially after this
right here we're going to put in a comma
we're going to add another
object rather an object or methods
rather and ours is called toggle nav and
we pass in this or reference rather is
active equals oops this dot is active
and that will toggle between true and
false so let's go ahead and save that
we'll go back to our project now if we
click it look at that so you can see we
have our custom CSS where we added the
light gray background and change the
color of these a little bit so now that
is all working real quickly let's just
add the CSS to make that more noticeable
because it's pretty much cannot see it
at the moment so let's go ahead back
down here and we reference nav - toggle
span which is for each of those three
lines and the background color we're
going to set to the c1 c1 c1 so now we
go back if I can find it there we go now
we could see it cool so now in the next
section we're going to get focused on
adding real quickly our footer just down
here once the foot is done then we'll
focus on the home component and the fact
component and by the way the fact
component we're not just going to
hard-code this all this stuff in here
we're going to pull from a public API
just so I can show you how to do that
and also we can how we can see the
differences between our react view and
an angular ok so now let's go ahead and
work on this footer that we have down
here it's obviously very simple we'll
just use font awesome for these two
icons instead of two different columns
here and just have a single paragraph of
text will also add the quick
sorry about that quick I CSS right here
alright
so let's come back up here now remember
this is the router view this is where
our components for home and fact will
reside so we can just go underneath this
and put in our footer because we want
our footer to be always be displayed as
well so let's go ahead and write out the
CSS for that and as well there is a
footer in the layouts section or the tab
of the Balma to Iowa documentation so
you can get you can reference that if
you want on your own what we make a
footer tag or element with a class of
footer and color is primary div class
here it's container because we want
everything in the side of a container
and then inside of here div class equals
columns because we have columns in that
container and then also div class equals
column inside of here is where our first
paragraph goes and I'm going to paste in
just off-screen coffee off screen some
text here and then we have a second one
you can get rid of this also we're going
to add a helper class has - text - right
and this is from Palma just to write a
line text and then we're going to add in
two links for social icons so a class
equals icon href not going anywhere
because it is fictional I class equals
font awesome and then font awesome -
Facebook which is the name of it
and we want to go ahead and copy this
paste it and this is going to be renamed
to Twitter and we'll save if we go back
we can see that the default color here I
is just a very light gray so you can't
really see it but here are two icons so
let's go ahead and fix up this
formatting just a little bit so we'll go
back go to the Style section it really
is only just a few different things here
so we'll have in passing our footer
background color is going to be the
primary and we're going to make this
important oops
and add an important here color is going
to be white all right and then we're
also going to reference the icons we're
going to make them a color of white and
a margin left of 20 pixels just to move
them away from each other so we'll save
that and there we go now obviously it's
all scrunched up up here at the top
because our home content is just this
home text so that's what we're going to
focus on in the next section so let's
focus on taking this and making it look
like this in a project okay so now we're
pretty much done working within our view
our main app view so what we want to do
now is get our toolbar our sidebar up go
into components and work on our home
view so as you can see it's very spares
so what we're going to do is refer back
real quickly to our Balma documentation
and we can see on the layout there is a
hero section so the hero section is this
portion right here that's called a hero
section tada so exciting
five so they have a some predefined CSS
for us based on these hero sections so
you can refer to that as you wish
but that is roughly what I'll be using
this styling right here but we're going
to make some adjustments of course to
make it custom so let's go back get
removed rid of home here and section
class equals hero and inside of it we're
going to put in div class equals hero -
body not her body to use how am I
thinking about
and then div class equals container and
inside of there we have our h1 class is
title and again this is specific to
Bulma and just for the fun of it we'll
use interpolation here so heading
interpolation by the way is just to show
I basically a property or a variable
that's defined here in our component so
I just want to show you how that's done
it's very simple basic stuff all right
and then also we're going to have div
class equals is - - - thirds column and
is - padding list all right so there's
three different things happening here is
two thirds so what is that exactly we
haven't really encountered the column
structuring yet so if we go back to the
Balma CSS we'll see if we go all the way
back up to the grid we'll find that we
have all of our grid classes so we can
see is 2/3 is one of them and the reason
we're adding that to that specific class
or that HTML element is because we have
right here this subheading and notice we
just don't we don't want it to go all
the way across so that's why we say is
2/3 all right and then also we also had
a helper class there as I is padding
list and column is what you
always add to individual columns
contained within a columns div
essentially all right so now inside of
here this is going to be h2 and this is
class equals subtitle and is - 4 will
also use interpolation call this
subheading which will recreate and the
the logic section down below all right
after that we're going to have a call to
action button so we're going to put a
class button again this is from Balma so
they have a button section which you can
check out we're going to add is large
which is also from Balma and is primary
to make it the primary color that we
were using in our app ID we're going to
make this learn that's custom and then
learn more all right great
so that concludes this the hero section
so if we save this let's go ahead first
before we check anything out and let's
create the two properties that we
referenced so after name we're going to
put in data we're going to return an
object consisting of heading soaring to
new heights I believe is what we used
and then also a subheading and this is
just our lorem ipsum text so i'm going
to copy that and paste it from
off-screen so we'll save that and we'll
go back to our app there we go so we
have some issues here with margin and
padding we don't have our background
here either
so let's go ahead and remedy that real
quickly so we put in our assets just
right here a source assets 4 so our
image by the way we don't need this so
we'll delete that momentarily so you
want to open up the project files that
we had with the clouds JPEG and you can
just copy and paste that in where this
needs to be so I'm going to right click
and reveal an explorer
and drag this over here assets I'm going
to get another one up alright so here's
my project folder with resources I'm
going to take clouds and just put it
right there
delete logo and we'll go back oh yeah
it's not going to show up because we
haven't yet done the CSS for that so
let's go ahead and do that real quick so
we'll come down here we're going to
reference the hero class the background
is going to be URL and this is coming
out a folder two assets clouds JPEG
we're also going to make the background
size cover so it expands the entire size
and then that's good right there we're
also going to reference the title inside
of it and fix some issues here so on
mobile we want the font weight to be
bold on tablet we're going to make the
font size 2.5 REMS and then on desktop
we're going to make the font size large
larger than it is by default of 4 rams
and then margin top is 2 revs we're also
going to real quickly reference the h2
which is the subtitle and we're going to
change the margin there so 1.5 rims on
the top 0 on the right 2 rounds on the
bottom and 0 on the left and we're going
to add important here to make sure this
works so we'll go back there we go much
much better so we click on FAQ for
instance we'll see it instantly loads
our fat component and there we go all
right so the next section we're going to
focus on the secondary content which is
this stuff just down here and then the
home component will be complete all
right so now let's go ahead
go back and control B just so you have a
little bit more space and just
underneath this closing section tag
we're going to add another section so
section class equals section inside of
here we're going to have a div class
container inside of here we're going to
have a div class of columns
IPD is going to be padding that's a
custom class we're going to create and
then is desktop and that is specific
from Balma now also inside of here we're
going to have a div class of column so
this is a column inside of columns so
this is one and this is some reference
to that little cog icon that we have so
is one by the way is another way to
structure the columns you can either put
out like is 2/3 or is - 1 through 12 so
it's only one column so we're going to
put is - 1 and then has text centered in
order to Center that clog in there all
right I so inside of there we put in our
I for the actual font awesome icon F
acog is the name if you recall and then
is primary alright
then next we have another column just to
save ourselves a little bit of time I'll
copy this and this second column we're
going to make is is - 1 - third -
desktop all right so that's also there
in the grid section of the Balma
documentation so adding a device like
desktop here after the column size will
make it specific only to that actual
device size all right so inside of here
this is where we're going to put in just
a peek class
of title and we make it bold
because if you recall this is what it
looks like right here you can just copy
this stuff paste it in actually let's
close out the closing P tag real quick
and inside of here we'll paste that and
then finally we'll copy this one more
column and this we just simply put in
column it's one of the advantage of a
flexbox base layout we can get rid of
this class here and the strong we're
going to simply paste in some of that
lorem ipsum text that we have so I
copied off-screen paste that in there
like that all right so let's save and
this is what that looks like so it does
need a little bit of work which will fix
in CSS momentarily so let's keep on
going and focus on the testimonials
right here all right so after that part
we're not going to create a new section
we're just going to add just beneath the
closing section right here div class
equals columns I'm going to put our PD
class which we reference shortly div
class equals column sorry about that
alright and then this is also specific
to Balma so we created that card layout
so if we go back to the documentation we
go up to elements I believe it's in
elements no maybe it's in components
there we go
card here's all the information you need
to know about that
so it gives you different HTML scenarios
based on this result if you want that
type of card or this type of card or
this type of card which is more specific
to what we want although we're not going
to have share buttons or anything like
that nobody wants to share testimonials
so let's go back here
and the structure is div class card
inside of here we have div class equals
card - content and then just start to
text-based elements so p class equals
title and I'll just close this out
temporarily and then p class equals
subtitle I'm just going to put in Gary
Simon so off screen I'm simply going to
copy and paste in I just died some
default text let me go back to XD
actually and do that and this goes right
here put a dash in front of my name and
then we're going to copy and paste
everything from column that ends right
there two more times so we have a total
of three of them so we'll save that and
with any luck if your div structure is
all correct this is what we should have
so it kind of looks a little bit silly
padding is not very good so let's fix
that with CSS come down here and
underneath our h2 we're going to
reference our COG because if you look at
back at the cog real quick it doesn't
look very good so small and ugly looking
so let's go ahead and fix that fa - cog
is a class that's attached to it
font size we're going to make it 40
pixels and then learn that was a custom
ID that we added and desktop only we're
going to make a margin bottom of two
REMS let me save this just so we can see
the result there we go kind of push
things down from the learn more button
right there to give it more even spacing
alright let's also
friends are PD class and I'll be the
final element so on tablet only it's
going to be a padding of 2 a.m. and 0 or
tablet in above rather which is pretty
much everything so there we go spaces
everything out awesome so I now let's
check it and see how it looks and
responds on mobile great works well
alright so in the next section we're
going to focus on this FAQ page right
here all right so let's go ahead and
make this ultimately look like this over
here ok so let's go ahead and get our
sidebar up with Patrol be click on our
fact and get started on that so there's
less quite a bit less CSS right here or
HTML rather than the other wat other
home component so I we're going to gut
out the FAC name right there we're going
to put in div class of container because
we want everything kind of centered
within that containing element we're
going to add section class equals
section again that's coming from Bulma
inside of here we're going to add our h1
class equals title make it back and then
also h2 for a subtitle class is subtitle
and is for and that's for a size so I'm
just going to type in real quickly
warum if some and all of that jazz
alright and then after it we're going to
have our column so div class equals
columns we're going to add a V if
actually and we're going to use also V
for directive to iterate through a
public API just to show you how that's
done but let's get the HTML ready first
so div class equals member column so you
start off with columns and then you add
a column and is one-third because we
have three of these which a lot of
twelve inside of here we're going to use
cards again so div class equals card
we're going to have Dib class equals
card - content and then inside of here
we're going to have P class equals title
I'm just going to put my title for now
we'll use interpolation momentarily and
then answer oops not yet my answer there
we go so we save that head on over to
our app here there we go we got there
FAQ subtitle my title and my answer so
let's go ahead and actually pull from a
public API it's called Jason placeholder
IQ but I've used it before in other
tutorials with angular it just allows
you to just pull in some mock i jason
data like comments and pictures and
posts and all that stuff i so to do that
we're going to use an HTTP library that
works well with view called Axios so to
do that we're going to use npm to
install it so let's go back to our
console we're going to type in MPM
install
Axios and save it alright once that's
complete we'll go back to our project
and just after the script tag we're
going to import it so we import Axios
from Axios very simple alright next here
in our exports we're going to have after
name we're going to have data and this
is an arrow function which we can use
and we can pass in facts
our name it facts as an array and also
if we have any errors as well after that
we're going to put in a comma and on the
created method for a life cycle so when
this components gets created then it's
going to call upon
Axios so Axios get method and then we
pass in the URL that we want let me just
show you the site real quickly that
we're going to access this from just for
your reference so this is a site here's
the URL if you want to visit and it's
basically just a fake online REST API
for testing and prototyping and it gives
you the resources that you can access
right here so we're going to use posts
which simply has a title and a body that
we can access which we will so real
quick let's close that out and I'm going
to paste that in actually inside HTTP
paste that in and then posts alright and
then we reference then all right the
response and we're going to make it a
reference our FAQs this F acts equals
the response data I mentioned on a site
it returns like 100 results we don't
want that many so we're going to use a
slice method to return just the first 10
all right and then optionally we can
catch it here E and this errors dot push
e all right
so let's go ahead and save that and up
here we have to do a little bit of work
with our view directives so first we say
V if facts and so we put double
ampersand fax length next we put over
here V - for back of facts now we
reference back here through
interpolation so for the title well
in double curly braces fact title copy
this real quick and then also fact dot
body so we'll save and there we go so
there's an issue where based on flexbox
there's no wrapping right now so it's
kind of just this ten results are just
flying off the side so let's go ahead
and fix up that with some real quick CSS
so we'll come down here and we're going
to reference real quickly our PD oats
padding rather 2.5 a.m. 0 1.5 em0 and
then also our answer margin top is 10
pixels so we're just kind of pushing it
away from the question and make it also
gray not Gary gray Jesus and then also
finally columns will fix that issue with
the wrapping we place in flexwrap we
want it to wrap so let's save it and go
back and there we go awesome awesome
awesome alright so that's how you create
a very simple app here using view J s so
hopefully that gave you enough I kind of
experience or to get your feet wet with
a view J s app and now in the next
portion of this course we're going to
focus on recreating the same exact app
with our FAQ page and pulling in from an
API both within angular and also react</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
