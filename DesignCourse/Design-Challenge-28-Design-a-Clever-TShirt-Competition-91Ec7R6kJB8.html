welcome to design challenge number 28
and that's to design a witty / clever
t-shirt concept now this is an exciting
challenge because I'm going to actually
choose a winner this time instead of
just reviewing them and not and what's
also exciting is based on whoever
becomes the winner i'm going to send out
a t-shirt with your concept on it so you
can wear it proudly all right so there's
also a small chance that Glenn Jones of
Glenn's that's GL e NN z com I who's a
great t-shirt designer may be the person
who picks the winning design i've sent
out an email we'll see if that happens
or not so i'm going to go ahead and
switch over to the desktop and we'll
review more of the details please watch
this portion alright alright so this is
the challenge thread here design a witty
tech t-shirt alright so the objective is
design a witty / clever t-shirt based on
around the concept of web design
development programming etc now Glenn's
teas right here these type of concepts
are the concepts I'm looking for
something that's just very simple unique
and clever so you can browse through
some of these and you know just to get
an idea of what I'm looking for you know
Moore's one down here there's a pretty
good one it kind of relates to thee it's
a tech industry you have the standard I
low battery iOS thing going on with a
coffee cup so very unique I these are
the type of concepts that I'm looking
for basically so the concept must be
clever and thought-provoking obviously
and it must have relevance to the
Internet tech industry use illustrator
preferably or another truly vector
software now you can use Photoshop but
only if you stick to using shape layers
and not raster layers because we want to
be able to sighs sighs this up large
enough for it to get printed on a
t-shirt so don't use any gradients
pebbles or bosses think flat colors like
the concepts at glance oh please I don't
want any gradients or smooth transitions
from pixels from one color or whatever
don't do it if you do i'm not going to
read
you your submission so consider this the
warning submission deadline as always
Sunday that's going to be June twenty
eighth in this case in choosing a winner
okay so as always i'm going to review
the shirt this coming Monday which would
be the 29th I will choose the concept
that I think is best from all the
entries submitted now if there are two
or more entries that are too close for
me to choose i will upload another
YouTube video in which I will ask you to
vote on those entries so I'll probably
use some type of service that allows
public voting and it'll be like a pole
alright so the winner will need to send
me the graphic file whether that's an
preferably something like an AI or an
eps and i'll upload it to an apparel
service that allows people to order
shirts so there's a lot of those
floating around I'm not sure which one I
want to use if you want to make a
suggestion go ahead and then i will then
advertise that shirt with its own
YouTube video that I upload to my
channel and also advertising the
Facebook and Twitter after 30 days i
will send half of the money that's
generated to you the winner whoever that
happens to be so it could be nobody
might order i'm not even sure if it 20
people order it you know and when it
making 200 bucks or whatever i'll split
that inside you the breast so i'll also
pay for one shirt which will be sent to
the winning designer so that they can
wear their own design now note i will be
participating in this competition I'm
going to making my own concept for this
if in case i see no entries that are
good enough in that case i'm going to
choose my own design and i will simply
choose a random winner from anybody who
submitted an entry to be the recipient
of the free t-shirt that is sent here so
i don't want to have to do this though
so make sure your entry is great i mean
try to really give it get it on par you
know to the type of concepts you would
see on Glen's tease all right on the
same level of quality and uniqueness and
cleverness and execution alright so
inspiration these are just suck just a
few I concepts I linked from Glen's tees
and yeah I encourage you to check out
you know the whole thing here and then
try to come up some with something on
your own that you know that's based on
web design development programming etc
alright so I'm really looking forward to
this because we I'm actually going to be
choosing a winner a lot of you have been
requesting that i do this lately and i'm
all you know you're also going
to actually receive something or win
something alright so I'm looking forward
