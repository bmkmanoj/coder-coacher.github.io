consider mspaint
as a viable alternative to traditional
UI design software like sketch and Adobe
experience design now of course if you
think this is silly
just take a look at the interface here
it has drastically improved since the
days of Windows 3.1 and I bet you
haven't even bothered checking out its
robust feature set well I did just that
and I'm going to show you just how
powerful this app has become now first
as you can see here we can choose from
millions of colors and fill a background
just as quick and easy as the
competition and notice this succeed
collection of icons you know you'll
never need more than this defining a
container with a rounded rectangle tool
check the simple type tool allows for
efficient typographic visualizations
need a hero section with this headline
or a sub headline to pries and with the
upcoming release mspaint will receive
layers though personally think layers
are cumbersome and I don't know useless
now this next part truly shows the
versatility of this application a
flexible assortment of paint brushes
that allow you to mix the worlds of
Digital 2d concept art with UI design
and you know I think this is really
going to be a trend in 2018 and really
why wouldn't it be it completely makes
sense to mix this with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
