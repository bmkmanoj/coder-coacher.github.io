court calm adobe has just released with
CC 2015 update and one of the major
updates is the integration of their
service called Adobe stock now Adobe
stock is basically a way to purchase
stock photography illustrations and
vector graphics and it's integrated
directly within Photoshop so let's
switch over to the desktop and I'll show
you exactly how to use the service
alright so let's go here to file new in
Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 and this time
I'm just going to use just a random
arbitrary size for a banner I'll say
maybe 600 by 250 and we'll hit OK and
here's our art board and we'll go ahead
and just die we'll leave it at art board
no no need to really change that so what
we'll do is I let's say for example
we're just creating a creating an
advertisement or something like that and
we want to have a picture of a car or
something like that in the background
and we're just going to have maybe just
a little bit of text and that's it so a
very minimal kind of like a billboard I
so traditionally what you would do you
would go on the web may be images Google
and you would filter by free to use or
any other number of sites like that well
what this new version of 2015 allows you
to do is we can click right over here
and we could click on this little logo
for the Creative Cloud logo we can I see
it says need content search millions of
photos at Adobe stock you can also
access the same place that this takes
you once you click it over here file
search Adobe stock so if we click on it
it will launch the browser and there we
go
very simple interface to search with and
so let's say for example we want no
illustrations or vectors we just want
photographs and we type car
okay so we can go through any number of
these and once we come to a picture that
we think will work well for a
composition we can go ahead and let's
say we'll use this one right here now
maybe maybe this one yeah we'll use this
one and all we have to do is if we want
to preview it all we could have to do is
specify save preview now this is a
library that I already created now if
you click this button if you have no
libraries existing obviously you have to
create a new one so you specify the name
here and then you can create it so mine
is test library and so I have to do is
click I save preview to test library and
now it says saved so now we can go back
to photoshop and if I click on test
library we could see we have the speed
car right here so now if I want to
actually use this just left-click and
drag it and we'll go ahead and scale
this up a bit and right around there
select move tool hit place make sure
this stays in our artboard now you can
see it does have a watermark because
this is just a preview it's meant for
you being able to test out whether or
not this particular image is going to
work so obviously if this was a real
advertisement or something you wouldn't
want this right here so what we would do
is if we go back here or go to file
search Adobe stock rather or we click on
libraries and say let's say for example
we liked that one we can go ahead and
click buy license and save to test
library now if we do that
if you don't currently have a
subscription to Adobe's stock this is
what you're going to present it be
presented with so a single image is
simply $9.99 with Adobe stock I you also
have subscription plans for ten images a
month which would be $30 which is quite
a difference because if you're to buy
ten of these would be $100 and then
there's a second one or a third one
rather 10 images a month which would be
$50 but additional images are only half
the price and roll over up to 120 images
and then the last option 750 images at
$200 a month which kind of seemed I
don't know a little strange to me to
take the the jump from 10 images to 750
but anyhow that's basically how Adobe
stock works now I need to basically say
something that I think it's really
important here Adobe stock there are
definitely cheaper alternatives out
there and there's actually free
alternatives as well now of course if
they have a great image and you're
working on a project that you really
care about and they have it ten dollars
is not very much I would definitely
purchase it but you should definitely be
aware of all the other resource sites
that exist out there so for example I I
do courses for the embody Network and
they have photo dune comm and these
images are quite a bit cheaper so let's
type in car for example and waiting for
this to load alright and let's say we
like this picture right here well they
give you some extra options first of all
you can specify the size that would be
nice if Adobe stock did that because
sometimes the only need is smaller is
you don't need a large one let's say for
example you're working on the web you
don't need like a large print one well
you could be as cheap as $1 so that's
one example about that's out there and
now there's a bunch of other examples
and I'm going to link those in the
description of YouTube here so that you
can check those out and there's a lot of
free resources
as well so hopefully you guys will find
use for that and that is it make sure
you subscribe here on youtube and
definitely check out design course comm
with the premium video courses i have
made available along with one on one
design training with myself so check
that out alright i'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
