video where we're going to finish up the
homepage mock-up for logo design Co so
this is what we have so far
basically in this area we're going to
have an area that's it's very simple so
let's just get started I'm going to take
the rectangle tool and right around here
I'm going to draw out an area around
this size and position it down just
slightly and I purchased a stock image
from 1 2 3 RF comm and it's just gonna
be like a watermark in the background so
I'm going to open that up and this is
the asset right here obviously only use
this if you have actually bothered
purchasing it but obviously hopefully
you're using your own service again you
can put something that's more relevant
in this area if you're following along
alright so I'm going to create a new
layer make it a clipping mask it okay
and yes somebody is text our instant
messaging me let me just close that not
very professional am i okay so let me I
hit control V to paste this in and I
want to get the columns out because I
don't really want this to extend too far
beyond or I don't really want to extend
it all beyond our 12 columns here ctrl T
you know right around there is good let
me let me scale it up just a little bit
okay and I'm going to go to image
adjustments desaturate and then I'm
going to I play around with the blend
mode here and just use my down arrow key
I think I already saw one I want to use
and this is gonna be multiplied and then
I'm going to drop the pasady down quite
a bit
it's right around not 29% all right and
then I'm going to take the eraser tool
and get back our columns here and then
just keep this inside here
alright alright so it looks pretty good
it blends in well and so if I scroll up
real quick I will take this right here
and duplicate that layer go up go up
come on alright we'll go over right
around here and I'm going to drag this
down okay alright now let's get started
columns out ctrl T I want this to be too
big we don't want to cover her face up
alright so now let's let me get rid of
that portion and we're gonna have a
button here the larger radius we'll try
30 make the foreground white
right around there
give me an identity control-t
and scale both of these up real quick
and actually I want to extend this out
just a little bit this is a little bit
different from what I originally
prepared night control age
all right and then I'm just going to
have like a I'm gonna take this one of
these that I created already and
duplicate it
all right and we'll drag this down oh no
I have a lot of select layers to long
and make it this color flip it
horizontal
all right let's take those three layers
and let's get the columns out cuz it's
not so even anymore basically in between
those two columns here all right and
then so this will be a button obviously
a call-to-action that people can click
to continue on with the process of
getting their project started or ordered
and then I'm going to take this same
gray up here in our foreground and
create another container except I want
to increase the canvas size here we'll
try 52 and real quick I will fill in
that background down lock it all right
lock it back up and if I select this
layer right here will select the layer
just beneath it and with our gray in the
foreground take the rectangle tool and
this will be about this size and we'll
take the ellipse tool try to find the
center here so be one two three four
five six so right here in between the
sixth and seventh I'm going to hold
shift and scale out a circle and drag
this up
it's hide that and we'll take this text
here just duplicate it real quick
or
and I want to make a couple adjustments
we're gonna extend this just a little
bit apply take these two layers when I'm
right around there and then I'm going to
duplicate this all right now texts all
right and I just basically put some
periods with a space in between each now
I've hit ctrl T hold shift and get it to
perfect vertical take the this part and
we'll get a let's see here hit ctrl T
scale it down a little bit and then
right click duplicate this make it this
color for this part
let's drag this up a little bit get rid
of a couple of these and then right here
we're going to have a phone number and
an email option for them to contact us
all right so let's go ahead and take
this layer make it a little bit further
in height and we're gonna have to do two
more custom icons real quick it's gonna
be really easy for the for the phone
number and the shoot us a message area
so let me scroll up here for the shoot
of some message we're gonna use the same
let's see let's make that we'll just
duplicate this group drag it down just
to right around here and the only
adjustment I'm going to make scale up
select layer
I'm gonna delete just this circle right
here now I'm going to take this one hit
ctrl T and just extend it out apply
right click and duplicate that and then
do it one more time
and let's see here we're also going to
do just take a phone one on the left
side for the phone and because I didn't
save a caught a backup copy of these
circles I'm just going to use one that's
going to be approximately the same type
of shape for that this circle right here
so that would be this one right here
duplicate that first we got to drag this
up
okay
if i zoom up right here i'm going to
delete this tool and let's get this
color here in the foreground and I'm
just going to quickly draw out like a
phone not an actual cell phone but
something like one of the older types so
make sure shape is selected and I'm just
going to eyeball this and I hope I can
get it right well I'll do right around
here
all right so if I take this and control
T
100% I want to adjust this it looks a
little bit funky so
alright that looks pretty decent I think
most will recognize that as a phone so
let's get out our columns here I don't
think I'm going to have this extent all
the way out so let me let me just use
more specifically later take the columns
and hit ctrl T all right and then I want
to hide these and just get out some text
right here let's duplicate this this is
gonna be black give us a ring scale it
down just a bit and we'll put one eight
eight eight I'm just coming up with a
random phone number so hopefully you
don't call it I don't have that yet try
forty eight and then adjust this spacing
up here drop forty eight as well all
right and then we can right click and
duplicate that move it over
shoot us a message and I'm going to
shrink this just a little bit not that
the right there and right there as well
and want to take all those layers not
this one though
all right and I'm going to move them up
just a bit
and then just on the bottom here we're
gonna take that same design we did
earlier what happened here is something
got screwed up just a bit I think I know
why that happened
create clipping mask this text got
changed one second
it's just a black
sometimes these things can happen when
you're working with a big document okay
everything else looks good yeah so I
want to take this right here I'm just
going to go control a four to select all
and then control C and then I'm going to
go back down here select this layer and
create a new layer as a clipping mask
hit control V and then edit image flip
vertical position is down here and I
want it to be the same design up here
are the same layer properties so it's
luminosity at 10% all right so that
looks pretty good for now
and then just down here I'm going to
have a very simple footer and so what
I'm going to do real quickly we can
knock this out real easily
it's just take this layer along with our
portfolio well there's one final thing I
wanted to do that I forgot to do in the
first video here I want to make this an
actual button that stands out so all I
have to do real quick is we'll select
the layer just beneath these and we'll
take around a rectangle tool we'll leave
it at 30 all right we'll change it to
white
take the type tool select just that
portion of text make it this color get
this into position all right so that was
real simple that way it stands out just
a little bit more so if I take all these
layers there's only three of them hold
shift and select that one and I right
click and hit duplicate make sure all
just like is unchecked we can drag this
all the way down to the bottom of the
document I'm just going to scroll down
here there you are we don't see it
because it's white text so what we can
do is just take all this and this is
going to be this text or this color
rather this is going to be white
actually this will be this color and
then logo copy image well what we can do
is I let me test this real quick hit
color overlay
all right and then I I think further
once we actually you know what I want to
make these black it's dead I think
further down the road once I get in the
html/css part I might may come back just
add a couple more things like a Terms of
Service and Privacy Policy and all that
but I'm not too worried about that right
now for this mock up alright and so that
is it basically now what we're gonna do
I'm gonna move on in the next section
we're going to take our design and
prepare the images for the HTML and CSS
process and so you'll if if you've never
messed around with designing websites
are in this fashion it'll be a little
bit a little bit confusing at first but
you'll see once we get to the CSS
section it'll all come together
so I will see you in the next video all
right good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
