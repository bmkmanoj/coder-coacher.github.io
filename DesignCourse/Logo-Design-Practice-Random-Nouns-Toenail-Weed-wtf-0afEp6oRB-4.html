calm and it's the end of the day and I
was struggling to think of what the hell
is going to recur because I'm doing this
video every day of 2014 thing and
sometimes this happens I don't really
know what the heck I'm going to record
up until you know the actual moment so I
came up with this idea logo design
practice technique and this is a
different one from usual the random
letter that I've been doing this one's
gonna be about a random noun so taking
two random nouns and this I found a tool
that will automatically pick random
nouns and then trying to combine them
into a symbol so usually when I record
these videos of me talking I've already
recorded the video tutorial that you're
about to see that's screencast and I
have to say this is pretty ridiculous so
I what came up but I yeah if you want to
you don't have to watch the whole thing
you don't have to follow along you
probably just scrolled the end to see
what the hell I came up with the two
nouns that I was given to work with
alright so I check out these on course
comp if you haven't yet and subscribe
here on YouTube alright so let's see
what I get here this is a site I just
went to Google and typed and random noun
generator this way God so um how many
now zone generate - all right so I'm
gonna go ahead man these kids are crying
downstairs something's going on with the
toddler anyhow generate purchase wall
that's not too bad that's almost too
easy I would think I mean they can have
a wall there with like a purchase sign I
mean that's too easy I gotta choose
something else
alright generate toenail weed what is
that alright so the goal here is to take
you tall again a single symbol I we're
not using text or anything like the
other practice technique that we use for
logo design but I just make it a very
simplistic type of symbol or icon that
will denote these two ideas and merge
them into one
gotta get a hold of that handle it's
hard to see on that block where that
green background yeah I'll do pretty
good right there and I yeah that is it I
can't believe I just did that but I got
his life isn't it oh man so let me take
this and group it up we'll see control
half scale this thing down just get some
different looks at it and that is our
tow tow now we'd would you imagine that
and another cool thing you can do is if
you have them all grouped up and go to
edit edit colors and then you can adjust
the colors real quickly you can convert
to grayscale like that but yeah that's
it I hope I didn't waste too much of
your time I mean ridiculous it's been a
long day it's like nine of pmaustin
anyhow yeah that is it so you know you
can use that tool do I still have that
up no no I don't damnit I but yeah you
can use that tool just do a search on
google for I what's it called random
noun generator just to come up you know
just another technique to really force
you to try to come up with interesting
ideas in terms of logo design at least
alright so yeah I check out these on
course comm if you haven't yet subscribe
here on YouTube and look forward to
another video tomorrow which i think is
probably going to be about announcing
that I are choosing the winner from the
video a couple days ago for the visual
are they design course talk on premium I
course giveaway so alright yeah I will
see you tomorrow bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
