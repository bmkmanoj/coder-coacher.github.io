today we're going to continue on with
the sci-fi scene that we're doing in
blender so we're just gonna set the
scene up more mess with lighting a
little bit and then tomorrow we'll go
ahead and try to finish it up I in
blender and finally in Photoshop alright
so check out design course comm if you
haven't yet subscribed here on YouTube
alright it's get started okay so this is
where I left off what we want to do now
is give this a material I think before
I'm gonna do that though I want to set
some things up though in this
environment so what I want to do is I
want to add like a cylinder container
alright so the way I'm gonna do that is
I'm just going to hit 1 on the number
pad and I'm gonna set the origin point
by left clicking just right there
somewhere in the middle doesn't have to
be perfect and also I'm going to ya
right there will work where it's down
there and I'm gonna hit shift a and add
a cylinder I'm gonna hit our X and 90
alright and I'm gonna hit tab to go into
edit mode select the face mode right
click delete the face and delete the
face over here alright then I'm going to
tab into object mode and hit scale s
rather oh I should real quickly I'm
gonna turn on the screencast keys
alright and okay that seems pretty good
for the size just somewhere around there
you don't have to be cheap with too
specific and I'm gonna zoom out a lot
just so we could see where this is at
and I'm just going to move it around
here in the center of our long beam
thing or whatever the heck you want to
call it and I'm gonna
s why and I'm gonna try and see what 10
does to us
okay then s why into alright so we'll
see where we're at here alright so what
we want to do now is I flatten this so
the what we'll do that is alright to the
wall what I want to hit s and Z all
right and I also want to make it smooth
and I also want to set up some lights
and I want to get a render going real
quickly right now it's probably gonna be
really dark if I go to render view yeah
it's because I the one default light is
outside of the area inside that
container all right so we could just
move it in like that and that'll give us
some more light and real quickly I want
to make an adjustment because I right
now it's kind of hard to maneuver around
this thing because this is so long so
I'm gonna hit s Y and just bring down
the scale quite a bit so now we can
maneuver a little bit better all right
and now I want to add some other lights
real quick I so what I'm gonna do is
just up here
I want to add a lamp so shift a layup
and we're gonna try a point or actually
no sorry about that shift a I'm gonna
experiment with this I put it area and
come over here to our light section and
emission we're gonna try this blue color
and right now I want to I want to get
the camera set up as well so hit 0 on
the number pad hit N and lock camera to
view and again hide that and
just maneuvering around a little bit
alright so if I go to rendered him zero
get out of there real quick all right so
what I want to do is I take the large
container area and I'm gonna hit on the
material section new and I'm gonna take
it down in terms of brightness quite a
bit maybe right around there all right
and I'm gonna also go take our middle
portion right here and let's see you had
this eye ray thing I guess you could
call it just to make sure I have a
selected dare that was selecting this by
accident and see that all right that
went right there go here to rendered I'm
gonna hit new and I'm gonna try emission
so come up here emission
all right and also I want to select the
lamp that we added alright so here's the
lamp settings we can change these to
different settings just to see what they
look like kind of like this one too
heavy yeah I want to make the color
something like right around there also
I'm gonna go to the real setting and
make everything black kind of like that
all right so now what I want to do is
come over and go to slalom mode and take
our main the one that we initially
started out with and hit tab and then
what we want to do is hit a + a to
select all all right so now at this
point we're gonna load up the browser
and let me get this set in here
correctly all right
what I want to do is go to CG textures
comm yeah we want to go to metal if I
can find it yeah it's alphabetized so
and I forget for 20 years I'm gonna
pause real quick okay so I use this one
and if you can see the URL text view
equals 5 207 that's probably gonna give
you this page I and so I forget which
one specifically they all look kind of
you don't want this one all right but
just something maybe like this or this I
think this one is the one I used you
cannot download that by you have to log
in I think you create for your crown or
whatever so download that and once you
have it downloading to save to a folder
switch back over to a blender and what
we want to do is select I yeah we're
going to left-click and drag this down
to split the view for this one we're
gonna choose the node editor and real
quickly I'm going to tab back out we're
gonna apply a new material and we'll
make it a mix shader' so if you've never
used the node editor before it's
basically a way that you can create
interesting materials and so you can
move these little nodes around you can
really experiment a lot with them I so
the whole key to understanding that was
just usually its experimenting so you'll
see how it works uh if you never use it
before so this mix shader' right here
allows you to add two different types of
shaders so if you want glossy and
diffuse or some type of metal or
whatever there's a bunch of different
things you can do so the top one I'm
going to make a diffuse so shift a
texture I don't know hi
am i doing shader there we go slow day
these allergies are killing me I'd let's
see here diffuse actually I'm gonna make
that the bottom one so just connect
those two notes together and you'll see
if we've switched over to rendered how
this will begin to change once we once
we make adjustments now for this one
we're gonna hit shift day you can add
another mix shader' onto a mix shader'
so go over here and select eye we're we
add mix shader' up here and then add
shift a I may experiment a little bit
I'm we're gonna add a
right here yeah this is like a medal you
can see how it's starting to change a
little bit actually to close her to
delete a connection control and just
left-click around it I'm gonna make this
the top one shift day down here I think
we're going to do another defuse we'll
see it's all about experimenting I
forget what I used initially all right
so now over here we're going to shift a
texture image texture this is where
we're going to specify the image that we
just downloaded and we want to connect
it to the color node over there so if
you hit open and select the image that
you used you see there's not much of a
change one second oh man this is getting
difficult to maneuver I think I'm gonna
do real quickly switch here to solid
mode yeah I'm gonna hide this cylinder
right here so you just use the I that
way we can move around a little bit
better initially here okay so switch
back to rendered here and right click on
it so we can select it and view
everything we did for this to work
correctly we need to unwrap it so what
we do is switch back to solid hit tab
and with everything still selected you
want to hit you and unwrap now the
result is likely not going to be very
good when we do this so if we go to
render to view what happened yeah I
can't really tell right now I want to
increase the road color real quickly
just so we could see a little bit better
what's going on all right so
we hit you again and lightmap pack hit
okay all right so I had to pause real
quick just to try to get these settings
right so it would work what I did was
change the FAC value and this controls
how much of which shader you have added
gets gets shown so I've brought it more
towards this side 0.2 and over here yeah
I'm not gonna mess with that yet and
then also I have this FAC value pushed
up a little bit higher and I took this
image texture and connected to the
diffuse over here so now we can actually
see something that looks a little bit
better and the you can experiment when
it comes to that unwrapping to see how
this actually looks you can see tell you
know based on how this looks it doesn't
look really anything like the the
texture that we actually used but it's
kind of sort of a quick hack to create
sort of an interesting look I if you try
smart UV project that will give you a
different look unwrapped gives you the
same thing cue projection these are all
give you just really interesting looking
see this is more accurate to the texture
right here if you do cylinder projection
because that's what it is
hi so I found that light map unpack at
the default settings kind of creates an
interesting little sort of texture so
that's pretty good right for now I I'm
going to turn back on the this portion
over here and also go to the world
setting and take this down to black
alright so
oops now I want to go ahead over here
too I recall the material settings we're
just going to call this base metal and
I'm gonna hit tab we're going to select
our second one right there and apply
this base material to that real quick
I'm gonna hide the cylinder right here
it's like this one do the same thing
select base metal and same thing here
now it's cool is you can change these up
right now they're not showing the
texture because we haven't unwrapped
them so if we select this second one
here again
I got a tab make sure we're in solid
here hit a a rendered and then hit you
light matte pack hit OK now we'll be
able to see some texture go back to tab
solid pee-yew hit OK
tab outs like this one tab AAA you light
map okay and now we could switch to
rendered
and what you could do is if you want to
change up the node settings a little bit
just to create some difference between
them you can say select the second one
right here I put click on this plus icon
right there let's call this base metal
two that way
now you can I experiment that with this
further to create just a different color
overall so or different appearance make
it a little bit darker it's hard to see
I mean it looks like this really
scrunched up view but that's okay all
right so now what I'm going to do is
bring back our cylinder and we can't see
it because we're outside of it all right
and I'm gonna select it and hit S&amp;amp;Z
again and get it closer drive it up a
little bit and hit rendered that's too
close so if I hit G that's the shortcut
for move and then Z oops
G and Z alright that's better now
obviously everything's really dark still
I understand
actually hit zero get back in our view
right here alright so I'm gonna add some
more lights to this so I'm gonna go to
solid view and hit zero to get out of
that oops this one needs to come down
see how that changed things up okay so
let me go back to solid I'm gonna take
that one
push it town hide my cylinder shifty
left click and then and we want to move
it over and sorry my daughter my
four-year-old daughter barged in I so
want more positions so that we can see
these in better detail
I let me get this moved around here our
luminate you know our actual I guess you
could call it a vessel
yeah maybe right there to see what this
looks like and rendered and probably
take down the strength try 30 and see
what that does doesn't do too much 10 so
now when we view this on the side
we'll see it a little bit better you
know what this thing let's make it hard
to maneuver so if I hide that alright so
I'm gonna do it another time so shift D
left click bring it forward and down
shifty click or duplicate again alright
and the solid here
shifty left click and we'll go drag it
to the bottom portion more in the middle
so that we can illuminate the bottom of
this as well I think we'll be able to
see it once we have I've lost myself
here there we go rendered
all right so that looks like kind of
interesting I'm gonna experiment by
adding another one maybe real quick
shifty
on that top one drag that down and put
it in here go to rendered it kind of
illuminates the center of it a little
bit more all right all right so I'm
gonna hit solid here all right so I
think for now let me right click and
join these areas go to rendered let me
get out of this view real quick all
right render it now all right so you
could see these little pixels that are
illuminating randomly you can have that
as an issue sometimes when you're
dealing with a lot of lights and also
based on your surface so a way to fix
that if you go to render settings and
come down here to clamp direction and
try 0.99 that can get rid of some of
them 0.98 will get rid let me try doing
it here they change that recently so
that there's two different settings you
can see that it does get rid of it gives
rid of some of the the brightness but
for now I'm not going to worry about
that because we're not really rendering
just yet so I yeah not not too concerned
about that yet so I yeah I definitely
think I am gonna be playing around a
little bit more with the nodes so we
could see an actual texture a little bit
more I yeah this doesn't affect it too
much inside but for now it's already 23
minutes so I'm gonna consider this
complete for the time being and then
tomorrow we'll go ahead and try to work
on finishing this all off and then also
bringing it into Photoshop all right so
