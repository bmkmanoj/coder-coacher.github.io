comm today we're going to step out of
Adobe Photoshop and into HTML in CSS so
we're going to focus today specifically
on doing the HTML and CSS for the
landing page alright so if you haven't
yet check out design course comm
subscribe here on YouTube and if you
need access to any project files they're
available for free alright let's get
started okay so make sure you open up
the very first mock-up we did mines
named home step one dot PSD and I
basically we're going to be referring
back to this I when we set up our HTML
structure ok so specifically speaking
the grid and the elements on here
alright so in order to proceed download
the project file that is available I in
the link if you're on design course comm
watching this then it's already right
there you just click on download project
files there's a quick registration
requires free no big deal I and if
you're watching this on YouTube the link
to the page on design course we can
download this in the description alright
so once you have the zip file downloaded
go ahead and extract it so I use an HTML
editor in that is right here and this is
called sublime text - it does cost money
I think like 60 bucks or something but I
you could use notepad you don't
necessarily have to use it as you can
see it's all just text-based so don't
freak out if you don't have it's not
that big of a deal but over here it just
I has the folder structure and you know
what you download pretty much look like
this for this index.htm file we want to
change the title here real quick to
whatever your site name is if you did
register one i've butterfl i save your
money and barter whatever and i just
real quickly I didn't bother showing you
guys me typing all this stuff this is
all very basic you know it starts out
with an HTML tag everything goes inside
those two tags
and in the next element always is the
head tag and it just has different mated
tags in here has the title which shows
up on the browser one eye
title or bar or whatever of the window
and then we have right here linked is a
CSS and I screwed up it's not 11:40 px
CSS just 11:40 as you can see right here
so make sure you make that change
otherwise it won't work and then for our
font our web fonts or sans approach just
linked right here as well alright so
basically the way we want to get started
in but by the way if we check out 11:40
CSS you know this is from the website
11:40 px calm and you can download
everything here as well I so basically
it shows you this is a very simple
minimalistic responsive framework so
when we're talking about responsive web
design basically it means that we can
use a single CSS file an HTML file that
will work on multiple viewport with sort
device viewport widths so it'll work on
it'll automatically adapt to like if
you're viewing on a phone the layout
will adapt if it's on a like a lap or a
what you call like an iPad or something
a tablet so over here it just gives you
some just very basic classes right here
and I will describe described and you
know explain these as we go along
alright so basically the first thing we
want to do is just type in div class
equals container 12 so just like that
and then we'll end it just like that
alright so basically this container 12
this is just like a div that's our class
container 12 that's specified 1140 CSFs
you just don't have to really worry
about it but basically what that is is
we turn on these grids
this means this div this container is
going to be the width of 12 of these
columns so that's all we have to worry
about for that and let's go back here
and inside of it we want to put header
which is an html5 tag header and because
we're going to be writing the HR the
HTML specifically for this top portion
okay so let's go back over here now what
we want to do is put in div class
equals Rho this is also something that's
predefined in that 1140 CSS file
basically use div class row whenever you
have two or more floating elements so I
the way I was thinking of doing this and
I hope I didn't do the CSS I've done
this project beforehand so I'm just
gonna hope you know there may be an
issue where I have to readjust the HTML
once we get to the CSS part but I if we
go over here we can see that this is
basically 1 2 3 4 5 6 mm I'm not sure 7
you might what I might do is just make
this i7 columns and then this one will
be 5 and I'll just write align both
these and we'll hope it works
once we scale the browser and for the
responsive portion so I'm just going to
do that real quick I mean if this wasn't
here I would just Center this image but
I'm not going to this is over here as
well so what I'll do is I come back over
here div class equals column 7 that's
also predefined 1 through 12 in that
1140 uh CSS alright and inside of that
we'll go ahead and put a href equals my
website address which is barter fold com
put yours if you registered 1 and then
image source equals images forward space
we'll just call this a little bit of PNG
usually I say the image is out first but
I kind of forgot it's no big deal you
don't have to do things in a certain way
but yeah we will be saving that logo as
a logo dot PNG and let's continue on
after this we have div class equals
column 5 so when it comes to these
column containers you want to make sure
they always add up to 512 so we got 7 in
5 so that's 12 and now in here we want
to have an unordered list for the
navigation a ul and we'll put in our one
link
a to F equals actually able put forward
slash login and login here a close the
Li as well the list item alright very
simple okay so now we have that portion
done that is all the HTML is required
for this up here basically alright so
now we have to worry about the next
element which is right here a very
simple piece of text so let's go ahead
and come over here I'm going to put h1
we're going to give it an ID that way we
can reference it in the CSS and control
the margin because there's quite a bit
of margin from above it and the header
above it all right so we'll put in id
equals home and I'll put need something
someone might want to barter close the
tag alright and then the very next thing
we have is this form right here so we
have to add some form HTML form tags so
let's go back here alright so form
action equals we're not going to send it
to a specific script so we're just going
to leave that blank because it's going
to submit to itself and then at the top
here once we get to the PHP I will put
the PHP code up there alright so action
equals I blank and then method equals
post and that will just post the data
from the form and let's close that and
then inside I'm going to put an empty
div and that's going to be used to put
any type of error signs I like if the
person didn't fill out all the three
forms or fields then we'll put in a some
PHP right in here that will basically
echo that alright so let's go down here
so now because these all float to the
right of each other wait where'd that go
I'll have to worry about that too much
I'll find it I because all these three
these three elements float we're going
to
div class equals row close it and then
come inside and this is going to be div
class equals now here's where we have to
refer back get the grid out this first
text box is for width so it's column
equals four
the next one I believe is five yep and
then this last one is three so there's
all add up to 12
let me just take this real quick
paste it two times
this is five and this is three very
simple alright so inside is where we
actually put the HTML code for our two
text box and button so let me see here
it's going to do the input type equals
text that means it's going to be a text
field as opposed to like a drop-down or
something class we're going to give the
class of large - FLD and that just means
large field and name equals we're going
to put I I need because that's the one
where they specify what they need or
want value equals nothing and then
placeholder equals I need this so
placeholders a tag that allows you to
put in that initial grayed out text
right here alright so let me can come
back over here I'm going to copy this
real quick we'll put will keep
everything the same except I offer I'll
change that name and what was that text
I can offer this okay
all right and then over here we're going
to have our button so that's input type
equals submit class equals large FLD
name equals I I'm just going to make
that step one and then class okay one
second of screwed up we're going to give
it to classes large - magnify so that
will give us the little magnifying glass
image as well and then we'll put in
value equals find matches oops there we
go all right so just about done and
let's see here now we just have this
little portion right here and it's just
some text so I'm going to come back here
and put that in and so this will be
outside of the form but it's inside of
this div closing what do you call
container twelve and so we'll just put P
for paragraph tag and we'll give it I
can give it an ID or a class I'm just
going to give an ID of I what was this
text for anyhow okay so I'm just going
to put it on home - info and then I'll
copy that text let me hide this real
quick all right and come back and go
ahead go ahead and close this and
because we had those three being green
these examples basically we'll put a
span tag and we'll be able to reference
that in CSS oops
all right so
all right so far so good so I let me
save this now if we were to go ahead and
view what this looks like in the browser
it looked terrible but I'll just do it
anyways then I go to open containing
folder double click on that and this is
what it looks like without any images
although there's only one anyway and CSS
applied so you know but basically have
the idea and so as you can see as we
pull this browser in things kind of
naturally line up and that's based on
that 1140 dot CSS okay so and of course
we will have to make adjustments to that
specifically once we have the CSS done
for just a large view right here so yeah
everything this is how it's supposed to
look like it's supposed to look like
crap without CSS but the CSS once we do
that that's where the magic will come in
now unfortunately it's late it's like
8:45 p.m. I have to toddler daughters
and my wife just yelled at me and said I
have to get done because the ones
getting tired and I always have to watch
the younger one to why the other one
goes to sleep so I'm going to have to
end it here I would have liked to get a
little bit longer today I know this is
probably a little bit annoying if you're
one of the individuals who have been
following a long day by day because it
seems like we don't get too much done
but yeah
it is what it is anyhow so tomorrow what
we'll do - just so that we can have a
little bit of a payoff we'll focus on
the CSS and really make this end up
looking like this and then maybe we'll
also get the second step done as well
all right so I'm Gary Siamese on course
