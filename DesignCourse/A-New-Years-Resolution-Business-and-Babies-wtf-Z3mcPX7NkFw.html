all of you to think about any new
projects or business ventures in this
frame of mind treat your business like
you're raising a child so in order to
have a child you have to have an orgasm
I can't believe I'm doing this now that
is oddly familiar if you've ever come up
with a new idea for a business the
inception of a business idea brings
about so much motivation inspiration
excitement etc so then in the next nine
months the baby is being built in the
womb now likewise you're building at
your business which includes design
development how you're going to make
money etc they're actually really
similar at this point oh except for the
alien coming out of you at the end then
it's born and you launch and you're
gonna live happily ever after with your
pudgy little child and you're very
successful business except three months
later your businesses fail meanwhile you
were feeding your child every single day
you never neglected it you close it you
bathe fit you paid so much attention to
it and what did you do for your business
after launch you were probably
discouraged you didn't get any sales or
much traffic so you neglected it and
what would happen to your child if you
treated it the way you treated your
business
well it would be dead because that's a
way to treat a child see making a baby
is fun much in the same way that's
starting and launching a new business is
so excited and that's what it takes to
raise a business to every day you have
to feed it in some manner whether that
be content or marketing or strategizing
your kid gets sick you take it to a
doctor if your business starts to fail
and figure out how to turn it around
every day you have to be in this mindset
so in 2017 you treat your business like
you're raising a child</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
