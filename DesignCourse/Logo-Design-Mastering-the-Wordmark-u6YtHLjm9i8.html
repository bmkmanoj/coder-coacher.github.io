identity designer and instructor of 15
years now I decided to create this
course because I see all too often
especially from new and aspiring
designers a focus on symbolism and
iconography as opposed to the word mark
which is the tight portion of a logo so
we're going to correct that by running
through a series of projects that will
help you create great word marks now
this word marks come in a variety of
forms simple and complex abstract and
literal so we have a little bit of
everything sprinkled throughout five
different projects now
two of the projects are going to include
hand lettering word marks with the use
of a tablet while the other projects
more focused on conveying relevant
symbolism through the type as opposed to
focusing on the type itself will be
working exclusively in Adobe Illustrator
and it would be a big plus if you have
access to a pressure-sensitive drawing
tablet now I really want to see what you
ultimately produce which is why I've
included two optional project
assignments that are aimed to challenge
you to create great word marks and if I
think what you produce needs improvement
I certainly won't be holding back so if
you're ready to take your identity game
to the next level let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
