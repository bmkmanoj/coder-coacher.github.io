video we're going to design the mock-up
for our homepage for logo design CEO in
Photoshop and again I can't stress this
enough hopefully you've kind of chosen
your own project at this point you have
the logo done and you'll just be able to
see kind of what exactly I'm going to do
for my project but you'll have your own
so right here I'm looking at bootstrap
and this is from Twitter and as it
states here
it's a popular front-end framework for
faster and easier web development so if
you're unfamiliar with I using a
front-end framework you'll understand as
we progress through the series and we
get into the HTML and the CSS I but I'm
just dive on this page now because I
bootstrap if we go to scaffolding up
here and scroll all the way down we'll
see that it hat it uses a grid system I
and if you're unfamiliar with what a
grid system is again we'll get into that
in more detail coming up here real
shortly I but the first thing that we
have to do is in Photoshop get our
document prepared so that when we design
the layout it's going to adhere to these
twelve column grid system that bootstrap
uses so if this if this is confusing I
and you're new to this which will be
confusing don't think about it too much
but what I want to do is at this website
here from Ben Stuart we have a Twitter
bootstrap responsive grid Photoshop
template okay so this is just a PSD file
and if you download it you'll get a zip
file and inside it you'll have three
five three files basically one for a 720
for one for a 940 and another for a 1170
width now we're going to use the 1170
width I basically what will happen since
we're going to use responsive when we
have the browser maximized
I the layout will be basically it'll
look exactly like we're going to design
it in this mock-up that we're going to
start here soon but then if we take the
browser and we kind of just drag it in
it will adapt I and also the purpose of
that of course is so that when you're
viewing the website on mobile devices or
tablets it will respond automatically
all right so we'll get more into that so
now go ahead and open up this file right
here and I'm going to open it up in my
own and I've called it pre I'm going to
move it onto the screen here and
basically when you open it up it's going
to look exactly like this I so each of
these if it also if I hit control H a
lot of these guides up here as well to
get rid of them to take control H so if
we I take a look at this I can hide the
info column and I'm going to fill this
in with a white color going to create a
new layer ctrl shift N and just fill
that in and call it background you'll
see these twelve pink columns here and
basically we want to design our layout
so that it adheres to these columns and
you'll see what I mean I'm more
specifically so what I want to do here
is just go to image canvas size and I'm
going to extend the height here to
something a little bit more prior to
around 15 and hit OK and then I'm going
to take both of these qahal out of these
layers hit ctrl T and hold the Alt key
and just drag up and select move tool
and hit apply all right so I'm going to
go ahead and also go to image canvas
size and extend the width just a little
bit I to around 20 inches and depending
on what your resolution is I for your
desktop you may want to make it a little
larger if you're on the larger edge
resolution or a little bit
smaller but basically you do want to see
everything in terms of width on the
screen alright so I'm just going to fill
that in with the background color and
then I'm going to open up the logo so
I'm going to go to file open and this is
the logo design that I did and I'm going
to leave it at 72 pixels and hit OK and
then hit control a and then ctrl C to
copy and then just ctrl V to paste it in
alright so I'm going to take my move
tool and I'm just going to move it up
here and we want it to be right there on
the left of the first grid or the first
column and now what I want to do is hit
ctrl T hold shift and scale it down just
a little bit just right around here it's
like the move tool hit apply and I'm
going to get rid of the columns or hide
them rather and for this top portion I
it's going to be blue so we're going to
take the rectangle tool and I'm just
going to choose a blue color I the color
code is 0 0 AF C 4 and hit OK and then
just underneath this layer 1 which well
I will rename to logo I'm going to drag
out right around there
okay then I'm going to take the logo go
to image adjustments invert and it's not
quite hundred percent white so what I
can do is just go to image adjustments
exposure turn the exposure all the way
up and now it is hundred percent white
okay so now on this point I want to get
a navigation up and it's just going to
be very simple and let's get the columns
back up here so we can see that and I'm
going to choose white for the foreground
and I'm just going to click once and
just type in portfolio and I'm going to
increase that size quite a bit but first
I'm going to change it to a font called
source sans Pro
and which I will link in the video here
and then I'm going to hit ctrl T hold
shift and just scale it up to right
around that size apply and we'll put it
right around there I may adjust that and
then we'll go ahead and I select this
yeah I put the space about 15 spaces and
then what I can do is copy that and then
paste it and paste it one more time I'm
going to have four links up there and so
now right off the bat I let's go ahead
and change these last two to the
appropriate names log in and get started
I'm going to hit ctrl T and just scale
it down to right around there and
position them down just slightly and
hide the columns here now with my move
tool I ought to select I can just kind
of reposition things here with my
keyboard and just kind of eyeball for
now and right here in the middle I'm
going to have a head headline text
that's going to be pretty big and so I'm
just going to type we design superior
logos and then scale that up a lot ctrl
t hold shift and alt and I do want it to
be pretty big now let's go ahead and
view the grid here and we just kind of
want to eyeball it so that it's
basically in the center this is going to
be a single 12 column grid basically
layer right here and so it doesn't
really matter we don't have to start it
right here or really the only thing we
have to pay attention to is that we have
it centered here roughly on the canvas
all right and I'll leave it right around
there
and now what I want to do is kind of
give a sub-headline underneath this so
what I will do is one moment is right
click and duplicate the layer or you can
do it with a shortcut ctrl shift D now
hit ctrl T scale it down and in this
text I'm going to type stand above your
competition your business is worth it
okay and what we can do here is Center
it up again which looks pretty even and
then right around here in this area and
real quickly I'm going to get ctrl T and
select this blue layer and extend it
down just a little bit further so in
this area starting on this second column
I'm going to have a white background
sort of and you'll see what its purpose
will be shortly so what I want to do is
create a clipping mask layer so if I hit
control shift N and select use previous
layer to create clipping mask
we'll call this logo background hit OK
and we take the rectangle tool and we
select right around here and then extend
it just below and end it right here at
this column what we can do is yeah like
I position this up just a little bit
more
and so into the left and right right
here we're going to have arrows left and
right arrows okay and what this is going
to allow people to do is just kind of
click these and it will also
automatically transition into showing
basically some featured logos that I've
designed so what I want to do here is
create those icons from scratch so it's
pretty simple what we'll do is go to
view show grid and also make sure snap
to grid is enabled here so if i zoom up
just right around here take the pen tool
make sure shape is selected with a white
foreground we can create a arrow pretty
easily and like right here
and control H twice to get rid of it go
back to hundred percent all right and
then I let's see here let me get the
grid back it will be basically in the
center of the first column and we can
duplicate this go to edit transform flip
horizontal and then just move it over
and let's get rid of the columns here
and now what I want to do is add another
layer which will be a clipping mask
underneath logo background and control
shift end hit okay and I just want to be
a darker shade of blue right here ctrl H
twice I get this blue and then I'll flow
right around there and then just move it
up a little bit with the keyboard top
arrows okay I now what I want to do in
this area well actually one thing I want
to create a custom pattern up here just
to give it some a little bit of texture
and so the way we'll do that we're going
to go to file new and I'm going to
choose a width and a height of 100 and
what I'm going to do is take the pen
tool here and I'm going to select just a
darker blue color hit OK select down
here once
hold shift for perfect diagonal line and
end it right around there and then take
this I hit control shift D to duplicate
which I can't right now because my
screen recorder has that same shortcut
up screwing it up but you can certainly
use that if you want and hit ctrl T and
I just rotate like I did and so I can
move till it apply and if we select over
here and just use the down arrow key and
the up arrow key we can experiment
possibly with some different layer modes
and one thing I want to do is just take
both these control T yeah I think I'm
flicked it all the way around you'll see
how this works it's actually pretty cool
alright so this can be our pattern so we
go to edit or yeah edit and we go to
define pattern and we'll just call this
I logo BG there okay now if we go back
to our mock-up here we can create a new
layer just above logo background
control-shift-n what's called this BG
and this will just be a regular layer
not a clipping mask and what we can do
is go ahead and create a rectangle
roughly around the size and then we can
double click on the right hand side of
it and go to pattern overlay and select
the one we just created down here
alright so now what we want to do we can
play around with the the blend mode
right here with the arrow keys and kind
of just use something that we think will
work here initially and I think I'm
going to use this one
and we're going to turn down the opacity
a lot actually right around 218 with
multiply selected and then hit okay and
then what I want to do is right click
hit rasterize layer' and then also layer
style and then I want to get rid of this
bottom portion right here tip delete and
I'm going to take the magic wand tool
and set the tolerance like one so we
just get these bottom portions and then
hit delete okay
and actually what I'm going to back up a
few because I notice I accidentally cut
off the very tip right there so let me
just back up a few times so what I'll do
is hit control Z and then alt several
times because I definitely want that
correct all right now hit delete and
take the magic wand tool again and
delete that and I'm not too satisfied
with that color it's a little bit too
dark so let me go ahead and experiment
with the opacity and also the blend
modes here just a little bit I'm just
using my down arrow key till I find
something that I think might work I'm
going to go to image adjustments
brightness and contrast and I think that
works pretty well if we turn the
brightness up we can see it but it
definitely doesn't take away from the
type or anything or the logo okay for
now I may position is up slightly right
around there and I think that works okay
alright so now what we want to do I is
put it in the example logos right here
and I've already created it so I can go
to here and these are just four
goes I've created to put in that space
so if I just select all and copy and put
them right around here
that will be good to go I also I want to
first go up here and change the
anti-aliasing to sharp and that way it
will appear more specific to exactly how
it would look in the browser instead of
it being set to smooth as it was all
right so I right now I think this is a
pretty good start and a pretty good end
to this portion we're going to have
actually a lot more and this is going to
be a lot taller and width which we'll
cover over the next video or two I so
yeah we're certainly going to have by a
testimonials area an area that kind of
describes a service more and a few of
the things in the footer I but for now
this is a good place to start or stop
rather so I will see you in the next
video
all right good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
