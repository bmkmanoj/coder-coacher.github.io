calm and welcome to the 25th design
course calm design challenge review and
we had some real good entries I one was
from a popular YouTube designer so check
that out for sure and also we're going
to pick the winner of the giveaway that
I announced for the visual identity
design course so let's go ahead and do
that alright so this is the random name
picker and the list of names of those
who submitted entries with exception to
one individual right here unfortunately
I got a code some better forms here
these are custom i coded them so what
probably happened is this person who
ever submitted this they were logged in
for a while and then hit submit and
posted it and the session was lost and
so I it didn't store their username
information so i have no clue who posted
this I'll try to find a way to make that
up to you but if you're watching this
who ever submitted this let me know in
the YouTube comments and I'll get a hold
of you so anyhow aside from that these
are the names so all I'm going to do is
hit pick a random name and you will want
the visual identity designed course
alright so the Defiant space let's do a
search and find out which one he did all
right right here so yeah I let's go
ahead and do the review though go ahead
and get a hold of me by the way just to
remind me to give you access to that and
you'll have in your account you just
click on my video courses and it should
show up right so I real quickly I do
want to mention just just today I
launched the one-on-one design training
I so if you go there you'll see and by
the way I'm going to release the video
on the YouTube channel about this
there's a cool promo video I made with
it right here and you can check out you
know what exactly this is basically it's
hourly design training with me in a
one-on-one environment and here's
currently the pricing that I have going
on with it for one hour sessions all
right so check that out all right back
to the reviews and I'll stop spamming
you what the hell am I all right there
we go
okay so let's get started all right so
white out just a pretty quick entry he
says the one issue with this is I it was
hard for me to read now of course you
know we know it says design course I
will but will another person who's just
looking at this top portion right here
know that right off the bat and I say
that because you have the DES and that's
pretty visible but then we get to this
area right here and we see the dot for
the eye but I don't necessarily see an
eye itself in here I'm it looks almost
like it could be an oh I and then
additionally we have this coming up
right here now this in and of itself
this shape right here looks exactly like
this II I now I understand connected
it's an actual G coming down but that's
one issue where you can kind of see a
very strong similarity between those two
characters so that's an issue you would
probably want to dress just by adjusting
how this G looks maybe just end it right
here the connecting point and not have
this go straight through and then it
becomes a little bit more legible I've
as far as the legibility for the course
you can definitely read all these
letters although this kind of makes it a
little bit difficult a little bit
cluttered if you will when it comes to
this bottom juice going straight through
the e so that's kind of a big no I would
say and then I would say the last I
concern i have is probably for just the
overall flow of the types in relation to
each other as a whole when it comes to
you know how you combine the design and
then the course with each other they
just kind of seemed separated and
there's not a good flow so a good
example of course would be this right
here everything right here seems to just
flow together real well it feels like
you know there's a lot of consistency
and it's a kind of its own one single
mark alright so thanks for that I think
just a few of those adjustments and
you'll be able to taste step it up a
pretty good-sized notch in terms of
quality alright so I Brad berry design
this is one of the best entries that we
received I and I just pause because i
know this individual has a pretty
popular youtube channel another designer
twenty-six thousand subscribers a pretty
decent sized channel check out his
channel thanks for submitting I can't
really say anything too bad about this
so there's a lot of consistency in the
type if you notice I you know when it
comes to hand lettering I all the tiny
details in the individual letters
themselves is really important so we can
notice not the beginning of each letter
you know we have this thickness here
apply to the left part portion and then
we have the connecting pool elements a
little bit thinner and we can see that
throughout every single connecting point
and through every portion of the letter
themselves in the kit that consistency
is what really makes it successful and
very good alright so I thanks for that
this is one that I would say some of the
other designers should definitely learn
from alright so Mario ok so the issue we
have sorry that my mouse scroll wheel is
really shaky all right so all right out
of my element this is my temp and trust
me when I'm not great at hand lettering
trust me I it's very difficult when
you're first trying to learn how to do
it so I think a lot of people felt that
same sort of thing because I've never
done any tutorials on it I don't have a
ton of experience it is tough so there's
just an issue of consistency here
throughout these letters and it's so
minor but I'm saying the fix is minor
but the difference is huge in what it
could transform and make this into so
what I'm talking about here is just take
a look at I like all the lowercase
letters here with reception to the D I
you know this top portion of the e
alright the esk is going slightly higher
the bottom of the e where begins the
baseline this s is going slightly lower
I we could see right here at the I just
before the dot it's even less vertically
high than the s in the e and then we
come down here to see is real low there
and then you have so you basically have
all these very subtle differences in
terms of alignment and height that throw
everything off essentially if you can
master
getting everything evened up you can end
up with a result that's kind of more
like this and also the inspiration up
here I and so it's just those details
again that you gotta really focus on so
I don't expect people just you know to
submit awesome entries you know right
off the bat here obviously Bradbury you
know has had experience you know in
doing this so just keep at it and thanks
for the submission okay all right this
time is extremely difficult I
calligraphy is not an area of design
least I try thanks for the submission
for sure I we do have some issues of
consistency I can kind of see in the
area of spacing I there the space
between the actual characters the D and
E seem kind of far the E&amp;amp;S seem kind of
far than we have the eye and the g i--
the eye and the s rather are pretty
close then we have the g and n are close
and so overall if you just fix those
minor issues and kind of got everything
to be more evenly distributed I kind of
like the look where there's less space
in between all the individual characters
as opposed to being more more like this
I think it would be a lot better in
terms of your execution of designing
each of the letters and your consistency
in presenting them like these two S's
almost look again t'kul that's very good
same with the east so you did that part
well I just say I trying to get the
letter spacing a little bit more
consistent would be best all right how
do i change my nickname you have to hit
me up on youtube remind me after this
and i could probably do that for you all
right so Scully okay I did three types
when you look at now the problem with
this is this wasn't hand-lettered now
these were fonts of course that somebody
hand lettered unless of course that you
actually you created these fonts
yourself which I don't think you did
because I do recall seeing this font
it's kind of like a popular free thought
down here yeah that wasn't the purpose
of this in this contest unfortunately so
you'd see like the s right here and then
ask these are exactly identical it kind
of just tells me that this individual
perhaps used fonts
when was supposed to be about hand
lettering so you may have been confused
about that and that's that's fine but
unfortunately I defeated the purpose of
the contest but no problem alright so i
buy back let's see I don't know why that
did that for some reason is this the one
we already looked at my damn forum
coding skills alright and then another
one from by Beck I unfortunately there's
just too much inconsistency going on
here and kind of looks like it was just
really quickly drawn out I so I would
say not anything kind of like what we're
looking for in terms of having a really
refined sort of like a logo sort of
wordmark essentially all right but
thanks for the entry and did you define
space the winner okay so this is
obviously a different sort of take on
the approach here to getting our word
mark on here i would say I you there are
several issues here of course I when it
comes to the letter the spacing and I
would also say there's probably too much
trying to be achieved here by connecting
all like a lot of the various letters
together like the S it's very creative
but it's kind of still hard to follow I
would see mainly probably because of the
alignment because we have this D up here
a lot of space in a lot of space between
an hour before and after the e lot of
space right here and then things kind of
get a little bit I jungled up over here
between the SI AGN and so you have the
de kind of sign right here then you have
a lot of space over here and then it
kind of gets a little bit closer
together then you have a little bit more
space so just between all these elements
here it's kind of just feel separated it
doesn't really feel unified or uniform
or consistent so I think if you just
worked on bringing everything together
in terms of consistency it would
definitely be a lot better in my opinion
so thanks for submitting that okay so
this one paint with green I'm looking at
this and I'm thinking myself is this
another font that somebody used so I let
me see here I got up before I started
recording oops I didn't scale it
correctly a scale is down to this
my recording area and I was just curious
you know because I didn't want to make
an assumption that this was you know not
handle done I because if you look at the
e the to ease the patterns in the middle
are definitely or you know in the
texture rather are definitely different
in these two E's but I thought to myself
be the forms themselves look definitely
very you know similar as if they it
isn't a font this is a font with a kind
of like a custom texture overlaid on top
of like a layer mask or something so I
cut the e out and I overlaid on here and
it's like an exact match same thing with
the s and that's the exact match um so
again you know paint with green if you
were under the impression that you know
you just kind of wanted to you were able
to use a font that's not what we were
trying to do we wanted to literally type
draw it out okay now if you again if you
created a fun out of this and you just
reuse the same letters then I cool
that's awesome I mean I like this and if
this was hand done that would be superb
it would be a superb some submission but
correct me if i'm wrong though all right
so I column 101 okay so not my strongest
design skill I think it's probably one
of the things that's hardest for most
graphic designers I would say is his
hand lettering stuff so again we have
issues here um kind of with alignment so
we have the baseline right here you see
is kind of roughly drawn out it looks
like in this area and then the letters
start to fall off unfortunately well
you're doing good here and it's like oh
crap things are kind of falling off and
then try correct it up here but then the
r and then s + E so if you were to draw
parallel lines from here like right here
the baseline of the e did this e it
would probably be something like down
here so you got to definitely try to
keep everything consistent in terms of
following the same path whether that be
an arc or you know just a straight line
after that there are some issues
additionally in terms of the letter
spacing it's real close here between the
N and the sea but then we have the 0 in
the U which is spaced out further
and then also i would say direction you
know we have the you straight up and
then we have our kind of just slamming
this way and then use up like this way
so these are all things that you know if
you're able to correct and keep
consistent it really boosts the quality
just automatically all right thanks for
the submission though and we have
another one here from Robin I oh I can't
say we're none other one I'm not sure if
this individual ready did another one
but anyhow I giving a try so let's see
here okay so looking at this it's not
bad I definitely it's definitely better
than said any other submissions but it's
not great either because there's not
something it doesn't really stick out
and say you know there's something
really spectacular about it I could
definitely see that this is you know it
is hand-drawn we can see the e right
here compare it with this e right here
they're definitely different although if
you look at them you could see the
alignment from the step of the e versus
this stem of the e it's completely
different not I can't say completely but
very noticeably different you know this
one's kind of trailing this way and this
one's kind of trailing straight up and
down on a 90 degree angle and again the
same thing with the end just kind of
just I've it's off on an angle a little
bit and all these subtleties I will just
kind of throw off the appearance of it
even to the untrained eye I'm because
everybody's so used to looking at
consistent i type essentially with all
the fonts are out there so it's one of
the things you really need to practice
on if you want to get good of course a
hand lettering you need to really
practice on consistency i think this
biggest takeaway from this challenge
alright so thanks for that submission um
i think it's just a few these few things
with some of these submissions
especially this one I that if they were
changed and everything we're applied
consistently it would be like two
hundred percent better so thanks for
that then we have salary here and this
is a very good design I think it becomes
even more pronounced because this is you
know obviously a paper version when you
see it with the vectorized version so
everything here seems real
consistent I'm maybe the only thing
that's kind of slightly off is just this
are you can see kind of the arse just
kind of coming down a little bit lower
than the other ones and it's a little
bit kind of not in the same angle when
these two crash there but you know what
I very minor gripe so this is definitely
within the top two I in here's kinda
like a texturized version so I really
like this very good submission thanks
for that alright so this is the
individual that we don't have the user
name unfortunately looking at this and
we scaled down my browser so i can see a
little bit better where am I at alright
so looking at this it doesn't feel
consistent it doesn't feel connected the
words either I think there's a little
just a little bit too much spacing in
between the letters and there's also too
much space in between course here and
there was no really there wasn't really
much of a tie-in between design and
course and so that's one issue that I
would say that's a biggest issue that's
holding it back in my opinion so again
try to work with the spacing bringing
everything a little bit together finding
a unique way to tie the two words
together and you'll have a solid concept
alright so let's look here and get the
reset to default and all right the thing
was a bitch to vector in illustrator you
know like the original i did on paper ok
so um yeah i think this is one that we
looked at up here previously let me make
sure yeah so that's the same one that we
looked at already so i'm not going to
analyze it again just you know for the
purpose of saving time here but the
thanks for the entry again alright so
Roger here looking at this so this is
obviously a very straightforward you
know not one that's not meant to be like
some extravagant logo or whatever so
just examining what's done here with the
type and looking at these let's see here
i I'm just kind of looking real quickly
at the ease for example the two E's seem
to match up pretty
pretty close I the s's as well so at
least everything here is pretty
consistent I it seems like if we look at
the words themselves individually it was
executed pretty well so I really don't
have too much bad to say about this is a
pretty good attempt of course you know
if we're trying to make it into like a
logo or something we would probably want
to bring the course much closer over
here and maybe do something a little bit
more unique but as it stands as type
itself it's good so thanks for that
entry alright so Dara alright let's see
here okay I was just reading that real
quick all right this kind of reminds me
of the coca-cola logo just you have this
that's see in that classic kind of arc
right here looking at this the there
still are some of these the issues that
I've been talking about some of the
other entries we have I letter spacing
with the E&amp;amp;S and the I pretty consistent
right here but then we get to the G in
the end and there's pretty much nothing
so you know it's just one of the things
most people are most designers new to
the hand letter aren't hand lettering
aren't aware of when they do it and then
that's kind of what ends up taking away
the potential for it to be great
essentially and so looking at this over
here we have the same issue we have the
letter spacing between the own use real
close and then the UN the r is kind of
further out and so that's one of the
things also like this esque and it seems
to be leaning a little bit to the left
compared to this e which is leaning
forward so these are this is tiny
nuances that will just throw off the
visibility and the readability of the
type and the flow of the concept itself
so again focus on keeping everything
consistent and you'll definitely improve
all right so coming down here here's
another one now this is just based on
using grid paper so it kind of takes the
element of my take oops one second the
element of creativity out of it a little
bit you know obviously you need to
construct it I but you know a great way
to experiment with hand lettering is
through the grid paper because it can
help you keep your your letter spacing
and all of that consistent but looking
at this as it stands let me go down a
little bit further yeah it's actually a
pretty cool concept obviously because
you're using great paper everything is
by default kind of even and so for what
it is it's definitely a good entry so
thanks for that and George X and we have
another submission where I would say you
know there's a lot of it inconsistencies
in terms of how the type is presented so
we have a this we have the NC o-- you
all touching each other then we have the
art kind of separated I'd s kind of
separated and the e as well and then the
g and the end there's a pretty sizable
space in between there so it kind of
flows off just to have flows off throws
off the flow of the type and we have the
same issue we have issues as well in
terms of alignment we can see that there
is you know two vertical or horizontal
lines rather that we're drawn here but
they some of the letters extend pretty
well beyond I above or below the lines
and that also is something that's going
to throw off the flow of the design as
well of course when you have like a G
that can definitely know the tail can
definitely come out of that area but
everything else you got to try to keep
for the most part consistent alright
thanks for this mission though all right
so here it was made by hand with a six
millimeter pilot parallel pen which I
decided by after last challenge okay all
right so this is actually a pretty good
entry everything as we can see one of
the things that can really help give
consistency is I you know the the
variations with the thickness which
obviously a calligraphy I brush or a pen
would definitely allow you to do in
between the letters themselves in terms
of alignment everything's
seems to be angled in the same direction
which is very important the letter
spacing seems to be pretty accurate
overall and then tying everything
together with these interesting loops
and such I it's a good entry so I can't
really say anything to negative about
this very good and then finally I
believe this is our last no I second
last right here okay so you're only 15
oh and that's no excuse Eddie ow looking
at this I really i like the course kind
of a lot better than i do design i think
too much was china of us was trying to
be completed up here just by with the s
and the eye and then the gene and and
this coming off the course seemed to be
you know the the lower case letters are
all I with exception to this are in this
s right here a little bit more
simplified I if if they give you a damn
thing one second I think if you simplify
the es IGN kind of like you have the oh
you and our or the Uyuni at least is
would have been a little lot better so I
think there's a lot of potential here
but I think there's just too much
happening up here guys the East arted
over here then the S is up here eyes
right here geez kind of down a little
bit and then also there's a lot
happening down here as well so I think I
just trying to simplify this a little
bit better I'm more in line with what's
going on here would be more ideal but
yeah it's a good entry alright so George
X another one again we have some of the
ESU oh this one was just vectorized I
think from the other one so i won't
bother reviewing that alright so thanks
for these submissions everyone look out
for a new challenge which is going to be
posted tomorrow i'm not even sure what
that is i have to think of that here in
the next 30 minutes i think but yeah
check out the youtube channel for that
check out the one-on-one design training
which is just released today check out
the video courses as well
oops I got a log out let me log out here
and I I got error showing up all over
the place I and yeah check those out and
again this is something i launched just
died one week ago there's a responsive
web design course which is brand new and
then also I the visual identity design
course which is formerly a part of
design course premium so yeah check that
out subscribe here on YouTube and I'll
see you with a new video tomorrow
goodbye
