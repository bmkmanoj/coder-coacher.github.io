welcome to the very last lesson as a
part of the theorem smart developers for
beginners 100% free course so let's
continue on here and by the way if
you're jumping in and you're finding
this video for the first time make sure
you watch from the beginning of the
course it's going to help you a lot more
alright so the first thing that we want
to do is we're going to make some
adjustments to our actual form so we no
longer have just a single instructor
names we have a first name and last name
and so there's a couple of other
adjustments we're going to make so for
instance first under Chrisette your
instructor the h1 we're gonna add a span
ID of count I NS this is going to give
us an instructor count for the number of
counts and we're also going to add two
lines underneath our h2 section right
here and that's going to be a span ID of
AI NS trans this is going to hold or
just display a block hash that's
associated with the latest event and
this is a line separator here and then
also underneath here I'm just going to
copy and paste out this name which will
have two more inputs this is first name
of F name ID and also an L name ID and a
last name and that's it for the actual
form adjustments so now we have to make
a couple of other in just mince
I for the actual JavaScript so the first
line right here of our instructor event
is course extra instructor we actually
change that an instructor name to
instructor info if you recall you can
look at the remix IDE for the smart
contract section of that and then also
we're gonna pass in an empty object in
the first argument and then we're gonna
say we only want the latest block and I
found that this was necessary in order
for this event to work on the robson
test network it worked in the test RPC
but not that I'm not not with the robb
stance so next we're going to adjust
actually the instructor dot watch method
right here and this right here we only
want to
hide the loader if the last returned
result is different has a different
block hash than the previous one so
that's why we're saving the block hash
up here in this i ns trans ID and so
what we'll do is put in if the result up
block hash is not equal to the AI NS
trans in HTML then we will hide the
loader graphic right there next we'll go
ahead and put in a NS trans dot HTML is
the block hash and put in result block
hash all right and then finally we also
have to adjust this line right here so
to do that we're going to change this
results dot orgs name that doesn't exist
anymore to web 3.2 ASCII we're gonna put
in a result our X dot F name and the
reason we're using to ASCII is because
we changed the string types to byte
types and when you do that you don't get
the actual string back anymore you have
to use the to ASCII function from run 3
to make it readable all right so we have
a first name but we also have a last
name so I'm gonna copy this and I move
over here and we're gonna put in a space
paste this in and we'll put in L name
alright simple alright and then finally
we're gonna make one last change here to
the click event or actually before that
we're going to reference our count
instructors function so Chrisette row
count instructors our error and response
on success we're gonna just say if
success
then we're going to say count I NS dot
html' is the response dot C that's where
it resides the actual number of
instructors all right and then finally
our click event has to be modified just
slightly the first argument of set
instructor is not the name this time
it's the address so web 3d th default
account alright and then the second
argument is age and then we have F name
and we'll copy this for L name right
here and we can get rid of this part as
well and then save alright awesome so
now at this point let's just go back to
our remix IDE this is deployed and we'll
go to our smart contract here and we
will actually try to use it and see if
it works so let's go ahead and type in
Garry Simon 34 that is my actual naitch
up age is val is not a function okay so
let's go find that that's right we have
to put a dollar sign there a live coding
got to love it alright so let's try it
again
Garry Simon and 34 alright we're gonna
hit submit now and once the
so I pending goes away this should go
away as well right here and show the
latest event of the instructor name and
last name
now this can take a little bit of time
and so we can see 17 seconds has passed
it can go up to 2 plus minutes so I will
forward this if this takes a while okay
and there we go you can see that it
worked now I should note that I had some
issues with it so I had to pause I
actually restarted the browser I reran
my MP Emraan dev command and then and
only then did it actually start to work
so if you're having issues with it the
loader not going and it's not updating
go ahead and make sure you do that so
let's to go ahead and do another update
real quick Stephanie Simon for my wife
who is 30
I'll hit update this shows up off-screen
will hit submit and also notice you know
this each time you make a state change
or an update to your smart contract or
your writing to it it does cost a
certain amount so you know we have two
point six seven one ETH once this
approves both that and the equivalent US
dollar value will go down slightly not
quite as much as when you actually
deploy the contract but every time you
make an update you know you're adding
for instance I a new instructor to our
case in our case then it will go down
alright so now we can see that it's
updated and it has worked all right so
hopefully you learned quite a bit
throughout this course and so you could
take that same contract and just change
to the main theory of network in made a
mask and deploy there using your real
aetherium because you will need actual
ether to deploy it and so yeah going
through this if you're a beginner you
should definitely have a solid footing
now going forward when creating your
smart contract so look out for more
courses in the future we've really just
I touched basically the the very
beginner aspects of it but there's a lot
more to
going forward so keep an eye out on my
youtube channel or my website in my
youtube channel alright talk to you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
