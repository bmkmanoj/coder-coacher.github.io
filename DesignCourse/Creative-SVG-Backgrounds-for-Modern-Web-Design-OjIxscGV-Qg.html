and today I wanted to do a tutorial on
is VG's and using them as both
background images and also not in order
to create the sort of eye it's kind of
trendy I've been seeing in a lot in 2018
this type of landing page as you can see
here on my monitor eye where basically
you have different cutouts in the SVG
itself and I'm gonna show you exactly
how to do that using a adobe illustrator
CC though you don't have to use it you
can use any vector application and then
I'm also gonna show you how to actually
make it a reality in the browser with
HTML and CSS alright so before we get
started make sure you check out corset
row comm and subscribe here alright
let's get started alright so to get
started I'm using adobe illustrator for
this though you can use any other vector
drawing application that has a pen tool
that allows you to use Bezier curves all
right so if you don't have illustrator
don't let this to you know detract from
the experience of watching this tutorial
so I'm gonna come up here to the let's
see here we'll go to web and we will
just leave this preset on so I'm gonna
hit create alright so now we have all
these windows up here let's get this
zoomed up so we can see the whole thing
alright so we'll say this just as the
the above-the-fold portion of a web
layout and by the way what I'm doing
here this could also work with you know
something that's for mobile or for apps
or whatever - alright so what I want to
do is I will just start off with the pen
tool in and of itself and I'm gonna
start up here up top by just putting an
anchor point around upper left corner
you have your guides that will help you
naturally here in most applications and
it's somewhere probably around the
middle doesn't have to be the exact
middle but I guess I'll we have the
guide there might as well just
left-click and so here's our second
Anchor Point we have one two and then
now this section will cut it out from
the SVG so that it's pure white and that
way
the navigation can go here alright so
I'm just gonna come down a little bit
I'm going to hold shift and just to drag
out to create a Bezier curve and then
just end it right around I'd say right
around there I'm just eyeballing it
really and this is one of these common
trends I'm starting to see more of like
some type of unique cut out where
there's a navigation here so I'm going
to just come all the way around and then
there we go it's holding shift just
create perfectly correct angles and
lines there so now with this selected we
don't want to you know and a stroke so
I'm going to hit zero all right sweet
now the fill don't want white and I'd
rather have a gradient so if I click on
the gradient over here and click it with
the gradient tool over here
I'm just gonna choose Leonard linear hit
G and then just drag kind of like a
diagonal alright and again there's no
right or wrong and this is just the
approach I'm taking so for the first
color switch to RGB here I don't know
maybe I'll have something like a a blue
I didn't have one like really specific
in mind something like right around
there will be good so that color code is
to a a 9ff right there alright hit enter
we'll take this second color picker and
we'll go back to our G B this one will
just have well kind of come over here to
the green section actually like that
right there so that's three fffe see I
believe it's kind of small on my monitor
I'm at a 4k resolution though I'm just
in this container of 1920
alright so that's good right there you
can of course have more colors if you
wish you can use a radial gradient or
whatever but um I'm happy with this
right here it's pretty subtle but it
does have nice color so
now we could just call it quits and
that's it you could have a logo over
here you have your navigation over here
and that's that but we can add even more
we can do you know here in Adobe
Illustrator at least and I know other
vector applications have it just the
ability to cut out easily from this
shape to just to create more you
interesting a more interesting
background here so I think I'll do that
and one thing that you can do I mean
once you start to understand the vector
tools and all of the different things
you can do you can just have fun with it
so I'm gonna take the ellipse tool
alright just drag out something around
that size for now control C control F to
duplicate alright notice I kind of put
it directly in the center over here
holding shift waiting for those
guidelines to show up control C control
F control C control F maybe one more
time so I have like five of them alright
now we're gonna take all of them and
we're gonna go to window and then
Pathfinder it's showing up on my other
screen and we're just going to unite
them and since that has happened
oops I think I also had the background
there you go now we want to unite them
now we have the single shape right here
what I want to do is you know we could
leave it like this that's fine but I
want to kind of smooth these out these
these edges right there so to do that we
can use the small smooth tool and that's
right here so I'm just going to go over
this area I'm just gonna left click and
that notice now it's just smooth those
out ever so slightly you can do it
several times
and it'll make it even smoother I think
I'm happy with that we only did it to
the top portion bottom portion isn't
going to be used and what I mean using
this for by the way it's make it white
I'm gonna cut it out of this section
down here I'm gonna make this really
large one holding shift and I want to
get this into place all right something
right around there you take both of
these paths
selected and then just minus front all
right so now we just have something it's
a little bit different instead of just a
straight line to separate whatever
contents beneath this this hero section
now it's you know something just unique
I'm not sure necessarily if I even like
it but this is just for demonstration so
at this point we could call it quits but
there's one more thing I want to do you
can also I also another thing I'm
starting to notice is I as a common
trend is having other kind of SVG
overlays of different geometric shapes
and so I'll do two of those common just
say a common element lips just get this
here in the center and maybe we'll just
have this half so I'll take the direct
selection tool up there just like the
left anchor point and delete it and then
also to make it stand out in different
color we can just take this here and
we're going to modify this gradient for
it right here so first I'm going to take
this color right here and we're going to
make the opacity zero and then we'll
take this and we'll just kind of make it
more on the pinkish side all right so
it's kind of subtle and that's that's
the look I'm going for
so that's the first one we could do
other unique stuff we could take the
polygon tool all right and then so we
have like a 1 2 3 4 5 6 a hexagon and I
we have these you can barely see them
these little corner radiuses pull these
in something interesting like that all
right let's go put this up over here and
then delete the right side of this
and then move it over alright I know it
looks kind of crappy right now but once
we get the type on and a navigation and
kind of like a centered sub like a
headline in sub headline it starts to
look pretty decent alright so these are
the three shapes that we're going to use
for this sort of colorful landing page
and so real quickly I'm just going to
take these and where's my layers at and
we can click this I collect for export
alright so we could do that for each one
of these let's see here here and here
probably could have selected all three
and just clicked it once what am i doing
oh I had all three selected apparently
let's back up I just want this layers oh
we need to select it actually right here
there we go
so now let's see if I could select all
three this is like one of the first
times I'm using this option there we go
now they're all there and we have them
named this one's going to be this is
going to be on the right I'm just going
to call this the right side this is the
right here this is on the left and then
asset 4 is just a BG for background
alright so now we want this to be of a
type SVG and I have a new folder for the
project for the web project and my code
folder this is where I store my project
sacks I just call this SVG BG's but
design whatever name in what you want
and then also an empty images folder
that's where we're gonna put those so
select folder and now it's exported them
awesome so now we can go ahead and get
started on the coding portion so to do
that I have that folder opened up with
the images we need to create an
index.html file I'm gonna put hold oh by
the way I'm using Visual Studio code
this is free and it gives you some handy
snippets I'm gonna put an exclamation
point hit enter to get just our basic
boilerplate down
control B right here will hide the
sidebar
all right so just call this SVG BG's and
then we'll get a reference to a CSS file
so link rel equals stylesheet and then a
href is sports / CSS folder doesn't
exist yet this will be main CSS all
right let's just knock out the HTML real
quick so um and there's not gonna be
much so the very first two elements I
want a place here so if you think about
this in terms of I you know eight HTML
in terms of what's comes first first we
have the body tag this will contain the
BG SVG as the background and then on top
of that next comes the two left in right
images so that's that would be this one
and this one and we'll use
position:absolute for that so we'll have
image source equals forward slash images
left is VG we'll give it an ID of Left
will replicate this ctrl shift down
arrow key this will be right and we'll
call this right as well all right
then next after that we have a nav I'm
just going to put the logo inside of it
it's going nowhere the ID is logo and
we'll just say awesome company after
that an unordered list for the list
navigation so we'll have list item a
link going nowhere about us and then
we'll hit shift alt down arrow key just
three times and then I'll put in
services and contact something very
simple
alright then after that we only have a
div class of container and we'll put in
an h1 element with my snazzy headline
and then ap paragraph I'm just going to
type in lorem
hit enter I don't think I wanted to be
quite this much text so I'm gonna just
get rid of over here alright there we go
that's it for the HTML very very simple
so next let's go ahead and create that
folder so control B we're gonna create
the CSS folder inside of it a file
called main CSS alright so to get
started let's control B again we'll have
our body and our HTML element and we'll
just say height a hundred percent margin
zero to get rid of default margins the
color of the text elements will be white
for our headline sub-headline then font
family I have I Mont Surat installed on
my PC but if you don't it's a Google web
font you can just use the link code
above from paste in main CSS at the top
use whatever font you want of course
reference the anchors here so color will
say is white as well
text-decoration:none
we don't want an underline and then
referencing the body specifically will
give our background alright so URL is
going to be pointing down out of folder
to images and then to PG SVG and
no-repeat and then also we're gonna have
the background size
is cover height oh I already have height
hundred percent and then padding-bottom
I'm gonna give a lot just to simulate
you know what it looks like beneath so
we can see those eye those little things
there's a little ocean wave thing that
we did so left position will say is
absolute and then top so from the top of
the browser will push it down by 60% at
this point let's check to see just what
it looks like it's gonna look like crap
but see what it looks like in the
browser I'm gonna go to view integrated
terminal and I have I'm just gonna put
HTTP server here now this is an NPM
package if you don't have an install
just type in NPM by the way you need
nodejs and NPM as well before you can
run that command but NPM I install HTTP
- server - g4 global so that looks like
for instance MPM i and then i is a
shorthand for install it would be HTTP
server - g you only have to run that
once then you can just run HP server
from anything and now it's going to give
us a little quick server at localhost
808 oh oh and by the way when we
exported it from Adobe when we specified
the images folder it created an SVG
folder itself which will break the links
so if I reveal this in Explorer we just
have to get into there and then put that
into images itself and then delete the
SVG folder so right now it's being used
we'll just leave it there alright so now
this is what we have going pretty ugly
so don't worry we'll fix that
momentarily alright so I'm coming back
here to our main CSS file let's just
take control B and now so what see we
have our left now we need a right
the position of course will be absolute
as well and then if I could actually
spell it or type it right and then this
one we're going to have top by about 20
percent
and then we're going to have right 0
that will push to the right of the
browser and then z-index I'll put 1 and
then after that we're gonna have a nav
so the padding when you give it thick
padding so 50 pixels by the way we're
not going to make this responsive so
just be wary if you wanted to make it
responsive you know you're gonna need to
use media queries to kind of reset
things or change them a little bit so
next we have our nav ul our unordered
list list style type none we'll get rid
of those bullets and then we're going to
float it to the right of the browser
next is our nav ul Li these will just
display inline float:left or ya
float:left
oh and by the way you don't need to do
that when we already have display inline
kind of using the old-school stuff you
can use the CSS grid now actually when
just making it this fast uh we're gonna
make them black padding will be 0 30
pixels from the right and left and then
our logo we're gonna increase the size
to 2 e/m let me just save this for now
check out what we have so far in the
browser mean let's see your CSS mean CSS
by the way this is an ideal development
environment I've normally would use
something that would auto refresh I'll
reload the browser and stuff upon file
changes but I don't want to have all
that setup for this tutorial so now
we're actually getting there pretty
quickly so let's keep on going it's
actually not very much left I think just
three more rule sets after this so we're
gonna have our container will say
text-align:center width is 60% and the
margin will be 110 pixels from the top
and bottom and auto will center it then
we'll have our h1 element we're going to
increase the size to 3.5 am
and then our container paragraph will
say font size increases well to 1.3 and
then the line height will increased by
1.4 so now let's go back refresh there
we go so I hopefully that was a pretty
good primer just on using you know being
very creative with your SVG graphics and
using it you know to relatively quickly
to create something that's pretty
colorful and vibrant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
