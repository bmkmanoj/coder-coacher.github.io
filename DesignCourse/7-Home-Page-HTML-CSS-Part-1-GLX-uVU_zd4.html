this lesson we're going to go ahead and
slightly diverge from where I was
rigidly planning on doing for the next
three videos which is going to take care
of all the images in one video and save
them then the next video to the HTML and
the CSS I'm gonna do something a little
bit different that's going to give us a
better initial payoff where we're just
going to basically tackle each section
of this homepage design in terms of
saving the images that are just relevant
to the top portion then doing the HTML
and then doing the CSS all in the same
video so this will be split up into
several different videos but this way at
least we get a payoff and we can
actually see it start to function here
in this very first video okay so the
first thing we want to do is just save
the logo and then we're also going to
save the background as images so let's
go ahead and get started I with the move
tool select and also like layer selected
make sure we have the logo layer
selected hit ctrl a and then ctrl C and
then we'll go to file new ctrl V to
paste it in there and also by the way if
your background is not already
transparent the way you do that is just
go to file new and set background
content to transparent and that way when
in the future when you open it up it
will be set at transparent so we want
that background to be transparent so I
we're going to go ahead to go to file
save for web and I've learned a shortcut
so I'll be using that instead of the
menu from now on alright and doing that
it brings up this dialog where we can
specify the different types of files
that we want to save if I'm going to use
PNG 24-bit for this and we'll keep it on
transparency so I'm just going to save
it now I've created a directory
structure um basically this is HTML and
then in there we have images I'm going
to create another one called CSS and
then also j/s okay so we will obviously
save this in images folder
and for this we'll call it logo and then
just hit enter all right now we want to
do the background so one thing I'm going
to do real quick is just hide this and
hide the logo layer as well that way we
can kind of see a full portion of the
background I know what I'm going to do
is zoom up and use make sure that's
normal we're going to use the
rectangular marquee tool to select a
portion here which will repeat and so
I'll let that go and let me just zoom
out to like you see the bottom and then
just hold shift to add to the selection
and make sure you get it perfect and
it's okay if there's well I can go ahead
and hit alt and delete that one portion
the pixels down there all right you know
if i zoom up I did get a little bit too
much there so what I'll just do is hold
alt shave off that extra pixel now we'll
go ahead to edit copy merged control N
and then control V now save for web this
time it'll be a PNG eight and we'll call
this top - BG okay so let me go ahead
and we're at a hundred percent let me
just zoom out a little bit and let's
bring these back real quick okay so now
we've saved basically two graphic files
for the background which will repeat and
also the logo up here this is the actual
navigation but there's no images that
are part of this so we don't have to
worry about saving this as a separate
image this will be achieved through HTML
and CSS alone same with the we designed
superior logos and at the sub-headline
so that's the portion that we're going
to focus on I getting ready
for this initial video so for our HTML
in CSS we're going to use what's called
bootstrap now this is from Twitter and
what it is as a state Sears is a sleek
intuitive a power of mobile first
front-end framework for faster and
easier web development now what this
basically means I it's basically i
portions of CSS that are already defined
when you download it and it has a really
good documentation on how to use it and
it's all structured here to let you know
I basically how you can use this in your
designs to speed up the process of
developing responsive websites so of
course our design is going to be
responsive but I'm not going to get too
much into giving you an overview I'm
just going to jump in and you'll learn
naturally as we progress so the first
thing you need to do is just download
bootstrap and see I've already
downloaded it but if I open it up here
we'll see we have a folder called dist
now remember I created those two folders
CSS and j/s already and you can just
take the both these files or just one
and go ahead and extract them to your
CSS folder here and then same thing with
the bootstrap j/s there now one thing
that is kind of unfortunate is right now
bootstrap 3 is relatively new and
there's an option called customize up
here
but unfortunately it says until RC to
boot chapter 3 customizer will be
disabled so we're going to be
customizing portions of the bootstrap
build that we downloaded by hand and
usually it's made kind of a lot easier
if this customizer were available but no
big deal this way at least you'll be
able to get a more solid understanding
if you're new to CSS how to tweak things
yourself manually okay so I know that
you downloaded it and you've extracted
those files now we're going to open up
our
I code editor now I'm using what's
called sub line text - you can just
google it and if you're interested you
can buy it otherwise if you have no
money you can use notepad just for
writing out the code but this high
formats the code pretty nicely and it's
pretty popular so I again I've opened up
the folder HTML and you can see if we
open this up you'll see that we have the
files in here I had to pause it real
quick and add those because I didn't for
the video I and so also we have our two
image files so now we need to create an
actual HTML file here so I'm going to
get a new file and we'll just say this
as index.html and so we're going to go
ahead and get started with I just hand
typing out the code for the head so I
I'm going to get started here with
typing some HTML out and if you are
already familiar with this you can just
kind of fast forward just to get to the
portion where you already see me typing
this out I will go ahead and put the
head here and if you're unfamiliar or
you're new to HTML I'm not gonna sit
here and explain every single tiny
detail but you'll naturally understand
as we progress how you know everything
kind of sort of works
I'll give it a title a little bit design
Co and design and visual identity
professionals all right so this tag here
is important for making our design
responsive make sure we don't have any
spelling errors there all right and we
also want to make sure we link our
bootstrap CSS files here so I'm gonna
copy this and paste it into here and
then you can just make sure you have the
same exact thing so we have the
bootstrap CSS linked here which is in
this folder and then also we're going to
have a custom CSS file that we'll use
for custom CSS for our site and then
also we need to get the bootstrap GS
file linked as well so I'm just going to
link that right here and also we need a
copy of jQuery so I'm going to do that
as well
just above it and I pasted this in here
and if you need this exact link you can
paste it and use this type in jQuery and
Google API in Google and you'll be able
to find that ok so that takes care of
the head so now we need to put the body
tags and this is where everything will
go now if you're familiar with bootstrap
bootstrap 3 is quite a bit different
than bootstrap 2 so the way I the
scaffolding and the div names work and
all that is quite different but if you
switched back to the CSS area it'll
basically tell you exactly what you
need to know I so let's go ahead back
here real quick and the first div that
we're going to add is div class equals
container all right
and inside here we're going to add a div
class equals row now what this class
would be for this this div rather will
be for this row up here so this is going
to be div that will basically encompass
these two portions the navigation the
logo over here all right so let's go
ahead and continue on and inside here
we're going to add the link for the logo
so a href equals four now I'm just going
to put the number sign and then class
equals nav bar - brand and then the
image tag here logo dot PNG and close
the tags up and so what this is this
class here this is predefined bootstrap
class for the CSS for navbar brand and
what that does is just automatically
adjusts the the logo right here based on
the device that your you're viewing it
on so it's just a quick way to get some
alignment going for the responsive
aspects all right so now under here we
have a little bit more HTML to write out
here for the navbar so let's go ahead
and get started with that there's a div
class equals navbar and this is also a
predefined bootstrap CSS class
all right and inside here I we're also
going to have a container and inside the
container now we're going to have a
html5 element button type equals button
class equals navbar toggle data - toggle
equals collapse and data
- target equals navbar responsive
collapse now basically I took this HTML
I just copied and pasted it when I
initially want to set this project up
for recording and that is right here
once we go down to components we have
nav bar and then we have responsive nav
bar so this is where this codes come
from right here that we're about to type
out so what this does the responsive nav
bar is you'll see pretty shortly once we
progress in this video when we scale in
the width of the browser the nav bar
will automatically transition from
looking like this and then into a
mobile-friendly version which will drop
down so let's go ahead and continue and
I'm going to go back here and just copy
this portion
all right and actually I'm going to
delete that portion okay and then
underneath there I'm going to copy again
actually I'm going to do it from a
different file off of my other monitor
I'm going to copy and paste and then
I'll quickly explain what's going on
here
all right so now we have a div class
equals in this is basically this line
right here and let me go back and then
we have a an unordered list which
actually serves for the HTML for the
menu and what we have here so that the
div class is nav collapse and then we
also have a secondary collapse and then
a navbar responsive collapse now when
we're talking about the data target the
target is the same class name as this so
this basically means is the links inside
are not the links rather but the the
list item at the menu will automatically
be turned into a button basically for
mobile and so we also have UL class we
have nav nav pills pull or write and
then also my - top - nav now these are
all these three right here are also
bootstrap predefined CSS elements and if
you explore just a little bit in here
you'll see for example if you hit ctrl F
and we put in pull right well then we
can see that what happens when we add
these so add pull right - a drop-down
menu to right align the drop-down menu
so we want to do that because we want
this to be right aligned over here all
right in
and we could do this further with nav
peels so what exactly is that well we
can control F nav pills so we could take
if we look up here I
we have UL class nav nav tabs or we can
change this to a you'll class nav nav
pills and that gives us basically this
container outside of the actual menu are
the links rather and we want the nav
pills because in our design we have
basically the same sort of thing going
on all right
so then we have the actual links right
here which is portfolio testimonials
login and get started and when you add
UL class equals active and again this is
a jar of bootstrap we could see that
adding active to a specific link makes
it I basically let me see here it gives
us this effect right here alright so let
me go ahead and make sure everything is
good to go and it looks like it is for
that HTML so now let's go ahead and
create a new file and we'll go ahead and
save this in CSS and call it custom CSS
all right and now we're going to do the
actual CSS for the background pattern
all right so the first thing I'm going
to do is add a comment up here custom
logo design does CEO
CSS and and that all right so the body
tag is where we'll specify the
background
repeat - X means it will repeat to
horizontally go ahead and save that and
now let's go ahead and view what this
looks like so I'm going to open
containing folder and double click this
alright so now you can see we have I
this is obviously incorrect so we're
gonna have a little work to do in order
to get this looking like this but we can
see definitely already we have the
background working for us at least back
here alright so now what we want to do
is do some custom CSS specifically for
my top nav now remember my top nav is
basically this portion over here and
we're going to make the links white and
a couple of the things so let's go ahead
and a custom CSS get some lines to work
with here and my - top - nav and let me
add a right here for the link so this
will allow us to style the link
specifically and color FFF is white and
then also I'm going to change the font
size to 1.7 m now if we save this and
refresh you see that they've been added
they've been a little bit bigger and
they're not white so let's go back I'm
gonna copy this and then also add some
CSS for the hover state when you hover
your mouse over it and the specific
color will be this color code right here
which is a blue alright and then I'll
paste this again just get rid of this my
top nav margin
15 pixels zero and so let's go ahead and
view this alright so now we've got the
hovers working alright okay so basically
if we bring back our browser we'll see
that we have this basically this gray
color this that's going around now this
is real important basically if you need
to figure out on troubleshoot you know
exactly which CSS element you need to
change in bootstrap in order to do
something in Chrome if you hit ctrl
shift I you'll get this pop-up right
here now I'm just going to drag this off
the screen you're not gonna be able to
see it but if you select this little
magnifying glass down there you'll see
that if you hover over anything and also
Firefox has a very similar tool so you
can research what exactly you need to
get to what shortcut it is that you need
to do to get that up but if it works the
same way so if you hover over anything
and then click on it in that window it
will automatically select the HTML
element so we'll see that this right
here is div class navbar okay and then
on the right hand side you'll see that
it shows all of the CSS properties for
navbar and we can see right here
background color has the color right
there so that's where we want to go and
remove from the bootstrap CSS file so go
back to our editor click on bootstrap we
can do a control F to find navbar and
you may have to find it several times to
find exactly where we want to go and
we'll see it is right there so if we
delete that and save it and go back to
our browser here we'll see now we have
the actual design
all right so now if we scale this in we
can see it begins to slightly start to
work I do that a couple more times and
we will be adjusting these further so
now what we want to do make this
background here to get started
white and then also invert the get
started text to this color down here so
again we can use the dev tool here by
hitting ctrl shift hi and we'll use the
finder there and then just select click
once there and that gives us this right
here so it's an Li class equals active
and then the link is a so the CSS is
right here so the background color is
set this blue color and then the color
for the text is white so if we want to
find that real quickly we'll just copy
that and then in bootstrap we'll find
right here and then for the color well
for the background first we're going to
make it white and the color we're going
to go to Photoshop and take the
eyedropper tool and select that right
there this is our color code down here
and then we can paste this in for color
and save it and now we have something
that's starting to resemble what we have
in Photoshop at least okay so now what I
want to do is go ahead and make the
actual links the text we want it to be a
different font than this so what I'll do
is we're going to use a font again that
is called source sans Pro and it's a
Google web font so if we go here to our
editor I have the HTML already that we
can include for that specific font and
I'm just going to copy it and then paste
it right there and the way I get this is
if we go to Google and we just type in
Google web font we'll see that I we have
source sans Pro right here but if we go
here we have all these fonts that we can
use on our website so if we just type in
source and we click this quick use
button we can have the option to choose
all these different styles so I chose a
three or chose a three hundred and a
bold seven hundred and when you do that
it automatically updates the HTML down
here and we can copy that and add it in
it gives you instructions and how to use
it into the CSS so that's just a quick
tip so now let me go to our editor here
and now that we have it included in the
HTML up here now we have to specify it
in bootstrap to use this new font that
we have so if we go to our editor here
and we go to bootstrap dot CSS and do
control F and to just type in - font -
family we'll start it up here alright
and do it a couple more times right here
for body we have font - family Helvetica
new well if we change this to source
sans Pro and hit ctrl s to save you'll
see it does get slightly changed but if
we want to let me experiment real quick
font - wait 300 okay that doesn't update
that because that's text let me go down
here and I made a statement steak so I
had to pause it real quick this should
be above so that we can it can get
loaded first before we referenced it
here in these files so that's why if we
refresh this will change to the correct
font okay so let's go ahead and see what
this looks like so far if we scale it
down and we're going to want a outline
of this so we're definitely not finished
yet but let me scroll out here and I
want to put some margin basically
between these elements so if I hit ctrl
shift I to bring that back out you can't
see it yet and we just select once and
we could see in here I be my top now for
the class that we could specify here so
let me see real quick if we go ahead and
see here that we have I the right here
is what we want to copy go to bootstrap
which will find that
sorry about that changes padding down
from the top here from 2 from 4 to 8 and
then I want to do a search for nav pills
and where it says margin-left - we're
gonna change the 30 just to give them
more space in between all right just
like that okay so now I let me just drag
this in to see how everything's coming
and we'll have to adjust that okay so
when we hover over these we could see
that they are not quite white there's
still like this gray color so basically
we have to search for a hover state so
let me hit control shift I and we go
here we'll see it is now Li a so let me
do a quick search hopefully I can find
this real quick and we have Li on the
hover we have background color right
here just change that to white see if
that affects it correctly and it does
okay so let's see if we look at our
version we have a more rounded basically
container here so we have to increase
the border radius of this portion right
here so I believe that is class active
so we just do some finding here and one
thing we could do is do a search for
border radius
this may be it right here not enough
pills Li a all right let me just
experiment and see if it is or not I'm
gonna try 30 pixels just a test and it
looks like that's it so that's good
alright I okay so let's see what we have
here we see that it is breaking right
there so we have to definitely address
that and so we can find out the exact
portion of where it is breaking I just
buy these rulers right here it's by
taking the font size here for these
links and scaling them down in that way
it will prevent that this issue from
occurring so let's go over on to our
editor here and we're going to look in
bootstrap for a specific line here and
I'm just going to type it in at media
width and it is right here so if I just
copy this and then paste it into our
custom close it up over here basically
if you're unfamiliar with media queries
so this is basically what makes
something responsive so if the viewport
is within 768 pixels and 991 pixels then
any of the CSS that goes here will
override anything that's up here so we
just want to change the font size of my
bash top that's nav a to font size 1.4
p.m. and we can add important to make
sure that actually works and font size
up here by default is 1.7 but if we
change to one point four and we refresh
now we can see that it scales down
slightly so you can see how it kind of
changes and that's the point where it
scales down and then this portion is
when the menu is changed I for phone
cell phones basically or any other small
device all right so now what I want to
do I is get a bar that shows up here so
if we hit control shift I and make sure
this is selected and we click right
there we see we have div class and nav
bar now we removed where it said the
background color but we can specify it
in our CSS specifically for this size to
be a certain color and so if we go to
our editor we're going to I'm just going
to copy this real quick delete this
stuff in the middle and this one is just
going to change to max width 7 67 so any
of this anything inside this portion
will pertain to smaller viewports so the
CSS for that was navbar and let me
delete that background - color is still
white let's see how that looks
and now we can see that it is now white
and of course these are not showing up
correctly either so we can adjust those
and so let's go to our source here and
since the colors were white for the
links
all we have to do is my actually I can
just copy and paste this real quick
the color is should be the blue color
that we have and if we save that we can
see them all now but we don't want them
to be right aligned I want them to be
vertically stacked so the way we can do
that is to take my top nav li
display:block clear both and now they
are also kind of right aligned so let's
go fix that and this will just be my top
now just that container and this will be
float:left important
all right so now we have an issue where
these are kind of to the right so let's
go ahead and fix that
so if we hit control shift I real quick
will see that we have nav pills Li plus
Li we have margin left 30 so that's
where we need to that's what we need to
fix so if you just control copy that and
put it under here margin left zero save
it
refresh and now we see that it's updated
all right and then one final thing is I
want to create some basically margin
here I don't want this going straight up
against the side of the device or the
browser so what we can do is control
shift I and the very first container or
the class the div that we have is
container and so that's what we can
adjust here so if we select it we'll see
what the current CSS is and all we have
to do is go into here bootstrap and we
found it right here and I'm just going
to put margin
we're padding rather sorry and now we
get that gives us five pixels but a me
want to do it just a tad bit more than
that
all right and that's a good portion I
guess a good place to stop right there
so in the next video we will continue on
with doing the exhume out here the
headline in the sub headline and then
we'll also start with this section down
here alright I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
