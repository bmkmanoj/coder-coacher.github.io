comm and now that we know the very
basics of how to install angular let's
go ahead and look more specifically
about how it all works so in this video
we're going to cover the very basics of
components and so first we're gonna
start looking at what a component is and
then we're going to start our own
angular project with the angular client
and then we're going to look at what a
component looks like in actual coding
and then we're going to create our own
component manually and then use the
angular client to create one
automatically components are the
fundamental building blocks that define
both the logic and the views also known
as templates of an angular project now
more specifically a component consists
of a view which is defined by HTML and a
class which includes the logic defined
by properties and class methods now if
you feel confused on exactly what that
means don't worry you'll figure it out
shortly as we progress throughout this
series now to give you a visual
perspective of how the views of
components might be laid out let's take
a look at a standard layout now the
following applies to a website as seen
here or an app now structurally this
page has three primary sections it has a
header a main content area and a sidebar
to the right so we have the header up
here which would be a component the main
content area over here which would be
another component and then finally a
sidebar over here which would be yet
another component now also note that
components are neste below so let's go
ahead and switch over to our code editor
to see what a component looks like in
actual coding okay so here in get bash
or whichever command-line tool you want
to use in your projects folder if you
want to create a brand new angular 2
project simply type in ng new and a
project title hit enter and let it run
it will take a little bit of time now
because I already did this from the
preview
in this series I'm just going to CD into
that angular 2 project so I'm gonna type
in CD angular - fastest which was the
name I gave it and then type in ng serve
so this will take just a few seconds to
compile everything and get it running
make sure everything works here and no
errors or spit out ok and then we'll
check our browser real quickly for
localhost 4200 alright now let's go over
here to the code editor I have angular -
fastest opened up here we're gonna go to
source app and then app component TS so
this is what a basic component looks
like and it's split up into three
different sections so up here we have
the import we have what's called a
component decorator and then the
exported class so import up here by the
way we can import multiple members and
have multiple imports imports simply
means we're importing a member which
could be by the way a function a value
or a class of some sort from other
modules and by the way a module is
simply a file in angular that either
imports or exports one of those members
from either the angular library a
third-party library or your own modules
now if that was confusing don't worry
we're going to keep going over this
stuff so eventually you'll commit it to
memory and you'll internally understand
it
alright so after that we have the
component decorator alright so what is
that
basically we have inside here what's
called metadata and these are just a
series of properties and values that let
angular to know information about our
component now we absolutely must have a
selector and a template to define our
view that's all that's required not
necessarily even this Styles URL over
here and basically the selector allows
us to communicate a custom HTML tag
and that allows us to can communicate
what is inside the view or the template
itself over here so if we look at index
dot HTML down here inside of the root
we'll see we have this app - root tag
now of course this isn't something
that's rooted in HTML as a regular tag
it's something that we've made up and
specified here in the app - or component
es app root all right and then down here
finally we have export class app
component and you don't necessarily have
to have anything inside of here however
if your application does require some
type of logic you would specify it in
here inside app component and then
finally over an app dot module TS
whenever you have a component that your
application uses you must first import
it right here and then you also must
specify it as the exported name that you
gave it into declarations ok so let's go
ahead and create our own component
manually and then after that we'll go
ahead and create one through the angular
client so let's go ahead and we're going
to click on our app folder right here
and create a new folder you will just
call this header inside of header we're
gonna create two new files so we'll
create one called header dot component
PS and then another header dot component
HTML ok
so let's create our component now if you
remember itit by default we must import
component at the very top so import
component from angular - core alright
now we have to give it the component
decorator component and then we have to
give it a selector and we'll put that as
app - header really you can name it
whatever you want and then also down
here if you recall in their app
component
have template URL which could either be
again in line if it's in line we simply
get rid of URL and then specify the HTML
here or if we want a separate file which
is our case we specify template URL here
so let's go back and we'll paste that in
and simply change this here to header
component HTML oops ok after that we
have to export class and header
component we'll go ahead and save this
and now the second step is we have to
come back to app module dot es and
import it so let's copy this line header
component from ford slash pedr pedr dot
component and then finally make sure
that comma is there after app component
and put in header component ok so now if
we were to go to the browser and refresh
this nothing's going to happen for two
reasons first we have to specify
something inside the header dot
component on HTML for now let's just put
instead of HTML just type in header and
then secondly we have to come to the app
component dot HTML and we have to add in
that selector so we'll go ahead and to
specify app - header and add the closing
tag and remember we use app - header
because we define that as the selector
right here all right make sure anything
else that needs saved is saved and then
we go back to our browser and we see
header has now shown up so now this is
consisting of two different components
header and the default app component
right there so now let's go ahead and
create one automatically through the
angular client and you'll see how this
saves us quite a bit of time
so let's go ahead and open up this I'm
gonna hit ctrl C just to get out of the
ng surf mode and I'm gonna type in ng
new component and we're gonna specify
our component name let's say footer oops
I'm not actually let's see here you
cannot use a new command inside an
angular client project oops sorry about
that and in G generate component butter
there we go
new is not correct alright so you can
see it created some files here but it
also did a little bit more than just
create files so let's go ahead back here
you can see we now have a new footer
folder we have a CSS file HTML and by
default it adds some HTML in here footer
component TS by the way it adds some
things that we didn't see initially it
added on an it which is a life cycle
hook and by the way we'll describe what
that is exactly in a later video and
also export class footer component
implements the on in it it added a
constructor for dependency injection
which we'll also cover in a later video
and then we have our ng on a net I
method here which by the way we'll cover
again later on you don't really need to
worry about that now also down in app
component es or app top modules FTS it
imported this for us as well here in the
imports and also it added it to the
declarations so now all we have to do is
we'll come back to app component HTML
and we'll add in app - footer and save
it and by the way let's make sure that
is the actual name of the selector by
going to the footer component es it is
right here app - footer and there we go
now if we go back to our browser we'll
see that it did not work hahaha but uh
oh that's
why ya wonder why that is let's go back
here type in ng serve and by the way if
you're really developing in real time
you would have two different command
lines open so that one is consistently
running ng serve and then the other one
you can run commands from so that's why
that happened so let's go back to our
localhost 4200 and footer works there we
go all right so hopefully now you have a
solid understanding about the very
basics of components and how they work
so now instead of delving more
specifically into the structure of
angular 2 in the next video I'm gonna
show you how you can import custom CSS
are not custom but CSS frameworks and
also work with templating in angular 2
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
