course calm welcome to design challenge
number 29 and this time we're gonna be
doing something we've never done before
now most of you are familiar with the
random mound logo designs I've done for
myself where I'd use a random noun
generator and generate two different
random talents and then try to combine
them in a single icon or a logo or
symbol of some sort well this time your
task is to do the same thing except for
yourself so I want you to use this site
i'm going to go ahead and link it in the
youtube description and it's basically
just a random noun generator go ahead
and click on generate random down and
get yourself two different random nouns
and then try to combine those and it's
single unique symbol as if it were for a
logo design and this is great practice
for logo design specifically alright so
make sure you know you try to limit
yourself and when you do your submission
when you submit make sure that you
include you know which to random nouns
that you were trying to symbolize all
right so I'll fast forward to the screen
real quick just so I can go over the
more specific rules alright make sure
first to subscribe here at YouTube if
you haven't yet and check out design
course calm alright so here is the
challenge thread you can find the link
in the YouTube description and so
basically objective is to visit this
link first which is the random now
generator and choose to and click
generate so what that means is it
specifies you know how many random nouns
do you want and you choose to and then
you simply just click generate all right
so this one generated message and size
and so the the objective is to take
these two nouns here and try to design a
single symbol perhaps if it were part of
like a logo design like a symbol
something very simple that takes these
two ideas and combines them into a
single symbol this is otherwise known as
a monogram alright so I was to go over
the requirements real quick so symbolize
only two nouns not one or three but two
I when used to meet your entry specify
which two words you were trying to
convey so that's very important so when
you click upload
on the image also in the thread post or
through a reply specify which two words
don't do not use any type in your design
no letters or numbers keep it simple and
avoid unnecessary visual aesthetics like
blurs gradients bevels please do not
submit that flag design is usually best
for logo design and then make it big
enough so that I can see it but also use
good white space so you know if you have
few documents like this big like right
here this white portion don't make it so
that you know the symbol is touching
this edge and this edge you know just
scale it down good enough but not too
small all right so submission deadline
is always going to be this next coming
Sunday July fifth and 12 p.m. eastern
standard time now I created a couple of
these videos where I put myself on the
spot on my channel and you could check
that out just to get an idea of what I
did or how I approached the situation
basically and so you can check those
videos out of course so yeah looking
forward to the submissions I go ahead
and subscribe here at YouTube we haven't
yet and check out design course calm
also earlier today I released a video I
design coder I oh and this is a one
hundred percent free iOS and Android
course and so it's going to show you how
to design this fictional app which
happens to be a speech countdown timer
and I the initial videos right here are
where i show you how to design
everything and then my partner Viv's of
slide nerd calm who also has a similar
channel channel of similar size on
youtube i takes you through first
android app development if you want to
learn android and building an app or iOS
as well so pretty much one of the only
courses i think does that and it's
hundred percent free all right so check
that out i'm looking forward to this
mission sorry goodbye
