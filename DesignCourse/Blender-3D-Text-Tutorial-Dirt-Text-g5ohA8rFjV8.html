comm today we're going to do just a real
quick
blender text tutorial were going to make
it look like dirt and earthy or whatever
so it's all going to be about ten
minutes I've I'm actually really busy so
I'm going to speed through this video
tutorial really quick but you can always
just pause and rewind and whatever you
need to do alright so if you haven't yet
check out these on course comm and
subscribe here on YouTube alright let's
get started alright so basically we
never used blender before real quickly I
if you want to select objects you
right-click them by default if you want
to move around you use your third mouse
button or middle mouse button if you
want to zoom up you use your scroll
wheel if you want to pan you hold shift
in that third mouse button so it'll take
a little while to get used to be able to
quickly move around but that is expected
so I'm gonna hit file new reload startup
file just really looking at the same
thing I'm going to delete that cue by
hitting delete in an enter and then this
here is your origin point and that's
where any object that you add will go if
you hit shift a you can add a mesh and
we won the ups node I'm so used to
adding meshes we want to add a text
right there
so we zoom up we'll see it's laying flat
if you hit R for rotate you can move it
around like this if you hit X you can
only move it around on the x-axis and if
you want to be precise you can hit
ninety four ninety degrees up and down
on your keyboard and outer alright so
right now we're in object mode we want
to switch to edit mode you can also do
that by toggling and hitting the key tab
alright so if we want to delete the text
and change it we can just type it here
to earthy something relevant for what
we're about to do and now if we come out
here drag this thing so we can see all
the options and the panels what we want
to do is select this right here this
will allow us to add some 3d depth by
extruding it out a little bit and you
could also add depth this way as well
right so if yours looks like something
like that that's fine and now what we
want to do is hit alt + C on the
keyboard and make this into a mesh from
curve made of surf text now what that
does is once we go back into Tab mode
would we no longer can edit the text we
can only see all these crazy vertices
hanging around so what we want to do now
is UV unwrap it so what is that well if
you ever want to add a texture onto this
you need to unwrap it and that's
basically inclusive of all type of 3d
objects whether it's just square
initially that we saw or anything else
so if we take this left click a drag out
to the right you'll see the window
splits and we can change the view over
here so by default it's just a duplicate
of this viewport right here if you want
to change it to UV image editor I will
see this grid square type thing this is
where we see what the unwrapped UV mesh
looks like from this object so if we hit
a twice we can select all of everything
and just hitting it toggles on and off
so deselect all or select all so make
sure it's all selected hit you on your
keyboard and hit unwrap that's what it
looks like so it's crazy
if you hit you again you can experiment
smart UV unwrap hit okay looks a little
bit better and you can just play around
with these results once we get the
actual texture in so now that it's
adding wraps real quickly I'll change
the blender render site our blender
render engine to the Cycles render
engine and basically I exclusively
pretty much work in cycles render and so
now what we want to do is get out our
image for our texture so I've got out CG
textures calm just requires a free
registration to download some of these
and they have all these different
textures for use in 3d I or not our 2d
as well I click on soil and we click on
I believe it's rough
we'll see yeah yep that's it and then
over here we have these three textures
I'm going to choose one in the middle
I've already downloaded this and I have
an a project file so just click this
download after you create a registration
and then what we want to do is change
this viewed here to the node editor
and what obviously is blank here I so
what we want to do is reel clicking just
to make this easier - I'm going to right
click hit join area and then left click
over here and there pull drag down it's
a little bit easier to work this way so
if I change this again to the node
editor we'll see nothing's here what we
can do hit tab up here and we'll go over
here the material section and hit new
and we see these two what are called
nodes that show up over here and we can
move on around stuff what we want to do
is hit shift a we want to add texture
image texture and then left-click and
drag this color to that color input over
here and then you can hit open which
will bring you to your project folder or
you can navigate to it and this is what
I want and if we come over here change
solid to rendered we'll see we have our
texture that's now UV mapped on to that
text real quick I'm going to lighten
things up so if we come over here to the
real tab and increase that maybe we'll
make like a green color sort of alright
so this looks okay in and of itself but
if we want to really mess around with it
more we can play around with these nodes
so if you hit ctrl if you hold ctrl left
click you can sever that connection
we're going to add a mix shader' in
between shift a and we'll take in shader
and mix shader' all right moving things
around put that right there put this one
up here
ooh not the fact that there to this
bottom shader one right there and then
hit shift a and we're going to add a
glossy shader so a mixer allows you to
add two different shaders one final
thing I want to do is that a
displacement so hit shift in D to
duplicate that over there and we'll just
add this to displacement that we could
see we kind of have an interesting look
here already as if there's rocks or
something in here I mean then of course
you could play around with the color I
you could do all sorts of crazy things
obviously I'm just going to leave mine
near white
all right and let me go ahead and
right-click in that area and to join
this area down and I'm going to go over
here real quick to the render settings
change from CPU to GPU and that makes it
a lot faster if you have a GPU or
graphics price graphics card and you
don't have this option all you have to
do is go to file user preferences and
under system compute device choose CUDA
and you have your cards here I have two
GeForce GTX 580 s all right
and I basically over sampling that's one
thing I want to change preview is what
we're previewing right now there's only
ten samples by default which makes it
look grainy but if we include to 100 or
so it looks a lot better but it takes a
little bit longer to render same thing
for render when you go to finally render
it you can really turn that up to maybe
a thousand all right so one final thing
I want to do real quick is just I add a
plane so if I switch back to solid hit
shift a plane hit s for scale and just
type in 20 and be pretty big and we'll
go over here the materials hit new and
we'll come over here and change this to
a mixed shader then we have a two shader
inputs down here so you don't always
have to use the the node editor as we
did before you can mess around with
stuff over here
we'll make that first one a diffuse
which is down here the second one a
glossy which is right there so now if I
preview things go to rendered now it's
actually sitting on something if you
right-click the text it doesn't show you
in rendered view if it's selected but it
is selected because it changed textures
here if you hit G that's the shortcut
remove you can move it up so it's kind
of sitting right there even though the Y
is kind of caught off I'm not really
worried about that I but yeah that is it
so that's how you can quickly take like
a texture and just map it on to some
type of object to make something I kind
of cool and obviously in this case
irrelevant maybe you had to do like a
poster or something or I but but yeah we
have earthy text looking earthy of sorts
and that's it
for this tour I know I kind of move
but I have to be somewhere and so yeah
you can always just pause and stuff but
I anyhow I'm Gary Simon of design course
comm if you haven't yet subscribed here
on YouTube
I'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
