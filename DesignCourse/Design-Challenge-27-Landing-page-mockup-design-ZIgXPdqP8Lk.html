course calm welcome to design challenge
number 27 designing a landing page
mock-up in Adobe Photoshop all right so
don't worry if you think of landing page
that you're going to have to design some
elaborate thing it's going to take
forever there are specific instructions
and there's really not a lot that you
have to design for it's really just
going to be the top portion of a
fictional landing page and the goal is
to try to get the fictional customer or
the visitor the website visitor to enter
their email address and click on a call
to action submit button alright so let's
go ahead and check that out I'm going to
forward to the screen and I'll see you
there alright so here is the design
challenge number 27 thread landing page
mock-up design so already the objective
design a mock-up of a landing page for a
fictional water filtration company don't
ask me why I came up with that it just
did and that's that the name is going to
be flow FL 0 the purpose of this landing
page is to get visitors to enter the
email address in exchange for a coupon
all right so this is also known as a
squeeze page alright so the requirements
are use the following content so the
headline water is better with flow
sub-headline receive a ten percent off
coupon by entering your email and then a
description right here that I want you
to include somewhere and then the
call-to-action button copy is send me my
coupon so you're going to have probably
five different things here you have the
headline the sub headline the
description you're going to have the the
text field input design like where the
person is actually going to click to
enter their email and then deep call to
action button you can go ahead also in
you don't have to create a logo for flow
if you just want to make a type based
wordmark logo just use some type of font
that's fine so you can include that I
make sure that you design a noticeable
text field again you know once for the
email a tree base the design on at least
a 1280 x 1000 pixels design and do not
include a navigation or menu then that's
not necessary we don't need that so if
you want to include the the FL oh maybe
you can just Center it up right up at
the top if you wish use a lot of white
space
which means you know a lot of distance
between elements don't cram things
together next to the edge of the design
i use good contrasting colors of course
and check out land book calm for
inspiration so this is land book they
have a lot of different just it's
basically a website gallery of landing
pages and there's a lot of just well
very well designed landing pages here
now for this challenge we're only
focusing on just the top portion of this
fictional landing page you don't have to
sit there and design like a whole
landing page with a ton of content it is
as long as you have this that's good
just for this stuff alright so you know
here's an example of a landing page that
has an email address input right here I
this is their their headline well this
is the logo headline sub headline and
then the email address and then they
call to action button that's pretty much
all I'm looking for for this but of
course it's completely up to you in
terms of how you want to lay this out in
terms of you know if you want to have
like a background image or if you want
to have a separate image of to the side
that's completely up to you ok so please
if you're going to submit a design try
to make it on par with the the level of
quality of some of these designs you
know try to pay attention to how they
design their buttons their use of white
space see like this one for example has
a lot of white space you know they have
them their menu up here we have a lot of
distance between here in the headline
and it's very simple and it's just
something that works well so of course
I'm not looking for the HTML or css of
this at all all has to be is a mock-up
ok so submit by sunday june twenty first
which is five or six days from now and i
will reveal them all right so yeah make
sure you subscribe here on youtube if
you haven't yet check out the design
courses that i have up here if you
haven't yet and I'll see you later on
alright goodbye
