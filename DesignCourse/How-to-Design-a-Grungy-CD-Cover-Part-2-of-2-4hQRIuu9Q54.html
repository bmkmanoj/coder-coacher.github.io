we are going to focus on finishing our
grungy CD cover in adobe photoshop CC
alright so if you need access to the
logo for a design course I wish we're
going to be using in this video I you
don't have to but if you want access to
it it's available free and the
description below this video alright
let's get started ok so to continue on
I'm going to open up my logo that I'm
going to use basically and I'm just
going to set the resolution actually the
higher maybe like four hundred and I've
linked this by the way into project
files patrouille and control see that
and then bring it to the top layer and
just okay that was quite bigger than
what I wanted but that's no problem cool
ctrl T shift + alt + scale that down
it's right around here it apply and we
want to make this white and there's
several different ways you make an
object completely white so if you
double-click the right hand side of the
layer go to color overlay make it white
hit OK and ok then you can see right
click and rasterize that layer style but
I'm not going to do that yet because I
want to create a duplicate of this so
ctrl shift D or right click and go to
duplicate layer and the bottom one I'm
going to move out just a little bit here
to the left I for the color overlay
we're going to choose color right around
here so 0 0 5 DC for is color code ok
and ok and I'm going to right click and
rasterize that when you go to filter and
pixelate mezzotint i've been using out a
lot for this you know just kind of keep
things consistent and then filter blur
motion blur all right something right
around there and I'm going to take I the
blair blend mode just see if I I think
anything may work better and I think I
can all let's see if i can assume up
hundred percent so i can see this yeah
that looks bad like I said it's
experimenting so I'm going to keep them
going down
linear light looks pretty good that
worked earlier yeah so I'm going to
stick with linear light right there
which is right there all right and I'm
going to move this over a little bit and
then I'm going to take the Yap the
smudge tool and we'll make the size a
little bit larger maybe around 110 and
just drag out parts of this unevenly
though all right that way you know it
looks it doesn't look like a copier of
itself per se so let's just zoom out
here all right and you know my video
intro I kind of have my logo animating
in with like these I kind of like the
pen tool anchor points so I'm just going
to illustrate that real quickly so I'm
going to take the rectangle tool on the
very top layer and just hold shift drag
out and let me zoom up here to one
hundred percent I me want to be a little
bit bigger than that so ctrl t hold
shift and then just drag out a little
bit all right and then I'm going to take
let's see here the line tool start
somewhere around here and is dragged up
alright and then I'm going to take yeah
the ellipse tool right on that top
portion control h all right and then
ctrl D I'm in control shift D to
duplicate or right-click and duplicate
layer and then bread just drag it down
over here using my arrow keys alright so
we have all those three and now what I
want to do is take the actual line which
is shaped one duplicate that
take down the opacity a lot like around
yeah twelve percent works good duplicate
that again you right around there all
right let me zoom out see how this kind
of looks so far so far so good all right
so I kind of want to inque sit a little
bit just to add some other you know kind
of define lines amongst all this I guess
you could call it chaos so I'm going to
zoom up here take the line tool let me
get whites for the foreground and hold
shift and it's dragged out and then you
can duplicate that control shift D
patrol tea and hold shift and make it
perfectly up and down so I can move till
it apply and then just move them to the
side where they create kind of a an
angle there take both of them hit
control e and we can also rasterize
those real quick and then hit control I
to invert those to a white color alright
so zoom out and now i want to duplicate
that i'm just going to call these
brackets our corners whatever duplicate
it and go to edit transform flip
horizontal move it over this one take
both of those control e duplicate hit ok
edit transform flip vertical I know I'm
moving fast but you know you can always
pause no big deal all right and then
take both of those in merge those so now
they're all four on its own layer and
you can experiment with the layer blend
mode as well to see if there's something
that kind of sticks out color dodge
looks interesting
enemy want to take the opacity down just
a little bit great around there alright
so let's zoom out and see what this
thing looks like looks pretty cool so
far I may want to take everything with
exception to the background layers here
so holding shift I have all these layers
selected take the move tool just move
this more into place alright alright
this looks pretty cool so far I think
right there will be a good place just to
call it quits in terms of the actual
design so you know I think by by now you
get the idea when it comes to this
Grunch design I mean you could add so
much more to this but I would be getting
redundant if I continued so now what I
want to do is take this just kind of
impose it into a basically a CD case or
I think you're called jewel cases
alright so i found a image of a jewel
case on flickr which is free to use and
it's right here i've linked it in the
description so if you just right click
hit copy image the biggest image they
provide is 800 x 7 33 but that's ok just
for the purposes of presenting it so if
we go to file new hit OK after having
that copied pasted that in and let's
take everything by hitting control a and
then go to edit copy merged so that
basically copies all the layers not just
what's currently selected and then what
we want to do is take the pen tool the
shape selected and we'll just zoom in
here and we want to basically create a
selection that's going to be the size
roughly of our actual actually I'm going
to take this right down here alright and
then just left-click once come up around
here left click and you don't have to be
exactly precise initially because we can
adjust those points in their positions
so now take the select on the direct
selection tool take your mouse arrow or
your up and down keys rather
directional keys and you can kind of
begin to work with this try to get it
lined up correctly I think right there
is probably fine all right so that's
fine just for I bowling it right now and
we do currently have that copied so ctrl
shift end make sure this is a clipping
mask hit okay and then paste it in
control V and control I'm going to zoom
out real quick hit ctrl T and hold shift
and alt and scale this down and begin
working with this to try to get the
right size roughly it's not going to be
perfect but that's okay so we'll rotate
this around scale this in by holding
shift and alt and like I said it's not
going to be a hundred percent perfect
but that's okay all right and then
select move to hit apply once you have
it roughly the position of what you want
and then this background here this layer
1 i'm going to go to image adjustments
and desaturate so kind of makes
everything look better it was going
crazy with all these reflective colors
and stuff and yeah if you want to make
more adjustments that's fine all you
have to do is select that shape one
layer and take your direct selection
tool and for instance I kind of want to
make this a little bit wider yeah we
don't want to clip though
actually I do kind of want to go all the
way out here I'll make adjustments to
that image all right so because i scaled
that down a little bit this issue
happens so you can fix that one two ways
you could hit ctrl T and just scale this
up the inside or because this is all
pretty much the same stuff right here we
could take the clone stamp tool with a
feather brush hold alt select out here
oops this is kind of I would not do this
normally but just to try to head this
tutorial ah there we go yeah you can
tell alright so if I just zoom out there
is a view of the CD alright so pretty
quick and easy tutorial on basically
oops basically just creating a CD
presentation and a design as well so I
yeah it basically check out design
course calm if you haven't yet subscribe
here on YouTube and let me know what you
think basically I'm doing a tutorial
every day of the year here in 2014 I
think this is video number 52 anyhow
I've stuck with it so oh wait one other
thing I wanted to create kind of like a
gloss sorry I'm all over the place I
make this a clipping mask make it white
and you just come up around here with
the pen tool ctrl H and then take the
opacity down a ton that way it kind of
makes it look like it's on a glossy or
behind a glossy glossy appearance
alright so that's it all right I'm gear
Simon and I'll see you tomorrow with a
new tutorial alright bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
