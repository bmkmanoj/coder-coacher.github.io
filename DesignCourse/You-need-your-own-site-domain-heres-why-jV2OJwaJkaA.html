today I'm not going to be doing any
design work i'm just going to talk about
something that's really important it's
understated and it's something that a
lot of new or aspiring designers and
developers get wrong all right so the
idea that you don't need your own
website or maybe you can just host
whatever you are your door work on like
one of the gallery sites like behance or
dribble etc I that falls short because
really you need your own dot-com or dot
net or whatever other extension
preferably com I along with hosting an
actually functioning site and the reason
it's important to have that and I even
say need not necessarily need you can
get by without having one but you want
one you need one if you want to maximize
your ability to gain exposure on the web
so just a real quick story I back in I'd
say I think it was like two thousand six
or so I did have a website but I never
utilized it and so in by the way just to
side note this aside for me actually
having a calm or a dotnet or whatever
you have to use the site as well so I'm
not just saying go out and register a
domain name and some hosting and then
just forget about it because that
doesn't mean right so you actually
have to utilize the site and be active
on it so back in two thousand six I had
a site I didn't utilize it though very
much and one day I was bored and so I
decided to write a tutorial a
handwritten not a video one on how to
design a logo and the reason I did that
was just to us it was kind of a personal
challenge to see if I could rank on a
real popular site back then I called
digg com d I GG and they're not very
popular anymore for various reasons but
anyhow if you made it to the front page
and it was like a social upvote
site where the crowd got to determine
through voting up or down stories who
would reach the front page you've got to
the front page you got thousands upon
thousands of visitors so a few hours one
evening I decided to write a tutorial
based on that and a one second this is
going to die on me okay so I decided to
write a tutorial based on it was
actually a kind of a crappy tutorial I
nonetheless I submitted it and it hit
the front page and I got like 13
thousand visitors and that didn't mean
anything because I wasn't monetizing his
site I didn't sell any services I didn't
have a portfolio it was just like one
page and that's it so yeah I reached the
goal and forward about I six months
later for some reason I was just bored
and I wanted to check my web stats and
out of nowhere I see that was getting
like a thousand visitors a day and where
I thought I was just getting zero you
know who the hell is checking out aside
from like search ends and BOTS or
whatever and so I looked into it and I
see that my website of that page ranks
for keywords and Google's like how to
design a logo and so I decided from
there to monetize it and made video
tutorials that's kind of how I got into
this whole business of making video
tutorials I figured you know maybe
people want to see full video tutorials
that pay a small price and I also
advertised services for actually
designing logos and from there I made
pretty good money I'd say right off the
gate was making like 3,000 bucks a month
and that's all from just one evening
sitting there I wrote a tutorial I
submitted it to a site and I didn't have
the intentions of a bit like really
blowing up but it did and I was actually
that's what enabled me to not have to
work for anybody 3,000 was just the
starting point it got to out at a day it
was making near over ten thousand
dollars a month so this is why it's so
important to have your own it that's
only one of the reasons really I there's
so many other reasons is important to
have your own site is to be established
but a real big reason is so that you
could put out content out there
doesn't necessarily have to be a
tutorial it could be even your own
design work maybe you're doing something
really interesting I if you want to
write articles for design or what you
learned and submit it or even make
scripts or even offer freebies design
freebies like photoshop action files or
template files there's some million
different things you can do with the
website so if you're one of the guys who
are thinking in that on email website
you know and you're a freelancer or
whatever I don't care if you work for
somebody currently and you already have
a living you should still have a website
and you should still try to use it post
it regularly I because if you're working
for somebody like an employer yeah it's
great consistent steady income but man
nothing beats working for yourself so
having your own website and posting to
it regularly and trying to really just
curate it and develop it is a huge step
towards i would say financial freedom in
a sense so definitely go get a domain I
in also make sure you get the hosting
and it's cheap I if your if your
piss-poor do whatever it takes I mean
it's like what ten or eleven dollars for
a domain name and then for hosting I
mean if you go to one of the many
different hosts out there even like
godaddy is like one of the cheapest I
think I mean it's literally like four
dollars a month so I don't care who you
are I don't care if you're a 13 or your
12 year old kid you can afford it you
can do whatever it takes to make the
money and so after that then it becomes
just I developing the site maybe get a
copy of WordPress and get a good theme
up there and just start pumping out
content come up with an idea and a plan
for it and you can start making money
and start really i pushing your own
image and your brand out there all right
just a quick video with you so I check
out design course calm if you haven't
subscribed here on YouTube and very
shortly i'm going to be releasing the
design course calm premium subscription
service so check that out all right
goodbye
