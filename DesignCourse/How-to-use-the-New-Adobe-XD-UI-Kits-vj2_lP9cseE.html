life just got a lot easier with the new
Adobe XD UI kit alright so Slayer aside
Adobe just released an update for
experienced design or XD that includes
UI kit for Apple iOS Microsoft Windows
and also Google's material design so
what are these UI Eclipse and why should
you care well if you're an app developer
or designer or whatever and you have to
design a mock-up or a prototype of the
app in question you know then that there
are specific UI element and layouts that
accompany each platform that you're
developing for and it can be a pain to
have to scour the internet for these UI
kits or god forbid create them from
scratch yourself so no longer do you
have to do that and I'm going to show
you how to use these UI kits by creating
a very simple gallery prototype so
before we begin make sure you check out
corset or com we have a lot of different
courses both free and paid and also
subscribe here if you like the channel
alright let's get started okay so with a
new fresh document open up here in Adobe
XD let's go ahead to the hamburger menu
over here open UI kit and we'll choose
Google material ok as you can see based
on the current resolution everything is
really tiny but to zoom up all we have
to do is hold the ctrl key and just use
our mouse scroll wheel to zoom up and
out ok so in order to use these and make
sense of them we have to have some type
of purpose so let's say for example that
we have an app that has a gallery and we
want to show what happens when you click
on one of the thumbnails and create some
type of prototype interaction with it
and we know that this app is going to be
based on Android so to use this kit
instead of doing everything from scratch
what we can do is first let's come down
here and we can see we have this these
two rows these are just based on
different device types so we have a
desktop a tablet right here and then a
mobile so let's say for instance we want
to use the mobile dark what to do is
click on let me zoom up real quick the
artboard title and that selects the
artboard and everything within it
automatically so control seed copy and
we're going to create a new document get
a control end for that if you wish get
this up here and then ctrl V to paste
very very simple okay so we have these
guys here that kind of show up these
pink sort of guides I'm going to select
it and then choose this little lock here
to unlock it and then delete I don't
really care about those we don't need
them okay so the next step that we want
to do is see if there is some sort of
gallery components that are available
here in the uikit document so just look
around you can see right there we have
to some sort of gallery right here so if
we select that copy it and then go back
to our other document well paste it in
position it right there you'll see the
guides that show up to let you know that
you're perfectly in center and we pay
it's right there very very simple now
this would probably be used more for a
white background and so I don't like
this white background container there
kind of looks not good so to do this we
could right-click and ungroup everything
or we can just double click right on it
down here and you'll see it'll
automatically select that layer for us
because we could see we have a fill
color of white now I have to do is you
could change it to a different color if
you wanted to or just hit delete which
is what I'm going to do
so now with that selected we can see
this is a grid because we have these
little handles to the right and left so
let's pull down all the way and this
automatically repeats the content inside
of it which is very handy all right and
now let's go ahead and select the
artboard ctrl C and then ctrl V okay so
let's take this gallery with right-click
we're going to choose ungroup and then
also ungroup grid so now we can have
access to all these individual
thumbnails now I want to leave
everything with exception or I want to
get rid of everything rather with
exception to this bear right here so I'm
just going to take all these holding
shifts left clicking and deleting there
we go now we'll take this I'm going to
hold shift and scale this up we'll scale
this all the way up to the very edge as
well and use your keyboard arrow keys of
position as as needed and it looks very
pixelated
because it's just meant to be a small
thumbnail over here so I'm going to
change them and so changing the content
here especially when it comes to
photographs in XD is very easy so if you
follow the link that provided in the
written tutorial for this video you'll
see that we have this bear picture right
here I'm going to use this you don't
have to I you can just download this put
it on your desktop and after you do that
we'll go ahead and take it from your
desktop and drag it over on top also do
the same thing with this right here
very easy okay now this is taking up too
much space so I just want to drag this
up to about 50% right around there
alright so now let's add some type so
maybe a heading and a little paragraph
of content right here so let's go back
to our XD uikit
and we'll find a typography section this
is on the upper left
alright so notice it gives us some specs
here this is based on material design
specs for light and dark backgrounds and
we'll just notice down here you know for
secondary colors you leave it at white
except you change the opacity here to
70% we'll do that for the paragraph text
but just for now I'm just going to take
this whole group right here and copy it
we'll go back I'm going to paste it it's
a group so let's go ahead and right
click ungroup and I'm going to delete
all of these with exception two just two
of them will leave title but we'll get
rid of sub the subtitle right there I'm
going to take both of them holding shift
I put the title right around there let's
make them also white so the fill color
over here and this one is really just
for reference we're going to see the
size it's currently 14 alright so the
way this current type layer is set up if
we type in or paste in something from
say for example lips um comm let me go
ahead and get that out real quick this
just gives us that lorem ipsum generated
text right here I'm going to copy just
this those two sentences now if I just
paste that in it's going to go off
screen so let's create our own type
layer so we'll take the type tool just
around here left click and drag want to
make sure we have good even margin on
the right and left the bottom we don't
have to worry about we're going to be
moving it and adjusting it afterwards
and then simply paste it in you'll
notice it's also riverboat the Roboto
font and 14 size for the font size also
change the opacity to 70% alright that
looks good we'll delete this one now
we'll drag this up and also if we hold
shift while dragging we'll see that we
have these guys that kind of let us know
that we have
even distance between the top and bottom
of the title and that looks pretty good
so we can always drag this down and
everything is situated and laid out very
nice awesome okay so let's say for
example we're satisfied with this DC
design so what do we do now well we can
go to the prototype tool or tab rather
and right here I we can notice this
entire thing is a group but we don't
want that so let's right-click we'll
choose ungroup now you can see it's yet
another group so right click ungroup
again so now we have access to just the
individual thumbnails so let's go ahead
and take this we'll see this little blue
selector or dragger right here we can
drag that over until it connects and
highlights or outlines rather the other
one this artwork here in blue and you
can specify whatever you want for the
transition easing all that stuff
iteration I'm not going to worry about
that just go leave it at default
settings and then also let's say for
example we want to simulate going back
to the gallery view page so if I just
try to select this right here
individually it's not going to let me
although if I do double click it we
don't necessarily have to ungroup so
I'll go ahead and drag it right back
alright so now if we hit play
we'll see let me just get this to the
right so it's not kind of cluttered over
here we click on it and there we go we
have a very quick prototype based on
using GUI kids all right so that's how
you create very quick rapid prototypes
using the Adobe XD UI kits all right so
if you enjoyed that make sure you

out course cetera com where we have a
bunch of free courses and very cheap
courses that show you how to design and
develop apps for all different types of
platforms all right see you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
