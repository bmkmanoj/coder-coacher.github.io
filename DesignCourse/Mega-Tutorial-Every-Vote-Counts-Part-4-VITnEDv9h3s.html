today we're going to add the details to
the ballot box and we're also going to
set up the scene and work a little bit
more on other various aspects of the
poster design all right so check out
design course calm if you haven't yet in
subscribe here on YouTube alright let's
get started alright so this is where we
left off from yesterday's tutorial and
we focus solely on this ballot box and
UV unwrapping it and making the wood
here in Photoshop so now what I want to
do is add some decals to this thing to
make it look a little bit more realistic
alright so I'm going to switch back to
photoshop here and this is where we left
off with the ballot that's you V dot PNG
what we want to do is by the way save as
and I'm going to save this in the latest
project folder which I let me go to
recent 28 value V dot PSD always a good
idea to save the PSD so if you want to
make changes to in the future you can
bring back the UV layer just so we can
see what's going on here this is the
front so the front corresponds to this
portion right here so what I want to do
is put a decal on this and I'm going to
just make it every vote counts oh god
and so we're going to switch over here
back to photoshop and i'm going to zoom
up a bit just so we can see a little bit
better now i'm going to use the type
tool and just left click and just put in
every and i'm going to hit enter and
then just face a few times vote space a
few times more counts with an
exclamation point ctrl t hold shift and
scale that sucker up like that except
this looks like crap so we're going to
make some more adjustments alright so i
have to find the croc font so let me
pause real quick alright so the font is
called art brush and i believe it's free
so if you just go to google and type in
art brush want if you want to you
same font as me you don't have to I then
you can just go ahead and download that
real quick so I'm going to fix the
spacing a little bit and make it like
right around there and then i'm going to
select this option right here and this
is warped x so we can warp this and you
have all these different things you make
it a go wave which it looks like crap
although you can change the settings
like that but i'm going to use i think
when you use arc and then no I don't
like that one bit i think i'm going to
use arch this way and this can take a
little bit of finessing i'm going to
experiment with this and pause it just
so that i can get the right setting here
alright so i pause it came back this is
the setting on e to use its lie plus 35
negative 18 plus 18 right around there
hit OK and then hit ctrl T and we'll
kind of just skew it slightly like that
hit ok and if you want to adjust the
line height between click right here
every in vote is kind of close to each
other and then we have vote and counts a
little bit further away what you can do
is if we select a vote and we go to
window character or click right here if
it's available there and the line height
right here we can we can I experiment
with like that now it's a little bit
more even between the three words
alright so what I want to do now is
apply what is called a few strokes so
what we can do is I want to hide the UV
just for now and I'm going to change I
want to make this so that it is red
white and blue just for the u.s. theme I
guess you could say so red white and
blue wait red white and blue let me
check the preimage real quick the one
that it created
yeah I think that's right so we want the
text to be blue and so will come out
here just choose a blue color like that
double click on the right side of layer
to bring up the layer styles and then
we'll choose stroke and its positions
outside by default which is good and
will come up here around nine pixels
we're going to make this white hit okay
and then we're going to duplicate it
right click the duplicate the layer or I
have a I'm going to use my shortcut key
and the one beneath it double click on
stroke and we're going to make this one
even larger and I'm going to make this
red there you go all right so now if we
take both of these layers I let's go
ahead and group them ctrl G with both of
them selected and just going to rename
it real quick to every vote counts I we
can use a layer blend mode set on the
group so if you click this and then
click it again you can see it's blue and
it's highlighted sorry now you can use
your arrow keys hit the down arrow key
to go through these just so we can get I
a potential blend mode that looks
realistic with how paint would be
overlaid on top of wood so I think I did
see one and so that looks pretty good
that doesn't look to let me see let me
zoom up here it's not really bleeding
through it I kind of like the look of
this even though we don't get the white
it still looks realistic you can see the
wood beneath the blue and the red so I'm
going to diverge from the original image
just a little bit by making it look like
that alright so I've used i multiply for
that okay so let's get back are you vs
so this is what's going to be on the
front of it let's go ahead real quick
hide the UV layer and let's save this so
control look it's such a long shortcut
on your essay first a file save for web
is alt shift ctrl s and I know that by
heart so I just do it quickly just
overwrite the ballot diffuse let's go
back to blender and then just click on
let me zoom up so you can see it this
folder right here you'll see now it has
our very awesome every vote counts all
right I think it would also be worth it
to put a decal on the top which kind of
has like a pointy arrow to this like
insert your vote so let's go over to
photoshop again zoom out here get our UV
up and this is the front alright so i'm
going to get i'm going to use like one
of the custom shapes so if you just left
click and drag out over here custom
shape tool and we can choose one of
these arrows you can make your own error
if you want with the pen tool i'm just
going to use this to make it quick and
i'm going to use this middle one right
here and hold shift and just scale it
right around there i'm going to make it
black ctrl T shift and rotate it up
select move tool hit apply
you can also adjust this like if you
don't want the tail like this all we can
do is take the direct selection tool
left click select those bottom ones and
hit the up arrow key if you want it to
be a little bit shorter so now what
we'll do is if you want to make the
centered left click and drag between the
distance of these two UV points and hit
center right here so now we'll just put
in your vote we want to make it big
enough so people can see it so that's
one error I made on the initial project
just like that alright so now I you know
we can add you know if you want you can
add details on these other ones and I
kind of do I want to add one on the
right side which is right here and so is
there one available in a custom shape
now there's not so I didn't I record
this beforehand so I'm just going to
wing it right now so what I'm going to
do zoom up here and we're real quick I
think I'm going to yeah I'm going to
take this every vote counts text right
here and I'm just going to take the top
one duplicate that or you can
right-click and duplicate it move it
above and just going to drag it down
here temporarily and I'm going to put in
your choices now because we have a
single line of text we can go ahead and
modify the warp options for this so we
want this to be readable so ok the kids
are yelling stop that damn it all right
I i think i'm going to you know right
around there should be pretty good I
mean that's pretty readable so your
choices ctrl T and right around there
and then down here I may make that a
little bit smaller ctrl T shift and alt
will leave it right around there all
right and then I'm going to use a the
ellipse tool shift oh no no no left
click shift and we'll choose right
around there and it's the same colors
the background side so it's hard to see
what I want to do is over here or by
taking the direct selection tool we can
get rid of the fill by clicking on it
and choosing this red / and then get a
bit of stroke and we'll make this one
read and then increase the stroke size
right around there ctrl T we can scale
it up a little bit and I'll new shift
sup move till it apply and then we'll
put in will take this text duplicate it
or right-click and duplicate on the
layer all right idiot one all right now
this text is a little bit hard to read
so i think i'm going to get rid of that
I the warp on it scale it down and I i
may get rid of as well let me I take off
the effect here and make this red and I
may change the font as well just so it's
a little bit easier to see
yeah that's fine so I'm going to leave
this idiot one right there now I'm going
to take these layers and then duplicate
them so those two layers holding shift
select both left click right click and
duplicate them or if you've set up a
custom key like I have oh man I did the
wrong ones let me delete those it needs
to just be this layer yeah and that ok
so it's these two layers duplicate them
move them over we're going to change
this to oops let me delete that idiot
one needs to change to idiot to the
color needs to change to blue as well as
the stroke
okay and they're all right so let's see
here I think that's you know I may want
to make this black just so and also get
rid of the stroke there all right now
I'm going to get control t yeah that'll
be good move to apply bring this down
alright that's good ok so those are the
only decals i'm going to add you know
what it would probably be worth it just
to take all these layers right here that
the decals and put them over here as
well on the left side that way if we
want to render on the other side it
shows the same thing so what we'll do is
I think I think it's all these layers up
here I'm going to group those yep that's
them so i'll change it to your choices
real quick duplicate that move it over
here very simple alright so now let's go
ahead and hide our UV layer ctrl s to
save this by the way and take the UV
hide it save for web file save for web i
just did the shortcut overripe out to
fuse go back to blender and there we go
awesome alright so i'm going to right
click on this join area and get this
joint over here and we could do some
more work getting this to look a little
bit more realistic so what I want to do
now is I'm going to add a wall so to
kind of upright right up against it so
I'm going to go to solid view and i'm
going to select just right around there
shift a mesh and plain our x 90 to get
it up and down and s and I don't know 25
and so that looks like a decent distance
so let's go to rendered view see what
this looks like alright pretty good and
I i'm going to set up so I in a new
mission plane it's called so by default
we have this one light over here which
is right there I'm going to delete that
so now if we can hit rendered will see
it doesn't affect things too much what
really affects the lightness is over
here in the world setting so if we drag
this down and I believe it right around
here for now I go to solid you can see
our cameras like right around there if
we click no more like over here no no no
no if I hit three and click right there
one yeah that's right by the camera
which is fine shift a mesh plane and RX
45 and bring this over around there and
hit s2 just I scale it by two and then
we'll go ahead and go to materials hit
new the surface is emission right there
and real quick just so i can show you go
to rendered strength is one which is not
very much hit 10 we'll see now it gets a
little bit brighter
now I would say that's too bright so
what we can do is drag scale this down a
little bit try maybe five
and we can also experiment between this
value here and the world setting value
so if we drag this down and then we go
back over here and then hit 10 you can
see it gives us a little bit more
shadows
alright so i don't really like the way
this is looking this is looking like a
strange like aluminum type of material
so if we click on it we right click it
and let's drag this down we'll change
this view to the node editor this view
can change to rendered you can
experiment with these values a little
bit so bringing it more towards the side
of the diffuse will give you a certain
odd look let's drag this to the right
though and experiment with the roughness
value so if you try to change it to zero
you can see it completely makes it one
hundred percent reflective and glossy
and strange looking so if we try point
one that gives us a certain look and so
there's just a lot of different
possibilities that you can use based on
playing with these values I think I'm
going to leave mine right around there
though all right
alright so let me write click this to
join this area down and now I we still a
little bit of time it's been about 19
minutes so I'm gonna add a floor right
here so this will be very easy going to
use cg textures calm again so if we go
back here switch back to cg textures com
you know you try to find any type of
floor you want I use the tiles section
right over here last time I'm gonna see
what floors give us um might be okay to
add this might be interesting actually
you know what I want to use just died I
think I'm going to go back to tiles it's
going to make it a little bit easier so
if i choose plain tiles i think i used
this looks pretty decent i think i use
the other one though on what I initially
did it I so yeah I'm just going to
choose meat well yeah seven by seven
hundred by seven hundred that's a
perfect square oh it just makes it real
easy for us to work with i'm going to
use this so i'm going to download that
i'm going to open this up real quick
show in folder right click and open with
photoshop and if you want to make
changes to this in terms of color you
can go to image adjustments hue and
saturation or come out here if you go to
windows and then select i think this is
the adjustments area yeah adjustments
you can add all these color balance
hue/saturation if you want to give this
a certain Hugh if you want to make it
more white or no saturation or a lot of
saturation that's completely up to you
I'm just going to leave it basically how
it is just to make things simple and
then save this real quick and we're
going to call this floor dash diffuse
okay so let's go back to blunder alright
so the floor right here is this option
let me go to solid view and we can see
it's massive but we can tile the actual
floor diffuse jpg that we've saved so
first if you're adding any texture
remember you have to unwrap it now
because this is a square and it's very
simple all we have to do is go to tab
into edit mode with it selected make
sure everything is selected hit a and a
again just to make sure it's toggled on
you unwrap we don't have to bring out
the unwrapped window because we know
it's going to work I know if let's go
ahead real quick and add a okay so there
is already a mixed shader added to this
I'm going to just click on this and I'm
just going to call this floor and we're
going to make this just die you believe
it as a mixed shader so what we want to
do is drag us down change to UV image
editor and no sorry node editor and I
what we'll do is hit shift a text your
image texture connect this to the
diffuse color hit open and or my at
first I gotta save this correctly floor
two views right there alright so now if
we view this thing it's going to look
messed up let's duplicate this shift D
add it to this one as well so watch what
happens when we go to rendered
absolutely way way way way too massive
so that's because this is a large object
but we can basically multiply this so
what we can do is scale over here if we
click on this I option right here
okay so these are all changed to 50 by
50 by 50 for the x y&amp;amp;z n scale with this
image texture selected but it didn't
really seem like it made a change but it
actually did you'll see them in here but
we have two of these so we have to click
on this one and change this to 50 50 and
50 hit enter now we have a floor a
glossy sort of floor basically and you
can play around with these values to
turn this up it gets real glossy doesn't
kind of look too realistic so somewhere
in the middle probably will work
decently all right so let me write click
join area down alright and if you want
the wall to line up to the edge of one
of these which would probably be worth
it I let's go to real quick it's
currently selected but we're in edit
mode hit tab to go to object mode and
what we can do is go back to rendered
and we can see it's kind of like in the
middle of one of these or off to the
side right here hit G and why to move it
and move it just left a little bit so if
we get in real close gee why they're
right there is perfect now it lines up
with this wall it looks a little bit
more realistic basically all right and
you can also select the wall here that
doesn't even have a texture i believe so
you hit new and it's diffuse I we can
change it to some type of off-white
color if you want to or go crazy which
is this is a little strange but yeah you
can experiment I'm going to make mine
just more towards the yellow end but
nothing too crazy I think right there
all right so all right where are you at
26 minutes so we're going to end this
here and in the next lesson we're going
to go ahead or tomorrow we're going to
go ahead and add a flag and do some cool
cloth simulation all right so I'll see
you then all right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
