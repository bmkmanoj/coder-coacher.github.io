Simon I'll be time for calm and this is
59 challenge number 17 in this time
we're going to do another design a
custom letter challenge we did this one
other time before and it turned out well
it was fun so at this time we're going
to do a letter D in a calligraphy style
alright so the requirements are is it
needs to be upper case it must be d with
no other letters and it must be in some
sort of calligraphy style make the
document at least 500 x 500 pixels
ensure there's a good white space
between the document edge and the letter
so for example if you choose 500 x 500 i
make sure the d itself is somewhere at
maximum of this age say 250 x 250 you
can always go larger than this though
you can go a thousand by thousand if you
wish and the submission deadline is
saturday 12 p.m. eastern standard time
december 27th that's six days from now i
actually launched this yesterday I'm
just doing a video now and so here's
just some real quick I bouts of
inspiration here just for a calligraphy
style so if you know anything about
calligraphy there's a lot of different
types of calligraphy can have these
really elaborate designs or something
more simplistic like this what i would
do is just check out google just type in
calligraphy or go to google images or go
to da fonte calm or one of the many font
sites and just check out the calligraphy
section just for inspiration now of
course don't copy anything i just use it
for inspiration and then design
something custom because otherwise
you're just going to waste your time if
you copy something nobody wins anything
with this so yeah I already have one
submission here so they're blind
submissions I which have recently
converted to so nobody copies each other
and then I when it comes to the deadline
i'll go ahead and unlock all the entries
everybody could see what they did and
i'll do a quick video review alright so
check out design course calm if you
haven't yet and subscribe here on
youtube alright goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
