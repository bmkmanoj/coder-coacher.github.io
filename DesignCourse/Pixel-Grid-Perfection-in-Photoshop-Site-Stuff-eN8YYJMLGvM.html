today we're going to tackle two
different things so first the video
datura portion it's going to be a real
quick tip and that is stepping into
Adobe Photoshop and I'm gonna show you
how to take shape layers like whether it
be an icon of some sort or some type of
design now when you go to rescale them
sometimes they'll appear blurry the
actual lines and so the reason this is
is because it's not aligned perfectly to
what's called the pixel grid so the
quick the fix is very quick and easy and
so I'll show you that and then the
second part of the video I'm going to be
outlining the upcoming premium
subscription service that design course
comm and I'm just gonna talk about the
direction I'm taking it in it's kind of
changed from what I originally thought
it was gonna be over the cat past month
or two so yeah check out these not
course.com be having it and subscribe
here at YouTube alright get started
alright so I'm gonna go to file new here
in Photoshop I'm just gonna choose 500
by 500 pixels 72 pixels per inch and RGB
and it okay fill it in with white and
I'm gonna create just a really really
quick sort of icon I you don't have to
follow along but I yeah just just for
the purpose of this tutorial or this
video rather I'll create a quick icon
and then inside of it I will create
three shapes this would be like kind of
like a message icon I guess I'm not
gonna try to really really line them up
perfectly I'm just gonna put those in
off this damn stroke I have to get I
have to clear the Preferences or the
history alright so in and of itself when
we're dealing with the initial you know
when we initially created everything
looks fine there's no sort of blurred
edges or anything like that but the
problem occurs if you take all these I'm
gonna group them real quick and you go
to scale it down so I'm going to
leave this over here and duplicate it
hit ctrl T I'm gonna get down maybe
right around there and hit apply now it
kind of looks blurry now I'm not sure
what you can see based on the video I
but if we zoom in here you can see these
gray sort of lines and when you're at a
hundred percent it doesn't make them
look crisp alright so I'm going to also
if you don't see this this sort of like
these blocks it's called the pixel grid
you can always just go to view and show
pixel grid all right
also you want to make sure this is on by
default but just make sure edit
preferences it showed up off screen
there just wanted to show up general
snap vector tools and transforms to
pixel grid make sure that's checked on
all right so I'm gonna duplicate that
again move it over alright and if we get
this out and we select the first sort of
I guess you could call it a weight line
area hit ctrl T and just move it a
little bit by holding shift as you see
it went away so I cap lie do the same
thing ctrl T shift just drag up a tad
bit and now you don't see those gray
blur it out edges so if we hit ctrl one
to go to a hundred percent you can see
it just looks a lot more crisp alright
so yes that is it so just a very quick
tip is something to keep note of when
you're designing for interfaces for our
website or whatever and you're dealing
with smaller icon sizes it's something
that can help one thing that you know
you kind of do have to be wary of I you
kind of need them to be shape layers in
order for this to work correctly instead
of raster layers alright so yeah that is
it I real quickly just because this is a
short video I'm going to show you what I
have going so far
or the premium subscription service that
I've been working on at design course
talk alright and this is I you know
initially I thought to myself I was
going to have you know separate products
like one for visual identity design
which is like a logo design and also
much more like designing the whole brand
appearance or the visual identity of a
company and then another one maybe for
website design and then I just several
others I thought and then I would just
charge a flat fee for each of them I
changed my mind and I'm gonna charge
just a flat monthly fee and then you'll
be able to access all of them plus one
thing I realized if I visit the forms
right here I the forms are still
relatively new but we're still getting
some good activity the design challenges
are popular I'm noticing and one thing I
realize you know the members that you
guys seem to like when I review do a
video review and I could cheek people or
I critique your individual design and
just kind of I'm able to help people out
specifically individually so what I
decided is to do a flat monthly fee a
subscription fee and our service rather
an eye a side from these video courses
that'll be fifty percent of it the other
50% the second service is going to be a
sort of one-on-one training sort of
system and I have to build that still
and I basically this first course right
here visual identity design course I
made good progress with it this top
portion is finished they're short videos
although they're very they go into a lot
of detail a necessary detail actually
and then I have three follow along
projects you can see the ones without
times those are the ones I have yet to
record so I have most of them recorded
already and and so what I realize you
know when it comes to designing or
becoming a good designer you it videos
are great trust me I mean I've done so
many videos this year one for every day
of the year so far and we're already
April 19th videos are great and they're
gonna show you a lot you're gonna learn
a lot but as I noticed when it comes to
these design challenges you know
even though a lot of you who have
followed along through you know these
videos that I've put out like four flat
icon design and letter mark logo design
when it comes to creating your own
project from scratch after you watch the
videos if you're new it's difficult it's
difficult to reproduce that same level
of quality so a video alone is not going
to show you how to become a good
designer it's not going to transform you
into a good designer overnight so that's
why I've decided to make design course
calm in the the subscription service
based on not just video courses but
one-on-one training as well which is
something I've found that not many other
sites are doing I think Linda calm they
don't do that they focus strictly just
on showing you videos and then that's it
at least I think that's how it is that
they've been for a long time it's the
same thing with a few of the other big
ones so I'm excited about it I and
hopefully you guys will join I'm not
gonna make it very pricey I I'm thinking
at most maybe fifty dollars but don't
hold me to it monthly fee but I yeah for
fifty dollars you'll be able to access
all the courses I think I'm just gonna
launch with this one plus the one-on-one
training and the one-on-one training
it's gonna basically kind of be like the
design challenges where I'm gonna have
mock projects for you individually to do
and then we'll work back and forth to
get you to a level where you're
satisfied then we're both satisfied that
you're now a good designer in that
specific field alright so yeah sorry
kind of just ranting on here but I'm
excited about it been working on a lot
so yep I look forward to a new video
tomorrow and I will see you then alright
good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
