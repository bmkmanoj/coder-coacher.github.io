today in this video I'm going to talk
about what's called split testing so
split testing real quickly is simply a
technique or a process a method in which
you can determine in two different
changes in which change results in the
higher desired objective or effect
that's being completed by your visitors
so if you have an email submit form you
can split test the button copy that's on
the call-to-action button or you can
test the colors on the page you can test
placement into positions of certain
elements on the page and see how all of
these effect conversion rates and goals
alright so I'm gonna talk a little bit
about this and hopefully you learn a lot
because split testing is absolutely
essential if you're trying to maximize
the effectiveness of any type of goal
that you have on your site so basically
if you're not split testing then you
should be for sure all right so I'm
going to talk about that I check out
these on course comm if you haven't yet
subscribe here on YouTube alright let's
get started alright so basically I once
ate that you can check out this is an
interesting site which tests 1.com I
this has a test of the week on the home
page and it allows you to see version a
and version B based on a previous split
testing campaign I guess you could call
it so so as you version a are here but
first it says text links verse icons
okay so that's what's being tested so
which homepage increased category clicks
by 90% plus for the Belgian Yellow Pages
website so the category pages if I click
on each one of these this is version a
or right here even though they're in a
foreign language I don't understand this
is these are the different categories
and they're interested in getting people
to click on these are testing which will
do better so this is version a
these are just standard text links and
then here's version B with actual images
or icons for them and then add like more
categories down here so obviously they
get I mean they give you the option now
to choose which one you think one based
on the real-life test results so this
one's pretty obvious I these stand out
much more of course this is these are
going to increase increase are you
serious increase the click-through rate
so obviously it is version B that one so
I already did this I I'll just do it
again I it kind of elaborates more on
you know why they think of one and it
shows the bus the site visitors you know
I 3/4 got it right so it was pretty
obvious but some of these aren't so
obvious though when it comes to split
testing so if I go to this over here the
453 case studies see case studies by
listing date I on this one and I didn't
click the vote I didn't review the
result yet but here's what they're
testing see product video versus watch
product or watch demo so which button
copy or the call to action button which
copy on it 148 percent more registration
form signups so let me close these ones
out and I'll click on this one and then
this is version B I'll move it over here
so version a the only difference between
these two is see product video or watch
demo so it sounds like you know is this
really gonna make that much of a
difference just changing a few words on
a landing page well forty eight percent
more I mean that's huge so if you were
to you know by default like a new
designer what they'll do is they'll go
with their Inuit their intuition about
what they think personally will work
best so they may just put you know see
product video or they may just put watch
demo and that's it and they won't split
test it so a hundred percent of all the
traffic is going to be filtered through
either one of these
two pages I invited fault most people
don't split tests so if they chose the
losing version of these two then they're
missing out on a sizeable chunk of
registrations and thus in the end money
so there's a huge difference that goes
into play when it comes to split testing
and determining the right winner in what
people ultimately respond to best and
one thing that's kind of humbling I
guess you could say as a designer is you
don't always know what works
that's why split testing is so hugely
important to do so I began I didn't view
this result I don't know what's gonna
win between these two I'm not sure which
would score 48 percent more or not but
just going by my gut I I would say watch
demo just because it's more simple and
see product video seems they'll just a
little bit more redundant they say they
have see right here so I could be
completely wrong I so I'll go ahead this
is version a I'm gonna save a version B
one version a increase C I was
completely wrong oh man
see that's why I even an experienced
designer you could be completely wrong
and people here it's really interesting
it's a great site because people can
talk I so yeah version B 70% of people
chose the one that I chose so but
version a C private video increase the
form fields on the page following the
button by 48 percent and so with a 98.5
confidence level that's based on how
many people you know what what the
sample size was I so completely wrong I
was along with most other people so
that's why hey oh it's so obvious you
know that this is maybe just two words
it's more simple you don't have
redundancy with see right here I this
one will definitely work and I'm not
going to
that's why it's it's very important to
ignore that inter feeling that you're
gonna be right I let's try another one
just for the fun of it so check this one
out so this time they're testing display
banner advertising banners so which
display got 71 percent more clicks okay
this is a translation alright so let me
close these out first I'll click on the
B oh wait you can't
alright these are the sizes pretty small
sizes but in let's see uh-oh
damn it they make you sign up oh that
sucks well anyhow you get the I'll
adjust to this dammit and they're not
gonna let me try to I yeah and they make
you pay that's interesting well I guess
there's a lot of value in determining or
in seeing existing case studies but I
based on split tests but anyhow yeah I'm
not gonna join but um but yeah that's
pretty cool site I like that I think
there's a couple other though that
aren't I
that don't charge I should have
researched this but oh well I so how do
you split test we'll talk about that a
little bit there's multiple services
that you know most of them they they
offer like a trial but ultimately they
do cost money with exception to
something Google Analytics provides and
so they used to call it Google Website
optimizer but now they call it content
experiments so if you type in Google
content experiments it'll give you some
information here you basically have to
have a Google Analytics account which is
free of course and content experience is
I experiments are also free and it's a
part of Google Analytics so they give
you an example here so let's say you
have a website these two house cleaning
services basically any deep cleaning
detailed cleaning and you want to
maximize detail cleaning the option
to purchase this much more because it's
I much more profitable so most users on
land I land on your homepage so this is
the page that you want to test for
Experian you create several new versions
of the page so one with a big red
headline detailed and cleaning one with
I and what you expand on the benefits of
detail cleaning one where you put an
icon next to the link purchase detail
cleaning so once you've set up your
experiment in a random sample of users
to see the different pages including
your original homepage you can simply
wait to see which page gets the highest
percentage of users detailed I purchased
detailed cleaning and so debt that's
just one of millions of different
examples of how you can set up a split
testing campaign and the way you do it's
actually real simple you'll go through
their interface in Google Analytics to
set up an experiment after you know what
let me log into my account and go to
that page just so you guys could see
that all right so I've logged in here to
my analytics account and you find this
under can note behavior and experiments
and this is the page you have so I
haven't added any of course but you add
am I going to create experiment and you
have all these different options
objective for this experiment and so you
can set up goals and I've already had
goals set up in the past I haven't had
any recent ones but I you set up with
goals by going to conversion and you
click on goals and overview and these
are older goals from that when the site
was older I haven't set up any but I
once you have those set up you go back
to experiment and you could specify
which metric you want or but objective
you want to test so if you're let's say
okay let me show you real quick a let me
show you the home page here so this
right here is a goal this is
call-to-action button get ready for our
relaunch in 2014 and you want to test
how many people would click notify me
maybe we could experiment with a
different text or a different headline
so let's say for example we wanted to
try testing get ready for every launch
2014 versed maybe some coffee like like
guy some stupid like submit your email
for
updates or something like that well the
goal then would be tracking how many
people signed up here and when you set
up the goals that make it pretty easy to
specify what the goal page is and all
that so you name the experiment select
the metric they like one of those goals
that you set up I you can specify the
percentage of traffic that goes to the
experiment I in an email notification if
a report and changes next step let me
just create one real quick I'm gonna
leave as a titled hit next and then it
shows you the original page that you
want to test so what you would do is
create like an index a dot php' for
example for this one and then the
variation which would be whatever you're
changing about this page and usually it
should just be one thing that you change
in when it comes to a/b split testing so
it'll be the different title or the
different button text so that could be
index B dot PHP and you link to it and
then you would hit next step and then
I'm not gonna do that because I haven't
set these pages up but basically setting
up your experiment code that they give
you code snippets to put on to the
original page and a variation page I
believe and it's very simply just paste
this size it's a bit of JavaScript into
a portion of the page and then you run
the start the experiment and that's all
it takes and then after a while
depending on how much traffic you have
you'll start to see results with this so
Google Analytics they offer a free AV
split testing page are not page but
feature I there are also paid versions
out there so split testing service so
Optimizely comm they're a real popular
service and that's just like interesting
landing page to have so i this one i
think i've used them in the past you'll
see the pricing they have here 30-day
trial and then $17 i there's just
there's a bunch of them optimized
where there are a few other wine usually
you'll find these through I the ads that
they have I've never heard of this one
yeah I don't like their site Oh
seriously seriously these pages that
automatically start video and audio I
hate them a visual website optimizer is
a also a very popular one so yeah these
are all options to talk to to check out
I in the future and so yeah everyone
should be doing split testing I don't
care what type of page you have if it's
a blog or if it's a news site or you're
selling something very important so what
I'm gonna do for sure in the future is
do a live split testing case study and I
think I might do that based on what I've
been working on recently because design
course premium will be launched very
soon and I let me log out there I've
been fixed that page yet index new and
so this page over here this top portion
is going to be eventually changed to
this and I when you click this the video
will load and I may test different
things though based on how many people I
can get to click to watch the actual
video and all that and so what I'll do
is a case study video where I integrate
a split test and then I'll share the
results maybe in a few days based on
what you know works and what doesn't so
that way we get a good live example
instead of me just rambling on through
these different sites so yeah I
hopefully this video is a little bit
useful to you in terms of introducing
you to split testing and the importance
of it I and somebody asked in the
forum's here on design course I you know
they had a question about you know how
much content is too much and all that
and well really you don't know you
shouldn't trust your gut instinct that's
the thing
you you basically want to
test it so if you had I there's
something called a long page ad copy for
short page at copy when it comes to
landing pages and websites in general
and you know every page should have a
goal and so if say for example you have
you're selling an e-book or something I
and you want to see how many people join
based on the landing page they hit so
one thing a lot of people will test is
doing what's called long page ad copy
for a short page grab coffee it's a long
page ad copy is exactly what it sounds
like it's just a ton of a lot of text or
content that will support trying to get
people to join or you know you're
stating your case as to why they should
purchase your product or your ebook or
whatever and then a short page at coffee
would be very simple direct and straight
to the point and I and so that's one way
that you can determine you know through
results if I have too much content or if
I don't and so so the answer to that
question in general is I don't know
let's test it so that's the importance
of split testing and so hopefully you
guys will utilize that information in
the future alright so I'm curious how
you design course comm check out the
site of course and as always subscribe
here on YouTube alright goodbye
