today hi have a very quick video
tutorial that's going to show you how to
use a brand new 100% free plugin for
Photoshop called ditto
and basically allows you to use
variables in Photoshop alright so this
is the page for it's casual notebook
calm flash ditto and I'm not going to
bother explaining exactly how everything
works I'd rather just show you so what
you need to do is visit this URL and
click download and it will allow you to
specify the amount you want to pay it's
already showing me this page because I
have already done it before but
initially it will show you an area where
you have to enter a dollar amount and
you could just put 0 and then just hit
OK and then it'll give you this screen
right here in which you click download
all right so basically it'll download it
and once you open that up it's going to
show you this folder here and you want
to just drag this to your desktop or
extract it somewhere on your computer
now inside of this we have in installer
JSX that's what we need to open up with
Photoshop so we'll go to photoshop go to
file and scripts and browse it's at the
very bottom it's not showing up on my
screen and what we want to do now is
basically go to the area where we have
this installer JSX hit load and
basically what that will do is press ok
just start the installation hit ok
complete ok you have to restart
Photoshop I'll do that real quickly and
then to ensure that it works correctly
you just go to window 1 second window
extensions and ditto you click on that
and this is the ditto plug-in right here
so basically let's open up a Photoshop
document now I'm using one that I
created before for my own site a mock-up
of a website and I if you don't have
your own backup of a website you can
just create a new document and just
follow along with this basically so as
we could see here we see we have a lot
of different layers actually a ton of
different layers because this is a
rather
long document and there's a lot of text
layers and object layers etc now one
great usage for these ditto for the
Photoshop variables would come into play
when we have multiple elements of
something like we can see these
paragraphs and these headings so if we
wanted to experiment with the font size
we would have to change each one
individually or the font color we would
have to change when each individually
and that's where dito really comes into
play
and makes life a little bit easier so
the way this works is if we click over
here and we can see that we have three
different field types we have the type
variable name and the variable value now
for the field type you have fill which
means to change something to a color you
have text which can literally change the
text that you specify in value
visibility font size family color height
x and y positions so the first step is
to specify your type well basically
let's try to change the make it easy to
change the font size of these four
paragraphs so we'll specify font size
and the variable name will space para
size I guess right here and the value
we'll go ahead and specify 24 pixels
currently the size of these paragraphs
are 20 pixels all right so once you have
your variable created you have to find
you have to have a way to basically
connect this variable to the layer
themselves the way you do that is you
find the layer over here and we can see
it has a name and you can leave the name
and if you wish and just add a hashtag
para size at the very end or you could
just go like this
para size and that's all that the name
has to be also to note you can add
multiple variables that control multiple
things so if you also want to be able to
easily control the color you just create
a new variable by clicking this plus
sign and then you append at the variable
name at the end here okay so let's go
ahead I'm just going to copy that and
we'll select each one of these but by
the way I have the move tool with auto
select layer selected that's why I just
click on it and it automatically selects
the layer on the side and there we go I
have all four updated
and let's see if this works currently
there'd size 20 and we're gonna change
it to size 24 so make note just look
here and watch how they change when I
hit this refresh there there we go you
see a little bit of work so that's done
automatically over here in the layers
and automatically updates that for us so
I could change this again maybe if I
want to try 16 pixels we'll see what
that looks like
alright so let me get up to like around
a hundred percent see obviously that
doesn't that was too small so I think
we're just gonna go back to 20 all right
and so let's add one more you click the
plus sign will specify font color we'll
call this para color and let's go ahead
and append para color I'll just copy
that paste this and finally this one as
well and now we can enter a hex value
without the hash tag and so let's say
for example currently the color is right
here's like a mid gray what if we wanted
to go a little bit lighter I'll take 5 D
5 D 5 D and switch back here and specify
just right there without the hash tag
and hit refresh and now we could see
they it lightens all of them up and so
that's basically how the ditto variable
plug-in works and so if you need help
understanding what type of values to it
it'll accept you just go on the page and
variable types it tells you what is
acceptable so for visibility you can
specify on or off font size its pixel
value bought family PostScript name of a
typeface font color same as the fill
which is just a hex value without the
numbers or the the hash tag and then the
line height and X&amp;amp;Y positions very cool
stuff alright so hopefully you'll find
that usable are very useful for any
future projects they have and that's it
so I yeah I am taking a break by the way
for this week off of the design
challenge so expect a new design
challenge
coming up next Tuesday I've been
extremely busy sorry about that
all right so talk to you later goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
