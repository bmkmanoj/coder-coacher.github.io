cetera calm and it's a Friday night I'm
drinking a little bit and I decided it's
been a while since we did another design
challenge corker cetera calm and that's
what you do tonight we're releasing it
and I basically the task this time
around its design a business card for a
fictional freelance designer this person
could be yourself or just someone that
you make up so what I want to do I'm
going to switch over here to the monitor
and you can find this by going to course
tetra com clicking on course or
challenges rather and or just check out
the link here in the description of
YouTube and you take you directly to
this page right now I'm recording this
video so it's not showing up okay so
challenge description alright you're
tasked with designing business card for
a freelance designer now you can use
Photoshop Illustrator you can use
whatever you want as long as it works
although you are ultimately going to
need to use Photoshop because I do have
one caveat one requirement which won't
get to in a second so watch the video
above for instructions on how to go
about designing the business card in
terms of the document setup for
photoshop illustrator if you've never
designed a business card it will also
show you how to use to require business
card mockup to present the design so the
following information must be present on
the business card design when you're
designing it so when you're using your
type tool we make sure you have to
include these five pieces of information
so the John Doe the name of the person
you can give them whatever name you want
if you want the fact that they're a
freelance designer that usually a false
underneath the person's name like their
title or their job description then
somewhere for the contact information
which is these two bits of information
their phone number and a fake email that
you can make up and then also the fact
that they specialize in web UI in print
design as shown here okay so the other
requirements you must present your
design with this Photoshop mock-up
download here it's a PSD file its going
to download it's about 13 Meg's not very
big now instructions on how to use it or
show in the video which I'm about to
show you in a second and your submission
will be deleted if it does not use this
mock-up to present your submission okay
so very important get to
second of course in terms of design
aesthetics less is more simple as better
keep things simple as opposed to complex
try to avoid all the crazy Photoshop
filters you know in the drop shadow and
everything try to keep things as simple
as possible and also you can submit
multiple multiple entries but make sure
that they're different from each other
are there different concepts don't just
change a single color and keep
submitting the damn thing a lot of
people we're doing that in two previous
I end your contests so just avoid that
you can submit multiple entries but make
sure they're different in terms of
concepts then also have fun okay so down
here is just an inspiration of you know
what I deemed to be you know pretty good
these are well-designed business cards
but you really do have a lot of creative
freedom the idea behind a business card
especially for a designer is trying to
make a creative and unique in some type
of way so let's go ahead here and once
you download this mock-up template in
Photoshop it's going to open up this is
what the mock-up template is and if
you're paying attention to the channel I
a day or two ago I released a tutorial
that shows you how to create this
mock-up template and you can check that
out i will link it as well here in
description youtube but this is
basically what it is so if you decide to
design your the business card here in
photoshop then you want to go to file
new and you're going to change the from
pixels if it's step by their two inches
and you want to set the width to 3.5 and
the height to two inches now the
resolution you want to have something
pretty large i would say at least 600 in
terms of resolution the color mode
because we're not actually going to get
this printed you can use RGB that's
perfectly fine and then hit OK and then
this is where you're going to design the
actual business card in and of itself
all right now I do have a tutorial on my
youtube channel that I'll link as well
about how to design a business card
although it's for illustrator but you
can still check it out just to get ideas
and so once you have a design you're
going to save
this as a PSD and once you have that
saved then you can double click right
here where it says your artwork and
where it says delete me which is that
stuff right there and it also has a
background then you're going to go ahead
and let's say for example you have a
design here let me just real quickly put
in a rectangle oops switch over here so
let's say this is your design obviously
you would have type on top of it well
hit control a and then we'll go to edit
copy merged and by here well paste that
in we'll hit ctrl T to get it scaled up
correctly and you want to scale this
correctly you could hold shift and alt
as well when you are scaling this hit
apply and then hit ctrl s to save and
there you go that is how your design
will be presented in this real world
sort of format and then when you're
ready to save it and upload it as a
submission encore cetera com for this
design challenge you'll go to file and i
like to use i actually a shortcut it's
just ctrl shift alt + s and that means
save for web and then we'll change us
here to a jpeg and the width we want to
keep this down maybe to around a
thousand pixels and then we'll go ahead
for quality you know as long as it's
above eighty percent you'll be pretty
good and then we'll go ahead and hit
save and then you'll save that and this
is what you're going to upload it has to
be presented on this sort of mock-up
template right here okay now if you're
going to design an illustrator will go
to new and then we'll change the units
two inches and again just 3.5 for the
width the height will be two inches RGB
for color mode hit OK and there we go
you'll start designing everything here
and again I do have this free tutorial
that I'm going to link that you can
check
how to design a business card if you've
never done one before once you're done
you'll hit file save as you'll save it
as an AI file for adobe illustrator and
the way you open that up will go to file
open I have an AI right here file and
here is a business card that I created
honestly the resolution around 650 and
okay control a to select all ctrl-c to
copy we'll go back to our smart object
layer ctrl T to paste ctrl T and then
hold shift and alt will scale that down
a bit and get this situated right here
and then hit ctrl s to save and there we
go this is what you go to file save as
resize it to around a thousand pixels
and then upload it okay so hopefully you
I understood exactly what I'm saying I
so again you have to make sure that when
you design this you're presenting it on
that mock-up template and also i'm going
to switch back real quick just do the
monitor oops where am I at I'm going to
go to actually let me switch back to
myself why I'm looking where I'm trying
to find there we go okay so right here
what we want to do is I I wanted to
mention real quickly the prices so the
free access to the new digital asset
designer creating and selling mock-ups
course it just released like a five days
ago or so and you will also receive the
Android app design and development
course so that's to the winner who I
will choose based on these five criteria
in terms of effective design and then
also if you do submit an entry and you
give an honest try I'm going to give you
a discount like a significant discount I
for the mock-ups course that I just
released about five days ago currently
there's a discount I'm offering it for
fifteen dollars I will offer it perhaps
maybe for just nine dollars or seven
dollars or something like that I haven't
really figured it out yet but if you do
submit a design I will provide that for
you alright so hopefully I you
no if you never design a business card
just look at it as an interesting
challenge and to improve your skills and
i'll give you feedback on it alright so
i'm looking forward to the entries I'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
