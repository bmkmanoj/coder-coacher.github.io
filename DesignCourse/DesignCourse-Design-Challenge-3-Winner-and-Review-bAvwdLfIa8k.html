today I'm going to go ahead and review
the design challenge number four which
was be to design a mobile app splash or
launcher page alright so basically it's
going to go over review each submission
real quickly and then choose a winner
and don't worry if you didn't win nobody
wins anything these are just for fun and
also just if you haven't yet subscribe
here on youtube check out design course
calm all rights get started alright so
let's go ahead and get started here's
the thread that was created and I real
quickly I lovely should be easily
identifiable and should be the primary
element that sticks out I so you're free
to use stock footage from sites like
these cg textures deviantart and I do
not include any type and aside for
featuring the logo the design should be
graphical and fit the feel of a gaming
thing alright so with that here's some I
just references I made alright so he
asks his the possible modify a logo a
little bit that's kind of important for
his submission alright so the first post
right here I in terms of simplicity and
in terms of making it the primary
element that sticks out that's good so
in terms of color there's clear contrast
that's good as well I in terms of I
guess you could call it maybe
originality I mean I probably just took
some I like a screenshot or something of
Tetris and just put it down there so i
would say in those others those initial
areas i mentioned that's great it's
always you know that's a thing a lot of
new designers will get wrong is I the
whole contrast issue or clutter issue or
it's not simple it's hard to distinguish
so I would say this is good overall
there's just in terms of like a WOW
factor I guess that's one thing it might
be lacking although it is a good you
know it's a splash it's the launcher
screen so usually
does just feature a logo so you can't be
too hard on this one so this is good all
right so we have quelle chris is that
Christ right crist right and this one's
not bad it's a little bit more graphical
and I we have a probably something used
from TCG textures it looks like in the
background and then an army soldier guy
back here it's not bad I when it comes
down here to the the actual logo there
is a gradient on it which that's not bad
i would say kind of clashes right here
with this orange and the blue here I and
I mean it is it is the primary element
that sticks out especially with the
flames that are coming around it but I
yeah overall not bad so also imposed it
correctly in these previews so that's
good and over here something that's kind
of the same thing I would say the logo
might be a little bit too small I but
that's okay not not too much of a big
deal there alright so a LG or is it a IG
write a LG right ah portfolio I I like
this one a lot and immediately jumped
out at me I he asked he was a person
asked if he can modify a logo a little
bit and I really like just how this
looks it makes it really feel
interesting as well as the the
difference clouds it looks like this is
what this is I and it kind of just
frames it up here it's darker down here
so I like it I move over here to X
matrix xxx some type of porn nate I'm
just kidding I so over here no stock
image is used so create some sort of
fact this is kind of cool reminds you of
kind of Tetris I but yeah I like it i
I'm not a big fan so much of drop
shadows but I mean I kind of understand
why I did it because I this is kind of
like a lighter background a little bit
more on the lighter side so if you took
it off you might it might be hard to see
it I so yeah overall not bad and then we
have over here from quelle Chris to
another third and final entry are the
other ones
yeah over here these two and so this one
I would say I like the other ones better
just because this one seems like it
makes it feel it's a little bit too much
going on and this clashes I would say
the this burnt orange color and the blue
to in my opinion and it's plus the then
the suits of the guys it kind of just
clashes everything in here so in terms
of simplicity I would say try to work i
would say for this specific instance i
think the other ones were better of his
alright so i'm not gonna try to
pronounce the name I so this one
originality that's a great idea I would
say in terms of a lot happening here in
in terms of making us I mean this is it
is kind of the focal point but we also
equally have this snake down here which
you know it looks like there's some
photo Malaysian that's happening which
is always good so uniqueness and
regionality I like it I in terms of the
snake in the throat though and kind of
blending back here and I'd say it kind
of looks like that part was drawn on or
manipulated some sort so that's probably
one of my own only discrepancies with it
otherwise not bad and then X matrix over
here I this is similar to the other one
just a different color suit or color
theme and another one this is pretty
simple but again like I said a launcher
wraps it usually simple although this
kind of becomes more the central helmet
rather than the the logo and this is
sort of the same idea with the skull and
I this kind of isn't I mean I know it
sticks out more because it's more
contrast but I this kind of overtakes
that this from being a the focal point
so you kind of have like a competing for
I real estate I guess you could say
between these two and any other one as
well um and then another one I would say
in terms of making it the prominent
image for sure that's I this is good and
then we add some controversial scoot
past it divine designs this one's kind
of hard to see well because kind of me
the image small but I also because I
stroke add it to this and then there's
also a outer glow added to it and then
on top of the cars behind it you kind of
just have like a clashing I guess you
could say so otherwise not bad and then
another one from LG portfolio I
personally like the other one better
although this is kind of cool this is
unique putting the bomb inside of this
portion so that's definitely cool I
would say though the other one in terms
of duplicity I just like it so much
Reuters it makes it feel just I don't
know more gay Murray to me even though
this really does look like game too it's
just in a different sense i guess you
could say um and then down here I this
is simple everything's flat like it this
definitely sticks out pretty well I I
say I like this one better on this one
the clouds and everything everything is
white here kind of takes away this one
sticks out more in my opinion would be
more effective we got watermelons kind
of all right so tons er we have I I
would assume this was an intentional
thing just to make it feel like it was
one of those old bit style games when
you didn't have much resolution although
it's kind of hard to see with the white
brick type things behind it and then
again there's a lot happening here I
would like to see this may be framed a
little bit better sometimes when you
have something overlaid on top of like a
photo like this if some sort is to take
like AI just a rectangle a dark
rectangle maybe make it black and then
take the opacity down a little bit and
then put this inside our on top of it
and that way you could see the game at
portion a little bit more because
there's a lot happening here and then
right here be colder I a little bit
smaller than i would have liked it
because i want to see all this detail
i'm not sure if this is something he
created all these details in here inside
I don't know but again it kind of like
this one over here we have so much
happening here that it makes a little
bit hard to focus your eye on one
central element like the logo which is
what we wanted I if you design this by
yourself this is really good though
like the background limits all right and
then we had one more person submit on a
separate thread right here in a term
simplicity we got the long shadow flat
design here not bad I I would say though
I kind of makes everything kind of blend
together when you add the palm tree to
the top and stuff in terms like I said
color is good contrast good simplicities
good i'll just say terms of execution I
everything kind of just runs together I
guess you could say so yeah otherwise
good good job and so the person now I'm
going to choose to win this and remember
I hate you picking letters but I I said
I would do it so I have to pick a winner
I and also nobody wins anything as well
so don't get pissed off and be desperate
I'm going to choose a LG portfolios this
one right here I really just like it I
very simple but it still has texture has
a lot of contrast and just fills gamers
to me I like it so good job and thanks
everyone for submitting your entries and
so look forward to the design challenge
number four all right I will see you
tomorrow with a new video all right
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
