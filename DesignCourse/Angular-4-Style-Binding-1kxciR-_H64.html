how we can change CSS classes through
class binding but what if we wanted to
change style binding and really they're
very similar except we're simply
changing the style attribute of a given
HTML element as opposed to classes ok so
let's go ahead and we're going to change
real quickly our h1 here and the way you
initiate style binding is to wrap style
here and then a name of a given CSS
property so let's say color equals and
we'll say title style down here in our
component class down here we'll create
title style and we'll make it a property
of CSS that you could bind the color
property to so we'll say color is red so
let's save it we'll come back here and
we'll see that it is now red very simple
now you can also control the value of
the specified CSS property within the
template expression itself and you can
make it conditional so for instance
let's just make this true down here just
to say that this property exists and up
here we'll change this here to add a
question mark so it's saying if title
style is defined or true then we'll make
the value of whatever specified here
which in this case it's color will make
it green otherwise and we use a colon
for that pink so let's save we'll see
that in this case it's going to show up
as green
if we were to set this as false we'll
see it will show up as pink now as with
class binding and the ability to control
multiple CSS classes we could do the
same thing with style binding through
the ng style directive so let's go ahead
and change that so up here we'll change
style here to ng style and remember
before if you want to do that with
classes its ng class very simple and
we'll go ahead and change this part and
remove that conditional so Styles is
just going to be a plural title styles
down here we'll make this a object and
now instead of given a CSS class as in
the case of an object for changing
multiple CSS classes through ng class we
change this here to CSS properties so
we'll say color and then their values
right here I'll say red or font size as
well we can make it four am so let's
just save this you'll see now it shows
up large so this gives us the ability to
control multiple CSS Styles through a
single object right here alright so as
you can see angular provides you with a
lot of different ways to control your
CSS through class binding and style
binding so in the next video we're going
to take a look at services in angular 4
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
