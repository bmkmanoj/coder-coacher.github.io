today we're going to put an end to this
make a tutorial on making a web app and
specifically because it's been about two
weeks now and I just didn't want it to
go over two weeks but we are gonna
finish the main aspect of it with just a
matching system and also making it
actually search based on location for
that form at the top alright so
basically if you need access to the
project files they will be there this
time since this is the final tutorial so
they're available of course for free
design course comm and if you haven't
yet subscribed here on YouTube alright
it's good alright so I just ran through
this tutorial and it was like 16 minutes
long and I realized that my microphone
wasn't recording so I have to do it
again this sucks so bad so I'm gonna be
moving faster this time just because I
want to get this whole series finished
and I'm gonna be I just want to be done
with it anyhow so I because I didn't
really anticipate this taking two weeks
and so I just want to switch gears so
anyhow to start again let's see we're
back here in main dot PHP we need to get
that search form working basically so
let me get out my window here and I'm
just gonna um yeah this is sucks I let
me go ahead and I have to upload some
files here actually let me cancel I'm
off screen right now I just want to
delete all the files that I updated just
now on alright so basically this is
where we left off just this portion
works and this up here the search form
doesn't work this doesn't recognize that
so let's go ahead real quickly into that
section and get that working so
basically what we need to do is check to
see if that form has been submitted so
we'll come down here and we'll put in if
if is not set post state then we'll make
a query or a variable rather additional
query equals and state equals let's see
once state and city equals once not - at
once city yeah and that's it and then
we'll put else if post ignore location
which is that checkbox doesn't equal 1
then the additional query this time will
equal instead of getting it from the
once will get it from the post which I
forgot to bracket over there all right
okay so now I will just come over here
and get rid of this portion at the end
those two hands and just put in
additional query and save it
alright so now if I go to if I upload
this off-screen and come back here
alright so if you refresh you see no
errors that's always that's always a
good thing now if we type in for example
or just put choose ignore location hit
update results you'll see that we get
this over here and this is messed up
coding this should actually be two or
three two separate I columns and so the
reason being what we'll do is just fix
that real quick we have to take off this
bracket that's not technically a
brackets but basically just put it put a
new one down here
so you save that and then you combat are
you fixed rather I'm going like I'm
wrong damn windows again up here alright
so if we refresh this we'll see now that
we have Dallas Texas and whatever that
birth Tata
I haven't whatever alright so basically
I yeah we have three different matches
and right now it's not it's basically
ignoring the location so if we look over
here I you'll see it looks kind of
crappy because we have like two commas
right here and that's because I did not
scrape the commas or remove the comments
from the yeah the second step so what
you would want to do ideally or maybe
even the first step for index dot PHP
for the sessions where you set that you
could do an STR replace and it would
look like this replace a comma with
nothing and then close that up and
that's how you would get rid of commas
and you can also get rid of a bunch of
other stuff too if you wanted to but I'm
not going to mess with that just because
this isn't a serious project alright so
I yeah basically now let's also go back
and test and make sure I make up a city
and see yeah it shouldn't show any
results basically so also let's see here
so what we could also do is like if no
results showed up you could always just
go over to let me come over here go back
to our main dot PHP you know so
basically if results were found all you
would have to do is put in a variable
right I think right here would work
found results equals one and then down
here if
is that found results echo sorry
no results were found alright and then I
what you could do
yeah let's just test that to make sure
it works and we can go back here to
refresh oh come on please seriously all
right I let me go ahead back and yeah I
pause that I realize I should have put
if not set so yeah upload that make sure
this works otherwise I'm gonna look
really stupid so now I there we go now
that works all right so I also you'd
want to change this text up here because
it's not really reflecting what's
happening you could probably change this
text to people who have what you need
and then down here would be people who
need what you have basically so let me
go over here I'm not going to worry
about that change in that text though
but what we can do now now that that
area is basically completed for the most
part is take this all this stuff and
then copy it get rid of all this these
three blocks of HTML and it should look
like that and then just paste all that
in and then what you need to do is just
change up the array right here we had
two of them once ARR and then offers arr
I'm gonna leave it as once though just
to make it easier on us so that we don't
have to mess around with changing so
many different things so basically the
everything right here can stay the same
let's see all right so this has to
change
this has to change from offers to once
all right
and what else from once and where want
equals once offer
all right
and then I all this stays the same as
well one that changes to found results -
just because I don't want the other one
it's just like a quick way of dealing
with that and yeah I think that might
actually work so let me go back here and
ignore location and now it's showing
different results based on the offers
and whatever that I've specified for
this account so yeah I now basically
this is where I'm just gonna end it when
it comes to the contact this person you
could do you can approach at multiple
boys you can pull the person's email and
just make it like an age where flank and
it'll just go to open up their their
email client which that's not a good way
because then people would be spamming
people left and right when people's
emails are exposed ideally what you
would do is use maybe something like
jQuery to check on clique if one of
these are pressed it'll bring up maybe
like an overlay div window where it
blurs out the rest of the background and
you do Google search on how to do that
with CSS basically and then inside there
you would had just a very simple message
form we have a message area and a button
click send and then it would send it an
email to the appropriate email based on
you know each one of these rows the Edit
my barter thing that's just I ideally
that would pop up in a new window though
you can do it in an entirely new
document and mod rewrite it maybe to
like edit Bart or up here and then once
again I mean if you've followed along
enough of this I mean you should have a
good understanding or at least a good
starting point to be able to figure out
how to edit information in the actual
database so that's very basic stuff then
my account same thing changing passwords
and changing the email accounts and all
that stuff that's very basic and again
if you're kind of you get stuck anywhere
just
you know become a self teacher I did you
just use Google type in your issue
specifically and you'll probably get a
ton of results from sites like Stack
Overflow where people have asked your
question on writing and if you can't
find an answer to a question just go to
stack overflow and post it a logout I
mean that's very simple all that is just
one line of code to kill a session
basically so yeah obviously there's a
lot more that needs to be done but the
purpose of this course I think I've
fulfilled it over two weeks I really
didn't want to run over two weeks and
we're at that point but the purpose
primarily being just to show the full
process of making an app's you know from
coming up with the idea coming up with a
domain name the the logo design the
mock-ups and Photoshop the HTML and CSS
and then finally the coding portion so
hopefully even though we didn't get to a
finished full product I hopefully you
gained something out of it and you took
away you know something positive so yeah
I'm eager to start getting into other
stuff now I've been tampering with unity
which is a game engine I and it they
have a free version as well and so I've
been taking my newly acquired blender
skills and I've been playing around
between those programs making 3d
environments that you can actually walk
around and so I'll be I think I'll
definitely be doing some of those I'm
not sure when I but yeah tomorrow I'm a
new tutorial I'm not even sure on what
yet but uh yeah I'll see you then so
I'll be putting up the files here for
this final project not every single day
I've been adding the actual project
files but today I will just because it's
the end for the for the this series so
alright check out design course comm and
subscribe here on YouTube alright bye
