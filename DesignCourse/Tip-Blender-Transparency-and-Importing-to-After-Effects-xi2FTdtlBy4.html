today i'm going to share a quick tip
that i've used recently quite a bit in
the creation of the design course comm
premium subscription service promo video
so let me just show you what the video
looks like real quick it's not what
we're going to be covering exactly like
the whole project that i created in this
video but i'm going to show you just the
process and the technique that i used
between blender and After Effects so
here's the video for the promo
all right so you can see that there are
several instances where I overlay text
and I also manipulate it in
after-effects so I'm going to show you
how I did that
within blender and after-effects in this
real quick video tutorial all right so
check out design course comm if you
haven't yet check out the forums
introduce yourself and also subscribe
here on YouTube alright so get started
alright so basically what I want to do
is just I I'm gonna use this for the
purpose of I creating some text and then
taking that into After Effects though
you could do anything in terms of any
type of 3d mesh you can use this cube or
anything that you want I so my object
like I mentioned I'm gonna focus on text
so I'm gonna delete this cube and it
shift a we're gonna add text so if we
zoom in here hit our for rotate X and 90
I'll get that sitting upright and I'll
go ahead and hit tab to edit this text
and just edit in whatever man and that's
the first thing that literally comes to
mind alright so tap back out I'm in
object mode I'm gonna go ahead real
quickly and just give some 3d width I
guess you could say an extrude this out
so I'm gonna pull this out come here and
click on the type tab and come down here
to extrude just turn this up right by
left-clicking and dragging right you
know that'll work pretty well right
there and if you wanted to you can give
it like depth and you can offset it and
you know do all sorts of interesting
things I'll leave mine like that alright
and just so that we have just a tad bit
of animation to work with down here is
the keyframe or the the animation
timeline basically these are I basically
frames down here at 0 20 40 60 but if
you want to change that to something
more familiar like seconds you can go
ahead and left click on View and then
change to show seconds so we got 1 2 3 4
etc so I the way you set a keyframe and
what a keyframe basically is is let's
say for example our starting point will
be right here all right so all right I'm
very frame 1 what we'll do is hit i as
in igloo on your keyboard I'm not really
sure how else you would screw that up so
I I and I oh yeah first very important
before we do this what we're gonna try
to do is keyframe the camera so if we
hit 0 on the number pad we get the
camera view we hit n as a nose on the
keyboard
we'll get this up over here lock camera
to view hit n as a nose again to get
that out of there so right now if we
pull this down and we click on camera I
will see it highlights it in orange so
now we move around let's say for example
we want our animation to begin let's say
right here what we do is hit I the
letter I and then down here we specify
visual location rotation scale that's
what I like to use it kind of covers
everything all right so now it just
placed this little keyframe right there
so if we want it to move say from this
point say maybe past the text we can
move I let's say maybe 2 seconds and
I'll zoom past it and also if this issue
happens with you like you get to a
certain point and you can't just go past
the damn thing you can hit shift control
at least on PC at the command a Mac
shift control and your middle mouse
button and what you can do is zoom past
it like that so makes it very easy just
go past the letters or wherever else you
want to go so let's say we're past it
and that's where we want it to be we'll
hit I and then hit visual location
rotation again and now if we go back to
the beginning and we hit play right here
there we go
all right so down here we have the start
and end so the start is the start frame
that's like we're wherever you want it
to begin obviously
logically it would be the at the
beginning here and then the end by
default set at 250 if you go back here I
and change this to deselect seconds
we'll see that we're right here is frame
49 so if we change that to 49 we'll have
the end of the animation and that is
what will render otherwise if you let on
to 50 it would try to render all 250
frames all right so right now if this
were to render this is what it would
look like
we'd go to render here and it looks
pretty ugly I and we'll see it kind of
just goes past it real quick I'll change
the render settings I'm going to change
mine first just go to two cycles render
change device to GPU if you don't have
that option all you have to do is just
go to file and go to user preferences
system up here and if you have a
graphics card you can choose CUDA I have
two of them so you'll have that option
it's a lot faster when it comes to
rendering all right so basically now
what we want to happen is to make this
so that it is transparent and so down
here under film you click on transparent
so now when we go to render this it
makes your RGB a is selected here when
we go to render this I buy the wave the
resolution I changed 1280 by 720 and
right now this 50% value basically means
the percentage of this so it would only
be half that this value take that up to
100 all right I so now when we go to
render this animation it will make these
each frame is going to be its own PNG
file and it's going to be transparent
all right the background at least so
they'll be only see this and so this is
really handy of course once we go into I
After Effects so what I want to do I'm
gonna make something looks like a little
bit better so I'm gonna give different
material on this so I'm going to right
click it just so we have text selected
and I'm going to come over here to
materials hit new and maybe I'll try
glossy and I'm gonna change our world
color to be brighter in the real tab
maybe I'll try Chrome so antsy Oh Tropic
or whatever it's called and you can play
around with the settings however you
wish you can add in lights and all that
good stuff I'm gonna leave this here
just for now just for a quick example
and now we are ready to render this so
go back here to this setting I'm gonna
change samples I'm just gonna change it
it's like 50 for the render it's still
kind of low but this will make it go
faster and then down here for
performance if you're using a GPU
processing you can change 64 by 64 to
256 by 256 and well I come up here also
it's gonna put this in a temp directory
by default so you want to click on this
and set a directory you know where you
want these individual pngs to go there's
going to be you know 49 individual of
these these files so I've gone ahead and
paused and I've saved it in just some
random folder called blah test and we're
ready to go so I'm gonna come here and
click on not render scene it should
change this button it should just be
still image because we know our
underwritten renders the render settings
already this should be changed to like
picture or still and then animation it's
just a little bit redundant there but
whatever we click animation if obviously
we want the animation so now it's gonna
go through this and it's gonna take a
little bit of time it's going pretty
decently fast though but I'll just pause
so you have to see here through this
alright so now that is finished I hit
escape this last one is basically by
there's nothing in its because we went
past the text so hit escape and now that
we're done with that what we want to do
is go into Adobe After Effects so I have
that loaded here I go to file new if you
can't see it you can't see on my mind
because it's off screen but file new and
you'll get this composition settings box
right here and I'm gonna feather ass do
you just cry as I can't talk specify the
width of 1280 by 720 I'm sorry I'm going
fast because my kids like crying
downstairs and I'm trying to like block
her voice out if I talk enough
I lose the duration I mean I just have
it like one minute doesn't matter
whatever background color black that's
fine i framerate whatever yeah we're
good to go
so hit OK
and I'm gonna resize this so it fits
inside of the viewport for you for the
video and then I project all I have to
do is go to file or just go over here
right click import and then file and
this is something I was working on
through a design course promo already
and this is the actual directory that
has all the individual PNG files as you
can see you know the backgrounds of
white because it's transparent so now if
we just hit I select the first one make
sure PNG sequence is checked on by
default and hit import now we bring this
in are dragging in rather and you can
use your mouse cool rule to zoom out if
you can't fit every or see everything
and get that I've situated it in there
as best you can and there you go so if
we want to preview that just hit 0 on
the number pad and that's it so the
speed at which this moves through you
control over in blender by just taking
these keyframes and moving them closer
to each other the closer they are the
faster they're gonna go so you were
wondering okay well how do you do that
just a quick tip if you never really
mess around with the animation
left-click and drag this window over
here by pulling this section I will
change this viewport here to what's
called the dope sheet alright so now we
can see these two sets of keyframes that
we have here so this one right here
corresponds to this portion and then
this one over here is that so the way
you move these around hit a on your
keyboard to toggle between selecting all
and deselecting and then so hit B as in
boy and just drag one all around all
those hit G and then now you can move
those and move them around so they're a
little bit closer now the animation will
play a much faster I
so yeah just a quick tip there and also
you know if you want to change the
background you can do all that cool sort
of stuff right click no composition
layer rather and what am i doing click
on comp layer new and solid and you can
make it white if you want
drag it beneath there so we could see it
and of course you know if you've never
used After Effects there's so many
different possibilities about what you
can do with it I you could apply
different effects to these so let's say
for example you want to apply some sort
of cool effect on the text so you have
effects and presets over here I just you
could change the color through color
correction um let me see here
you have brightness and contrast you
have animation presets so if you want to
apply like a TV warped effect you type a
TV right there and you have different
options so just drag that on there and
then we'll let it preload a little bit
although that looks like insane right
there the effect is a little bit much
but I just real cool stuff so yeah the
general idea of course is to take you
know your 3d that you're able to do in
blender give it an alpha background in
that way you can really take whatever
models that you want and if you have
experienced After Effects you can do a
lot of cool stuff I recently used that
same sort of effect on the design course
comm premium promo video and I think I
already showed that I'm going to show it
in the video and you how so I won't show
that again but I yeah so that is it just
a quick tip and yeah check out design
course comm if you haven't yet and
