welcome to this course we're going to do
a quick introduction and kind of a
preview in terms of what we're doing and
also what the purpose of this course
really is so there's a lot of different
options when it comes to JavaScript for
developing and designing your web apps
these days so the top three seem to be
angular react in view jas so typically
when you're new or you're not familiar
with any of these three you may go to
google and type in react versus angular
versus you know view just to see what
other people's takes on and their
opinions are now that so that's fine but
sometimes you know we're different and
you can always trust other people's
subjective opinions so the goal of this
course is to create a single project and
we're going to recreate it in each of
these three different technologies so we
have react angular in view and the
purpose is to get your feet wet enough
so that you can walk away from this
course and say hey I like angular better
than these other two or I like view a
lot better for my purposes all right so
our initial videos are going to cover
the mock-up of this app actually note
this app right here and it's a very
simple generic landing page but it's
well designed we're going to be using
the Balma CSS framework and it's
relatively new and becoming quite
popular of course you can always use
bootstrap or foundation if you wish and
we're going to be stepping into Adobe XD
to create a prototype now if you're not
really interested in that part you can
just skip ahead in this course once it's
completely finished and just dive into
either angular react or view when we
create this project all right so let's
get started
alright guys so basically in this
chapter we're going to be focusing on
designing a project mock-up for a
fictional company with a very generic
but very well designed landing page and
so right here we have a web design grid
document that I want you to open up from
the project files just go ahead and
download that wherever you're viewing
this at I'll make it easy for you to
find this
project files and if you're unfamiliar
with what a grid system is well
basically we have 12 different columns
here and the purpose that will say just
at this point in the course is that this
is going to help us structure our layout
into different columns so depending on
what modern CSS framework you're going
to be working with whether that be
bootstrap or foundation or Balma which
is what we're going to be using I
they're all based on at least 12 column
grid systems and they're responsive and
makes them and make your layout
essentially adapt to different viewports
or different devices like tablets
desktops and mobile phones all right so
basically we want to click on and toggle
on and off the layers here and you'll
see we have our artboard this is the web
1920 so by default we're going to start
designing the site based on a large
viewport like a desktop and if we come
into here we'll see we have a grid layer
and we will be toggling this on and off
as we go all right so for now I'm going
to leave it on and we're going to focus
on doing a sort of like a nav bar at the
top now like I mentioned we're going to
be using Balma CSS and this is a modern
front-end responsive framework and let
me show you the site real quickly and
you can access it at Balma dot IO you
just drag this up slightly and we'll be
referring to the documentation quite a
bit as we're designing our prototype the
reason being we're going to be using
some of these predefined elements that
the Balma framework offers so you can
see it's organized in different tabs and
also different sub tabs so we have an
overview over here of how to install
them we'll go over this later on in the
course after we get done with the
prototypes we have you know just a
really well-documented outline of this
framework going on here so like I said
we want to start with a navbar and so if
we go over to components we'll see we
have a nav
right here and it's basically a
responsive horizontal navbar that can
contain links tabs buttons icons and a
logo
alright so tells you just information
about how to structure it and we're
going to go over this later on in the
course once we get to that point but for
now all we're going to look at is just
the design and the example is right here
at the top so this is the navbar and of
course we can customize this based on
our needs and we will but all you have
to just really know is just how its
structured kind of what the buttons look
like we are going to have a button for
ours and also the links and how they're
structured now of course we can also
customize it with our own CSS later on
so we'll just I think of that going
forward okay so let's go ahead and do a
navbar so what we'll do and by the way I
will try to remember as much as possible
like when I zoom up for instance or do
certain things with my mouse and
keyboard I'll try to remember to let you
know what I did for instance right there
to zoom in and out we hold alt in the
mouse scroll wheel also to pan or move
things around hold the spacebar and left
click and drag okay so for our navbar
we're going to have it extend initially
a hundred percent of the viewport width
so in this context we don't have to
really worry about the grid at all all
right so we're just going to take a
rectangle here left click drag it out
I'm not too concerned at this point with
the height or anything like that you
just want to get a general idea all
right so when we let go we don't need a
border on this we do want to feel and
I'm going to give it a specific color
code and the fill the color code is
three eight three eight three eight and
this is basically if you hit enter not
quite a black not the medium gray just
kind of in between I'm not too much of a
fan of I absolute black these days for
this for like a navbar for instance
there's some obviously contexts in which
you know it would work well all right so
now we'll go ahead and put in a logo so
we'll take the type tool and just
left-click somewhere and I'm just going
to type in
my company of course it's real small we
can't really see it so I'm going to zoom
up with an alt screw will and real
quickly over here we can see we have the
text panel options and this is the size
I just a side note you can left-click
and drag up or down to change the size
so we'll say somewhere around 33 will be
fine
and we'll make it white here for the
fill all right right around there is
good alright and then we're going to
have a right aligned horizontal
navigation over here alright so we're
going to have four different links I and
then also a call-to-action button over
here so I left click will start right
around here and I'll just type in home
alright make this larger
all right around 27 will work and it's
not enough contrast so let's change the
fill here bring it up right around the
color code is bf bf bf like your
boyfriend or not okay so ctrl-c and
ctrl-v
we'll move this over holding shift right
now the whip doesn't really it's not
really important at this point we'll get
that figured out in a second once we get
them all there we're going to have about
and then control C control V see when we
move it over we can see that this little
guide showed up that right there is even
spacing we'll change this to features
you can by the way hit escape just to
select the move tool scroll see control
F and then also a FAQ page we are going
to make the fact page function by the
way when we get to the development
process for each of our three different
JavaScript technologies react angular
and view alright so
that looks pretty good for now I may
want to decrease the size maybe just a
25 all right now we'll go ahead and
create a call-to-action button now this
is a good point to go back and look at
the Balma documentation and we can see
some examples of a button here but if we
go to elements button just going to give
you examples and the coding examples
associated with their buttons and how
they have them styled by default now
notice we also have outlined versions
and I think that's what I want to use
just for a one button in the navigation
all right so let's go back and let's go
ahead and use our rectangle once again
I'm just going to left-click and drag
out somewhere right around there will
work all right we're going to get rid of
the fill and we're going to give it a
specific color code all right so I just
paste it in color code of 1 e C 9 AC and
if you click this right here it's going
to add it to our swatches so that we can
reuse it easily later on alright so now
if you also notice if we go back to our
documentation there is a slight bevel or
rounded corner on the button so let's go
ahead and emulate that as well we can
just drag up right here roughly to
around 5 and that looks good
all right by the way we want to space
this out evenly so I'm going to take all
of these 4 while holding the shift and
then hold shift and left click and drag
right around there so we have equal
space between each of these elements so
that creates consistency which is
obviously very important whenever you're
dealing with UI design alright so what I
want to do now is put in some text so or
take the type tool if we want this to be
centered
just left-click and drag all the way
from the left to the very right then
over here we click on Center and that's
how you absolutely Center text here in
Adobe XD as well as other graphics
applications pretty standard so this is
going to be just a join now text right
here join that button and as well we're
going to make the text the same color so
we click over here and there we go
alright awesome one final thing if we go
back to the Balma documentation go back
to NAV we can see that if we come down
there's some other examples that we have
here you can actually add a class that
has a shadow and there's a shadow that
will show up if you add this class so
the shadow is very subtle so let's just
add a shadow of course it's not
necessary but I'm choosing to add it so
just add a shadow just like that and
we'll see what the direction is so it's
just going straight down by three pixels
which is pretty consistent I don't know
if you can see it but it's just barely
there okay so that is it for this
section in the next we're going to go
ahead and get focused on the hero
section down here alright so what we're
going to do now is focus on what's
called the hero section so a hero
section if you're unaware is the portion
in a design or usually a website or a
web app when you first land on the
homepage or a landing page for instance
you'll see just an area that's probably
around this large it's usually very
simplistic it has a title subtitle
usually in a call to action button and
the background is either a solid color
some type of graphic or vector design or
an actual photograph that's just going
to laid there in the background that
doesn't contrast too much with the text
that's in front so once again we'll go
ahead back to our Balma
and if we click on layout and we click
on hero there is a he broke last section
and it's basically designated by a
section tag in here with classic hero
and then other supporting classes and if
we scroll down we'll see there's a lot
of different examples of how you can
structure this is a very minimalistic
kind of very not tall version of a hero
section and then we come down here and
we'll have more you can work in
gradients really easily as we can see
right here and we'll probably be using a
section right here in terms of
aesthetics it's not going to be blue
actually we're going to use a photograph
but we'll have a title subtitle and also
a call-to-action button okay so let's go
ahead back and what we want to do like I
mentioned before we're going to have a
photograph background for this but first
we need a container to place that into
and that's how Adobe XD basically works
kind of works like a clipping mask so if
we just left-click starting right
underneath that now probably somewhere
right around here will work well and
then just let go the color doesn't
matter it's going to be completely
hidden based on the photograph we're
about to place into it so for this step
we want to make sure it's still selected
and I want you to download the project
files and inside of the project files
and the m2 section you will find a
clouds jpg file so just to show you here
is clouds dot jpg we left click and just
drag it right there close this out and
there we go very simple as you can see
so let's get our layers you can see it's
kind of going over our grid I'm so we'll
go ahead and right click this we select
this right click and we'll choose a
range and bring forward it's currently
showing up off of my screen
unfortunately the way I have like
recording set up I but if you just come
down all the way here you'll see a range
and then you want to send
or bring to the front rather there we go
all right great so again we'll be
toggling this on and off in terms of
opacity to bring this down just a bit so
we can kind of see what's happening okay
and by the way I chose to reorder it
that way because right now currently I
don't know why they wouldn't include
this yet because it says beta for Adobe
XD you can actually drag layers at all
so you can tree or der them okay so now
what we want to do is I add our type so
now we're going to get into the part
where we kind of have to pay attention
to these grids and just make sure
everything's lined up you know
especially at the beginning of the
layout and also in terms of how wide we
want certain elements to be or to extend
across do we want to extend across all
12 of these columns or maybe just you
know maybe two six or seven so we'll get
into that just shortly so what we want
to do now is take our type tool we'll go
ahead and hide that real quickly zoom up
with the alt scroll wheel and I'm just
going to left-click right around here we
want to give ourselves a lot of margin
and padding especially for a hero
section because I when you get things
crammed up real close together it just
completely throws off the entire flow
and the aesthetic of the design so we're
going to give ourselves a decent amount
of space so soaring to new heights is
going to be my headline there so let's
go ahead and increase that quite
substantially I'll say maybe right
around 67 we'll make it black all right
now let's also go ahead and create a
subtitle or subheading so this time I'm
going to left-click and we're going to
drag it out to approximately I would say
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 maybe 9 so 9 columns
long which ends just after features
right here so left click and drag out
right here alright great
so this
size of this of course it can be quite a
bit less I'm going to just put 33 for
now although it may change although for
some reasons it's not taking let me just
do this there we go it updates after you
select off of it alright so I'm just
going to put it in some warm epsom text
you can go to lip simcom and just copy
and paste some of it and this is all I'm
going to use for now all right so let's
bring things down just a little bit
notice how we have 166 at the top it's
just on the very left and pink it might
be hard to see when it comes to
designing like this you also want to
make sure at the bottom of your element
right here you're also about 166 or even
amount of white space between these
edges and that just helps the aesthetics
and the flow of your design and it helps
things just look a lot better when you
have things that are consistent okay so
now I we're also going to have a
call-to-action button just underneath
this so we'll go ahead and actually
we'll copy this one right here so we're
going to get the text and the actual
button itself so held shift and select
both of those ctrl-c ctrl-v move it down
over here this one's not going to be
Hollow we want it to really stand out
because it's going to be our primary
call-to-action so go out around 3
columns here we don't need a border we
do want to fill with our primary color
now let's select the text right here the
same color so we can't see it and we'll
make it white and we'll also select this
and increase the size we're going to
change this though to our services now
the way the buttons work by default in
bulma if we go back here we'll go to
elements button is there based on the
width of the text that's inside
and I believe there is a class that will
allow you extend it to a hundred percent
of the parent container but just to make
things a little bit simpler on ourselves
so we don't have to add that we're going
to bring this in right around here and
bring this in around the same size so
it's going to look roughly like this all
right great
so now let's go ahead and try to give
ourselves a brown and even or equal
amount of space from the top and bottom
all right so let's go ahead and hide
this real quick and get our layers hide
the grid all right do I like this yeah
it's not too bad looking let me zoom up
just a little bit other shows on the
larger desktop but this will be good for
now I think we could probably even make
this bold to make it stick out just a
bit more
this call-to-action button it could also
be a little bit larger so we'll take
this text in here will increase this
size right around there all right so as
you can see it's really pretty standard
right now I'm just curious if there's a
semi light version I kind of like that
better creates more of a distinction and
also helps reinforce what's called
visual hierarchy so your eyes are kind
of really just attracted to this this
headline right here and then this
supporting content is a little bit more
of an afterthought afterwards all right
okay that's good so that's it for this
section in the next we're going to go
ahead and focus on the other supporting
content which is secondary to the hero
content down here alright so here we're
going to have two different sections of
content the first is just going to be a
little bit more tight down here with an
icon
and then down here we're just going to
have three cards and that's going to be
four containers for testimonials
essentially and then at the bottom we'll
have a footer so to get started the very
first thing that we want to do is add an
icon now instead of doing an icon by
scratch which you can definitely do
using these tools up here in Adobe XD
we're going to go ahead and use the font
awesome
now the reason being is because I Balma
here we go back to overview we'll see
that it says font awesome icons if you
want to use icons with moment then don't
forget to include font awesome so I will
be including that once we get to that
section later later on so if we go to
Google and we type in font font awesome
icons we click on that and here is a
search section and we have tons of icons
that we can use in a project so I'm just
going to use a cog so type in COG there
we go
and right here is what we want to
reference is this fa - cog right now I
don't believe there's a way to download
these say for instance as PNG files I so
we'll go ahead and get a PNG file out of
this and to do that if you head on over
to fa2 PNG i/o which basically means
font awesome to PNG you can type in the
name and that was the FA - cog alright
the color in our case we want the color
to be our primary color so I'm going to
hop back into XD and we're going to grab
real quickly this color right here take
that color code ctrl C to copy it and
we'll go back paste that in
and for the size I think a hundred
pixels will definitely be fine so I
click generate and then click download
you can go ahead and show in folder I'm
going to mine showed up off-screen by
the way when it shows up simply just
drag it on anywhere there that's perfect
right around there okay so now this is a
good time to get out the grid so let's
go back to our layers we'll show it and
we want it to fit within this first
column so when we structure the HTML
it's basically going to be the size of
the first column that we have specified
now remember we also want a good amount
of space so I'm going to drag this down
because it doesn't look like there's
quite enough right here as compared to
the top so I'm going to drag this down
so we have an even amount of space from
here to here and then from here to here
and then from here to here as well ok so
now let's go ahead and get our type tool
I'm going to zoom up just a bit and I'm
going to left-click starting from right
around here
and I think we'll go out to a round
right there so we're starting at the
second column and ending at I 1 2 3 4 6
7
alright so 7 this is 6 columns long
technically we're starting at the 2nd
and I'm just going to type in a quick
sentence we provide superior logistics
so that your business can succeed in a
crazy world something really kind of
silly really
alright so we'll increase this and we
want this to be pretty thick so we also
will drop this down and make it black
we're going to make it bold
and we'll put it right there we wanted
to begin just at the top of this cog I
want them to be even all right and then
we're also going to put in some lorem
ipsum text and you know what I think the
drag is in one column right around there
so now we're going to do a second one
and in fact we can just take this
control-c control-v or you hit control D
that will do everything it wants to
duplicate it I'm being a little bit
inefficient and it's going to grab more
lorem ipsum text so take this paste that
in and for this size let's see what the
size of the text is up here it's 33 try
33 here as well we're going to make it
light alright we also extend the line
height so it matches the width of this
over here so let's go ahead and hide
this real quick the grid just to see
what things are looking like so far all
right pretty good let me scale it down
just a tiny bit all right so now we'll
take this back in all right I like that
all right looking good so far so now in
the next section let's do some cards
based on three different columns which
they always need to add up to 12m if you
want everything to fill out so they will
be four columns along each so before we
get to that part we're going to go ahead
and click on the name of our artboard
and we're going to increase the size or
the height so I'm going to put in 2100
just for now notice this little dashed
line that's based on the viewport height
so anything beneath this will scroll
there will be a scroll when we go to
play the prototype all right so let's go
ahead back and turn on the grid and that
is right here this grid let's go ahead
and click on it and drag this down great
okay so now let's refer back real quick
to our you can close this out to our
Balma documentation and we have I
believe it's referred to as a component
it's the first one card and this will
give you an idea of what the cards look
like so essentially the cards in and of
themselves all they are is a very light
border basically one pixels it looks
like and there's also a very tiny little
drop shadow that comes off to the right
and the bottom and this gives you a
bunch of stuff so we're probably going
to focus on creating something more like
this example as opposed to the top two
up here so you can see they're very
flexible we're not going to have share
button so it's really just going to be
really simple box with a quote inside of
it okay
so let's go back and do that so the
first one will take the rectangle tool
and right now where it's at not too
important we'll adjust it later needs to
be four columns long though all right so
now let's go ahead and just temporarily
what we can leave it there I was going
to hide it but no big deal we'll take
the type tool and come right around here
and for now I'm just going to asdf when
we go off screen and just copy a quote
that I had you can go ahead and paste
this in if you wish I'm going to
increase this size let's go ahead and
make it black we'll make this eye light
as well
if i zoom in you can see the type that I
use again you can put whatever you want
and that looks pretty good and then also
we will have an author name so I'll just
put like a Gary Simon probably make this
a little bit bigger and I do like the
default color that it gives us this is
kind of like a medium gray right there
and we'll bring this in notice I'm
looking to make sure we have in an equal
amount of white space on the top bottom
left and right and there we go so now
we're going to repeat grid this because
we have three of them so it's kind of
silly just to sit there and copy and
paste each one so we take this text
right here hold shifts like that and
then also the backs we have three items
selected you can hit ctrl G that's
optional by the way you really don't
have to group them if you don't want to
or you can just hit repeat grid so we'll
go ahead and repeat this and just two
right there and then we can increase the
size just by of you know between them
just by dragging that there in the
middle all right so now again we want to
make sure is even or equal margin
between these elements let's go ahead
and hide the grid real quick all right
and that is what we have so far actually
I think things could be probably spaced
out now I think they're good for now
yeah right there is good okay so I'm
liking this so far
in the next section what we'll do is add
a real quick footer down here and you'll
just be basically two columns with some
text on the left and then some icons
social icons on the right all right so
let's go ahead and create a real quick
footer down here
okay so if I click on our artboard title
we'll go ahead and drag this down just a
bit it's not going to be a very you know
very beefy thick footer as some people
like to do and we're going to use our
our fill color right here our primary
color for it so let's go ahead and take
the rectangle tool left click and drag
get rid of the border
give us a fill of a primary color
alright so this works pretty well I like
the color I think I may want to take
this again just increase it slightly
just give us a little bit more room oops
wrong one so we'll drag this down right
there alright great so now we really
don't need the grid up as long as we
have left align this you know basically
to the container from everything that's
been there so we'll take the type tool
and good the guide shows up so we'll get
there well and I'm just going to put
down here um and this right here is a
spiffy footer where you can put stuff
God the things I come up with will make
it white and we will increase the size
roughly right on there is fine then over
here right align we're going to have
just a Facebook and Twitter icon which
is pretty standard so if I type in
Facebook we're going to go ahead and get
the name we can choose to use I will use
Facebook official so we'll grab that
name real quick
right there that size I could probably
go down just to 50 generate it download
it open it up show in folder rather and
we'll come down and we'll drag it in
oops that's one thing going to make sure
that you don't have anything selected
when you drag that in so I'm just going
to put it here oops and kind of forgot
we need to invert that make sure that's
white so we'll come back over here make
that white generate download and repeat
that annoying process one more time
perfect so 50 is pretty much perfect and
if it was too big a little bit bigger or
smaller probably would have been off so
I kind of lucked out there and we'll do
that one more time for Twitter so we'll
go back I'll type in Twitter and we'll
use the Twitter square just to keep
things consistent and so is FA Twitter
square there it is and generate download
it and drag it in
so we'll put it right around here make
sure this is right aligned there we go
maybe mover just a tad bit more and
there we go that is our very simple
example of a web design slash web app
landing page okay so basically from this
point on now I we also want to do a FAQ
page just to show for instance in
angular and react and view you know how
you create different pages so that will
kind of help us so in the next section
we're going to go ahead and create that
FAQ page I'll see you then
alright so let's go ahead and create
that FAQ page the first thing we're
going to do I'll rename this it's kind
of not very user firmly we'll just call
this desktop and then we're going to hit
ctrl C and then control V so it
automatically just duplicate everything
and stick it over here to the right and
so for our FAQ page we're not going to
have a hero section which is pretty
standardized when you're commenting
concerns web design at least so we'll go
ahead and get rid of that we're going to
leave these two blips right here but get
rid of this call-to-action and then get
rid of everything here we're also going
to ungroup the grid and then get rid of
these two things right there we're
actually going to use this right here as
I kind of a question-and-answer
containers but first let's focus on this
top part up here so remove this up just
slightly and we're going to put in FAQ
and then for our lorem ipsum text we're
going to leave it there but we're just
to make sure this extends out to the
very right side simple enough now let's
take this we don't need a this text
right here right click by the way if you
had a grouped and hit ungroup all right
and now what we'll do here is pose a
question at the top and then the bottom
and
a smaller paragraph font will have an
answer so I will go ahead real quickly
and just type in will this allow me to
do that other thing all right cool
we'll take that ctrl D this time the
whole control C ctrl F was getting a
little bit annoying admittedly and we're
going to take this down let's take a
look at our size I think the size of
this text over here is 33 so we'll keep
things consistent and put 33 I'm not
even really happy with the difference
between these two because there's not
much of a noticeable difference so you
can you know kind of again this is
called visual hierarchy in design you
can reinforce that through color through
making this bold or making it larger and
I think that's the direction that I'm
going to take it so something like this
large and then we'll take this text down
here beneath it and I'm going to copy
and paste again you can use lorem ipsum
that's probably the standard thing that
you should do but I had some other stuff
I had off screen so I'm just going to
use that we're going to leave that there
again you want a good space between all
your elements so I'm just moving them
around with my keyboard ah let's see
here all right that looks pretty good in
my opinion all right so once you're
satisfied with everything we can go
ahead and take everything repeat grid
get it all the way out to the very edge
well actually just to the very right
over here and then extend these as
needed and again this is if it would
help at this point to get up a grid real
quickly just to see
and so right there is perfect all right
so we'll hide our grid and we'll pull
this down I let's see here now what make
it go I three right there we'll take
everything right here holding shift drag
it down somewhere over here we're going
to take this and increase the height so
drag this up keep on dragging up here I
get up more right there's perfect and
also notice the spacing vertically
doesn't match this here so we'll just
drag that down a bit where do these 43
and this is 40 trying to get it to match
up 443 45s fine there we go all right
and that is our FAQ page very cool all
right so let me hide this real quick so
this is our our design so far at this
point so in the next section what we're
going to do is also add a mobile version
but you know what real quickly before we
do that let's hop into the prototype tab
and let's I get some of these like an
actual interactive prototype working so
when somebody clicks on this link right
here this back link you can see a little
blue thing we just drag it over anywhere
over onto this artboard and it gives you
options by the way I for a target your
transition type and also your easing
options and a duration animation I'm
going to leave them here by default I'm
not really too worried about that also
if we click on the logo will make it go
back to the homepage same thing with if
they click on home fact doesn't go
anywhere
there nothing really goes anywhere else
apart from that so now it doesn't really
matter which tab if you click on play
sorry about that it made a real large I
had to pause and fix it and I here we go
so you can see the viewport right down
there at the edge so makes a scroll like
an actual webpage or app of some sort we
click on FAQ and there we go looks a
little redundant with the same content
but I again adjust as manually if you
wish alright so like I said in the next
section we're going to go ahead and
create a mobile version of this layout
to see how the layout should respond
when we're using bomba in the grid
system alright so let's go ahead and
create a brand new artboard so we'll
click on the artboard tool and we're
going to choose iPhone six or seven plus
so the reason we're doing this is
because I instead of just copying like
the home page for instance of the
desktop and then pasting it or
duplicating it it's not going to be in
the size of an actual phone so we're
going to start by scratch coming over
here we'll just choose you know whatever
you want to display it on if it's a
tablet choose iPad if it's a modern
smartphone choose just iPhone six seven
plus you can see it's substantially
smaller that we don't have to really
worry about that we are going to make
sure it's kind of it's going to need to
be longer to fit in all this content
within here so now it's going to be a
matter of intense copying pasting and
resizing and deleting so we're going to
select everything so I take all of our
elements here ctrl C and then over here
we're going to paste them all in
actually no or not what we'll do is
select them I forgot it kind of doesn't
maintain the layout control C control V
and then we drag it all the way over to
here
all right so now you can see we have a
little bit of work to do in terms of by
adjusting this layout here so to do that
I what we'll do is firsts move this logo
over and we're going to scale it down
quite a bit maybe around 24 either have
it we don't need any of this stuff so
we're going to delete it instead we're
going to have your your standard
hamburger menu over here to the right
we're also going to take this and scale
it in I'm also going to make it slightly
less tall right there then we're going
to take our line tool here starting up
here near the top hold shift drag out I
actually like the default color here for
the border color we'll leave it there if
you want thicker of course you can
adjust thickness so ctrl D hold shift
drag down ctrl D hold shift drag down
make sure they are even in margin I
think that's a little bit too big so I'm
going to select all three holding shift
and scale it down right around there and
this is actually pretty consistent with
the balm of responsive navigation icon
alright good so now we got that done
let's focus on this big section right
here so we're just going to drag it in
make sure it's up at the top and yeah
right around there is pretty good I'd
say we can always just this momentarily
and then we're going to take our three
flips of content all right this is going
to be scaled down quite a bit so we'll
see this through media queries and CSS
let's see maybe something like that
right around there for
this size I try like 17 maybe we also
need to find the right side of this and
drag it in probably a little bit larger
so we'll try 22 alright that's looking
good this is going to be scaled down
just a bit so we'll take our services
scale that down as well again we have
some margin issues they have a lot going
between the bottom of this text and the
top of this button we can get control G
so we don't have to keep on selecting
each one of those and let's see and I'm
just experimenting with the layout here
just to see how I want everything to be
spaced out in a mobile version all right
I think that looks good right around
there all right so next we'll take this
cog again it's in its own container or
its own column it's just a single column
however that column will expand to 12
columns or 100% width on the desktop or
mobile version rather so I'll scale is
down holding ctrl + shift or ctrl + alt
sorry sorry not control shift + alt and
then we'll take this let's get this down
a little bit as well and also our
content right here let's see what the
size of this is is 22 so we'll make this
oops
we'll make this 22 as well and also we
going to make it 0 to be default
whatever the line height is and then we
have our I've three flips of
testimonials right here so we don't need
three of them
actually we can ungroup the grid real
quickly I'm going to scale everything
down
all right right click ungroup going to
take this and scale it down and around
there this looks good
maybe drag this up just slightly
right there great and then we can group
and repeat the grid downwards just three
times let's go ahead and select our
artboard and we need to make this taller
so right around 20 or 2,000 for me and
scale this down as well
all right and I believe I forgot I did
not copy this section right here or this
piece of content so let me copy that
real quick I think I pasted it right
there there we go
and I just realized this this artboard
is going to have to be a little bit
longer so put in 2,300 maybe not quite
that long so 2150 drag this down alright
so we'll have these to come in they
might be right aligned actually and then
this right here
something like that I think will work 28
tried 22 and right now I'm just going to
copy this and then just delete it
because it's not based on a an area
where we drug out the size so let's go
ahead and make this white and then also
fix that to zero for some reason putting
zero is not working so I put it at 13
and I have to readjust this because I
put an actual enter there we go that's
why this zero thing wasn't working there
we go
all right sorry about that sometimes
things get a little bit tricky to deal
with all right cool
okay so that is the mobile version of
the app so if we click on this artboard
specifically and hit play we'll be able
to see what it looks like on a mobile
version so if I just bring this in a bit
we can scroll all the way down and this
is what it should look like on a smart
phone alright so in the next section
we're going to make this hamburger icon
menu actually work and show and drop
down menu that shows on smart phones
okay so now let's go ahead and make this
here this button work so what we'll do
is copy this paste it in and the Balmer
default drop down menu is really simple
so to do it what we'll do is just create
a rectangle right here maybe roughly
right there and we're going to have our
four links which are home about features
back as well as our joint now
call-to-action button
so we'll go ahead and left click right
here this will be home I actually kind
of like the color by default already and
so we'll copy and paste or control D to
duplicate it right around there I'm
about 31 pixels difference about his
escape control D why isn't it showing me
the guys for the about oh well I said it
was 31 so right there and then we'll do
features D control D and then FAC
alright hi that's good right there
and by the way probably could have also
used the repeat grid you know what we're
going to do that just so I can show you
the slow and inefficient way which I
just showed you
versus the much better way by the way
there are also dividers between each of
the links by default when you're using
the balm of framework so I have just a
simple dividing line I it's pretty light
so around d 4 d 4 d 4 for the color code
will work so now we take these two
holding shift and we choose repeat grid
tada
that's the intelligent way of doing it
alright don't do it the first way I
showed you
so now ungroup the grid and now we can
just change these right here so this is
about this is features and this is
frequently asked questions who scape
finally we also have our call to action
button so let's go grab that so it's
those two items and ctrl D drag them
over right to here perfect it actually
winds up pretty good in terms of the
padding between all of our elements
important like I mentioned also we don't
need this border we can give it a shadow
like that alright awesome now one thing
that also changes there's a cool sort of
micro interactions / microbe animation
that takes place when you click on this
right here this hamburger it transforms
into an X to close out so what we can do
is I get rid of these three take this
hold shift to make a 45-degree angle and
we'll go ahead and we'll duplicate it
with ctrl D and then I'm just holding it
shift so it's creating another 45-degree
angle the other way and then just bring
it to the center now it's a little bit
big so take both of them scale them down
probably right around there get that
moved over with our arrow keys as needed
and there we go
so I alright awesome so let's watch this
happen um in terms of an actual
prototype so let's click orbit the
prototype tab will click on up real
quickly we'll go back to design select
these three hit ctrl G to group them I
will do the same thing with this over
here these two items ctrl G to group so
now we click on this it takes us to this
page and if we click on this it's going
to take us back to this page now if we
click on fact it's going to take us to a
FAQ page but that's going to be of your
last step so let's go ahead and click
play right now
oops make sure you select on this
artboard first and then click play I'm
going to drag this over get it into view
so that we can actually see it and
alright so let's click this there we go
shows us exactly what's going to happen
all right awesome so now I in the next
section let's go ahead and we will
replicate this artboard and create a FAQ
page which will simply list out all this
stuff except in smartphone version okay
so let's go ahead we're going to take
this artboard right here
I control C control V and let's go ahead
and gut it so we don't need this hubris
section we're going to change this to
FAQ and we're going to leave this little
warm-up some text get rid of the button
and we're going to get rid of almost
everything else so we'll take this and
move it up because remember the
containers are in or the fact that for
the questions and the answers over here
they're inside the same sort of card
container so what we can do is just
adjust it for those questions so to do
that real quickly I'm going to copy
off-screen to start the title that we
had before so will this allow me to do
that other thing okay and then also we
have the secondary text well first let's
go ahead and just copy that will paste
it get rid of this and this size
something like 22 I may go smaller than
that maybe like 20 I'll die for that
text I'm going to copy this again all
right
paste that in we're going to extend this
notice how these aren't updating down
here so I'm just going to
oops
I'm going to back up actually and
ungroup the grid delete these all right
and then I right-click on group there we
go now we can take them and repeat the
grid a bunch of times have right there
is good
actually to make life simple this goes
down as far as we meet can pray right
around there take all this oh there's
that extra text I never saw it there it
is so we did copy it before
probably off-screen right there too as
well all right that's good and we'll
move all this stuff up right there and
then take our size right there all right
awesome so let's hop into the prototype
section and when somebody clicks on FAQ
they're going to go to the FAQ page when
somebody clicks on company they're going
to go back to this original page
somebody clicks on this menu they're
going to go to the menu page and if
somebody clicks this X yeah they go back
ok that's good I'm just trying to make
sure everything's kind of I wire it as
it needs to be so again somebody clicks
X they're back all right that's good so
let's give it a go hop over here to
design will choose this artboard hit
play everything going again here all
right click this we click FAQ there we
go I like it and then we click my
company goes back there we click this we
click X out of there I would go back to
FAQ we click on the menu cool stuff
works well alright so that is it for
this section and now that we have a
prototype
design of our fictional app or website
here done just for you know both for
desktop and mobile view the next step is
to start for new projects for react
angular and view GS and we're going to
take a look at you know each one one at
a time from the very beginning in terms
of setting up a project to the very end
in terms of you know getting the CSS and
everything integrated as needed and that
way we can really see some of the core
difference differences and the basic
differences between each of these pieces
of JavaScript technologies alright so
I'll see you very shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
