calm today with doing the design
challenge number 19 which design in
isometric building okay so looking at
the objective it was very simple just
design a single isometric building could
be a skyscraper or any sort of
commercial building I and there are very
few requirements the submission deadline
I was about four days ago and then I
just linked to some inspiration and the
reason I did this I design an isometric
building challenge is because I've been
working on a course for one of the
network's I do monthly courses for which
is tuts+ calm and I that is doing pixel
art but I decided to also combine the
road of isometrics and pixel art at the
same time so just to show you a preview
project of that course that is right
here and let me tell you it is such a
painstakingly slow process when you're
dealing with individual pixels I mean it
is just I mean this is going to be like
a three hour course just to do this
right here anyhow i thought i'd share
that with you guys I so yeah let's get
started I'm not going to really review
these in the sense of like trying to be
real technical this is more for just fun
just to do something different so I'm
not going to treat this as I would like
say a logo design competition or
challenge so we'll start here with the
first one we have Mohammed and this is
this one was done with the 3d
application which is perfectly fine I
was cinema 4d and yeah looking at this
because you're using a 3d application
you're able to nail down obviously
automatically the highlights and the
shadows and everything and so I like the
simple nature of this whose could
definitely work and you know seeing in
conjunction with other buildings it
would be better obviously if they were
different buildings but again the
requirement is only to do one so yeah
overall I like this like the this light
shading that you have here and there are
highlights on the windows overall it's
good all right so thanks for that
submission and when I came across this
one initially like looking from here and
up I kind of didn't like all the
balloons it just kind of seemed I don't
know they didn't seem
I think there's a way too many colors
and brightness going on but then looking
down here the actual house I like that a
lot there's a lot of detail here as seen
here and detail is great when it comes
to isometric art so I thanks for that
submission coming down here I building
the DC or the design course Empire as
seen here in the DC logo I is kind of
funny I but I just looking at this I
don't know the one thing I don't think I
like about it it's just the colors I the
beige right here I think maybe if it
made more sense to have maybe just gray
like a building or whatever and all
these tiny little windows almost look
like window blinds but that's just again
I'm not trying to be too critical here I
do like the simple nature of everything
here is pretty much simple as well as
the trees and the clouds here so I like
it for what it is so thanks for that
submission all right I let's see here so
this one I like this a lot I like
everything here I like the the bricks
here I again the finer detail really
sticks out i like the different shadows
that are going on here I'm not so sure
though if I like the eye I see this is
your logo and you have it here I think
it's sticking out a little bit too far
but that's just me being anal about it I
in the PG sense obviously alright so and
then we have the Vlad Vlad is that how
you said I've always wondered Vlad Vlad
Amir I'll shut up and the rege I damn
requirement was one building not to
don't you ever submit again I'll just
kidding now I only wanted one building
just because I didn't want this it takes
you long but you know extra points to
you for doing another building is
spending the time to do it so I like
this I one thing that probably could
have been improved just looking at it
right now kind of for the first time I
like the you know the shadows that you
have here they fit real well and it
really just adds you know a sense of
realism to it I but they're not added
for the the trees here it seems like the
from the trees perspective the sun's
coming up and it's just like it's
straight up above it and they're going
they came off this way it would have
created for a little bit more
consistency in terms of the lighting
direction but again I like the
building's himself and the focus of
course was on the building so you did a
good job especially you know the I think
these fit pretty well too since you
designed two of them and I they're
consistent in their appearance alright
so looking down here hipster kid I look
at this is a different aspect or a
different perspective usual usually when
you consider isometric design but it
does work the only possible issue here
which again this is just me being you
know just keep taking things too much I
what the hell happen yeah there you go
is this area right here kind of doesn't
follow the same path or the perspective
I although that that may not necessarily
be wrong in terms of protect it could
just be the building design that way
essentially I but yeah looking at again
we reset this to one hundred percent
zoom looking at this yeah this could
definitely fit well with I depending on
you know how the other buildings were
designed and the setting that you have
although it almost does look like it's
tilted there was that just me I'm going
to copy this real quick just go in here
take this zoom up start right here yep
that was just me for some reason it
looks like this is everything is just
tilted to like I don't know I'll just
shut up I'll quit while I'm ahead all
right I also i do want to mention that i
I've been this is completely unrelated
to the challenge by the way but i forgot
to mention it initially i've been i
migrated I've migrated to a new hosts
and has been a really crappy terrible
process because i have so many different
websites and so many files and stuff and
with design course com there's a lot of
settings and the server environments
been wrong so i've been a little bit
slacking I are not slacking but unable
to record mentor I projects may be
getting to that very quickly so I just
want to address that I then we have
merged murtaza I'll I like this a lot I
you know there's individual I real fine
detail like
tiny doorknob and stuff but then
everything else is kind of big like the
books that stick out well I like the
colors like the shadows and all this
this is probably yeah cinema4d a 3d
application but yeah I really like this
in good job um Alexa alright let's see
try to make a replica of the signal
iduna park homes okay I yeah this is
pretty cool I I think one thing we've
seen if we take a look at the other
entries when it comes to shadows it
seems like it really just adds an extra
element and it's not hard to add shadows
usually I so we've been cool just to see
this with some shadows but not necessary
I mean you obviously added took a lot of
time with all the details so that's
awesome like all these tiny little
windows right here and here I be adding
shadows I think would have probably
taken it up to a next level but yeah
very good detailed building thanks for
the submission and this one right here
they need link it correctly I they
forgot to read the requirements so they
wasted their time as I said with
pyramids and since so that that's
unfortunate I and obviously there's not
too much here for me to even critique
anyways because there's not a lot of
detail but thanks for the entry anyhow
and first entry hope it's not too bad
this is pitiful I don't know why you
bothered submitting this now I'm just
kidding but this is actually probably
one of the best entries that we have so
I really liked it very unique
architecture I'm thinking outside of the
box I the swimming pool obviously this
is done in a 3d application I other I
mean if it was done in photoshop by hand
though be insane but yeah I've had to
guess it's definitely a 3d application
very unique though I like it a lot then
sasai isometric and all the detail is
there thanks for taking the time to make
this and that was it not a lot of
entries just because you know this is
more of a detailed and time intensive
project or challenge rather but yeah
then there's this one final announcement
that I want to make I before concluding
and I announce us on the Facebook page
probably not too many of you watching us
our fans on the facebook page so you
no yet but I'm going to be working in
collaboration with slide nerd of a
YouTube in salida nerd com um basically
this guy has a very similar size channel
I think he has like forty one thousand
subscribers I have forty-two thousand
subscribers he does all things android
basically in Java and he has a ton of
tutorials on creating android apps and
working with the different maybe android
studio and all that and I hit him up I
say you know would be really cool is to
do a collaboration tutorial series on
creating an Android app and I would take
care of all the design and he's going to
take care of all of the coding and so
the first six or so videos are going to
be based on my channel where I'm going
to cover all the design from the app
launcher icon to two or three different
screens that are going to be present in
the app I I think that's about it yeah
also about how to export them properly
for use in Android and then I'm going to
forward on to his channel where he's
going to show you how to make the app
actually function alright so I paused
real quick i want to show you just a
very small preview of what the app might
actually potentially be we went and I
designed this real quick for a promotion
on Facebook just to let people know
about it but you can see vanier it's
going to be an app called I think we're
going to call it remind Lee because
there's already an app called reminder
with an R so I'm just going to change
that but the general premise is it's
going to be very simple because I want
you guys to be able to follow along on
the coding process so you obviously you
don't want to develop develop in an app
that's too intensive for a beginner and
likewise for his subscribers I'm not I
didn't want to get way too into like an
evolved or involved a design I want to
make it so that beginners could actually
follow so that's our goal so that you
guys you know you subscribers a design
course can follow along I with a nap
coding that's you know hopefully won't
be too involved and also for his
followers and subscribers of course can
also follow along in the design section
so what's going to be usually what you
find is when you're looking for
tutorials on apps you'll have a guy he's
really good at may be designing apps but
you don't ever get to see him coded
because he can't code them wrong I or
the opposite end you have a really good
coder who's showing you how to make apps
but the apps always look like crap so
that's why we're doing the collaboration
so we're hopeful that it's I going to be
successful it's going to be free and
then in the future we may do depending
on how it does we may do some udemy
courses possibly but yeah this is going
to be an app based on just setting a
single alarm and there's going to be a
radial progress bar that goes around I
and it allow you to specify just a
simple title of what you want to be
alerted on if you want to activate the
phone alarm I and yeah so we're
hopefully this will be ready in a few
weeks so yeah just wanted to put that
out there so be sure to check out his
channel it's youtube.com / user / slide
nerd and we will be doing a more formal
announcement video as well all right so
check out these nine course com if you
haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube alright goodbye
