comm today we're going to continue on
with the HTML and CSS for the second
step as well as the login page and we're
also going to get a little bit into
designing the creating the HTML and CSS
for the user interface where the person
is logged in alright so if you haven't
yet subscribe here on YouTube and check
out design course come on let's get
started
alright so this is where we left off
from yesterday so let me put switch back
here to the hell's going on yeah
Photoshop here and basically you want to
get out make sure you have both the home
page PSD and also the step two that we
did as well and we're going to finish
these two in terms of HTML and CSS and
also make them responsive all right so
basically I the first thing we have to
worry about worry about is this part
right here so we want to save this logo
real quick so just with auto select
layer just click on it and then choose
its layer one for me I control a and
then ctrl C and then ctrl N or command
of course if you're a Mac user and hit
OK and paste that in and then I'm going
to go file save for web but from now on
I'm going to use this shortcut alt shift
ctrl s just like that and make it at
png-8 and all the other options can
remain the same and go ahead and save
this
now I've already saved in a different
project folder so let me switch to the
correct one and here we are in the
images folder right here alright so save
this just as logo.png alright so
basically let's switch back here to our
HTML editor and let me right click on
this to open the containing folder and
then get it up and viewable in an actual
browser so I'm off the screen one second
I'm going to drag this in real quick I'm
on a much larger larger resolution that
when I'm recording on that's why it's
kind of looking crazy so let me just
scale this in correctly alright so
basically this is
what you should have you know roughly so
far without any of the CSS okay so what
we need to do is focus first on this top
part so we're going to come up here and
I'm going to copy this CSS line right
here and then paste it in and then
rename the 1142 style CSS so most of it
pretty much all of our custom CSS will
go in this right here this that way
it'll make it easier to see what's going
on in terms of specific customizations
so we'll go ahead and save that and
we'll go ahead and create a new file and
then save it and we'll name this style
dot CSS right so now that that is linked
up we can begin actually you know
started working with this so the first
thing we'll mess around with is this top
portion here so we need to get this
centered alright so if you recall we
made this seven column so we need to
basically give this another class so
that we can reference it specifically to
right aligned anything that's inside
here inside of this column so if I just
specify column seven then down the road
if I add another column seven then
everything would be right aligned so I
want to make it specific actually
technically what we would do is make it
an ID so ID equals maybe we'll just call
it I header - nav you know whatever
alright so what we'll do is come in here
with our CSS and we'll just go ahead and
put header - nav and then IMG for the
image inside of it and put float right
and then save that and we'll get out our
thing here and refresh it and as you can
see it's now centered now we could need
to basically do the same thing for the
login here portion all right so
basically we have this ul item unordered
list and all of our links will go with
in here so we'll be adding to this but
it's just for now we're just going to
keep it for logging here and so we need
this everything to float right so this
entire portion needs to float right so
we could give this an ID or a class
where we could just reference it because
from the header option so if we go to
the header tag and put header ul and
because we own we know what we're only
going to have one unordered list or one
navigation inside this header tag we can
just reference it that way so all you
have to do is put in header ul and then
we'll put float right and then also to
get rid of that little dot that shows up
next to each link like right there that
black circle you just type in
list-style-type:none alright so now we
can go ahead and refresh that and it red
lines all the way to the end of the 12
grit all right so now we need to give it
some eye margin or padding you know it's
right right up against everything so
let's go ahead and fix that real quick
so what we'll do is everything is
contained our elements so far is
contained within this header so we can
give that header specifically some
padding so header and I'm going to try
padding:30px and zero so we don't want
any padding to the right or left so
that's why this year is there but we do
want the top and bottom so we'll save
that and I know I'm kind of moving by
quickly it's late again and I'm gonna be
have two damn kids
oh I mean I got a deal with them pretty
soon did I anyhow yeah so just pause if
I'm going too fast I mean that's the
great thing about video anyhow so the
next thing we'll go ahead and work on I
yeah I want to kind of just format the
text here the links real quickly so I'm
going to come up here at the very top
I'm going to put in a open that up color
and we're going to make it I
let's see whatever color we had here
whether like a complete black color
looks like a gray okay it's all it's
like six five so paste that in there and
then P for a P tag font size I want it
to be just a little bit bigger than what
will be shown so 1.1 and then also I'm
going to come to 1140 CSS and we can see
up here this very top line it's like
referencing almost every type of HTML
tag and what I want to do is come over
here and find where that opens up and at
the end I was going to put a semi
cool and after that padding portion
input flaunt - family source sans pro
just like that
and let me I'm going to check off screen
to make sure that was the only change
that I made yeah I also want to put font
- wait - 300 all right so now let's
refresh and see what happens okay so our
font changed and I this font size was
increased a little bit and this changed
as well
alright so so far so good let's move on
let's go to back to index now we want to
focus on this portion our exxor alright
recall our headline so what we'll do is
reference that that's going to be h1 IDs
home alright so we'll go back to style
and h1 just let us notice the h1 tag and
then home is the ID open that up the
margin so that the way the margin works
is you know you can either in same thing
with padding you can either just specify
top bottom left right or you can put
just 30 pix pixels and that will affect
all corners or you can put all four of
them left top right left bottom if you
have different ones so that's what I
going to do I think it's one pick one
120 pixels 0 for the bottom 40 pixels I
mean for the right I mean 40 pixels for
the bottom and then for the left zero as
well and so I the way the way I got that
hundred twenty pixels is basically I
kind of eyeballed it and just you know
you could be specific there is a tool
that will you know kind of just show you
exactly how many pixels are up there but
I yeah usually I just experiment with
that real quick so that's what I found
that worked out well
let me go back here and add a couple
more the font size has to be increased
as well so I'm going to put it to 2.4
a.m. and then text - align Center will
Center it up so let's refresh this and
that got screwed up so I'm going to have
to fix that and that's because I forgot
to switch back this portion oops zero
what they reopen zero all right so now
all right so that's much better
all right so now we'll move on to the
actual
text fields here and let me go back to
our index and see what we have going
there so we have class is large - FLD so
that's what we want to focus on now so
let's go ahead over here large - FLD
open that up alright so there's a lot
that needs to be done because these are
quite far what we saw by default are
quite far away from this so we have to
add a few properties here so padding
first of all the space between the text
in the actual text field I'm going to
add 17 pixels on all sides border radius
because right now it's square I think
try around 8 pixels and that's for the
other browser and then font size has to
be increased
we'll try 1.5 and then the borders 1
pixel solid stamp solid and then the
color code will gum come over here and
we're not going to gum over here we're
going to come over here
I just just shut up all right and then
just double click on that stroke and
then the color is specifically right
here and we'll just paste that in right
there all right so let's refresh this
and see what happens
all right that's a lot closer and they
also need to be a hundred percent in
terms of I there with so I forgot to add
that one percent all right so now it
will fill out their columns BAM cool
alright so now also this thing that
needs adjusting as well so let me come
back over to editor and we gave this um
let's see here
large magnify I'm going to give it a
different one here I'm going to also
give it
but you know what I'm just going to get
rid of large field and just put large -
BTN sorry about changing things up the
kind of it just kind of works better
this way so what we'll do is put a comma
large - BTN because it's pretty much
styled almost the same way with
exception to the color and such so what
we'll do is then copy all this paste it
right here and then we want to change
yeah we want to change basically
everything so background - color is that
green color and let's get that real
quick copy and we'll paste this in and
then border we don't want a border so
color we want it to be white right now
it's like I think it's like a black and
then cursor this will change the hand to
a pointer because right now it wasn't
given us that hover effect so now it
changes to the actual cursor but pointer
thing right there all right so let's
scale this in just to look and see what
happens so far so some adjustments like
this is too much obviously when you
scale that in when you're going to be on
like smaller devices like phones so
we'll fix that as well but so far so
good
all right I let's see here let's also do
a hover state for the button so when you
hover over it it will slightly get
darker and let's get rid of that and in
the background color it's just going to
be a slightly darker green like right
around there all right so now what we
want to do is change that save it and
now that will work yeah all right so now
we just have this thing here at the
bottom to worry about so let me go ahead
and let's see we called it home info so
let's put P home - info and this will be
a margin top by hunter pixels and then
text-align:center and then also we gave
it a span so we can make that those
examples green like that and then we'll
just put in color grab that color code
actually I think maybe a little bit
darker than that so mine's for a 7 1 F 1
D if you want to match it up there
alright so let's refresh this there we
go
sweet alright so now what we want to do
is make some adjustments here for the
responsive nature of the design so if we
come in here we can see right at that
breakpoint and I believe that's at 767
unless is when everything doesn't float
anymore so we want to Center this up
this can stay right aligned that's fine
we want to bring this up maybe make this
text smaller and also bring this portion
up as well so let's go ahead and do that
alright so I basically 1140 CSS if you
switch there you'll see the different
media queries they have go and they have
one for the minimum width of 960 all the
way up to 11 60 I'm not going to mess
with that one I will mess I will copy
this and just paste it in down here
close it up and then also grab the next
one do the same thing which is max width
767 alright so this basically means
anything that's less than 67 767 on the
the viewport device width or the browser
width then you know execute anything
that goes in here so right now I think
everything was fine I mean if we if you
have Google Chrome out for example we
hit control shift I it brings up this
window right here which like you know
what the hell is that if you've never
seen it before don't worry but when you
bring that up what happens is when you I
scale this in you'll see right here it
has the the pixels at the upper right
hand corner right by my cursor right now
and so basically we can see you know
where we're at in terms of the viewport
width so
we get down to 767 there you know right
there right around there is where it
changes and so the layout up into that
point is fine so we don't have to put
anything in between here I that's not
always the case though depending on your
layout and what you're working with but
right now we can just focus on this
portion right here 767 and so that's
where we do need to make some changes so
the first things we'll go ahead and
change is the header portion with that
area that should basically you know
everything should be lining to the
center so text - align center give
myself some space here and then also
we're going to have to reference logo
container
- container IMG and float:none because
right now it's float right and that will
just adjust that so now when we come
back in refresh it yeah it doesn't work
what the hell's going on one second yeah
that's my fault because I'm when I'm
doing this I'm looking off to my other
screen where I've already done the code
and so I forgot that I did not name that
logo container I called it header nav
sorry about that let me change that and
then now it will work damn it there so
now we see it's centers and outside of
that portion stays centered all right
that's good
all right so now we have to adjust this
portion just a couple more things and
this will be h1 i home let me make sure
that's actually it yeah it is okay cool
and we'll just put margin - top 40
pixels and no no no sorry margin we're
going to put 30 pixels zero 40 pixels
and zero and then font size - EMM so
basically now we brought everything up
you know you we could party even bring
that up more one second twenty let's try
that it's up a little bit more okay that
works and then we have to bring this
thing up too so
so basically I pee home - info and that
will be margin - top 40 pixels that's
the one I was looking at before so now
we you know basically fix that portion
so that's a lot better all right sweet
eye now real quickly let's go ahead and
switch back to our editor here take out
our index.html be renaming that to PHP
so that's no big deal
I'm not going to worry about that right
now but I'm going to save this so we're
going to save this as just step - -
might be we're saving this one as PHP
this time and so now it's basically a
duplicate so we're going to work on step
two real quick and it's just going to be
a couple adjustments no big deal let me
find it yeah so let's go back here and
alright so first thing that needs change
is the actual title so that will change
- the first one is we're going to put a
strong that makes it bold so great close
that strong tag up and just put just one
more step just like that alright and
then we still have a form except we've
changed up the fields a little bit so
these are all going to be three and
three and this one we're going to leave
at Oh actually let me just take this one
paste that in alright so these first two
fields is we go back our text fields and
then we have a drop-down menu all right
so let's focus on the actual text field
the name will name this email and then
the placeholder is going to be email
address oops
and then this name will be city and then
placeholder will be city and then also
let's get rid of this and all I did was
real quickly I found I went on Google
and I'll let me see if I can find this
real quick I went to a yeah HTML state
drop-down search I'm going here to the
second one and let's see if my kids are
bothering
anyhow I found this one just copy this
and let me come down here and then just
come back here and paste this in alright
and I'm going to take everything and
just tab it in you don't have to tab it
if you're not using any type of editor
like notepad you can't do that then but
don't worry about it it's state and then
we're going to put also the class we're
going to give it that same class as
large - FLD and I yeah that's good right
there and then um the button text is
what we have yeah let's do this so let's
do that
alright we can just give it a different
name step two just to be specific and
now what we want to do is I'm going to
get out and open up the containing
folder all right so that's that now
let's see how this responds all right
this would be on like an iPad probably
this width right right around here as
well and then you're getting into the
cell phone territory and it works well
sweet so I yeah good stuff yesterday
it's late again today like I was mention
it's 8:30 but I've been working all day
on something new which I wanted to show
you guys I got a design course calm I
I'll go put video - page 2 PHP I'm just
going to choose like one of the latest
ones I think it like 74 maybe okay
that's the brain you're on I've been
working on coding a registration system

get it I so that's why the today's video
is quite light I was just working all
day on this so much involved in building
