overdressed once again because my
daughter's dance rehearsal and I'm just
lazy I didn't feel like changing so
anyhow welcome to the fourth and final
section that's a part of this hundred
percent free comparison course by
example where we're going to cover our
app that we covered in View j/s and
react now we're going to be covering in
angular
alright so angular is owned and
maintained by Google and aside from
being JavaScript based it's not a
library it is a framework so it's a
little bit more robust alright so if you
just stop hopping in here you can
download the project files by I just
dialing them inside of the zip you'll
see that we have a lot of ton of
different files for the each of the
lesson videos where there's a begin and
end state and there's also the HTML the
CSS that we're going to be pasting in
that's going to create the layout for
this app alright so let's get started oh
but real quick before we begin make sure
you check out my site course cetera comm
where you're going to find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying meal I can expect
each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on all right
let's get back to it all right so let's
get started here as with the other two
as in view and react
you could either choose to install your
angular project as a part of an existing
project or you can start fresh which is
what we're going to do with the help of
the angular command-line interface so
first let's go ahead and install it with
NPM install - g for global angular for
slash CLI alright so once it's finished
we're going to go ahead and access the
CLI and the way you do that is through
simply ng if you hit enter it'll give
you all of the options that you can do
ng - V I believe will give you your
current version so to start a new
project and by the way as compared to
the view CLI and the
the AK CLI angular's command-line
interface has a lot of options a lot
more robust so it's not just for
installation lets you generate I
components directives pipes and services
and all this other stuff so we're going
to start a new project by ng new and
then the name of our project and I we're
going to name our s compare - angular
and we're also going to add a couple
options so you could just hit enter and
it'll start your project up by default I
but we're going to add two things here
two different flags first is going to be
routing and this will set up just a
routes file for us as well as importing
it into an NG module so it just kind of
saves a little bit of time for us by
setting that file up and then also we're
going to specify a style instead of two
by default I believe angular setup if
you just didn't include this at all to
work with CSS you could also specify s
CSS or sass now because I the ball my
CSS framework that we're using use of
sass I'm just going to be specifies
staffs here so after that just hit enter
and I will go ahead and pause it because
it does run npm install for so it takes
a little bit longer then say compared to
i believe you it does you have to run
npm install by default alright so let's
go ahead and CD into it after it's been
created to compare - angular and the way
we serve it here is through ng serve so
it's going to set up a local server at
localhost 4200 right here so let's go
ahead and open that up once it's done
and here we go looks like they just
recently updated this little default
landing page from that the CLI generates
for the project you should just say app
works over here so they upgraded just a
tad bit but nonetheless we're going to
be removing all this stuff I here in the
next section so we're going to just get
started as you did with the previous to
being react and view by kind of
outlining how things work at a very
basic fundamental level and as well as
setting up our components all right all
right so go ahead here I'm using Visual
Studio code to open up the project that
we just created which is compare -
angular so sort of a similar for
structure that we have before this is
just for testing and really worried
about that node modules because this is
a node node js based project and then we
have our source and right here the one
file to pay attention to is index.html
which is a starting point of our app the
one thing I would take note of is this
app - root right here so this right here
is where the app will actually be placed
in and if we open up the app folder and
go to app component es and that is for
typescript which is a superset of
JavaScript that compiles down to
JavaScript so typescript gives you
certain advantages over just writing
plain JavaScript you can just write
JavaScript if you wish though all right
so if we look in our app component at TS
file you'll see that we have a selector
here and this whole thing right here is
called your component decorator and
inside of it you basically specify a
series of properties that configure this
given component so they always have a
selector and this is a brute which
corresponds to this index dot HTML app
root right here okay so going back to
this file we could also see that we have
a template URL property and this is
bound to an external HTML file which is
located right here and then as well we
have a style URLs property which lets
you specify the an external sass or CSS
or s CSS file for the different let me
find it right here I by default is just
empty for your different styles
associated with this given component all
right then finally down here we also
have I the export class app component
this is where all the logic goes so
dependency injection defining your
methods and your properties
all go right here we can see one by
default is created called title we go
back to our app component dot HTML we'll
see it's referenced here through
interpolation as title all right so
that's basically in a crash course of
how you know very rough and simplified
sense of how angular is set up to work
so let's go ahead and get started and
the first thing we're going to do is to
generate some components with the CLI so
unlike the other two tools for view and
react well the angular CLI lets us real
quickly just generate these files sort
of having to manually create them for
ourselves so what we'll do is go back to
our console here and I'm going to get up
another console window because I'm going
to lead this ng serve ran and Here I am
inside the project folder and before we
look at this real quick I'm going to
bring back the Adobe XD mock-up and
prototype that we designed in the very
first section of this course and again
just to go over this in terms of how the
components are structured we have a
header here or a navigation rather and
then we have a footer down here and then
we have inside of here a component that
will show a home and then also over here
a component that will show a fact page
all right so we could generate a
component for these for the navigation
and the footer however if you know that
they're going to be present on every
page then you don't really have to
generate a component specifically for
those instead we're just going to place
the HTML in the CSS and the coding for
that inside of our app component ts file
that we already looked at so really that
just leaves the FAC in the home
components to generate so it looks like
this we're going to access the CLI by ng
now we could say generate or simply G
which is shorthand for generate you can
use either org and then component or C
for component which is shorthand you can
use either or and then the name of the
component so the first one will do
is home pay enter you can see it
generates several files for us and also
updates our app module dot EES file and
then we'll also hit the up arrow key and
changes to FAC
alright simple enough so let's go back
to our project here real quick alright
so now we have two folders based on the
component names we generated so FAQ and
home alright in the next section we're
going to go ahead and get focused on
tying these components together and
setting up our routing ok so in our
source app and app pipe and Rodney
routing module file this was generated
when we added the routing syntax or the
flag rather when we started the project
with the CLI alright so this is really
straightforward the only thing we have
to worry about is this object here
contained within this array right here
and for each path that we want we
designate a component and we separate
them here with commas so the first one
is going to be for a home component so
the first thing we need to do is import
it up at the top so import home
component and that's the name by the way
if you checked inside the home folder
and from port slash home and home
component is actually we don't have to
put the TS file there now we're going to
do the same thing for the fact component
so this changes here to FAC and this
right here is simply fact and back there
we go alright so for this default path
we're going to leave the path they're
just empty and we're going to get rid of
this children property and we're going
to change this here to home component a
rather component home component alright
and then after that we're going to put a
comma and we also have one for our faq
page
okay so for this it's just simply going
to be back and this will be fat
component there simple enough so now
let's go ahead and focus on the app
component in the HTML file for a
template now let me go ahead and remove
that and notice we have a router outlet
down here alright so this is where our
home component and our back component
will be placed inside so up here will be
the header and down here will be the
footer all right so if we take a look at
the result in a browser make sure ng
serve is being run in the console you'll
see that we have our homeworks this is
the home component and this works
because we set it up in the app routing
file and then if we go to /faq we'll see
it says back works
all right great so let's continue on and
let's go ahead and let's go in integrate
our ball mount CSS framework so back at
our console we're going to run npm
install Balma and save it alright so
once that is installed we'll go back
here and we're going to go into a file
called angular CLI to Jason alright so
notice we have a property here called
styles and by default it has a set of
style sass which is just right down in
here right there just before that is
when we want to load or where we want to
load our Bhama sass file so just above
that go ahead and type in this right
here so node modules Balma balm of sass
all right so you could save that now
we're also going to create an mq sass
file that's sitting right next that will
sit in the same folder as our style soft
sass so I'm going to create that real
quick mq sass and I'm simply going to
paste in what we were pasting in before
we created this same file for view and
react and for view because that was the
first framework or library you know that
we're covering of the 3
I did you know pretty much when it comes
to the whole HTML and CSS process I did
going to write this out by hand although
I don't think I did this file but all
the other CSS and all that is all
covered in view the view section of this
course just for your very reference if
you wanted to see that instead of
instead of me just pasting us in by the
way all the project files are here so
you can paste this in as well you don't
have to sit there and type all this out
manually but this is just for some of my
variables here that are defined that we
can have access to our custom CSS that
we will write and then some mixing here
for responsive CSS alright so we'll save
that as well so next let's go ahead and
focus on real quickly the header portion
of our app component before we focus on
the header let's go ahead to our
index.html file and just before the
closing head tag we're going to add our
font awesome link rel right here because
bulma does use font awesome for the
icons alright so let's go back to our
app component HTML so here we have our
header and then we'll also have our
footer so let's focus on the header and
also making it work so I'm going to
paste in from the HTML that we've been
using throughout this course for the
header portion of the site so simply
paste in right here
hit ctrl B just to give us a little bit
more room and this is what I have pasted
in so again you can access this all from
the project files which will have you
know just a folder that says like just
basic HTML and you can copy this as
needed and paste it all right so I'm
going to save that alright and you may
have to run ng server stop your ng serve
if you haven't yet and rerun it so hit
ctrl C Y to stop and then run ng serve
again and the this is what yours should
look like at this point so let's also
add to CSS that we have been working
with as well to customize it based on
our needs so let's go back here and
bring back control be for the sidebar
and we have our app component SAS file
so the very first thing which we are
going to import our mq SAS or a media
query SAS file up at the top like that
and then I'm just going to paste in the
rule sets that we created back in the
view section of the port the course here
so again this is using the SAS styling
so there's no I semicolons and all that
stuff
alright so we'll save that and there we
go
cool so now we go in
we'll see it doesn't work so let's make
it work by capturing a click event and
also set up setting up a class binding
here in angular so to do that let's go
back to our component HTML and we have
our span class of nav - type and toggle
so we have to do event binding and set
up a click event so the way you do that
in angular here is to wrap the event
that you want to capture which is a
click in parenthesis equals and we're
going to put in toggle nav which is the
property we will define in the component
class equals not toggle nav all right
and then we do class binding through an
ng class directive ng class wrap that in
a brackets equals and inside of here we
put in object with is - active which is
a class that has to be added and this is
based on Balma obama class so if it's
added to this then it changes this
hamburger icon menu into an X so that
people can close out of it on mobile
versions and we bind it to the state of
toggle nav whether it's true or false so
if it's true it adds is active if it's
false it won't be added alright so just
like this is how you close that out and
then also we're going to copy ng class
this whole thing right here and paste it
onto this div class which is respond
Cybil for showing or hiding our menu
which have these items right here
alright so also another thing that I
pasted in is this router link right here
so over the router link these two links
right here we didn't set up pages for so
I didn't add anything but router link is
how you actually set it up you don't use
href with the path name otherwise it
won't work so you just use router link
equals and then the path so this is our
home component and then this is our FAQ
path right here alright good so let's
say that not done yet we have to go back
to the actual app component so control B
sidebar app component and in our app
component all we have to do is get rid
of this title we don't need anymore
it's just create a toggle now and we set
the to false that's it
so we'll save we'll go back to our
project drag it in so we can see and
watch the animate a little micro
animation there with our X and there we
go awesome let's also do our footer real
quick by the way I personally just like
the decoding structure if we're
comparing angular versus react just this
right here what it took there the amount
of coding it took just to create that
click effect arm compared to like react
for instance that's just a personal
preference definitely less coding okay
so let's go ahead and focus on the
footer as well so just down here is
where our footer HTML is going to go so
the footer HTML fairly simple I'm going
to copy and paste that in right here if
you want to pause and just follow along
I can go ahead you can go ahead and do
then type it out by hand or just open up
the project files and paste it as well
again nothing really serious is
happening here there's nothing I you
know we're not capturing click events or
not passing in data anyhow your static
HTML so I'm going to do that this is
what it looks like so we have our
homeworks in backwards
awesome alright great so in the next
section we're going to focus on the
home.html
alright so for our home component the
HTML that we want to create is a Serie
section up here and then this section
down here which is pretty much a
secondary content alright so let's go
back here to our project and we're going
to go into our home home component HTML
we'll go ahead and get all that and
we'll just do start off with these hero
section first
so pasted this in and if we save it and
go back to our project
there we go soaring to new heights blah
blah blah we don't have CSS yet for this
so it's a little bit where you're
looking plus we need to also get our
cloud such a PG file I in assets folder
so right here and assets 4 is already
created for us by default so I'm going
to right click and reveal an explorer
and go into here and you can download
the project files and find this clouds a
jpg make sure it's in there close this
out and if we go back to our project it
should show weight it won't show yet
because we don't have the CSS or about
that so now let's go to our home
component sass and it's going to paste
this in so we're importing our media
query file we're referencing a hero
class here just making some adjustments
on the font size is based on tablet
desktop referencing our h2f ACOG is for
a font awesome adjustment to the size of
the font and yeah pretty much it this is
for padding right here so we'll save
that there we go so that is it so far
great alright so let's also continue on
and add the rest of the HTML to fill it
to finish out the home component page so
off screen I'm simply pasting real
quickly or coughing rather now I'm going
to paste this section of content right
here so we'll save that we'll go back
and there we go so that is the home
component HTML awesome all right so we
have a lot of time left here so I'm
going to just finish off by the in
alienating section is this FAQ page
right here so we're going to go into the
fact I actually will start off with the
the component file first because we're
going to pull in data from an API like
we did with view and react the same
exact API location so in view and react
we used
Axios to pull which is HTTP client
library to pull in the data the JSON
data for this for an angular it has a
built in library for us to use for that
purpose
so at the top of the file we're going to
import two different things we're going
to import HTTP from angular the angular
HTTP library and then we're also going
to import a map operator from reactive
extensions which is right here so make
sure you have these two added at the top
and then inside of or at the very top of
our FAQ component class we're going to
have FAQs property of a type array of
any and then in our constructor we're
going to pass in our HTTP and instance
of it so private HTTP HTTP all right and
then inside of here and then this
constructor this gets ran when the
component loads so we're going to
reference this dot HTTP GET and then our
URL to the endpoint that we've been
using throughout this course so I'm
going to paste that in and after that we
add map which we import at the top the
response to response in JSON format and
then we subscribe
result to this fax equals the result a
response rather I always say result and
one way to do that all right and then
that should be enough for this section
so now we have our back HTML and again
this is very simple I so I'm going to
paste this in without the coding portion
first so that I can describe that actual
portion so we're pasting in the HTML we
already did during the view section and
right now we do have interpolation here
so the section that gets repeated for
these questions and answers is from here
to here alright so starting at this
second div class in what we do is add in
astrick ng4 equals and we specify let
faq of facts facts is the property that
our response is mapped to and then we
reference fact that title and body right
here so if we save this and we click on
our FAQs page we get an error so let's
check it out things don't always work
like you intend them to so no provider
for HTTP all right so that's because I
forgot real quickly if we go back here
to app module TS we have to import it
and add it as and imports right here
alright so the code for that
let's put there in the middle is import
HDTV module from angular HTTP library
and then we'll just copy this put a
comma here and add it as an import so if
you say if you go back and click on FAQs
there we go so this is showing up off on
the right because we didn't haven't at
yet added the CSS to fix this no rap
issue over here so let's go back and do
that real quick we're going to go to our
sass file for
back and just add these three rule sets
so flex wrap wrap is what's going to fix
that issue over there by the way we go
back here we're going to have a ton of
results if you just want to limit that
to ten and the weight and angular to do
that real quickly is go back to our HTML
and right here we're going to put in
parentheses
fax fax dot slice 0 10 and then we add a
colon in brackets and close out that so
if we go back here well now see there's
only 10 and there we go that is it so
hopefully you guys were able to learn
quite a bit about you know the primary
core differences between react angular
and view j/s personally my takeaway from
it is I really like angular and that I
may be partial because I started out
with angular first so that's where I'm
most comfortable um after that I would
say I like view j/s a lot everything
kind of follows a similar flow to
angular and the idea that the component
structure you know it's very it's
separated in terms of you know you have
your Styles you have your component
logic and you have your template react I
just you know know I just don't really
personally prefer I know it's very
popular if not probably equally pauper's
popular to angular but you know that's
my personal preference so use this you
know you know I know a lot of may be
aspiring or new developers you know this
is probably hopefully valuable in some
way so that you could say okay I
personally like this
you know I like view or whatever so I'm
going to start focusing on that so
hopefully there's value in that so
please I yeah subscribe to my youtube
channel as at that design course and
also check out my site for more courses
across cetera
calm alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
