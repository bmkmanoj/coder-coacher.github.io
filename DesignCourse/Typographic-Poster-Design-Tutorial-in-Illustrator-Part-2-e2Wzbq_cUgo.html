today is februari forth with our 34th
video of the year and we're going to
finish up the type of graphic poster
that we started yesterday in adobe
illustrator CC so as always check out
these nine course com if you haven't yet
and subscribe here on YouTube here's a
preview once again of what we're going
to design
alright so now what we want to do is
take our I two pieces of text there they
are currently type layers so hit ctrl
shift and the letter O and that will get
control eh they'll convert them to
outline so that's good I let's go ahead
and zoom up now I'm just going to kind
of work with this text to make it look a
little bit cooler I guess you could say
for lack of a better I so what we want
to do is we'll come in and we'll zoom up
a little bit more actually i'm going to
create like kind of like a cut like so
the d is cutting into the sea a little
bit so we'll take the pen tool and it
will cook we're real close to there and
it's going to have to imagine you know
where this is that we could have changed
the color so we could see it but that's
fine and just kind of left click and
drag just a little bit and hold alt and
left click and then come in right around
there and then we'll end it right there
now if you make this black of course you
can see kind of the effect and real
quickly we will take both of these right
here and we want to get out our I where
we out here Pathfinder and we will merge
those and then we will take this and
this and subtract that shape alright so
now it's transparent all right so it
looks pretty cool okay so let's continue
on with these kind of these cuts I guess
you could call them I had to pause the
video because my toddler's and wife came
home they're really loud you probably
hear them throughout the course of this
video unfortunately all right so i will
take the pencil again um next one will
just kind of do you know we're just kind
of following these lines and shapes and
just you know it kind of creates a cool
effect basically so I'll click right
there and kind of end it right around
here
and that happens so I'm going to control
Z to undo get rid of that pathfinder and
it will come out right around there oops
hold alt left click and then kind of end
it right at this corner all right and
then connect it back up I hold shift
select both of these objects we get our
Pathfinder back out and do that all
right so zoom out here and we will I
let's see here we're going to add ah
let's see two more alright so let's zoom
back up man they're loud down there I
hope you can't hear that's very
irritating that's life working at home
with your kids alright so we'll come out
here create one that kind of just goes
right around here so let me click right
on that edge and left-click and pull
drag alt left click and it doesn't
matter the fill right now it's just
we're only concerned about the shape
I'll take this hold shift select both of
them and do that and then just one more
time will come down around here alright
so right around there alt left click and
join up take move tool selected hold
shift and minus front alright so let me
zoom out to see kind of what this thing
looks like I if you hold your spacebar
by the way and then left click you can
drag this around alright so that's
looking pretty good so far let me go
ahead and take both of these and let's
change the color there's a default color
into swatches here sasai this blue right
here leave it at that
take this as well let's go ahead and
group these so hold shift select both
hit ctrl G to group them and I'm going
to make it kind of dark try that I think
that's a probably pretty decent right
around there and let's go ahead and
start working with our The Strokes that
we're going to create so I'm just going
to move things up here now this compound
path I'm going to copy that control C
and then ctrl f and we're going to hide
the bottom one just to kind of create a
copy that you know that we can use in
the future all right so now what I want
to do I'm going to hit ctrl H get rid of
the outlines now what we want to do is
go ahead and give it a stroke now we
want to view our appearance right here
so with the compound path selected we
can see there's a stroke there's no
stroke right now so if we just give this
a stroke and let's see here it's black I
think so we could change that to white
we'll go around five now what we can do
with this stroke area selected we can go
to effect we can go to distort and
transform and then transform and this
comes up so if we select on preview and
we focus here on move if we slide this a
little bit we'll see it only affects the
stroke not the base you know DC there so
I take both of these and kind of just
move them down just a little bit I'd say
that looks pretty good right around
there and then hit OK now kind of have
this cool sort of offset stroke thing
going I I don't want to leave it like
that so what I want to do is go ahead
and go to object path outline stroke
alright so now if we drop this down a
created a group we have the DC right
here and then we have the stroke text or
not text but the outline right there and
what we want to do on group with that
selected we right click ungroup all
right so basically that just takes them
out of that group folder and now they're
both right here so what we want to do is
with both of them selected and they are
we can go to object clipping mask make
all right so that obviously just look
all that good in and of itself I what I
want to do is yeah don't do that that's
not what I want to do I I want to make
this right here this blue will change
that too right now the may go to
gradient here there switch that you go
over there and our layers got hidden
make that white alright so now we change
this to white and now if we bring this
back up we can kind of see that the
stroke doesn't kind of go outside of the
letters okay so now we can cry to create
some more these strokes just to kind of
give you know an interesting appearance
to this text so I what I want to do is
we'll close this up and I'm just going
to duplicate that again so ctrl c ctrl f
and i'll hide this bottom one will come
down here to appearance click on stroke
and this time we can give it may be a
lighter stroke or around three instead
of five and then we will do the same
thing will go to affect distort
transform transform preview I this time
maybe we'll go the opposite direction
and you can just kind of eyeball this
hit okay I do want to make it like a
thinner stroke so we'll go to two all
right and let's see how this looks so
far all right now this one I don't think
we're going to make it a clipping
ask I think what we'll do is take this
color real quickly maybe drop it down
take a mid grey and we will move this to
the bottom actually I want to separate
those though so let's go ahead and hand
go to object path we will go to outline
stroke will delete this portion the
actual text and I get that back up take
this it's not a group because it's only
itself so just ungroup and we'll put it
beneath their all right so let me zoom
up just a little bit so you can see this
a little better all right i think i
might do maybe one more type of stroke
ish thing alright so we will control c
control out that base that initially
recreated the compound path hide this
one we're going to do this one more time
so we'll take our stroke here I let's go
three then we will go ahead and change
this to I I think like a lighter well
maybe a darker blue right around here
and with this selected we're going to
affect distort transform and preview
play with this a little bit I'm not sure
if I want to go out that far
or maybe all right we'll hit okay we'll
do that same thing once again we'll go
to object path outline stroke and then
we will right click ungroup that get rid
of this you still have this all right
now let me zoom out here kind of see
what this thing looks like alright so
you know you can also play around with I
blend modes for the layers kind of like
in Photoshop and after effects I you can
do an overlay and that kind of changes
the appearance let me zoom up here real
quick and I color dodge you know it's
kind of just a matter of playing around
just to see if you like any of these
results what am i doing then I want to
write layer I don't think I am there I
think that's the new one we created so
yeah we go to overlay kind of creates
this transparent thing that you can only
see on the background color dodge that
looks too messy screen lighten color
burn so you can experiment kind of use
what you know you think kind of looks
good and people are being loud
downstairs one second here difference
looks terrible exclusion you you know
whatever you want I think I'm just going
to go to normal you can even just take
the opacity down a little bit or a lot
just to give yourself you know you could
use your arrow keys as well to kind of
adjust these all right all right so
let's go ahead and zoom out so we can
kind of see this full effect that we
have going here and I think that is it
if you need to adjust things around here
first of all we'll lock our layers so we
can only select this and
could hold ctrl or no shift and alt to
scale this thing as you need kind of
position it around and there we go I let
me go ahead and alright so basically I
if you need to usually if you're going
to print this for a you know for actual
print you know and using a print company
usually they would provide you with a a
template file depending on whichever
size you wanted to use and that would
contain the bleeds and edges that you
would need to kind of make sure you I
guess you could say obey I otherwise
when you go to send it to them you know
the print might not come out well but we
didn't use that but pretty much you know
the idea is that we use to design this
you know are there they're definitely
applicable to the process of print
design for posters all right so I check
out design course calm if you haven't
yet and if you haven't subscribe here at
a on youtube do so and I will see you
tomorrow with in all new tutorial all
right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
