today we're going to do the CSS of the
GUI HTML that we did yesterday alright
so if you need access to the project
files of course they're for free and
they're available here at design course
calm and check out these on course calm
if you haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube let's get started alright so
basically I this is where we left off
from the video two days ago and so yeah
let's go ahead and do the CSS to make
everything basically look like this
alright so let's go here alright so
basically the CSS file we are working
with is styled uh CSS and real quickly
I'm going to put in just a comment here
at the couple comments in various places
so up here oops
I'm going to just put in general CSS or
maybe I'll make this global and that
will just be fifty for these two
portions up here this will be I let's
call this step one two CSS and then
right underneath here's where we'll put
main GUI CSS all right okay so basically
the first thing that we need to I start
writing out CSS for is this submenu
right here so that needs to be basically
this color and it also needs some
padding and all that stuff so I let me
get out the color code real quick
alright it's - a - a - a for me and come
back over here in our CSS file
and let me double-click this as well so
I could switch back and forth alright so
basically that is sub - menu that's a
class so we'll put it in background that
color right there and then padding 15
pixels I would say on the top and bottom
and then nothing of course on the left
and right all right so let's also
continue on and now what we have to
worry about is basically the actual
class right here for small - FLD so real
quick and make sure our saved everything
and upload that CSS alright so now we
have to worry about these things right
here they're not looking very good so
let me go ahead and get back to our CSS
and that is a class of small - FLD all
right
and we're put in padding 8 pixels width
is gonna be Auto font - size is going to
be 1 a.m. border - radius is 8 pixels
copy that real quick and border:none all
right and also the I forgot to include
the button
strangely enough because as you can see
here there's no button and yet they're
supposed to be one right here so I'm
going to go into real quickly just put
it right out that HTML on little how or
why I forgot that it's so basically
coming down right after this portion I'm
going to put in
div class equals now I'm gonna make this
it really it would be six but I'm gonna
make this four because I'm gonna make an
adjustment to the width of the other
columns just after I do this so inside
the input type equals submit class
equals small - BTN name equals update
results and value equals update results
alright so I these up here they were two
columns I'm gonna make him three and the
reason being after I found out when I
was doing this beforehand they weren't
just they weren't big enough so so now I
these two are six and then two and four
makes twelve alright so you save this
let's just real quickly upload our
changes alright so now we were getting
there so basically this portion both of
these I want to make a hundred percent
so let me go ahead in terms of width so
let me go back here and I'm going to
just put small - FLD again and just put
with 100% and I'm going to add to this
portion up here small - BTN which is the
button and then also just for in the
future I'm gonna put the button right
here which is the HTML attribute for
these so these are all generally styled
the same alright so now let's go ahead
and did I say that make sure I saved
those changes and just upload CSS here
alright so now it's filled out I the
update results and this stuff got to get
the correct colors so let me go back
here to the CSS
and I'm going to put small - BTN and I
button and I'm gonna make this back
around I already know the color of that
green is gonna be F I mean 7 CC 1 for 2
alright and we're also going to give it
a padding of 8 pixels for top and bottom
and 23 pixels for right and left color
of the text inside needs to be white so
that's the color code for white and then
font size 1 am cursor:pointer because it
was just it wasn't changing the cursor
when you hover it over it so now we can
upload those real quick all right much
better okay so now we have to worry
about this portion right here we got to
change that text and we got to bring it
down a little bit so come back here and
we have to add a class real quick right
here and call this ignore - section and
this will be ignored section of the
class and it's just going to be margin
top 13 pixels and then also we need to
make that text grey so what was that I
think that was um yeah class is grey -
text so to come down here I already know
the color code offhand so it is seven
six seven six seven six alright so let's
go ahead and upload that real quick and
yeah we also have to upload the main dot
PHP because I had that extra class in
there so alright this could probably
stand to be a little bit bigger but
I'm not gonna worry about it for now all
right so now what we need to worry about
is the actual this portion right here
which is gray this is white the
background is white but this needs to be
gray all the way across so I forgot to
add that in when we were doing the HTML
so basically right here before container
12 needs to go div class equals gray -
container and then close it up at the
very bottom as well save that and then
we'll put in gray - container the
background color I already know what
that is so that is Edie Edie Edie
padding we want to give it a lot of
padding on the top and bottom so I'm
just going to put 60 pixels and zero for
right and left and upload that mean dot
CSS and then also I mean dot PHP and
then style dot CSS all right so now if
we go back to the browser we have that
color correct all right so we're almost
there I now let's focus on this portion
all right so let's come back to our HTML
and this of course is let's see
all right so each one has the ID of full
and then this one down here as half for
the ID and then they both have main -
titles for the CSS so let's write that
main - titles font size is going to make
one point 7 p.m. the we want to give us
a margin at the bottom of 40 pixels and
in text we want to indent it because
there's going to be an icon so 35 pixels
for that all right we'll save this and
also when you come up here at the top we
need to add in a bold version of the
font 700 is the weight
and if we upload things real quick
and check out what we have going on
you'll see that we need to make this
part bold all right so let's go ahead
and do that and that's in style each one
dot or just put mean - titles strong
font-weight:bold
and then I all right seven hundred mean
sorry and then also that span which
contains that descriptive text needs to
be a gray color so color and that is 7e
seventy seventy all right so let's go
ahead and upload that
all right so I don't like the way that
looks
yeah it's because I forgot to upload the
main dots PHP because I didn't include
that 700 version all right
I also there has to be a space in
between here I didn't do that in the
HTML so let me do that real quick that
is right here and here all right so all
right the next thing I have to worry
about is the actual IDs of full in half
so I'm gonna go ahead and we need to
save that image or both of those images
so I'm gonna also select layer here with
the move tool we have to right click and
rasterize that control a to select all
ctrl C to copy ctrl n hit enter and ctrl
V to paste and make sure it's a
transparent background so when you go to
file new or ctrl n make sure the
background contents are transparent and
paste that in save for web ctrl shift
all in s is the shortcut key for that
let me get a PNG 24 bit and I'm gonna
come back over here to the correct
project folder and save that as full and
then do the same thing right here so
ctrl D to deselect will select this now
both of these if you take both as layers
and you right click and merge or you go
to control e here's what happens so it
maintains the the shapes but so you
don't want that to happen obviously so
you right click rasterize those layers
with both of them ctrl e and now it will
work so ctrl a ctrl c ctrl n enter paste
and save for web and half very easy all
right so now we have those images saved
what we want to do is come over here and
put in the CSS for that so full and it's
gonna be background URL
images and this is fooled at PNG we
don't want to repeat obviously so
no-repeat and then the position is it
needs to it's going to need to come down
a little bit to match up with the text
so I know this because I went through it
already so usually you would have to
experiment with that so zero is for the
right and left we don't want it to move
at all in that direction but the top and
needs to push down five pixels
all right so copy that paste it half
half and this one's going to need to
also have margin top fifty pixels to
push it away from the three containers
above it a little bit so let's go ahead
and upload this changes so we have the
main CSS our PHP I mean keep on saying
that take those two images put them in
an images folder come back to the CSS
and upload that and there we go alright
so now the next parts you know once we
make a change than one of these gonna
you know make it to also will be done
here pretty quickly alright so what we
want to do is come over here and the
first CSS is to worry about is the
barter container and that needs to have
this one pixel border on Alison needs to
be white so let's go over here
it's barter - container border is one
pixel solid and D 0 D 0 D 0 is the one
is the color I used and the background
is FFF alright and we also have to worry
about the contact container right here
and that needs to be just basically a
grey color and so let's come back
and that is background the color I use
is e 2 e 2 e 2 and we want to padding
around itself and the button so that's
10 pixels for me all right so then we
have to worry about the text which is
class once offers so P once offers and
I'm going to use margin 17 pixels so
basically that's going to push it away
from the edges in all directions and
also I'm gonna make it font-weight:bold
now inside of once offers is a span
which is for this specific text right
there and so we need to put span right
here and let me just real quickly show
what we have going on so far so I'm
going to save that upload that alright
so basically I we need to push it down
we need to size it a little bit and also
mess around with the margin all right so
let's come back over here alright so the
font gnat text transform uppercase right
now in the HTML I did have them as
uppercase but when we get to the PHP
section you know people aren't going to
enter it like that so we can use text
transform to force everything into
uppercase display a block that will push
it down to the second eye line so that's
not floating left of the offer text the
bold part at the font size we're gonna
make it a little bit smaller 0.9 m line
height we're gonna change to 17 pixels
and margin top just push it up or down a
little bit by 6 pixels
also the button as you saw was not a
hundred percent over here so let's
adjust that real quick
button with a hundred percent your
simple all right upload that all right
there we go all right so let's take this
and drag it in and see what it look like
on different viewport widths so far so
good so far so good we can probably make
this later I basically extend a hundred
percent width all right so now I another
thing I wanted to do is add some hover
State for these so all we have to do
real quick oh wait I forgot about this
right here so almost done let me go over
to the class for that was barter data
for that text and just needs text
transform uppercase color is nine nine
nine nine nine six 9s basically and font
size make point 9:00 a.m. and then
margin I'm going to push it from the top
and bottom a little bit by six pixels
and then also I want to add a hover
state for the button as well as small -
BTN hover and background a change to
6:09 f2c alright so its upload that and
then it should be finished
cool all right that is it all right so
