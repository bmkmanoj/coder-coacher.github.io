hello everyone Garry Simon of course
Etro welcome to this brand new 100% free
course that's going to show you how to
build native desktop applications using
something called the electron framework
now this basically allows you to create
these applications for Mac Windows and
Linux and it allows you to do it while
using HTML CSS and JavaScript so in this
video I want to provide you with a real
quick look at the actual application
we're going to be building from scratch
in order to learn electron and also I
want to show you something called the
electron API demos which we'll do first
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on all right
let's get back to it now switching over
to my desktop if we scroll down on this
page which is at github comm electron
forward slash electron API demos you'll
see that we can use git clone to
replicate this repository now the first
thing you're going to need before you
can actually use git is getting stuff
itself at git - SCM comm /downloads
download for your operating system if
you don't have yet have it and once you
do that copy this line we'll go to our
console or command line right click to
paste that here using Windows and then
we're going to CD into it
alright and then we're going to run npm
install and npm start now by the way NPM
is the node package managers which also
means you need node J s which you can
download at node.js org and follow the
instructions by the - all the default
settings when you install it in that
while will by default install NPM for
you so that you can access NPM at the
command line all right and here we are
anna has started the app
vacations so the way this is structured
is on the left side we have the
different sections of where in what the
API can actually handle so first we have
the section of Windows you can create
and manage windows so under here on the
right side we can see that it provides
us with some basic information about
this API and it shows you examples like
so for instance to create a new window
you can click on view the demo and it
shows you a actual window being created
in electron and then also really handy
it shows you the code associated with
this so you can also handle windows and
crashes you can use menus and this is
all stuff that we're going to be
covering you can open external links
communication between two processes like
windows we're also going to be handling
that through the IPC throughout this
course and just some other stuff like
taking a screen shot so this is really
really handy especially after the course
and you want to develop your own app and
you know perhaps I didn't cover
something that you need to know refer
back to this API demos first and then
check Google and Stack Overflow if you
get stuck all right so now I want to
show you the actual application that
we're going to use so I'm gonna launch
it right here alright loading loading
there we go okay so this is the current
price of Bitcoin and as you can see this
is a very very simple interface and we
also see here that we have choose a
target price now by the way this current
price of Bitcoin we're going to access
it by integrating the Axios HTTP library
into our app and this will allow us to
grab it and then every 30 seconds we get
the updated price so notify me when and
by the way check out how this window is
actually opaque also check out how it's
sticky in that if I click any other
thing else it's always going to remain
on top regardless of what's happening so
going back and launching this window
here if I set a price say for instance I
want to be notified when Bitcoin reaches
over
$10,000 which what's really insane about
that it was actually $11,300 earlier
today we'll say 10,000 and then hit
update now we can see what just happened
here is that it communicated that
information from that window back to
this window right here and it's updated
and what's going to happen is if this
ever increases above 10,000 it's going
to give us a desktop notification so if
I make it intentionally really low and I
hit update then the next time this
refreshes in 30 seconds then we will see
this little notification appear so I'll
fast forward until we get to that point
all right there it is we see it showed
up just down here and this is just one
example that will show you how to hook
into native desktop functionality using
electron okay so that's basically it and
although it's a very simple app I
actually give you the challenge of
extending it so that you could perhaps
add more cryptocurrencies to track and
probably a lot of other bells and
whistles but with this alone you're
going to learn a lot I guarantee it
okay so let's get started alright so the
very first thing we need to make sure
that we have and I know I already
covered this initially make sure we have
NPM and you can run that with NPM a - v2
check and also node - V all right if not
make sure you go to node.js org and
download what you need for your
operating system and then reload your
command or console after installing
alright so next let's go ahead and
create a new folder for our project I'm
going to say make door and then Krypto -
app and then also CD into it alright so
now we're going to use NPM to create a
package.json file which will store all
of our project dependencies so NPM and
NIT - why we'll skip all of the prompts
that give you very
questions for these properties right
here alright and next what we're going
to do is install electron itself so to
do that NPM install electron we're gonna
save it as a dev dependency and also
save exact right here so momentarily
this will install and I'll fast forward
alright it's done now I'm gonna open up
visual studio code which I can do from
the command line here with code in a
period and Visual Studio code is a very
popular and you know what it's also made
in electron so it's a very popular app
from Microsoft for a code editor so in
here by the way I'm gonna make this a
little bit larger I want to make sure
you can see everything that I have here
going the first thing that we want to do
is create a new file alright so we're
gonna call a new file here in the root
folder main j/s alright so we'll call
this what really is going to bootstrap
our application so before we get back to
this I want to go to our package JSON
file and there's just a couple things we
need to reference notice it says main at
index J s this needs to match this file
right here so we're going to change that
to main J s and the reason I'm doing
that is to not create any confusion when
we actually create an index page so next
I also want to change this from test and
the value here to electron period
electron period is what you type in
order to launch your app however this is
a shorthand method of just typing NPM
start instead of having to type this
alright so save that and the next thing
we're gonna do is open up a Quick Start
Guide so this QuickStart guide can be
accessed here at this URL electron J
Astle org four slash Doc's tutorial
quicks - start and if we scroll down
just far enough we'll see kind of just
some boilerplate main.js code and this
is everything that we want
you copy just within this code block
right there so I'm gonna copy that we'll
go back to our editor go to main j/s and
then paste it okay so I want to real
quickly just describe what's happening
because I didn't want to have to type
all of this from scratch most of it is
code you will not have to touch when
you're developing your app so first we
have our variables that are defined up
here so we're importing just some
necessary modules such as app and
browser window from the electron library
we're also going to use path and URL to
work with path files and their location
all right so next as you can see we
already have some handy comments right
here which describe what this does here
our function create window nothing
happens here just yet but this provides
us with some configuration options so we
have win equals new browser window this
is how you create windows and you can
pass in objects here an object with a
bunch of properties such as the width
into height there are some other options
that we will also add later on and then
we use when load URL where we specify
the path of the actual template this
doesn't yet exist but we will create it
and the protocol type is files and
slashes true we don't really have to
mess with any of that
we're also I'll have this open dev tool
so if you're familiar with Chrome's dev
tools if you hit ctrl shift I while in
chrome this is the same thing it helps
you do basically debug and code your app
and we can comment this out by the way
if we don't want to see it which we'll
do later all right and then this is
there's some garbage cleanup here if a
window is closed we set when to null and
down here these are all other just three
different things using the on method on
our app and really we don't have to
touch them they're just something
specific to Darwin here which is
specific to Mac OS and you can read
through these comments if you wish so at
this point we can go ahead and just save
it alright and next we're going to
create that index.html
so to do that we'll come over here
index.html all right and we can go ahead
real quickly refer back to that document
which was not right there sorry about
that my toolbar is not working there it
goes
and we can just copy that and then paste
it in here all right
so make sure both of your files are
saved and then we can go back to our
command line and by the way we can go to
view and integrated terminal and we
could just run our commands here with
NPM start alright with any luck and by
the way you can see that we have these
dev tools that are now open and
available for us to use so this is what
this very very basic app looks like it's
using you know it's telling us all of
our information and as you can see very
very very simple ok so now in the next
section we're going to go ahead and
focus on the menu section up here
alright so to this point we installed
our very basic project and now let's see
about integrating an actual menu all
right so if we prefer back here to our
main J's file we can see up at the top
or importing app in browser window we're
also going to import menu alright so
after that when in our function create
window put it just here we're going to
create a VAR variable of menu and set it
to menu build from template and then
pass in an array and then also an object
alright so for this object the very
first thing we need to specify is the
label now the label is what shows up for
instance right here this is a label file
edit selection these are all labels all
right so next we put in a comma and then
we put in submenu and this is an array
so each submenu
is it refers to each of these items like
new file new window open file etc all
right so inside of here it accepts an
array of objects so here's an object
this will be label and we'll make this a
label adjust notification you alright
and we'll go ahead and if you're using
Visual Studio code you can hit shift all
in the down arrow key to replicate this
two more times alright so for this one
we'll change this value to coin market
cap so for instance if this is clicked
we'll make it load up a browser window
with coin market Capcom where you can
browse cryptocurrency values and then
this one will just make exit alright so
next in order to actually make this work
after our menu variable we need to set
menu set application menu and then pass
in our menu variable just above okay so
if we save this and then we go to our
integrated terminal or you can use your
console same thing and run NPM start we
will now say that the default menu that
was here before which shows up when you
don't have one explicitly set now is set
to the custom menu that we just created
so if we click on any of these not going
to work all right so let's go ahead and
continue on with building out this menu
so how would we actually make a menu
clickable alright we clicked it but
nothing happened
well we can detect clicks by just
modifying real quickly this section
right here let's say for instance the
exit very basic command we want to close
the application so let's go ahead and
just organize this a little bit better
so that you can see what's happening
here
I hate when that happens by the way and
a shift and tab that and then tab it
back in okay so just to make things a
little bit better I'll do the same thing
here alright so after label we want
put in a comma and then a click and then
inside of here
you could console.log it for instance if
you wanted to or make it do whatever you
want once a person clicks on that so the
way to quit an application is simply to
call app dot quit and it's as simple as
that so going back to our integrated
terminal at the up arrow key to rerun
NPM start click on exit and voila okay
so also let's see about making this coin
market cap up here launch an actual
browser window so to do that we first at
the top need to import we're gonna
create a constant called shell we're
going to require from electron shell all
right now coming down for our coin
market cap section oops there we go well
put it in the same thing so it's a click
and inside of it will say shell dot open
external and then the URL that we want
to open all right let's save that and
then go back to our integrated terminal
oops I just toggle it off MPM start
let's see click on it and it just showed
up off my screen drag it over here there
we go very very very simple as you can
see and that's one of the great things
about this framework that makes things
you know pretty much straightforward so
let's also create a separator between
these two values the adjust notification
submenu in the coin market caps on a
menu and exit right here so to do this
again very very simple stuff we'll just
put in a space right here after that
comma after coin market caps
object and we put in a new object of
type and then separator and then comma
at the end all right so we'll save this
go back to our view nope I already have
it open and now if we look at the menu
we can see this nice little separator
and this helps you group your content
here for your submenu items all right
great
so coming up here we're also going to
I'm gonna show you really quickly you
know because we only have one menu item
here I'm gonna show you how to define
two or more even though our application
isn't going to have one it would still
be work just to show you how so if we
close this out real quickly we'll see
that we have one object from here to
there with a label and a submenu you
simply replicate that same sort of
structure by putting a period or a comma
after the last object right here or the
first one and creating a new one so the
same thing level label I'll put it in
info and I will just leave it at that so
now if we rerun it I hit control C and
that will terminate it by the way hit Y
and now we have our multiple menus and
that's really just the gist of menus in
this section we're going to take a look
at creating windows but first to this
point we really haven't organized our
project very much because we haven't had
to we haven't had very many files to
work with so I'm going to switch over to
our code editor and I want to do a
little bit of cleanup in a little bit
more of organization instead of just
having all of our files here in the
source section so what I want to do is
create a new folder called source or SRC
we're going to move our index.html into
that now when we do that we have to
update our packaged adjacent file or
actually instead our mas file and scroll
up to this section we
we have index.html on line 16 we want to
change that to source because now it's
in the source folder make sure you save
that there all right so also inside of
here because our application has just
two windows we're going to create
another index or not an indexed file but
HTML file so this will be a dot HTML all
right and also each one of these will
have its own Associated JavaScript file
so that we can place its associated code
inside of it so let's go ahead and
create an index a s and again if you
recall earlier that's why I renamed this
from index to main and then also we'll
have a add a s so hopping into our
index.html here what we want to do is
first I'm going to put in or paste in
rather this section right here so link
rel stylesheet and this is going to
reference a file and folder that doesn't
yet exist so we're going to create this
right now - we're going to create an
assets and CSS folder so we're going to
do this here in the root and so this
will be assets and then also inside of
here CSS and inside of here we're going
to create a main CSS and also an add CSS
all right great
so now going back to our index.html
we're going to get rid of all this stuff
between the body all right and I'm just
going to put in a div class of row and
by the way we're not going to be using
any CSS framework it's because this is
all very minimal a div class of price
container and AP class of subtext and
current BTC USD that's just a label here
and then inside of here we're going to
have an h1 with the
price of ID and I'm just going to put in
loading right here because that will get
replaced once it actually uses inner
text to replace it with the value from
the API this is going to be a gold
container and in here is a paragraph
with an image source and this is going
to be in assets images up SVG and also a
span ID of target price and one second
I'm referring just to some screen off
the side or and we're going to put
choose a target price close that span
and the paragraph as well okay I'm gonna
control B to get rid of that sidebar
alright so by the way I had an extra
closing here so let's see those were
already closed sorry about that
all right so next after that is just a
little bit more of HTML we're gonna have
a div ID of right container this will
hold our button notify BTN and notify me
when and then finally just before the
closing body tag we're going to put in a
script source of index J s which we
created earlier and there's nothing
inside of it all right so we can go
ahead and save this now we won't be
adding any more to that and we're also
going to reference real quickly in our
ad template so let's hit control B we'll
go to our add HTML and I'm just going to
put in real quickly a exclamation point
and enter will give us just some
boilerplate HTML here and so I'm going
to put in I'm gonna paste this real
quickly this is just two linked
references to our main and add CSS files
and then also just from real quick HTML
here I know we haven't touched anything
with creating Windows just yet but I'm
just doing some necessary setup for our
app right here because it makes sense
notify me when btc-e reaches this is a
label and underneath here a div class
I'm going to name this one row two and
then a div right here in an input ID of
notify Val and place holder equals USD
all right and then after this we're
gonna put in a button and this ID is
going to be update BTN with an update
value caption and then also we're gonna
say a ID equals close BTN and this will
be closed window for allowing them to
close that window I'm gonna put a br
right here and then also we're going to
have just underneath here a script
source of add dot j s alright so
everything here is looking pretty good
okay
so let's go ahead and save that and real
quickly I'm going to focus on CSS but
I'm not going to type it all out I'm
going to include a reference file or you
can check out the written version on my
website because each of these tutorials
have a full written version so under
main CSS we're gonna copy from the
written version right here all of this
now there's nothing really special
happening we're importing a custom font
setting up the body and just referencing
all of the elements that I created here
again nothing too technical happening
here and then also we're gonna go to add
CSS and we're gonna paste in another set
of rule sets right here and there's even
for your right here and that just styles
that a little window that pops up when
you click on it
all right so I'm going to save that and
let's go ahead and get our integrated
terminal out and run NPM start with any
luck all right there we go so now this
doesn't yet exist so we need to go ahead
and get that image so if you look at
this address right here we have this SVG
graphic so just pause and it's s three
Amazon Atos comScore cetera tutorial
images in up top SVG right-click and you
can save this to your desktop and I'm
just going to save it on my desktop real
quickly as up SVG we want to go ahead
and real quickly close this and we'll
open up right click reveal an explorer
we're gonna go into assets and create an
images folder and then I'm gonna drag
from the desktop the SVG graphic that I
just saved just right there okay so now
if we go back to the code editor and
rerun NPM start any luck there we go and
now shows up awesome so of course
nothing here loads just yet so let's see
what happens or what it takes to make
this button right here show our add dot
HTML section alright so if we go under
real quickly to our index dot JSP I'm
going to close this out we're going to
go ahead and just import three different
modules so we have constant lecture on
Eagles require electron very simple our
path for working with files and then
also browser window this is what's going
to allow us to create an actual window
so constant our window is electron dot
remote browser window right so next
inside of here just after our cost here
we're going to put in another one notify
beets
is going to give us the actual element
ID and we'll put in notify BTN all right
so that's in reference to this button
right here and then going back we'll say
notify BTN dot add eventlistener
on click then we're going to say
function passing the event and inside of
here is where we want to begin to build
out the window so to do this we're going
to say constant model path equals path
join this is all for allowing us to find
out where that ad dot HTML file is all
right and then after that we're going to
say let win equals new browser window
and we're gonna pass in a width just
like when we created the main index dot
HTML from our main J's file a width of
800 or weight rather sorry about that
400 and a height of 200 so this is going
to be a smaller window that shows up and
then we're gonna say wind on close again
we're going to do that clean up here
when equals null and then wind load URL
and this is where we pass in the model
path and then finally when dot show once
we have it all ready to go okay so now
let's go ahead and give this a shot by
saving it we'll go to view our inspector
or integrated terminal rather
all right then you luck we click on this
and there we go
now do we really need this menu and this
top section right here no so how do we
get rid of that it's actually pretty
simple so if I close this out we're
going to go ahead and right where it
says width of 400 and 200 right before
that or it doesn't really matter where
you put it we'll put in frame property
with the value of false so we'll save
that rerun I'll click on it by the way
that little inspector is getting
annoying so we're going to go ahead and
remove that but now as you can see we
can actually I've no more longer have
this top menu section right here all
right so next let's also see what it
takes to make this window transparent
and by the way in case you're wondering
how I can drag this round there is
actually a CSS rule set in add CSS that
allows me to do this okay so we don't we
can't close it yet and we'll remedy all
that first but let's first take a look
at to see if we wanted to make this
trance this window transparent so this
is two steps involved first we have to
add another property right here of
transparent true and then we have to go
to our add CSS and we have to define
just at the bottom a new rule set of
HTML body with the background set to RGB
a with your color right here and you can
choose to change this if you hover over
it here and I'll change these three
values for you and then also the Alpha
hence RGB a the Alpha we're just putting
at 50% height hundred-percent as well
and it's that fixed a certain issue
where it wasn't working all the way so
now if I were on NPM start and click on
notify me now we could see this really
cool sort of transparent window now I
normally wouldn't leave it like this
because it makes it a little bit hard to
see the content so you could probably
stand
to bump that opacity value up from 0.5
maybe to 0.8 if you wanted to so let's
also take a look at how we can make this
window sticky alright so in other words
if I click on this it's suddenly hidden
but I wanted to stay on top no matter
what so to do that and real quickly
we'll just close this out alright what
we'll do is we're going to add another
property under index GS this is this
property we'll put it just right here
always on top will be set to true
awesome so now we'll rerun this and now
if I click this and I click anywhere
this will always stay on top all right
finally let's see what it takes to close
this actual window all right so we're
gonna go ahead and on our add Jas by the
way we're going to copy the first two
lines from the index.jsp we're also
going to create a new one called remote
electron dot remote and then also let's
get our close button which is the ID of
that little closed window link right
there and then we're gonna say close BTN
add eventlistener on click we should be
getting the hang of this by now pass an
e event and we're gonna say VAR window
equals remote get current window because
we want to close the window that that
link is currently on and then we say
window close so let's save run NPM start
click on our notify button and then
click off of here awesome okay so I I
know that was sort of a crash
there was a lot to cover there so in the
next section we're gonna take a look at
actually retrieving that Bitcoin price
and showing it in our index dot HTML
alright so as I said we now need to
fetch the price of Bitcoin and we're
gonna do that by using an HTTP library
called Axios now this will connect to a
cryptocurrency API it's hundred percent
free it's called crypto care crypto
compare.com forward slash api where you
can learn more about the calls if you
want to extend the functionality of what
we're about to do alright so I'm gonna
switch over here to the desktop and the
first section we're going to go to is in
our source index dot JSP R and what I
want to do now is view up or get up the
view slash integrated terminal and we're
going to install Axios alright so to do
that we use npm install
Axios and we're gonna save it as a
dependency now what we want to do is in
our let's just go ahead and close this
at the top of our index j s file we will
import it so
Axios equals require Axios alright very
very simple so now we're ready to use
Axios to make a request so first before
we actually do that let's create two
other variables the first is going to be
a price and we're gonna say document
query selector that'll allow us to
select just an h1 tag and then also a
target price is document.getelementbyid
and the ID of it is target price alright
so first again this is selecting our h1
and then target price is selecting if we
come to our index dot HTML we have an ID
right here of span ID target price so
this will show the target price that the
user specifies in the ad window alright
so now come in here
we're going to create a function alright
so we'll just do this after this section
and so we're gonna make a function
called get BTC for Bitcoin and the
reason I'm wrapping this in a function
is because shortly after this we're
going to call this function function on
an interval like every 30 seconds so
we're gonna make our get request with
Axios and here's where we're gonna I'm
going to paste in real quickly a full
URL just to get the current price of
Bitcoin and so this is the URL here and
if by the way you're like I mentioned
before you want to see all that the
crypto compare API is capable of then we
go here to crypto compare.com forward
slash api so we have requests in here we
have a lot of different stuff for
instance under data is where you mainly
want to look to get the current price of
something it tells you all the different
request parameters and that it accepts
so the one just to get the current US
dollar right here amount of what a one
bitcoin is worth it is this address
right here okay so after this we say
then take the response and we'll say our
constant of kryptos we're going to bind
the response to kryptos response now if
you were to console.log the response you
would find data BTC USD D that is
exactly what we want so now we've put
price dot inner HTML we're going to say
equals $1 amount plus kripp those and
we'll say to locale string and this will
make it a proper number format with
comma separation okay so now this in and
of itself as I mentioned before it won't
actually run because it's just a
function that's not doing anything so in
order to make this run we have to call
it get BTC and then also set interval
when we'll put in get BTC and the amount
of milliseconds so for three or four
thirty seconds it would be thirty
thousand right here alright so now also
by the way this is going to show the
u.s. dollar amount right here alright so
let's go ahead and run this oops
I ran the npm install Axios one second
npm start there we go alright and there
it goes just showed up so it's currently
nine thousand eight hundred thirty three
dollars and fifty four cents ok so now
that we actually have the price of
Bitcoin now we're going to go ahead and
cover how exactly we can take whatever
is entered in here the target price from
which we want to be notified of when it
when it breaks this price right here
how will we communicate that data from
this window over to this part right here
in the target price section so now we're
going to use the electron IPC which is
an acronym for inter process
communication sounds scary but it's not
basically if you think of processes as
Windows it's allowing communication
between those windows or processes I
mean it's made very easy so the first
thing we want to do is I'm going to
bring up the sidebar here we're gonna
hop into our main J's file this is where
we're going to declare the main IPC so
when it comes to the IPC there's two
different types of processes there's the
renderer which is IPC renderer and then
there's main IPC main we're just going
to declare main once right here in our
main J s are our bootstrapping file and
this is where it's going to receive all
the messages from the various processes
or Windows and it will also send that
data out to any of those processes or
windows as we need it to
so the way we do this is we create a
variable with AI as IPC and this will be
require electron IPC main all right and
at the very bottom let's get rid of this
we're going to put in IPC dot on method
and we're looking for a message that's
called update notify value that's what
we're going to call it when we call the
IPC renderer from our add dot HTML file
so that's the name are going to give it
and this is a name we're going to be
looking for in the IPC main file so then
we have a function which handles an
event an argument and inside of here
we're going to say win web contents send
and we're going to send in something
called and this is where we're going to
define the name of the message target
price of Val and we're going to bind it
to the response which is whatever is
entered into that text field in the add
HTML file so this is going to send that
value to win and win is currently bound
to our index.html file right here back
when we create the window the browser
window all right so it's very important
that you understand this it probably
sounds like an being a little bit
redundant
so this IPC main will catch the message
that's sent from our add HTML right here
and then it's going to send that back to
our index.html so it can be displayed
here where it says choose a target price
so it's gonna replace that inner text
okay hopefully you understand that so
far so let's save that we're not done
yet though because now we have to
integrate the IPC renderer in our ad dot
JS file so let's go to add a s we're
going to say right here it's Const I see
equals electron dot IPC
renderer all right now at the just right
here we'll put in a Const of update B TN
equals document dot get element by ID
and this will be update BTN and we'll
say update BTN dot add eventlistener
on click we will say inside of here
we're going to use IPCC IPC's all right
dot send method and this is where we
name it update notify value and then
document we're going to pass in as the
value is the document get element by ID
and the inputs ID which happens to be
notify Val value now also when that is
submitted we want to close that window
that little add HTML window so we put
our window equals remote dot get current
window and then window dot close alright
so we'll save that and we also have the
IPC renderer that needs to be added to
our index dot HTML so let's copy this
real quick so our index.js file we're
gonna add it right there and then we're
also going to create a we already have
target price and price all right we
don't have to create that then we're
just going to add another IPC dot on
target price val so remember target
price val is set in here right here it's
gonna send this to this window which
happens to be in index we're going to
say function event are just the same as
the last one on the IPC main and then
we're going to set our target
price val - we're gonna put this in
number format the response which is just
a number that the user enters and then
also target price dot inner HTML equals
the dollar sign concatenate target price
I put target rice target price val -
locale string yen alright so okay if
you're a little bit confused that's
natural but I tried to do my best to
describe what's happening it's just a
matter of sending and receiving messages
between these windows where IPC main in
main JJ s is kind of the central hub
from which it sends and then receives
and relays these messages alright so
let's go ahead and save this and if
we're lucky at all it's going to work so
it's go to view and we'll go to our
integrated terminal NPM start alright it
loaded the current price notify me when
we'll say nine thousand eight hundred
and thirty-four just salutely own almost
a dollar above and there we go it has
now been set and this now has access to
it now of course at this point it's not
going to show any type of notification
because we haven't yet worked that in
alright so now the only thing left is to
integrate a notification a desktop
notification that will show up once the
price of one Bitcoin has exceeded the
user specified value and the way we're
going to do this is we're going to head
into our index dot JSP R and first we're
going to create a variable for right
here called var target price Val alright
and this is defined right here on our
IPC on right here
where we save the number to it and next
we're going to create an object called
notification and inside of it we're
going to have two properties title and
it's going to be the title of the
notification that shows up I will just
say BTC alert and then also body and
we'll say BTC just beat your target
price all right so to actually show the
notification we're going to come down
into our response from our API call and
we're going to put an if statement so
we're gonna say if target price dot
inner HTML doesn't equal empty so if
it's empty we're not going to run Ness
or we're not going to show any type of
notification because when the first app
loads I basically it's empty so what we
want to do is put and target price val
is less than response data bitcoin btc-e
USD all right so now we're gonna put in
on my notification this will give us
access to what happens to that
notification we're gonna say new window
dot notification and then we're going to
pass in the notification title and
notification itself alright so let's go
ahead and give this a shot and I changed
the three sec the three-second value to
one just so we can we don't have to wait
around just to see this notification so
now we're going to go to our terminal
type in NPM start and let's change this
to something really low like nine
hundred dollars so of course when this
fires in a few seconds down here there
it goes Bitcoin alert it just beat your
target price awesome so
we can also add a custom icon
notification I'm going to do that we
simply add to this object an icon
property with past the dot join this is
going to give us the location and assets
images BTC PNG and right now you see my
images folder we'll see I have a BTC PNG
file and I got that from all you have to
do is visit this URL right here this is
from icon archive com4 slash download
blah blah blah you see it up here
hopefully and when you do that you can
download it and it's a Bitcoin to ICO
file but you can rename the ICO to PNG
just fine and name it BTC all over KS
PNG and put it in that images folder
right here alright so once you do that
you can go ahead and save it rerun it
set a value right here and we'll say 900
update and now with any luck it will
show up down here that new little there
it is that's great
alright so you can also go a little bit
further with notifications and actually
do a little bit more advanced things
based on the specific operating system
whether that be Windows or Mac so just
to show you real quickly the official
documentation it shows under here for
advanced notifications for under the
windows section you can use what's
called the user land module electron
Windows notifications right here and you
can actually integrate this and it'll
give you usage options and the reason
you would want to do this is it allows
for advanced notifications with custom
templates images and other flexible
elements same thing with Mac OS we have
advanced notifications where you can
even have an input field this is kind of
useful for example if somebody respond
- you have a chat app or something like
that you can allow the user to quickly
reply in the actual notification I'm not
going to cover that in this course just
because this is a beginners course and
we want to do anything advanced or
anything like that
so I may do a separate tutorial though
and you can look for that on my channel
okay so at this point the app is done I
know not very complex but these beginner
courses you know it doesn't make sense
to do anything complex we want to get
your feet wet obviously so now going
forward
in the next and final lesson we're going
to cover how we can create a deployed
build from which you could send other
people and then they can use your actual
executable application alright so let's
go ahead and make our app and actually
deployed app with an executable and I'm
going to show you how to do it for each
of the three operating systems so to do
this the very first thing we need to do
is install what's called the electron
packager so in a project npm install
electron - packager and then save as a
dev dependency and as this installs
we're going to go back to our project
here and it's just finished and - our
package JSON file alright so we're going
to by the way when it comes to you know
the name of your app you kind of wanted
to be whatever you want it to be your
your version your description all that
stuff now would be a good time to
actually fill that in and the section
that we're going to go to in and modify
specifically is under scripts that we're
gonna create a script for each of the
three operating systems to create a
deployment now I must say before I go
any further this right here is a page
when I searched on Google and typed in
you know how did properly deploy a
electron app this is the very first
result that came up and it's very well
expanded on in terms of you know the
manual steps it takes to
you know make a deployment out of all of
these so if I go down all the way here
to shortcuts the only thing we need to
do is just copy this right here within
two scripts close it out and then paste
those three right there
all right so now we have a NPM run
package - Mac package I even win and
Linux commands that we can now run to
install for each one of these now before
you try to run in any of them you'll see
that some of them have certain flags
that are added for instance the icon
it's defining a path like assets icons
Mac icon icns file we also have for
Windows the add the actual icon location
is icons win icon ICO you also see if we
go a little bit further we'll see we
have for instance the product name you
may want to change this section as well
so I'm going to change that I'm just
going to call this crypto app all right
and so just a port the important part to
remember is to have these depending on
if you're making just a you know a build
for all of them or just for Windows in
my case just to demonstrate this make
sure that this file right here exists so
fortunately we can just reuse that other
one so I'm going to save this we're done
in here but what I want to do now is
create that folder and so it's going to
be in icon so let me just reveal an
explorer and make this a little bit
easier so we're going to create a folder
here control-shift-n on windows and this
is going to be called let's see icons
and then win and inside of here we're
gonna go to images we're going to copy
this BTC to PNG go back to icons when
and inside of here we're going to rename
this whole thing to icon ICO that's the
file that it's going to
look for all right so now once we have
all that ready we can now run one of the
scripts so I'm just instead of using the
integrated term it's a little bit hard
for you to see because the text is small
and that so I'm just gonna go back to my
regular console here all right we're
going to run npm run package win if any
luck with any luck
there will be no issues here and while
this is running and it doesn't take that
long
great now it says a wrote new app -
release - builds and then the name
electron tutorial app open up reveal an
explorer here it is here's the actual
app and if we double click this there we
go let's see if this works we'll just
say 300 a real small amount should show
up down here there we go
and it now works alright guys hopefully
you learn quite a bit throughout this I
really I think that this is just a very
good
hopefully solid starting point from
which you can really begin to learn more
so hopefully I was able to provide that
stepping stone alright
I'm Gary Simon of course set row I will
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
