it's sometimes necessary to know when
this happens so it could be a click
hover or a keyboard action these are all
events that you can use to call
component logic within angular so that's
what angular event binding is all about
it's one-way data-binding and that it
sends information from the view to the
component class and this is opposite
from property binding where data is sent
from the component to the view so in
this tutorial let's go ahead and take a
closer look at event binding and how it
all works
so first whenever you wish to capture an
event from the view you do so by
wrapping the event in question with
parentheses so angular provides you with
a variety of events from which you can
call component logic so if you head on
over to the link here you'll see it the
MD n which is the Mozilla developer
Network site we have an event reference
page and these are events that we can
hook in using event binding from angular
and as you can see there's a lot and
it's all structured into different
categories so we have even clipboard
events so some of these you know the hit
ctrl C for copy we can call a method in
a component class and make it do
something we have a ton of different
Mouse events such as mouse enter mouse
over mouse up click double click even so
gives you a lot of power in terms of
creating event binding and calling
methods in your angular app ok so let's
go ahead and give this all a shot in our
own project so I'm just going to
continue from the previous lesson in
this free course and I basically I
gutted out everything in the template
and also everything in the class here so
let's go ahead and create a basic simple
button element so we'll do button and as
we can see we have all these parentheses
and the type of event we're going to
specify is a simple click event all
right so equals we're going to bind this
to a method let's call this my event and
then we'll also pass in and this is
optional by the way an event variable
that will pass along a lot of different
information about this event to our
component class and to our methods
essentially so let's just call this my
button all right and then inside of our
component class we'll create my event
and here inside of it we'll just put
console.log and then event so let's save
this all right I mean we could see I've
used ng served to get our development
server up here at localhost 4200 I'm
gonna hit ctrl shift I just to get out
the console and we click on the button
and there we go so now it provides us
with this object with all these
different properties that obviously you
can feel free to experiment with all
these however you wish and sometimes you
will need access to this information
okay so let's go ahead and try a
different type of event to see if this
same information here fires so let's try
changing this here to Mouse enter which
is one of the events that is ascribe at
the mdn page that we just looked at come
back here to our project so now mouse
enters and there we go okay that is all
event binding is your calling component
methods based on user initiated actions
so feel free to experiment with more
events on your own time so in the next
section of this course we're going to
get started with styling in angular I'll
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
