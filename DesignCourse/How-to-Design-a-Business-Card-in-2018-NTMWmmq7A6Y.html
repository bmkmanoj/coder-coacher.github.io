today I'm going to be tackling a graphic
design type of tutorial in that we're
going to design a business card
now the reason being is my third most
popular video on this channel is
actually a video from four years ago how
to design a business card I wanted to
revisit that topic just to you know
create a new fresh version updated
version of the tutorial and offer some
you know potentially better insights and
new insights for those of you who find
yourself in a position where you either
have to design a business card for
somebody else or for your own business
using Adobe Illustrator so if you fall
into one of those categories are you
probably going to be able to walk away
having gained something with this video
so first we're going to design a
business card and this is it right here
we're not using Photoshop even though I
have Photoshop open here but I'm going
to make the ID actually the logo file
here available so that you can follow
along as we do this I really believe in
you know if you're trying to learn
something don't just watch the video try
to follow along as well it'll help
commit things more to memory all right
so I'm also at the end once we're done
designing the actual vector business
card I'm going to show you how to place
it in this sort of cool 3d mock-up
template and there's a bunch of these
available a lot of different websites
and I'll show you how this works as well
alright so this is basically the final
product and so the very first thing that
you want to consider when you're
designing a business card the very very
first you know consideration would be
alright what size exactly and that's
really gonna depend on who you're using
for you know printing the business card
you're gonna use to some service most of
you are probably going to use some
service online whether that's like Vista
Print or muqaam etc and almost always
these larger sites will have a template
section where you can just download the
template that you need which will have
the exact specifications all worked in
to the file so that's what I've done
here I'm just going to use mood
as an example there are pretty large
site for business cards and printing
stuff like that and they have a template
section and I let's see here so mu size
business card templates if I click on
that and by the way I'll try to link
this right in the description to youtube
video so you don't have to try to find
this page on your own we can see for our
landscape size I mean let me get this a
little bit bigger we can see that for a
landscape size we can we have a dhobi
Photoshop you know PSD files a JPEG you
don't probably will really want to use
that but we see at the top Adobe
Illustrator
which is an AE I file that's the one
that's most ideal to use although you
can use Photoshop if you wish you just
have to make sure that you're you know
working within a large enough file which
this would guarantee if you're using the
template so I'm going to use this one
right here the Adobe Illustrator
template the PDF /ai file so once that
downloads and this is going to say
something about honoring nine slice
scaling of symbols don't show again I'm
just going to have I'm just going to say
yes for that alright so this is what
most of them are going to look like when
it comes to these templates here that
you download from these printer websites
and they're all pretty much gonna have
if they're decent at least this stuff
here around the borders and you have
three different areas you have your
bleed area which is denoted in this pink
section you have the trim and then you
have the safe area which is the dash
section so what do these mean well this
or this particular template tells you
right here about what they are but just
to give you a general gist anything
that's like a background like you have a
background image or you have a
photograph that you want to extend all
the way to the very edge of the card
needs to go into this section that's all
the way basically to the entire canvas
and I outside of this this right here is
the trim line this is where it's
actually going to be cut that's why you
want anything that's supposed to be a
background image or a background color
or photograph you want that to extend
outside of it not right on it because
then you might get white areas on your
edges so you want to go all
we out here and then inside here the
safe area this is where you do not want
to have any type of type or your logos I
mean there's anything that's kind of
important needs to go well inside you
want to give it enough like padding in
margin from that dashed line all right
so with that said this will basically
provide you with that template and you
can here in Illustrator if you go to
layers we can see that you know we have
two different layer sections right here
we have the artwork guidelines which we
can hide and then we have your design
and this is where really you want all
your paths and your type and stuff to
reside inside here so we're going to be
referring back and forth to this just to
ensure that our alignment is all you
know as it needs to be essentially
alright so I'm going to talk of that off
for now and here's the part where it
gets really subjective I when you're
just beginning to design your business
card you have to ask yourself well what
content do I want on it you know I
obviously your business name if you
don't if you're a freelancer you're just
gonna put your name obviously do you
want to have like a slogan or a sub
headline that's a part of your business
name or your name are you probably going
to want a form of contact this is all
very basic stuff but outside of the
content how do you want to actually
design it again hugely subjective but
one of the things that you're probably
want to integrate almost nail like 99
million times is or out of I what a
ninety nine million and one times is
your brand identity colors your visual
identity you really want to reinforce
that that means using your logo using
the colors that are associated with your
brand alright so for me and I'm going to
link this here this file as we can see
it's empty this is the logo here it's
currently white that's why you can't see
it this is my logo for Chrisette row and
if I copy this and by the way if you
have your own vector artwork and you
open up you want to go to me
make sure before you copy anything like
that you want to go to file new document
color mode make sure it's on CMYK first
and then copy all right and then you can
go ahead and paste it because otherwise
if it's on RGB and then you copy and
then you try to paste it it's gonna ask
you if you want to change the document
color settings because the conflict you
don't want to do that obviously you want
to keep it at CMYK um so right here I'm
just gonna drag this up to the top now
for corset row my primary color for my
visual identity is this one right here
and this is actually in my swatches like
if I go here let me see here if I were
to draw a little section out like that
let's see here yeah I think this was
showing up on a different screen there
we go and I I click on this right here
it's our it's a swatch right here and
it's telling me the CMYK values which is
78 7 62 and 0 I if I go back here and
create a new rectangle I'm just gonna
drag out something like that I'm gonna
get rid of the stroke all right and then
right here oh we can see the swatches
are already here so I can just click
that and there we go
so I want to have the logo at the top
and we cuz these are right now two
different things here we've got a group
those right there so control G will
group them and we can see these in the
layers section up here if you don't see
the later hangout by the way you can go
to window and layers and if we expand
this we'll see these all right so I want
to have the logo here I let's see I'm
not gonna have it just like this like if
I take everything down like that while
holding shift and scaling it and going
up around here we'll take both of those
holding shift and drag them up all right
so I could just leave it like that but I
kind of want to have these three little
dots the actual symbol for the logo
right aligned
so I'm holding shift just to expand this
all right so now it says corset row and
then it has the logo are the actual
symbol over here that is right aligned
this right here we can go to thousand
different ways in terms of just
designing and being unique or whatever
for me I'm going to put in a area or a
piece of type that's underneath this
kind of like a sub-headline or like a
slogan so I'm just going to take the
type tool left click once and I'm going
to say full stack dev education full
stack development education it's
basically what the business is about so
if I go to properties I'll change this
to white alright and we'll go and change
the character this font I'm gonna use a
font called Mont Surat I think that's
how it's pronounced and I will just go
to regular alright and this is a free
font by the way so if you go to google
and type montserrat font download you
can find it if you want to use the same
one I like it a lot and let's take down
this size here so I'm just holding shift
and scaling in now one very very very
very important thing I want to mention
right now because we're dealing with
type whenever you're dealing with type
on a business card you want to make sure
people can read it and this is one of
the things that can get you know
newcomers to design and is screwed up so
right now we're dealing with a size and
by the way we could scroll up and down
using the alt and the screw rule will I
right now we're dealing with it's it's
very large on my desktop here and I can
see it and I can read it easily i but
with it being this large this isn't
actually how large your business card is
that would be really large it's like a
size of like a full piece of regular
printer paper right well yeah you can
read it here but can you are you going
to be able to read it when it's the
actual size which may be something more
like this so these are considerations
that you have to take into account so
chances are if you have it large and
it's still
hard to read even when it's large then
it's definitely going to be much more
difficult to read when it's in the
actual format all right so that's just
one thing to definitely know readability
huge another thing to note is when
you're dealing with this important
elements that people need to be able to
read like your type
make sure you have great contrast so in
this example we have this I would say
it's not dark but it's definitely a lot
more contrast than white but so it's
definitely on the darker side anything
on top needs to contrast in terms of
type as much as possible so I made it
white that will give me the maximum
amount of contrast so yeah we may have
the scale right and people will be able
to read it when it's on the business
card however if the color is something
more like I don't know that yeah that's
gonna look like garbage and gonna hurt
people's eyes I'm gonna be able to have
to squint so always try to go for a lot
of contrast you don't necessarily have
to use absolute white but make sure
everything contrasts same thing with a
light background you know you're gonna
make sure you're gonna want it to be
darker or black etc right back up a few
times all right so now we could just
lead this part like this and then put
like contact information but if you want
to do something that's more unique in
terms of design aesthetics then we could
do something like this so if you have
like a general shape that you've drawn
out here in Illustrator you could use
this tool right here which is a direct
selection tool that allows you to select
the actual anchor points and move them
around so we could do something like
that I'm holding shift while dragging
and that way we create just kind of a an
interesting sort of slant on this
containing element right here so it
looks pretty cool we could take it a
step further we could I ctrl C then ctrl
F it and come take the one that's
underneath it because that basically
duplicates it I'm going to use my
keyboard down arrow key alright we'll
change it to me
be a little bit lighter so if I
double-click this come up around there
it's 8-0 lead ECE for the hex value
color if you want to be exact
alright that's kind of cool we could
take the direct selection tool again
maybe move it up you can move this one
down slightly there we go we created a
sort of just cool graphical element
right there for the containing portion
up here and this helps separate really
what is two different parts of this
business card we have okay what is this
business card for and so it has its own
kind of unique aesthetic up here and
then we have secondary information in
terms of who is behind this what is
their contact information so this is
just one way to approach it it's not you
know the end-all be he'll you know be
kind of lame if everybody use the same
type of thing but that's just one way to
approach it so continuing on I before we
continue though let's I'm gonna take
this artwork guidelines layer and put it
all the way to the top so I'm just left
clicking and dragging up here and let's
I bring it back to see visibility so you
want to make sure
another very important eye design
guideline and fundamental to follow is
you want to make sure your elements are
equally aligned so I'm just looking at
you know this dashed line right here and
I want to make sure that you know this
logo and this piece of type right here
have equal distance from the top and the
left portion of this dashed line so
there's more yeah I would say white
space are padding up here then there is
to the left so we can move this over
oning shift and now we have a more you
know equal and evenly spaced composition
here and that just makes things overall
look better same thing right here this
looks actually pretty good for me we
have pretty much equal space so I'm good
with that
alright and everything is looking pretty
good so far we could also see it we have
a fair amount of let me go ahead but by
the way and I hide this part I'm gonna
unlock that just hide this so it looks
like we have a
fair amount of a white space between our
elements and the part where it's
actually going to be cut so that's
important
all right you don't want things smashed
up to this side it's gonna look like
crap okay so continuing on I'm just
gonna head back in and we'll hide that
now we're gonna add some type I in terms
of you know what we want you know
whatever type of information that
they're in you know we don't want people
to know who actually have the card so
obviously it's probably going to be your
name nine times out of ten so put the
type tool oh by the way maybe we don't
have to do that I'm going to just delete
that real quick we could take this one
since it's already the same you know the
type element if the fonts already
selected the weight is and just hit
control C control F hold shift and drag
it down all right so let's go back to
properties here and we'll just make it
black and I'll just put my name all
right Gary Simon we'll put in maybe if a
bold before this all right and then it's
also coming down here
I'll keep it the same layer I'm gonna
put CEO of course cetera comm whatever
and so sorry my throat's been screwed up
for the last like two weeks so let's go
ahead and yeah here's a great eye part I
want to talk about another design
fundamental this year this next section
is called visual hierarchy so what the
heck is that and get that other way well
essentially visual hierarchy is all
about using design to place emphasis and
importance and prioritize the content
that's a part of your design essentially
you know what is most important what do
you want people to see first so if we
look here in relation to the name and
you know who I am or what my role is as
a part of this company
when you see that I they have equal
importance because there's nothing
that's separating them in terms of scale
font weight color etc but clearly my
name is more important than just my role
so one of the things we want to do is
create separation through these elements
and the way we do that is you can do it
several different ways and you can do in
multiple ways
first is okay well maybe that shouldn't
be bold we'll just leave that at regular
alright so now oops screwed that up
there we go
so now we've created a separation in
terms of our visual hierarchy at least
in regards to this element here so we
could see clearly Gary Simon it sticks
out first we see that more but still I
don't think it should be the same size
so let's scale that down so we could
take this size here let's see we'll try
and around six points and that doesn't
look too bad
so let's go ahead and increase the line
height because you don't want them too
close alright that seems a lot better in
my opinion alright great so let's also
add usually as outside of the name and
your position or an individual's
position as a part of a company you'd
also have contact information of some
sort so in terms of you know prior
prioritization and your visual hierarchy
this would probably fall second or you
know in terms of last in terms of being
important almost on the last or the tail
end of things so I'm going to control C
control after that so we create a
duplicate and I'm going to write a line
just move this over here and you want to
use your guides as well we can see the
right side of this is matching up to the
right side of that element alright so
now we could put in something like an
email address so let me
ahead and delete this I'll put in
contact at course cetera comm I'll also
put in a fake phone number all right so
that's two ways of contact and now oops
control C control F now what can go
ahead and maybe put in address so I
don't know for 192 Malibu drive put in
let's see have Beverly Hills 90210
alright and then us okay now it's really
starting to come along and in terms of
again one other way to emphasize visual
heart hierarchy would be we can make the
color of this maybe just more of on a
gray side nothing too light because you
want people to be able to read it easily
but then again I it creates more of a
flow for the design to separate it in
terms of color so now let's bring back
this I artwork guide here and now we can
kind of see how this card is shaping up
to look we have good margin and padding
in white space all around you want to
make sure it's pretty much consistent
across everything we could see that
there's gonna be some a lot of space
down here at the bottom though not sure
if we really want that so we could push
this down a little bit more now there's
equal space between the bottom of the US
and the right of the US as well alright
so that looks pretty good right there
okay so now at this point I'm going to
consider the card pretty much done it
say in terms of designing it but there's
still some other considerations that you
have to take into account so let's say
you're happy with your design you like
how it looks now what well now is the
point where you should probably save a
copy of your
because it has all of the type still
intact now once you've done that and
then created a duplicate we can go ahead
and select everything and we can could
convert all the type elements to
outlines and that's the reason because
the reason for that is because when you
send it off and you have the printers
print it then if they don't have those
fonts it's going to screw everything up
so you want to convert it to paths so
then you can just type in or not type in
but hit the keyboard shortcut ctrl shift
in the letter O so now everything has
been converted to paths you can no
longer modify the type here all right
but now this ensures that who's ever
printing it doesn't need the actual font
okay so now after that the final
consideration before you send this off
or upload it is to hide the artwork and
then simply just save it and you're
ready to go
all right so after that you're pretty
much finished however you can take it
one step further and this is
particularly useful if you're a graphic
designer and you want to showcase your
design work like maybe on behance
it's cool to be able to use these
different mock-up templates and if you
go to google and you type in business
card photoshop mock-up templates or
something like that you'll come up with
a lot of results one such result is at
graphic burger comm they have a bunch of
free different type of templates that
you can use to showcase what your
business card looks like alright so the
one I chose is right here and all you
have to do is just click download and
I've already downloaded it so I'm going
to open it off off screen real quick
and it's I yeah it's a good like 60
Meg's I believe for that one so they can
be pretty large in size and so it's
gonna have a zip file
oops get that back double click this
open that up and here we go so the way
this works is
is make sure you go to window make sure
you can see your layers is you can see
your design here this is a smart object
layer you just double-click it
then it opens up what looks like a new
document but it's really it's a smart
object layer and you can basically put
in anything that you want right here so
obviously we want to import our design
of our business card so there's a few
ways you could do that you can you could
save this you go to file save as and
save it as one of the types that
Photoshop can import me though I'm just
going to print screen it because I'm
lazy so if I go to a hault print screen
I copy everything in this current window
and paste it and then put it maybe right
around here and then save it we go back
there we go and that is the business
card so you could do that same process
that's basically how all those Smart
Objects work this templates in those
mock-ups alright so hopefully you guys
learned a lot I know it's kind of
rambling there but I really wanted to
try to you know reinforce the concepts
that you really need to adhere to if
you're designing a business card and you
want it to be effective so just to
reiterate when you're designing your
business card you want to make sure you
follow a few of these design principles
so the first one is readability which
means you want to have great contrast
between your foreground which would be
your type and your background so if
you're using a light background darker
and trying to make it you know you want
your text to be dark as possible and
vice versa obviously outside of that
size you want to make sure that you
could definitely read you're gonna be
able to read what's on your business
card especially the type and also visual
hierarchy try to separate your design in
a way that makes sense using visual
aesthetics like size eye color
and scale and position as well alright
