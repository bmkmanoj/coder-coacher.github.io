net and design course comm and today we
are going to design this heart graphic
and first if you're watching this on
YouTube and not on the actual tutorial
page on my website make sure you check
out the link in the description below so
you can view the full tutorial because
this video right here is only the second
part in a four-part series on t-shirt
design okay so I'm going to click out of
this and we're going to go to file new
and set the width at 700 the height by
500 points and hit OK going to hit
control one just so I'm at a hundred
percent here and to start off we're
going to go to view show grid and then
view snap to grid now I'm going to take
the magnifying glass here and zoom up a
couple times and I'm going to take the
pen tool and I'm just going to select
right here on the center point and then
I'm going to go up about three grid
points and you may not be able to see
this depending on the video here and I'm
going to drag out around three points
and then somewhere around right here I'm
going to drag out a few more and then
right around here a lot another point
now we want to mirror this eye so we
have to be sure that we are on the same
points here on the grid
actually in one second and then what we
want to do is end up right around here
and then we will take the direct
selection tool and adjust this up one
now if we select this you want to change
stroke up here and try six alright so
that looks pretty good to me
to start off with I actually I may want
to change it to eight because we want
these to be nice and thick I'm going to
scale this up holding shift and the Alt
key and because I've done that we need
to make it even thicker all right that's
good alright so now I'm going to turn
off and hide the grid and turn off snap
to grid so now what we want to go to do
is go to object path outline stroke
alright so there's one area real quick I
want to clean up so I'm going to zoom up
here and just drop that a little bit you
may or may not have to do this okay
all right so right here if we click down
here I and extend this in our layers we
have a group right here in this
background right here we want to change
to a red ok so now I'm going to zoom up
and first we're going to select the
black outline here and we're gonna
change it to a dark brown sorry take the
direct selection tool and then change it
to dark brown now we're going to take
the pen tool and we want to take this
thorn probably right around here and end
it right around there now if you've
never used the pen tool sometimes it
does take a little time to get used to
and you can do a search on how to
effectively use the pen tool and there's
tons of tutorials out there but it is
one of the tools that I use most ok so
we can adjust it a little bit more if we
want alright so now we want what we want
to do is add some of the thorns coming
out up around this area here so I'm
going to zoom up more and you can add
these however you want and wherever you
want I'm gonna make them a little bit
jagged
and maybe just one more right here
all right so now I want to add some
highlights to this so I'm going to
select just a lighter brown and then
take the pen tool
well first I'm going to zoom up just a
little bit more take the pen tool and
try to follow up the actual contour of
this thorn
now when I do that I'm holding I'm
holding the Alt key and then just
clicking once because otherwise if we
leave that there and we try to go up
here you see what it does and then we're
just going to end it right around here
now I'm going to take the opacity and
just turn it off all the way to zero and
then come around here turn it back on
and we can want to come straight down
here now we can adjust it a little bit
more and make it kind of flow better
with the direct selection tool and we
can just move these around a little bit
okay
so we can add a few more
I'm going to add one starting right here
on the inner side of the thorn now I'm
just hitting ctrl Z when I I want to
undo something just click back on there
now I'm going to hold alt here on this
one and just drag out a little bit
because I don't want to go quite as far
as it was okay it's it control one to
zoom out and I want to add a highlight
over here start right around here
and end right around here so we're
assuming the light source is coming out
from from the upper left and this just
gives the design some feeling of depth
now if you see here how it kind of goes
over the other line you could take the
direct selection tool and just drag this
in a little bit all right control one
okay so now the next step is creating
kind of a shadow as if this part of the
thorn is coming up over on top of the
red heart area right there so let's zoom
up and we're going to take the let's see
a dark brown right here and we're going
to start right there at the very tip and
we're going to drag out right around
here following this area and then end up
right around there all right then we're
going to come up
and then end it right here so now we
want to drag this layer down further
here to right there right in between
that initial group that was created and
I'm gonna control H to get rid of the
line view and wrenching the opacity down
here to something to something pretty
light like that actually I don't want to
use the opacity I just realized so what
I'm going to do is change this to a
hundred percent and then we're going to
experiment with actually getting a solid
color without having to adjust the
opacity here so let's see here
take here and just use a darker red
color and a double-click on that and
maybe just make it a little bit darker
okay that's better
all right so let's add two more for the
shadows of these specific thorns right
around here
and that looks pretty good so we have a
couple more to do I want to do one on
this inter RIT edge right there and
we'll start right around here and we can
just quickly go over here connect them
bring this layer down right around there
hit control one and then one more
finally underneath this thorn and we'll
just go through right around here and
drag that down so right around here
actually up it down further here okay
troll whine all right so now the only
other step left is to add the blood and
I'm going to use this same color and
zoom up take our pen tool I'll hit ctrl
H so we can view the actual path
and we can adjust this a little bit more
and then for the puddle of blood at the
bottom we'll just create some type of
random spatter shape here and then we'll
take and hold the Alt key with the move
tool and we'd hit shift to scale up a
little bit more control one and there we
go that is our thorn in the heart idea
for the t-shirt and that's all that's
involved in creating this vector graphic
here in Adobe Illustrator so go ahead
back to the tutorial if you're not on my
site and you can continue on with the
third and fourth step okay so if any of
you have actually followed along go
ahead and feel free to share your
attempt at making this and also if you
decide to go forth and follow the full
tutorial and try to attempt to sell your
t-shirts and make money out of a t-shirt
business share that as well alright
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
