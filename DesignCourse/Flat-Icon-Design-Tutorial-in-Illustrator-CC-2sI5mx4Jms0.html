design course comm and today we're going
to focus on flat design and we're going
to apply that flat design trend to an
icon so flat design is a pretty popular
trend among designers in the last few
years and so you're going to see i
basically all that goes into creating
something that you could be considered
flat so we're going to get started in
adobe illustrator but first as always
visit design course comm and put in your
email at the top and you'll receive all
types of goodies in the future and also
visit the link in the description for
the project files alright let's get
started okay so to get started we're
going to go ahead and go to file a new
and the new window will come up here and
for the width I'm just going to specify
800 and the height I'm going to use 600
and you can use whatever kind of fills
up your screen at 100% so you may have
to experiment with that and there's 100%
for me by hitting control one I so let's
go ahead and get started let's take out
our rounded rectangle tool and we'll go
ahead and just click once and that
brings up the rounded rectangle dialog
box and so for the width I'm going to
use 512 and the height 512 as well and
for the corner radius we're going to
leave it at 80 and that happens to be
the dimensions for a iOS app icon so
this doesn't necessarily have to be for
an iOS app icon but this is just going
to be the container that we're going to
use to hold the actual icon so right now
I have a stroke on here so I'm just
going to hit 0 on that and I'm going to
scale this down just a bit actually I'm
not going to do that going to leave it
at there for now I'm going to do is just
going to give it a blue color right here
and for this particular icon it's just
going to be
for a chat message or blip or whatever
you want to call it now ordinarily if
you were going to create an icon you
would create other icons so you can
create an icon set to either sell or
give away for free I but for this
tutorial we're going to focus on one
just to demonstrate you know what flat
design is and how we can integrate it
into our designs alright so next thing I
want to do is create another rounded
rectangle and we'll leave it right
around here and I'm going to give it a
color I will leave it I think right
around there is pretty good I and I'm
just kind of for now just eyeball
placing it in here and then I want to
use the pen tool and I'll just select
right here along this edge hold shift to
give us a perfectly vertical line and
then hold shift again to give this a
diagonal line so now we can go back to
the move tool and we see that I position
that pretty well and we can adjust it
further if we wish I think that's pretty
good so real quickly if I just take
everything and hold shift and scale it
down we can see how it scales which
everything looks pretty good off the bat
so I'm going to end do that alright so
now I'm going to put three lines here
which will just basically signify I
messages so we use the Rabb rounded
rectangle again and we'll start right
around here and just drag out to right
around there then we'll make this white
all right so let's go ahead and hit ctrl
C and then ctrl F and hold shift and
drag down the copy and then we'll do the
same thing one more time alright so
let's go ahead I'll take everything
again and we will just scale that down
by holding shift just to see how it
looks and that looks pretty good I think
we can make an adjustment or two so I'm
going to undo I'm going to select these
three I'm going to drag them over to the
left just a little bit
and down just a tad bit alright so
pretty good so far so basically we
really could consider this a true flat
icon I because it illustrates exactly
you know what type of icon this is you
know what it means
and basically this is simplicity at its
finest so we're going to take it a step
further a couple more times so let's go
ahead and in my layers I'm going to just
drag this up and I'm going to drag it
down here what I want to do is go ahead
and take all these select all the layers
and hit ctrl G to create a group and
then I'm going to ctrl C and ctrl F to
duplicate that so now what I'm going to
do is just hide the bottom one so we
only have this one here to work with so
for what we're going to do for this one
is create a long shadow which is a part
of flat web design trend so you'll see
what I mean
let's go ahead and we will ungroup by
right-clicking and now we will take this
blue background container hit ctrl C and
then ctrl F to duplicate it and you'll
see why we're doing is just in a second
so let's take the pen tool we will
select right here hold shift and we'll
go along the edge and probably right
about here and then hold shift and
select right here now that I was kind of
off so I'll have to do is switch switch
to the direct selection tool and we'll
select this point hold shift select that
point hold shift and we'll move that
down just so it meets that edge alright
so now what we want to do is take the
layer right here and this layer I'm just
going to move it off-screen right around
there and then what I want to do is I'm
going to move over real quick we have to
make sure before we do this that we
connect these two with the pen tool all
right and then we can go ahead and
select this portion we can go to object
path divide objects below so what that
does is takes that single
half that we created and kind of
intersects this background so now what
we want to do is take this and delete
that and now we can come back over here
hold shift and drag this over and now we
can give it a color
so I'll go ahead and we'll bring out let
me move this over I'm going to go to
gradient I'm going to double click this
over here for our foreground and then
just make it slightly darker all right
I'm going to put this back up here and
then I noticed an issue I kind of didn't
account for that we could kind of see it
right there so the fix is real easy I'm
just going to add a point so we left
click drag and specify add Anchor Point
tool and we just put one right there and
then move this up alright so I that's
the long shadow I'm what we can do to
see how this works we can hold shift
scale that down and I think that's
pretty good if you really wanted to
adjust the opacity you could do that
easily we could try 70% I think that
works a little bit better it lightens it
up alright so now I go back here we want
to take everything and hit ctrl G to
group that as well so now we have our
two different icons let's go ahead and
take it one step further and hit ctrl C
and then ctrl F and we'll hide this
bottom group and then we'll right click
and hit ungroup okay so this time we're
going to create some soft gradients so
let's go ahead and get started we'll
choose this layer right here and we will
go to gradient and we'll go to linear or
type so now we're going to hit G and
we'll hold shift and click all the way
down and then we want to take this first
color stop and we'll make this color and
then we'll take the next one and make it
that color it's just slightly darker
alright and let's go back to the move
tool now we can also do that with
the shadow so select it and go to linear
and then hit G select right around there
and just hold shift to create a diagonal
gradient and we can reverse this real
quick and what we're going to do is take
this last one we'll make it the color
that's over here and then just the
opacity will turn down to zero and then
we can go ahead and take this one and
make it quite a bit darker or maybe
around there and then we can also adjust
this if we wish all right and then
finally we can take these two layers
holding shift and hit ctrl G and then we
can create a gradient on these as well
so hit G hold shift scale down and then
we can bring this back here let's bring
this up to 100% and let's choose a color
like around here and then we'll go back
to the first color stop and we'll choose
and say maybe around there that's the
same color something like that looks
pretty good alright so there you go now
what you would do once you have these
all done if you wanted to provide the
icon set in these three different styles
then what you would do is you would just
go to file you would go to export and
you would save these in PNG 24 so I what
I'm going to do real quick is select all
these again hit ctrl G and then we can
go ahead and take all these I get them
all out invisible and we'll select all
them by own shift and hold shift and
we'll scale down just so we can see the
three of these right now so we'll take
this one over here take this one right
here and there you go
we have three different styles of flat
icon designs alright so if you haven't
go ahead and visit design course comm
and subscribe yeah hopefully if you
already got the resource files that's
great so I tilt Amaro I'll see you again
alright goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
