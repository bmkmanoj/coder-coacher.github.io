interface to generate an angular project
by default it's going to set the project
up to work with standard CSS so if we
run or at least type it out I'm not
actually going to execute this ng new
your project name and hit enter
you'll see that by default it will set
up the project just to work with
straight-up normal CSS now if you wanted
to set it up so that you can use the
power of sass then we add the - - style
equal isn't binded to SAS or scss and
then when you hit enter it's going to
structure the project to work with sass
which is a preprocessor which has a lot
of different handy features that
standard CSS simply doesn't have so if
you're working with a bigger project you
can use s CSS which I personally like to
use and it will help your CSS code as
you're writing along now we already
started a project from the screen
angular for course so I'm just going to
CD into it and then I'm going to run and
you serve okay so this is the code that
we had from the previous lesson that
we've been working on and I'm just going
to quickly get rid of everything in the
template and we don't need this event
down here as well okay so when you use
the angular command line interface to
generate a project by default it will
set up your components to work with
external CSS stylesheets
so whether you're using inline or
external CSS they're both defined within
the component decorator right here okay
so an external stylesheet is defined
within the style URLs property right
here maybe as you can see it's linking
to a specific file called app components
CSS and this is what the command line
interface generates and by default this
is blank this is where all your CSS rule
sets will go all right so
I this way all the CSS that is specific
to this components template will be
placed in that file so it's useful when
you're dealing with a lot of CSS and you
don't want your CSS cluttering your
component code now should you prefer to
write inline CSS within the component
decorator itself you have to change the
style URLs property to styles and then
we can remove this right here and if we
want to run or allow yourself to write
multi-line CSS we use backticks
which is the tilde key and then our CSS
rule sets will go right here so we'll
create one for h1 we'll make this
text-decoration:underline and also we
need to designate an actual h1 tag
appear in the template and we'll make
this hello
we'll save it and there we go we can see
that it is underlined so again to recap
like HTML you can choose to write your
CSS in line through the Styles property
but it's usually best to keep your CSS
in an external style sheet so that
things are kept more organized
especially when you have a decent amount
of CSS rule sets okay so in the next
lesson we're going to take a look at
class binding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
