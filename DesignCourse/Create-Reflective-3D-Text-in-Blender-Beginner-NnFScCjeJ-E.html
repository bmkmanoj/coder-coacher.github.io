today is January 12th with our twelfth
video of the year and we are going to go
back into blender today for a second
blender 3d tutorial and for those of you
who are unaware blender 3d is a free
graphics application and you can
download for free at blender org and
it's very small very lightweight 50 60
megabytes very quick installation and
today we're going to be focusing on
playing around with some 3d text and
materials so if you're a beginner this
would be perfect for you I so as always
check out design course comm and also
please I download the project files if
you wish for free then they're available
down in the description below this video
all right so let's get started okay so
the first thing you want to do is make
sure you have blender actually installed
so you go to blender org and you can
download it it's entirely free it's a
very light download something like 50 or
60 Meg's the installation is very quick
as well and when you first load it up
this is what you'll be presented with
now if you've never used blender before
of course I will just go over some very
few basic things first to select an
object you just right-click it not left
it's right so we can select this camera
blah blah blah we can select multiple
objects by holding shift like any other
application and if we want to move
around into 3d scene we use our middle
mouse button like this and if we want to
zoom up we use our scroll wheel and if
we want to pan the view just hold shift
and your middle mouse button so if
you're new to this you know it just it's
a matter of practice and making it
become muscle memory so you can move
around quick and do what you need to do
so the first thing we want to do is get
rid of this default cube they always
load it up it's always the default scene
when you go to file new so just hit
delete and enter now what we want to do
is hit add mesh and plane and then hit
s4 scale so we can scale it up as large
as we want like this or we can enter a
number
value so if we put in 20 it'll make it
pretty large or if we put in ten at the
size I think that's what I want to use
so we'll do ten and now what I want to
do is kind of get in here and adjust
this right side and we're going to
extrude it a few times so here's what I
mean I first hit five on your number pad
and that gives us into orthographic view
instead of perspective view it makes it
easier to work with things and then I
want to go into edit mode so you hit tab
or you select edit alright so now we're
able to actually modify the form of this
object of this plane so what I want to
do is I on our number pad hit the number
1 that will give us in the front view so
what I want to do is take just this
right portion over here so I'm going to
slightly move up and then I'm going to
select in edge mode so you have three
different modes you have your virtus
where you can select individual vertices
or you have your edges where you can
select edges or you have faces where you
can select the whole face so we want
edge mode and we want to right click on
that one over there now hit 1 and I'm
going to pay on the view and I'm going
to hit E now ii basically means extrude
so when i hit e we can see we've created
a new face basically off of this thing
so we're basically working with the
shape and molding at how we want so i'm
going to get back to one i'm going to
hit again
actually no i'm going to go back a
couple times i want it to gradually
taper off or taper up rather and then
finally hit again and then we're going
to make sure it only moves on the z-axis
by hitting a Z key and then just going
up a lot all right so that kind of
creates like a backdrop for our text
that's going to go over here so now what
I want to do is just go to shading down
here and hit smooth
so we want to hit a and then a again
select all and then hit smooth okay now
let's get out of it mode by hitting tab
and let us go ahead now and add our text
so shift a will bring up this menu so
add text and it lays it flat down on the
ground at first so what we want to do is
hit our X 90 so we're just rotating it
90 degrees on the x-axis all right so
kind of have everything flipped around
here if I hit R and Z will get that
position how I want it to so all right
there we go all right now what I want to
do is take our text again we're going to
hit s and scale that up quite a bit
around here we're going to go to edit
mode and then just hit caps lock I'm
going to use DC you can use whatever
letters you want DC for design course or
whatever and then we're going to hit
edit again okay so now at this point
what I want to do is drag this out over
here and go to our type section and I
want to take extrude up to around for
our 0.4 rather and I also want to take
depth up to around 0.19 or 0.02 whatever
and then I also want to offset it just a
little bit we do not want these touching
in the middle so if I sit one yet we see
they they don't touch that I want to
look more space between that because I'm
going to make these solid so drop this
down maybe to right around there okay so
the offset just kind of makes it the
path a little bit bigger or the text
rather okay so now what I want to do is
go ahead
and convert this from the text mode to
an actual mesh so if you're familiar
with Photoshop and you probably are you
know how you have a text layer and it
whenever it's actually editable and
reeking you can change the text that's
means it's a type layer so if you want
to work with it more than or distort it
or whatever then you have to either
rasterize that later or you have to
convert it to a shape layer but then
that means no longer you can add the
text well it's the same thing for it
with this 3d application so to do that
we go to alt C and we'll go mesh from
curve
I've made a slash serve slash text all
right so now when we go into edit mode
by hitting tab will no longer be able to
edit it so it kind of just converts it
to a wireframe here so I now what I want
to do is now this part is going to be a
little bit tricky first let's go back
into edit mode by hitting tab let's move
everything up a little bit all right so
now everything's all in view that's C on
there is just barely touching all right
so we're going to go into edit mode
hitting tab and now I want to select
only these edges that go all the way
around and inside same thing with the C
so we're going to hold shift and alt and
right click so when you do that it'll
select a portion of them I hoped it
would select all of these at the same
time but that's not the case you just
have to select some of the ones that are
deselected and then do that again so
holding shift and alt so hold shift alt
and again and you can see it didn't
select all these all right now it looks
like it selected everything I want on
the D that's do same thing with the C
hold shift alt and right-click
so basically as you see I'm just trying
to select the ones that don't look like
they got selected all right so I think
that is nope those up there didn't get
selected there we go okay so now I have
everything selected now I just want to
take these all and push them back so the
way we will do this is we'll change our
view from solid to wireframe so that
lets us see everything a lot easier and
then just take this green Y arrow move
it right around there so if we hit seven
and we pan our view we can see how thick
these letters are and help back for our
back we push that in it doesn't have to
be exact but just so it's reasonably
pushed in okay so now we're going to go
into tab and our object mode and go back
to solid and now I want to set up our
camera real quick so we're going to hit
the zero on the number pad and I'm going
to change something real quick so we'll
go to view properties and lock camera to
view and then go to view properties
again to hide that and now we just want
to set up our view for the camera so
first I'm going to take everything and
move over here because I don't want to
get that edge
I want the whole backdrop to be visible
all right and then I we're going to go
over here first up here I'm going to
change the cycles render and then we'll
click on the world and this will allows
us to change the background color right
here so we can make it white and then
let's go ahead and now we're not
obviously no we're not done yet we still
have a couple things to do but just to
give us an idea of what things currently
look like before we render we going to
go down here just to sampling I'm going
to change the preview to 100 and the
bird the render rather 100 in the
preview to 100 as well and then just
come up here I'm going to be using a GPU
compute it makes it a lot faster for the
rendering and we're just going to look
and see what we currently have going
here remember there's no materials
applied it applied yet and so that's
going to really change things up so
alright so far so good so I'm going to
hit escape out of there and now what I
want to do is get out of camera view by
hitting 0 on the number pad again and
what I want to do is assign a material
to this so with it selected we're going
to go to new and we're going to select
glossy if we can find that here right
there and the color I'm just going to
change to blue all right so now let's
see what happened when we made that
change it's not going to be very
impressive okay nope not at all so now
what we want to do is give it some
depths because right now everything is
there's there's no it's not solid at all
it's very flimsy I guess you could use
as a term I so we want to go over here
and click on solidify and I want to take
the offset to around 0.2 for
all right and then you'll see that
probably will change things quite a bit
but first I want to add an omission so
what we'll do basically basically an
admission will be it's like it's like a
light source and it just gives us a lot
of light so we can do that by adding a
plane hit in our X 45 just so it's kind
of facing the text and then we'll go to
the materials and change this to
emission and then we'll give it a
strength strength of 10 all right so
let's go over here to render and as you
can see we have a pretty cool very
complex glassy looking result so this
could be used for any number of purposes
or reasons I so that that texture was
just one quick way to make something
that looks just really crazy but just to
show you how easy it is if you're
beginner to play with these I click
right here will create a new one and
we'll call this new and we can just
change the surface these are all
different types of services surfaces
which you can experiment with i we can
use a mix shader'
which allows you to add to these
surfaces at once and this allows you to
control the percentage of which I get
shown more so well we can do that and
we'll choose diffuse for the top one and
then we can choose real quick I glossy
for the second and then if we go over
here and change this to rendered you
know damn it I should have closed out my
instant messaging service it's my wife I
am in a downstairs anyhow you can see
now it becomes like a solid eye color
because they're both white but if we
change this
maybe to blue and change this bottom one
here to maybe like kind of like a
purplish color then it really changes
the look of everything right away so if
we wanted to render this with our render
camera view we can see now that we have
something that looks really cool I so
obviously you know being able to use 3d
and in a true 3d environment not just
photoshop I you can see that we can come
up with something that looks pretty cool
for 3d text for any you know if you've
ever commissioned design a poster or
something like this then there you go
now also if you want to make this a
little bit better looking so you can see
it's like a little bit grainy I guess
you could say well in our render
settings we can take this render change
that to like a thousand the higher it is
the better it's going to look and then
we can hit render and also another thing
I'm going to do I'm just going to hit
escape we can change the eye let's see
here yeah
the tiles right here those little tiles
that you saw so I'll show up I give you
changes to 56 for example hit render a
little bit bigger and now we're using a
thousand samples so it will take a
little bit longer but obviously the end
result it does look better and I'm just
going to pause it until it's done and
that's what that looks like and then
just finally I want to go back to the
other material that we had and I'm going
to right click this get back into solid
view and I think it was material 0:02
that we used no it was not sorry if is
this glossy right here and render that
out with the higher settings I'm going
to pause this again alright and that's
what that looks like so I hopefully I
learned a little bit something
you know I'm just getting into 3d myself
so I'm using this time in which I've set
forth that goal to create a video
everyday for 2014 just to kind of
showcase what I'm learning and hopefully
you guys can learn from it too all right
so I will see you guys tomorrow with an
all-new tutorial make sure you check out
design course comm eye there may be
courses up available now depending on
when you're watching this but at the
time of recording nothing is up there
yet although you can put in your email
to be notified of when I do release full
courses alright I'm Gary Simon and I
will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
