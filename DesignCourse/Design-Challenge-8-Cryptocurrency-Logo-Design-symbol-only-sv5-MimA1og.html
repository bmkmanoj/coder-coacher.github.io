Gary Simon here and wow I just finished
two courses which have deadlines like
this and three days of each other for
two other networks so therefore that
explains my absence on my channel for
the last week or two but I'm all done
fortunately and now I'm looking to plow
forward with a lot of new content here
in the coming weeks so for today we're
going to start a brand new design
challenge we just concluded one about a
week ago I only had five men trees but
I'm pretty certain we're going to get a
lot more this time around so this design
challenge if you head them over to
Corsica comm and click on challenges at
the top is to design a symbol for a
cryptocurrency service alright so most
of you probably know what
cryptocurrencies are but if you've heard
of Bitcoin
that's a crypto currency now there are
currently over like a thousand other
cryptocurrencies out there in fact if
you go to route see right here
cryptocurrency marketplace this coin
market Capcom you can see I think they
have close to a thousand listed out here
anyhow so going back here and get rid of
this stuff I put this challenge you're
tasked with designing just a symbol
slash icon slash mark whatever you want
to call it for a fictional which means
it doesn't exist cryptocurrency service
so this service is simply one that will
send users a notification via email text
message instant message whatever when a
given cryptocurrency rises or falls in
price so the theory behind this fake
service that does not exist which it
might be but it's not mine I usually can
sign up they can say okay I want to
follow litecoin or Bitcoin or multiple
whatever and if this particular
cryptocurrency falls above or rises or
falls below or rises above a certain
price then send me a message whatever I
so think of it as a logo without any
type so no word mark I don't want to see
any letters so the requirements are let
me increase this a little bit combine
the ideas of currency which is money and
messaging into a scene
a simple symbol so I can't stress simple
enough we'll get to that though
and then also upload at least a 500 by
500 pixel concept and upload only one
concept now my system won't let you
upload more than one entry but don't
combine multiple concepts into the same
document that you uploads just one
concept per person I want to keep it
simple and fast for myself to be able to
rate I so all so as always submit with
good design principles in mind so the
whole purpose of these challenges to
help me help you get better at design I
and it's usually a lot easier if I can
try to just negate some of these issues
before you start designing so use good
white space which means give your
elements or your lines in your symbol
etc room to breathe don't clutter them
all up into a big mess remember you're
low your icon or your logo if it's
scaled down to a really small size say
like 40 pixels by 40 pixels you still
want to be able to see what it is
all right so use good color good
contrast use visual hierarchy and use
simplicity of course you go here and
read all these specifically yourself of
course I've put some inspiration about
what I would consider good symbolism I
just went to dribble net and ah or
dribble calm and just grabbed a few and
put them up here so you can click on
these and you know just get an idea for
what I consider I think objectively what
most other people consider good icons or
symbolism all right so again we're
combining two ideas into one symbol the
one idea is currency or money or digital
currency and the second is messaging so
that is your task and whoever wins I
they will win one month of course cetera
Pro which you know if you click on it I
gives you details about how to join and
what that gives you access to all of my
courses down here I and you'll see some
are pro only which means you need to be
a member some a lot of free but yeah
that's that's what the winner will win
and the way I choose a winner if you're
new to this is I basically when the
deadline is up which is two weeks from
today
happens to be August 3rd then I go on
YouTube live and I go through all the
entries that are submitted here and I do
a live review and then ultimately I
choose who will be the winner all right
so I'm looking forward to the entries
and I will see you guys soon along with
that new content and tutorials and
courses and all that good stuff alright
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
