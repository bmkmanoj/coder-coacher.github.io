this 100% free brand new course on
learning bootstrap for by example
now why learn by example well personally
that's how I really learn best I don't
like those courses they're all
fundamental based and then last for
hours I like to learn by example and to
actually learn by doing so what we're
going to be doing is first outlining you
know how do we integrate bootstrap for
and its various ways to do that and then
throughout the rest of the course we're
just going to learn by doing and it's
going to really give you a lot of
confidence going forward alright so in
this initial part we're going to go
ahead and do a preview and a look at the
project that we're going to learn how to
build with bootstrap for all right let's
get started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
com where you're going to find a bunch
of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost of buying me
like expect each month that did now also
it probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe
here on YouTube to be sure to make sure
the notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it alright let's go
ahead and launch our project that I will
show you how to build 100%
okay so this is the layout that we're
going to be building from scratch using
bootstrap for now as you can see we have
a nice hero section here then some
secondary supporting content that will
help us understand the grid system which
it's also using font awesome icons as
you can see and also from here we have a
form section at the bottom now if we
take this browser and shrink it in will
see that it is fully responsive and of
course our navigation works as well
and even though this isn't like a
massive layout with a ton of content
we're going to be covering a lot of
ground as it pertains to bootstrap for
so you're going to learn how to
integrate bootstrap for with a modern
development workflow structured with
gulp which is a JavaScript task runner
don't worry if you've never heard of it
before I'll explain it you're going to
learn how to customize bootstrap for
sass settings and ultimately how to use
the power of bootstrap for classes to
minimize the amount of CSS that you need
to write so let's go ahead and get
started now like other similar
frameworks you're able to install
bootstrap for project through two
different methods now one is quick and
dirty and the other on is most
preferable but it takes a bit more time
now the key differences between each of
these methods is the time it takes to
get started versus the file size and
loading time and there are a couple
other differences that we will take a
look at shortly so the quick way and
this is method is the most ideal when
you're working on a prototype or a
wireframe it allows you to quickly and
easily get up and running with bootstrap
or by simply copying and pasting
literally four lines of HTML onto a page
now the downside to this method is a
lack of customization options as it's
strictly CSS and not sass and also load
times now when you use this method
you're importing the entire bootstrap
library which is almost always
unnecessary this results in unnecessary
file sizes thus longer load times now
still if you're working on a prototype
or a project where the load time isn't a
factor this is the quickest way to get
started so assuming you have an HTML
page you simply copy and paste the
following line between the head tags and
then you include the necessary
JavaScript includes just before the
closing body tag and that's it
so you're now able to write HTML and
Haunter and harness the power of boot
shop for now in this course however
we're not going to use this method we're
going to set up a more robust
development environment and use the sass
version of bootstrap for all right so
again bucho 4 it comes in two different
flavors it's straight up CSS which is
what the CDN uses
method that we just discussed uses and
sass now sass is a preprocessor
processor that allows you to write more
dynamic CSS and then takes this sass CSS
and compiles it down just to standard
CSS so bootstrap for sass allows you to
make more customizations and choose
which elements of the bootstrap four
framework you would like to include
based on your project projects needs so
this ultimately leads to a reduced file
size which is necessary for your
websites or apps performance so a
popular package manager is NPM or the
node package manager and you're going to
need to install nodejs which includes
the node package manager so if you've
never installed before you go to node.js
or you click on downloads and we choose
Windows or Mac installer and you
download it and just run through the
typical setup process and then once
that's done you can load up your command
line and you could type in NPM pipe and
V and it will give you a version number
all right so assume you have it
installed and you're all ready to go
let's go ahead and create a directory so
m'kay derp game layout alright now we're
going to CD into it alright great so
here we've created a new folder now
let's go ahead and type in NPM and knit
to create a package.json file so NPM in
it
alright now it's going to prompt us with
a series of questions now I'm going to
just hit enter for all these alright so
now we're back at our prompt here
alright so the purpose of this package a
JSON file is that it creates a
configuration for our project so when we
install bootstrap 4 for instance it's
going to add a package name along with
the version to this file and that way in
the future if you need to install this
project on another environment such as a
server you can run NPM install and it
will download all the necessary packages
and dependencies based on this package
dot JSON file alright so let's go ahead
and install bootstrap for with
p.m. install so let me clear this out
and I type an NPM install bootstrap and
right now it's at alpha six
so I'm going to put in an at four point
zero point zero - alpha dot six and then
we're going to add two dashes and save
which will save it as a dependency in
our package JSON file alright as you can
see it's very quick and so also at the
time of writing this by the way
bootstrap four may be officially
released or maybe perhaps it has come
out with another alpha or at least
command it candidate so you can just
google bootstrap for in see which
version it's at and you can install that
as needed okay now if you hop it into a
code editor I'm using Visual Studio code
which is a hundred percent free and
google it and download it and we're in
our game loud folder and we can see we
have our package adjacent that the npm
init command ran notice under
dependencies we see bootstrap with the
version number and then we also have a
node modules folder with three different
folders inside of it so first we have
bootstrap and this contains the CSS and
sass version of our bootstrap 4 we also
have jQuery which is used by bootstrap
in various components and then we also
have tether which is a library for
element positioning so each of these
folders must be added to our project but
we don't currently have a project to
work with so in the next section that's
what we're going to work with and get
set up is a development environment
alright so we already have a project
with bootstrap integrated so let's
create a more robust environment that we
can use while we work on our bootstrap
for project so in the project root
folder we're going to create a new
folder called source so let's collapse
this we're going to create a new folder
here we'll call this SRC alright and
inside of
we're going to create four more folders
so with that folder selected we'll
create a new folder here called assets
and this is where our graphics and such
will go we'll also create another one
called CSS this is where our compiled
CSS will go we'll also create another
one called
s CSS which is the sass file extension
that we will use and then finally we'll
create another one called J s for
JavaScript all right so now what we want
to do is inside of the source folder
we're going to create a new index.html
alright so come out here new file
index.html alright so oops currently
that is not in source make sure that's
in source there we go and now for the
written version of this tutorial or this
lesson you can go ahead and copy I'll
provide that in a project files if
you're not watching this in YouTube for
instance and paste this right here
alright so there's a few things
happening that's worth mentioning so
let's go ahead I'm going to hit ctrl B
to get rid of that sidebar so everything
is pretty much standard here we have our
head and inside of here the parts to
really pay attention to are right here
and so the first one is we're importing
a Google web font right here called
railway so that's what we're going to be
using and then also we have font awesome
right here which provides you with very
easy to use icons
we'll be using that we're also
referencing I forward slash CSS
bootstrap CSS of course this file
doesn't exist currently and then also a
style dot CSS which is where some custom
CSS rule sets will go and then inside of
our body just before the closing body
tag is our JavaScript references so we
have jQuery which is required for
bootstrap for we have tether which is
also required and then of course we have
bootstrap Minjae s
all right so of course this these files
right here don't exist yet and neither
do these two files so what we need to do
in order to remedy that is before we get
to that portion actually I'm jumping
ahead we're going to go create another
file in our s CSS or sass folder we're
going to call it here style dot s CSS
and inside of it we're going to create a
variable and a simple rule set for the
body so the variable is BG color I'm
just setting it to blue and then in the
body in the background we're setting it
to this variable right here so the
background of our website will be just
this standard you know kind of ugly blue
and blue color and this is just for test
test purposes just to make sure that the
SAS preprocessor is working and I
converting how we want it to so that
leads us to the next section all right
and that's working with gulp
all right so gulp is a Java Script task
runner and it's going to help us solve
this empty folder issue along with SAS
compiling in life browser reloading so
to get started we have to hop back into
the command line and use NPM so let's go
ahead and save these two files here by
the way all right so what we need to do
is use NPM to install gulp with browser
sync as well and another package called
gulp - sass and then we're going to save
it as a development dependency all right
so hit enter and let that run through
all right so once that's finished let's
go ahead and hop back into our code
editor and for our code editor we're
going to take a look real quick and back
in the node modules remember there was
just three folders there before well now
there are after refreshing many many
many more as you can see these are all
other packages that those three packages
that we installed rely on and of course
you'll find in here somewhere embedded
in here you'll find the gulp and the
goal
as and the other package that we
installed so that command that we're in
for NPM install you know all it does is
just place a bunch of folders inside of
the net node modules folder that we saw
so we actually have to to use gulp we
have to create a gulp file TAS in the
projects route so I will just click on
package real quick make sure we're in
the project route and I'll create a new
file called gulp file Jas ok so the
first thing we need to do is create
variables that reference the three
packages that we just installed so again
following the written version of this
tutorial I'm going to paste in those
three right here so the way this is set
up is we have a bar gulp browser sync
and sass and we're using require and
this is a reference to the actual folder
name of the package name that's located
in node modules all right simple enough
now of course if you've never really
touched gulp or even much Java Script
this is going to look a little bit
foreign but don't worry with a little
time and persistence you'll be able to
understand it so the next thing that we
have to do is create a task so gulp is
setup you know once again it's a task
runner so the first thing we need to do
is to take our sass files and convert
them into CSS that a browser can
actually read so to do that I'm going to
create a task here and I'm going to
paste this right in alright so the first
thing we use the gulp task method and
we're naming this particular task tat
sass right here sorry I'm kind of losing
my speech there inside of it we create a
function inside we return a gulp dot
source method and all this here is just
telling us is where is the location of
these sass files that we want to work
with so we're passing an array because
we have two different locations so we
have our node modules bootstrap a CSS
bootstrap CSS version so this is the
bootstrap sass and then also separated
by a comma we have a source in our SSS
folder which we
created and then we're saying we're
using the wild-card asterisk to say any
sass file inside of this SCSS right
there we could if we know if we knew we
are only working with one file for
instance we could just make this style
SDSS which is the name that we gave it
up here and then after that we used a
pipe method to say okay next what we
want to happen is we're going to
actually use sass which will convert
this sass into CSS then we use another
pipe to say that next what we want to
happen we want to take that result and
we're going to use gulp destination or D
est and this is where it's going to take
that CSS that it just created or
compiled and it's going to place it in a
source CSS folder which again we created
and then we're going to use a bi pipe
here for browser sink which is in
reference to this variable up there and
dot stream and this will notify the
browser and we'll reload okay so
hopefully you kind of get it we not done
yet though we have to you know because
bootstrap 4 does use JavaScript we're
going to take the JavaScript and
necessary JavaScript files from the
bootstrap and also jquery folders also
tether as well and we're going to move
them into the GS folder that we created
so the next section on the paste is
right here so we're creating a task
called j/s we're going to return at the
gulp source so again the same thing as
up here we're just referencing the
location of these Jas files so we have
the bootstrap file jQuery and tether
right here then we're just saying we're
not actually doing anything to it we're
not running any type of minification or
whatever which you can if you want
we're just moving it into a source J's
folder and then again we're running this
here to notify the browser all right and
then finally we have two more tasks to
create
the first one right here this is a task
called serve and we're passing in this
time in the second argument we're
passing in an array which just contains
a reference to SAS so SAS will run
automatically when serve is ran you'll
see how that works momentarily then
we're using browsersync dot in it to
initialize a server that's starting in
our source folder so this is a local
static server that will run on localhost
3000 you'll see that momentarily as well
and then we have gulp watch right here
we have two of these that's going to
watch our bootstrap file if we make
changes or any changes as well in the
source s CSS folder that we're going to
be writing in so every time we make an
update where we save it it's going to
reload the browser essentially and that
way we don't have to mainly hit refresh
and we're also it's also going to run
SAS the SAS tasks up here and then also
if we make change to HTML on any type of
change and if we update it or save then
we're going to reload the browser okay
then finally just one line down here is
called tasks the default gulp task means
if somebody if we just type in gulp in
the command line then what's going to
run well two different things that we
specified here in this array we have a
j/s task in the serve task so when we
run gulp it's going to start the server
it's going to launch our browser and
it's also going to run this j/s here to
move files from node modules into our
source j/s folder so let's save it and
let's go back to the command line and we
did everything correctly this should
work so let me clear this and just type
gulp alright and there we go so your
browser should load up if I hit control
shift I make sure you go to console
there's no errors that means bootstrap
is now fully loaded and ready to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
