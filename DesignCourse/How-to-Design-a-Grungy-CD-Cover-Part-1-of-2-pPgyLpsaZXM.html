comm today we're gonna focus on
designing a grungy sort of dirty CD
design so we're only going to focus on
the front side of the CD and we're going
to use Adobe Photoshop CC to do this and
this is going to span over the course of
two days today we're going to focus on
designing most of it and then tomorrow
we're gonna finish it off and then
impose it into a 3d view of a jewel case
or a CD case alright so basically check
out design course comm if you haven't
yet and certainly subscribe here on
YouTube let's get started
alright so real quickly I've downloaded
a template file for a CD cover just from
a random print site and we're not going
to use it but I wanted to describe real
quickly what these are so anytime you're
dealing with print design you're gonna
have to deal with three different things
terminology basically so we have their
bleed which is your last outer portion
right here and basically that's a any
type of background elements or any type
of design that's supposed to be you know
100% to the top bottom left and right
should go outside of this line or extend
out into this line rather in this
portion and then you have your trim line
this is where it's physically being cut
and then you have your safety right here
which means if you have any important
elements such as text you want to keep
it inside this portion not like flour up
against it basically and anyhow it's
kind of bad design to put any text right
up against this line anyways so I will
go ahead to file new and we'll just call
this cover and the general size of a CD
cover in inches is four point seven five
by four point seven five resolution
you're going to want at three hundred
generally and then color mode CMYK
background contents I always leave mine
up transparent and then just hit OK
alright so this would actually be the
trim line within height so if we go to
image canvas size and change that to
five it okay you could basically I this
is it you can see it slightly gets
larger and I forgot just to fill this in
with the color
quick I'm gonna do that again change
that to five
all right so this outer portion would be
at be the actual bleed area so I'm gonna
hide this and just get started
so control-shift-n enter for a new layer
call this background or BG fill this in
will use like a almost a black color so
- zero - zero - zero and then for this
background we want something right
around here as well so five four five
four five four for that color code so if
we go to image or no filter rather
render clouds and gives us basically an
interesting texture to start working
with alright so now what I want to do is
just kind of fade out the edges a little
bit so I'm gonna take the brush tool
with a feather brush it's hardness at
zero the size I'm gonna leave I'm gonna
put actually maybe around fifteen
hundred and then just kind of click
around here it doesn't have to be
perfect
actually I'm gonna back up there and
make this black like one hundred percent
black and then like I said it doesn't
have to be perfect cuz this is just
grunge alright alright so in the middle
I kind of want to create like a dirty
grungy type of butterfly paint spatter
type thing so I've linked I some
different custom brushes in the
description in YouTube below this video
I and you could just download them
experiment so if you take the paint
brush take this scroll down you'll see I
have a bunch of them and he listed here
so I if you kind of just click on here
you can see what these things look like
so I'm looking for one that's kind of
full in the center that could possibly
work I think this works pretty good so
I'm gonna choose this one right here and
you could choose anything as similar it
doesn't have to be perfect I will take a
red color for the foreground and it
create a new layer we'll just call this
blood
and then just click right around here
all right
pretty simple then I'm going to take the
rectangular marquee tool and then just
right around there to somewhere close
this edge just delete all right so then
I'm going to duplicate it you can right
click hit duplicate layer or ctrl shift
D I which is a custom hockey I setup and
that's what I'm going to use I in the
future here so if you want to setup your
own I keyboard shortcuts you could do
that by going to edit keyboard shortcuts
and finding I here in the tools that's
the panels really and it's in or is it
that it's in layer so to duplicate layer
right here ctrl shift D I've setup right
there
so I'm duplicating so many times it's
it's a good idea just to set up a hotkey
for that alright so I now we have that
duplicated oh it's go to edit transform
flip horizontal move this over and then
just join them take both of these by
holding shift left clicking hit ctrl e
to merge and alright so now what we want
to do is I do placate that once more so
ctrl shift D and you know when it comes
to the grungy textures or whatever you
can really just play around with the
filters and don't just coming up with
anything that kind of looks cool so I'm
gonna go to filter pixelate and
mezzotint alright so that just kind of
really distorts the heck out of this
right here so I'm just zooming up so you
can see this a little bit better
hi and then what I want to do is go to
filter blur and motion blur right around
there
alright so now the next part is gonna be
a matter of experimenting with this I if
I go to image adjustments invert I want
to see what that looks like okay and
then maybe go to image adjustments and
brightness and contrast maybe take the
brightness down to negative 95 and the
contrast up to 100 and take this
portion actually we'll take this right
here hit ctrl T for transform and then
hold alt and bring this in just a tad
bit maybe down like this as well and you
can also you know you can take I right
here if you left click it twice for the
layer blend modes you can really
experiment by hitting your down arrow
key and maybe coming up with something
that you think looks interesting and I
think there is one up here that I kind
of like the look of and that is linear
light
alright so beneath both of those blood
layers maybe create a new one by ctrl
shift and hit enter and I'm going to
take the brush tool and I'm going to get
just a different type of spatter going
here just for more texture so yeah maybe
right there and I don't want to make it
black so take our foreground make it
black and then just come around there
actually maybe right-click twice maybe
and then create even another one
control-shift-n and we'll choose a
different one this time
alright I'm gonna make just slightly
larger so maybe like 1500 in this time I
don't want it to be black I'm gonna take
it maybe just um big gray alright and
they maybe take that pasady down just a
little bit alright alright so now what I
want to do is basically take a rectangle
tool and I think I'm just gonna go
beneath the two blood copy so let's
rename these real quick though so this
will be B G spatter black B G spatter
gray and then just above those
control-shift-n for a new layer hit OK
and I'm going to take I for someone to
zoom out just hit ctrl oops not control
one rather a zoom out rather fit on
screen and then we'll take I just with
the same gray color the rectangle tool
and just drag out a holding alt alright
and I'm going to right-click and
rasterize that layer and then I'm going
to do the same thing sort of that we did
with the this layer right here so we'll
go to filter pixelate will go to
mezzotint hit okay and then maybe just
do it one more time ago and filter
mezzotint alright so you can see it kind
of changed you know basically it looks
crazy so then what I want to do is the
same thing as before just go ahead to
filter blur motion blur
right around there hit okay get rid of
that I feel on screen and bring this
just over here maybe take down the
opacity I'm going to duplicate that
layer and take our rectangle rectangular
marquee tool and kind of cut out the
middle portion just so it's very thin
maybe even thinner than that okay so you
can barely see it but we can bring up
this and this is just you know something
that's just a random sort of design
slash effect so we can take those two
and hit ctrl e to merge them call this
vertical line to one duplicate that
maybe bring this one down take the
eraser tool a feather brush and then
delete that whole portion right here
ctrl T make it thick and again I'm just
playing around you know not really doing
anything with any type of reason let's
see here
all right so it's continued on just kind
of I improving on this I'm going to take
this blood copy layer right here the red
one and I want to experiment maybe with
the blend modes a little bit so I'm just
hitting my down arrow key
all right you want to experiment even
that that color and then duplicating
that layer and positioning yeah just on
top and then changing this back to
normal control t oops I needed to zoom
out here
if you hit hold all in your scroll wheel
you can easily zoom out all right that
looks kind of cool right there what I'm
gonna do is leave it right there hit
apply and take this middle portion hit I
ctrl T you can hold all while doing this
all right
control-t on that maybe all right just
so we can get things to stand out a
little bit more with a little bit more
color all right so if i zoom I fit on
screen this is what everything looks
like so far I want to play around just a
tad bit more so let me yeah we'll come
just over
yeah the BG Cup I lay right there
controls you that and for a new layer
and I may take I let's see here yeah
just a large feather brush so we're
going around right around for 400 or 500
pixels with a black and I just kind of
want this also it's good to stand out
more so the way we can do that is just
kind of to blur out portions of or to
make it black rather of the background
all right all right so now I want to add
some elements that aren't all grungy
like this which we really just kind of
help bring the image together a little
bit so what we'll do is I'll come out
here and we will yeah I think just above
this layer create a new layer
control-shift-n and we'll take the
ellipse tool and just around the center
you don't have to be perfect hold shift
and scale out right around there and
we'll get rid of the fill or you could
do it up here as well and then we'll
give it a stroke maybe like a gray color
and then take these sides up so if we
want to see this a little bit better
hit ctrl H twice because just make this
one if we wanted to all right and
actually maybe point five all right and
then we can take the opacity drop it
down a little bit take this ellipse
layer we'll duplicate that duplicate it
again right click and rasterize it yeah
we'll go to filter pixelate mezzo tint
okay see it kind of made it a little bit
Jaggi there go up here to a hundred
percent and then go to image adjustments
hue and saturation colorize take the
saturation up high and bring the
brightness the lightness rather down you
just right around there and again
there's no right or wrong when it comes
to this type of design obviously but I
so you don't have to follow these
exactly all right
all right so basically I think that will
be pretty good that I may want to
experiment with this one if we go to
image adjustments hue and saturation we
can always play around with this and I
don't think I quite liked where it was
at right here for this type of blue so
if I just drag it over I think I like
that a little bit better I'm at negative
33 though you probably don't have the
exact same outlook so do you know
basically just choose what you think
looks good and all right I think that's
a good place to stop for today so
tomorrow we'll finish this up by doing
two different things we'll get in kind
of like a logo here it's going to be the
design course logo you can use whatever
you want
I will of course link that if you want
to use the same project file and we'll
also play around with it a little bit
and do a little bit more detail and then
we'll go ahead and take it and just
basically composite it into a 3d view of
an actual CD cover case
alright so I'll see you then but first
of course check out design course comm
I'm going to be releasing I'm hoping to
release maybe three or four or five
different course products this year so
none are up yet unfortunately but I
check it out now and maybe if you're
watching this a little bit down the road
and also subscribe here on YouTube
alright I'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
