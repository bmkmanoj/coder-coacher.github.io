today we're going to step into a
two-part blender series for beginners
and we're going to design a really
simple but really cool-looking 3d
software box as you just saw alright so
today we're just going to focus on
solely the blender portion where we're
going to get the basic shape of the
software box out and also UV unwrap it
and set up the scene and then tomorrow
we'll go ahead and focus solely in
Photoshop bring that over and then make
a scene out of it that looks pretty much
just exactly of what you saw just before
me talking alright so if you haven't yet
check out design course comm and
subscribe here at YouTube alright so get
started all right so if you're new to
blender real quickly right clicking will
allow you to select an object to move
around the viewport you use your third
or middle mouse button to zoom up you
use your scroll wheel and pan you hold
shift and left-click I'm running through
this really quickly for a couple of
reasons well one is because I've done a
ton of these blender tutorials beginner
to tours all ready haven't done in like
50,000 times that brief introduction and
because I don't have too much time today
unfortunately so I'm going to do is get
a file new you have to stay there and
hit reload startup file just so we're
looking at the same thing alright so
basically as with any other project when
you're thinking about modeling something
you know you have to consider what is
the basic shape of what you're about to
begin or what you're trying to create so
it is a rectangle a software box so we
can use this existing cube that is here
by default to get started so what I want
to do is ordinarily just to preface this
real quick if you were to really being
serious and you're trying to design a
render of a real software box that
you're attempting to get printed what
you would do is you know whoever you're
going to use for that packaging and the
printing you would try to find the exact
specifications of that software box so
that obviously your render is going to
be accurately reflecting what it will
look like exactly in the real world
but for this we're just going to assume
this is a fictional product product
software package so I'm just going to
eyeball it when I come to deform this
cube alright so what I want to do is I'm
going to hit tab and that will take us
to edit mode so there's two ways of
getting there this way and then tab so
toggling between object and edit mode
gets you between those two states so
object mode of course you can move
things scale them up and down and rotate
them I edit mode allows you to edit and
transform the actual shape itself so by
default we're in user perspective mode
that gives us a realistic 3d perspective
if you hit 5 on your number pad that
gets us to ortho mode and this isn't
realistic in terms of a 3d perspective
but it does make I messing around with
the actual geometry a little bit easier
alright so what I'm going to do is if
you hit one on your number pad you go to
the front view 7 of course is top three
is the right side hitting ctrl in any
one of those like control three will
give you two left control seven will
give you bottom control one will give
you back all right so we want to go on
the top okay so what I want to do is
take hit a on your keyboard and that
will deselect and that will toggle
between select all and select none hit B
this is kind of like the lasso tool in
Photoshop and also turn on this thing
real quick before you do that otherwise
if it's off by default and you leave it
off yet B you'll only select the visible
vertices we want to select all of them
so that's what this option right here
does so go back to seven hit a B now
it's selected both of them alright so
hit seven and now we're going to do is
just drag it on the x-axis right around
there somewhere
alright and it's also a little bit too
well it's basically a perfect square and
you know a software package
doesn't look like that so what we'll do
is I will go to hit three hit a B as a
boy drag that thing left roughly right
around there so if you hit a twice we'll
move this thing up actually if we want
to move it we can switch to tab I to
object mode and move it up here right
around there and I want to add a plane
at this point as well for it to actually
be sitting on something so I'm going to
hit shift a mesh and plane all right so
I'm going to hit s for scale and just
type in something big like 50 on the
keyboard hit Enter all right and now
what I want to do is just I make some
quick adjustments to something I
basically do in every project I come
over here we want to first select a
cycles render we're going to select GPU
now if you don't have the GPU compute
option and you do have a graphics
processor you can go to file and we'll
go over here to user preferences click
on system and over here under compute
device if you have these cards listed or
they may be to something entirely
different
select click on CUDA and then just click
out and then you'll be able to select
GPU compute it makes rendering thousand
times faster almost all right
the resolution when I go to render this
I want 1280 by 720 and 50% means it
would do 50% of this value I want a
hundred percent I'm going to come down
here at sampling by default right now
we're at the render is at ten samples
that's actually very low so if you go
over here you switch from solid view to
rendered view you'll see that it gets
kind of grainy it's not too noticeable
right here though I'm going to switch
the world view real quick I'm going to
make the color kind of like a light gray
color up there alright and I'm going to
go back here and for render
I'm going to change your samples to try
700 the higher it is the longer it will
take but the better quality and the
preview is what we're looking at now so
I I'm just going to leave mine at like a
hundred so as you can see it's running
through that real quick at one hundred
samples and it gets through pretty
quickly so as you move around in here it
will run through hundred samples each
time that you change the view a little
bit all right so now what we want to do
that we have our software box and it
looks you know pretty accurate to an
actual software box what we want to do
is UV unwrap it alright so we'll switch
off to solid and right up here when you
change
I mean you hover over it your icon
changes when it changes like that to the
little crosshair left-click and drag
down and that will split the view it
duplicates or replicates whatever is up
here and so we want to change this view
over here by default that 3d view we
want to change this to the uv/image
editor all right so now what we want to
do is come over here and let's see here
yeah go to image and new image and take
this and multiply it by 2 which is 2 0 4
8 you can enter math and then we'll just
do it for you automatically
and you can leave all these other
options the same and we'll hit OK now by
default you see is massive black thing
over here I did use your scroll wheel
and not zoom out like that ok so now
what we want to do is right-click to
select our actual box and we want to hit
tab to go into edit mode alright so
right now it is currently not UV
unwrapped so what we want to do is you
hit the letter U on your keyboard with
everything selected you have to make
sure you hit a and a it actually lights
up everything so hit U and hit unwrap
now when you hit unwrap I most of the
time the desired result doesn't look
like what is ever is up here it's
basically what it is make everything
square so you have other options though
you can go to you again you can try
smart UV project hit okay and now you
can see it has our two long sides has
the top and bottom and it has the front
in back
you can try experimenting more i q--
projection you could try cylinder
projection that's that wouldn't work you
could try sphere projection even you
could try all these different things i
so i think what will work best is doing
project from view a few times so what
i'll do is get this a more in view will
hit five to get an ortho mode and then
will hit one actually that's not our
front so if i hit three or sorry control
in the three on the number pad will get
two left ortho and what i'm going to do
is simply we have to make sure that we
don't adjust this view and in terms of i
zoom enough and now at this point what
i'm going to do is select into face mode
by default run virtus mode that lets you
select the individual vertices by
right-clicking them then you have side
mode and you can select the sides we
want to go to face mode when you select
when you change the face mode from
either of those two you'll see as little
dots shows up in the center of each face
so right click it and that lets you
select that specific face and you can
see the issue with this is is what we'll
be doing in the next lesson will be
taking this whole UV layout it's called
we're going to export it as a PNG image
and then we're going to import it into
photoshop and the reason this wouldn't
work out is because you're going to be
designing i what should be a perfect
sort of rectangle but this isn't perfect
so that's why this is an issue and what
would happen is if you try designing in
it it would looked all distorted and
like off-centered and stuff so you want
it to be as accurate as possible based
on the 3d geometry so if we hit you
project from view you'll see it now
changes to a perfect rectangle so if we
hit G on our keyboard that's the
shortcut for remove we can just move it
over to the side temporarily right there
all right so we're on the Left view we
want to go to the right view so we hit
control 3 to get to left so all you have
to do is hit 3 on the number pad to get
to the other side we'll right-click that
face hit you and project from view and
we'll just move it over right around
there because the other one is right
here all right and then we'll hit 1 and
this is front so we'll select this one
right here make sure it actually shows
that one because it allowed me to select
the back 1 because of the option we had
selected we'll hit you
project from view all right so this is
front
I'll hit G and just move it over here
and then we'll hit control 1 to go to
back view right click it you project
from view hit G and move it over to the
very right so that's good and then we
have 2 more just to worry about and that
is the top so if we hit 7 we'll go ahead
and right click that make sure that
lights up we have you and project from
view the top and bottom I'll just stick
up here and then control 7 gets us to
the bottom and you project from view G
and just move this over here so now if
we hit a to deselect all and then a
again we'll see all of our individual
parts as needed so what we can do is
take all of these and rearrange them so
that it makes logical sense based on
this UV layout so I'm going to move this
up just so we have a little bit more
room to work and if you hit a you can
deselect everything and then B you could
select these two and then we could scale
these up quite a bit so hit s and G
and let's get these lined up next to
each other I'm going to move this real
quick so nothing's overlapping over
there and so I'll have to do is take I
hit a and B G line them up right next to
each other I'm going to hit a B it's
like these two and then B again to
select these as well hit G and move
these up actually going to move them off
screen all right
a B G if you can believe it right around
there that would be that would give us a
decent us decent enough resolution at a
2-0 for 8 by 2 0 for 8 document then I'm
going to take these over here and these
are the sides and so I'm going to hit a
B G a B real quick we'll move them
together get them kind of lined up and
you can zoom up a lot G all right that's
pretty good and I'm going to hit a and
beans like both G to move them over s
you want to try to get them the same
height as the front and back as well so
if we s G s
gee you can use your arrow keys after
hitting G to move these into place
alright and then we have the top and
bottom up here a B G s and right around
there is pretty good and I'll go ahead
and move these over to actually what we
could do is rotate them so if you are X
90
so again R then X and then hit 9 on your
keyboard to enter and a B will G and
then again a B and I think the size is
pretty good so we could just we could
put it right over here just for now now
take them all we'll move them up G and
then also you can hit X or Y so let's
hit Y and write it around there is
pretty good so if we move up believe it
or not when it comes to the the size
differences between these even a pixel
will kind of throw it off so if you a
and then B and select these two and we
hit G and Y right there that looks
pretty good
in terms of how they're lining up
all right so now what we want to do at
this point is export the UV layout so
what you do is go to UV export UV layout
and I paused real quick to create an
actual folder for this project and we'll
go ahead and take in make sure all UVs
is specified and to 0 for 8 right to 0
for 8 the fill opacity basically is the
opacity of the layer that contains the
UVs which is fine so I'd be 25%
so what cooks call this UV layout dot
PNG and hit export layout just like that
all right so that wraps up this video
for today again kind of pressed for time
so I'm not going to complete the video
today tomorrow will they go ahead and
finish this up with the majority of our
work being in Photoshop alright so check
out these nine course comm if you
haven't yet and also just because I've
been so busy working on this intently I
wanted to show a preview real quick of
some software boxes I designed for
design course comm recently all right so
this is I I've shown this often in the
form I some software boxes let me make
that bigger that I I've been working
with in using the same technique really
as blender than I'm showing you guys and
you can see they look really cool and
you can play around with them and yeah
so anyhow yeah check out design course
comm if you haven't yet these two
products will be releasing soon so I
subscribe here and also enter your email
at the site and you'll receive an email
once I launch this this basically a
subscription service that gives you
access to these products and then many
