today i'm going to share a very quick
tip i recently learned and i didn't know
about with google chrome so google
chrome of course is a popular browser
and within it there's the option to
emulate different devices and this is
very important and helpful for those of
us who are designing responsive websites
which basically everyone should be kind
of concerned with at this point in terms
of modern design and it helps you be
able to see what your site looks like on
a variety of different devices and both
smartphones and tablets alright so i'm
going to switch off to the desktop and
show you exactly how to enable this
feature alright so basically if you hit
ctrl shift an eye on google chrome
you'll have a window now it usually by
default if I click on this will show up
within the same browser window
if you wanted to disconnect it you click
on this icon right here and it comes up
in its own separate window and so to get
to that emulation error you just click
on this drawer button right here and you
click on an emulation tab and you have
all these devices down here that you can
emulate so Apple products you have
Google you have you know a lot of smart
phones different carriers I are from
companies and then I even the tablets
and you have iPads even so if I click on
iPhone 5 I wanna see what this looks
like this form page on my site looks
like on an iPhone 5 and click on emulate
I'll remove this over off screen we'll
see now we have basically an emulation
of the iPhone 5 and what my site looks
like on this specific device pretty cool
so if I change this over here back to a
BlackBerry PlayBook
whatever that is you know it'll adjust
that automatically and let me know what
my site looks like so of course you know
again the importance of this is letting
us know if
any areas that need fixed within CSS I
that some of these devices you know we
want to be able to tell otherwise so
without having the actual devices in
hand so you know when it comes to
responsive design you know we're all
used to for instance I also to get rid
of this all you have to do is hit reset
to go back to normal browser and so
usually we would just drag this in see
if there's any areas but you know that's
not really very accurate just because
you know you're not sure what with
you're working with and it's just kind
of difficult so just picking out you
know going through these devices when
you have a site you're trying to make
responsive it definitely makes sense
maybe not every single wine because that
would take forever but trying to get you
know a variety of different viewport
widths and smartphones and tablets is a
good idea alright just a quick tip and
so check out design course comm if you
have it yet I the design course premium
subscription service is going to be
launching within the next week or two so
check that out and yeah subscribe on
YouTube as well if you haven't yet all
right I'll see you guys tomorrow good
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
