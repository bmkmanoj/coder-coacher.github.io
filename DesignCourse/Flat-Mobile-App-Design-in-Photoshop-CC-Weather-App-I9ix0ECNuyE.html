and today is January 11th and we have
our eleventh video of the year so that's
good and we're going to be focusing on
designing a mobile app so this is going
to be for a fictional weather app and
we're just going to design one screen so
we can get your feet wet with mobile app
design if you've never done it and then
we're also going to place the final
design in a prospective 3d iPhone 5 so
as always you can download the project
files for free in the link below the
video and also at the time of recording
this I don't yet have a mobile app
design course and certification course
but you can go to design course comm put
in your email if it's not up yet but if
you're viewing this maybe three months
four months a year down the road it may
be up already and you could definitely
check that out for a more robust course
all right so let's go ahead and get
started okay so the first thing I want
to do i or you're going to want to do is
download the project files that which is
in the link below this video and open up
the app template dot PSD so we have the
status bar up here which is in some
group and then just the background layer
right here so we have this background
portion to work with for our weather app
okay so the second thing you're going to
want to do is just go to file open and
open up the rain PNG so this is a very
large image hit ctrl a and ctrl C to
copy and then close that out and then
ctrl V to paste in and then move to the
move tool and hit ctrl T and then hold
shift with alt and scale that down by
quite a bit so I'm going to go maybe
maybe around there and then I'm going to
go ahead up here in the layer blend
modes and hit the down arrow key and I
think screen works well and then we're
going to take the opacity down quite a
bit okay so this is going to signify
that it's
really raining so if you were to have a
the app developer when you provide them
with the assets you would obviously
provide them with multiple
basically you know one for sunny and one
for cloudy and rain here of course so I
we're going to do a screen that would
you know basically be the interface for
a rainy day alright so now that we have
that we're ready to go the next thing I
want to do is up here I'm going to have
the location I and then the temperature
and then rainy slash cloud in an icon so
let's get started with that the first
thing I'm going to do is just put in
here with the type tool 72 so I'm going
to scale this up a lot I'm going to
change the source sans Pro well it
already is but I'm going to change it to
extra light and that font is linked in
the description of this video and I want
it to be a little bit smaller
I may be tinkering around with this
because I'm just kind of eyeballing it
and then I want to do the little circle
degree thing so I'm going to zoom up
here we'll get 100% and take the ellipse
tool and hold shift well you don't have
to hold shift well yeah shift and alt
will get to you right there okay and
then we're going to take the direct
selection tool over here and this window
that pops up or up here we're going to
get rid of the foreground or the fill
rather and we're going to give it a
white let's try one pixel I make I'm a
put 0.8 there alright and then we can
move this up as needed all right so I'm
going to get rid of this I'm going to
zoom out
okay and also if you go back to the move
tool
you know whichever layer you're
currently on if you need to move that
around you can use your up and down
arrow keys alright so I'm going to take
those two right away and rename this to
degree and I'm going to hit ctrl G we're
going to call this temperature I want
everything to be organized in layer
groups here I'll just call this rain
alright so now we can move on I
basically over here to the right I'm
going to have a water or like basically
water drop icon so what we're going to
do is zoom up here to hundred percent
and you can always hit control 1 to get
there automatically I we're going to go
to view show grid and then view make
sure snap to grid is on alright I'm
going to zoom up one more time I'm going
to take the shape tool or a pen tool
with shape selected rather and I'm going
to click up there once and then click
down here and hold and just drag out
right around there alright so then what
I want to do is duplicate that layer so
right click and duplicate go to edit
transform flip horizontal we'll move
that over right there and with the
direct selection tool apply hit control
C to copy we're going to delete that
layer and then ctrl V to paste so the
paste is on a layer and all becomes one
single layer basically a shape layer
alright so then what we want to do is
right click well duplicate that again
and I'm going to move it right here I'm
going to temporarily just change the
color to the background so double click
on there to get the color picker up and
then I'm going to duplicate this layer
the bottom white one again and move it
up and then I'm going to play around
with these two I get the this
organized how I want to so it's
basically just an illustration showing
two water drops or an icon rather that's
I'm not sure if you heard that my wife
is still sick coughing her lungs out
downstairs with pneumonia all right all
right so I think that's pretty good
I believe it there so now what we want
to do I'm going to hide this top layer
and then for this layer I'm going to hit
ctrl C after selecting the direct
selection tool I'm going to delete this
and then I'm going to with shape wine
which is our original water drop layer
ctrl V to paste and then up here we're
going to go to subtract front shape all
right so then we can bring this back up
and now this middle portion if we take
both of these layers move them around
you'll see that it is transparent which
is what we want okay so I'm going to
leave this right around here I'm going
to go ahead and go to turning off the
grid and then also turn off snap all
right now what I want to do is take both
of these layers and then hit ctrl e to
merge those we'll just call this drops
and effect ctrl T and oops wait one
thing we want to do before we try to
scale it is take the direct selection
tool and then just select all of them
and then we can go back select move tool
hit ctrl T and scale is down it apply
alright that looks to be right around
the size that I want it to be and then
over here I'm going to type in rain and
cloudy all right and then hit ctrl T
and hit them select move tool it apply
and we're going to get up the character
so go to windows character panel and
then change this to auto all right so
I'm going to zoom out here a couple
times just to see what this looks like
the fonts too thin when it's that small
so I'm going to change this to light and
everything move to here and I'm a scale
down this group just a tad bit alright
so far so good alright so now what I
want to do is create the little location
icon up here so I'm just going to type
in Cleveland Oh H scale that up just a
bit we don't want to be as big as this
text and I may change this from light to
regular
all right and basically I'm going to
have a silhouette of the state so this
would be Ohio and I'm going to just use
Google Images and I'm off screen here
typing this in and I'm you can do the
same thing you use any state you want I
and so I'm just going to try to find a
map of the state and then copy that
image paste it in so I found one here
I'm just going to scale that down and
then just very very quickly I'm going to
use the pen tool to go around this and I
don't have to be perfect because the
icon is going to be so small so you can
see I'm just kind of going real fast
and let me go like this so I can see
what's going on hitting ctrl Z you know
I'm just letting myself be able to see
what's beneath that all right and then
we'll delete that layer take this scale
that down a lot maybe even more select
move tool hit apply all right that looks
pretty good so now if I go ahead and
zoom out all right that looks pretty
good one change I'm going to make is the
I want this to stand out with color so
I'm going to select that 72 layer and
somewhere right around there so the
color codes right here DCA 966
and I'm going to copy that and then I'm
going to take the degree we're going to
select direct selection tool click on
this little icon and paste that in and
you get ctrl H to get rid of that those
outlines all right so we're ten minutes
in we have the top portion done so we're
moving along good down here I just kind
of came up with a random idea as a way
to kind of illustrate the temperature
that's going to be throughout the day so
what I want to do is take the ellipse
tool Oh first of all I want to take
these
layers before we continue and group them
up appropriate appropriately so I'm
going to take move tool with layer
selected Auto Select take these two
layers and I'll send that to state like
group call this location all right so we
have temperature already and then we
have ring cloudy drops okay so we're
going to hit ctrl G and we'll just call
this I don't know I'll just call it ring
cloudy whatever it is alright so now
what I want to do I'm going to create a
new layer at the top here go ahead and
take that ellipse tool hold shift and
scale up right around here all right
then I want to take the direct selection
tool get rid of the fill come over here
give it a fill make it white and I'd say
1.5 or so for that all right so
basically it's going to emulate kind of
like a clock so I want 12 up here and we
want that to be quite a bit bigger
although not too big and I'm going to
use just Arial for this and make it
white for the size I'm going to go down
to 6 points and leave it right around
here and then I'm going to duplicate
that and you should set up a shortcut
for duplicate because we do it so often
and I need to fix mine because my screen
recording software uses it so whenever I
try to use that shortcut it tries to do
something else with the application so I
need to fix that and so obviously I'm
just duplicating these moving it around
changing it to the actual times oops
move this over here 9
and just real quickly to visualize if
these are on the same path this needs
moved up about two pixels and we want
this to be evenly spaced alright so now
what I want to do I will say for example
the current time is and the current time
we would be displayed up here we'll just
say it's like 4:30 so it would be in
this section where we could have the
degree so take this Auto select group
select on here we'll duplicate that
we'll drag it up here then we'll drag it
down here ctrl T and scale that down
holding shift and alt and then move and
apply alright and then what I want to do
is take the type tool select that layer
we'll change it to regular and I'll take
that degree and we'll take down that I
change that to 0.4 for the stroke
alright and then finally we can right
click and duplicate that we'll duplicate
this a few times just three more times
and I want these ones to be light and I
want to change them to white same thing
with this degree oops
come over here change that to white and
then take the group itself and take the
opacity down a little bit and you know
what I do want to make one more change
we'll go back to 72 and change this to
extra light all right so the up acity is
that 60% here and I'm going to change it
so you know throughout the day the
hottest is usually around you know
obviously 12 to 3 so then it starts to
cool down so we'll say 67
duplicate that group shift and move up
right around there and then we'll say 55
and then we will duplicate this again
and we'll say 70 all right and then
finally I just illustrate that this
section is currently you know the time
frame that we're looking at we can go
ahead and find that layer which is
ellipse one and I'll just call this
circle time
and control shift end and create a
clipping mask hit OK and then we'll take
the rectangle tool and then we'll take
change the foreground color to this
right there and then we will simply hold
alt and drag up great around there all
right all right we wrap just about 16
minutes in the video and we're just
about done okay so now what I want to do
is just kind of create at the bottom
here I a five-day preview of the weather
so we're going to take and this will be
in a container so I'm going to drag out
here we're going to change the opacity
down quite a bit
I'll try 12 percent all right
and we'll go ahead and we get started
with the actual I names here and I'm
just going to use abbreviated names for
five days so we'll start with Monday and
I want to scale this up real quick
and we're at light lean or extra light
let's change that to light mm-maybe
regular all right and we'll move this
over so that we basically have five days
so
go ahead and duplicate you know what
we'll duplicate this after I have the
first one here so the icon so basically
are going to have icons for that will
represent you know what type of weather
it's going to be so I let's say we
wanted to create one real quickly for
cloudy so I'm going to zoom up here and
hold shift and select once there and
then this will be part of the cloud and
then we'll create another one up here
holding shift and ctrl H alright and to
illustrate I this a little bit better
we'll right-click we'll duplicate that
and then we'll go to edit transform flip
horizontal and hit ctrl T scale that
down just a little bit and let me see
what it looks like if it's this color
now what we'll do is give it a stroke so
I'll just double click over here go to
stroke change this down a lot maybe
around three
let me drag it down just a tad all right
so Monday will be cloudy I and then I
want to scale that down just a tad bit
and select all three move them down here
in position now I'm going to hit ctrl G
to group those we'll just call this
Monday I'm going to duplicate that group
is it
tue my brain is not working all right
and then Tuesday we can say it will be
cloudy and rainy so the way we can do
that we can just reuse this up here so
let me go to auto select layer will
duplicate that and we'll drag this up
and put that in Monday copy which box
would be Tuesday drops I move this down
scale that down quite a bit I think that
looks fine right there
and let's duplicate this again on select
group
all right and this time we can do one
for a sunny day so a lot of select layer
I'm going to get rid of that and that
and that and we'll take the ellipse tool
and I'll come down here we'll take the
rounded rectangle tool and we'll kind of
create sunshine rays we'll duplicate
that and come down here we'll just bring
that I hit control e to merge those
duplicate them again ctrl T hold shift
and we'll take these and duplicate those
both both of those by hitting ctrl E and
then not duplicate rather merge now we
want to duplicate hit ctrl T oops what
am i doing
yeah now select them both and if you
want you can make them out further or
bring them in just a tad bit all right
so that would be a sunny day actually
you know what I don't like that they're
all just going to be even so I'm not
going to adjust those so I undid that
all right and then let's call this
Wednesday we will let's take Monday and
duplicate that
and we will duplicate that one more time
what so they only get one nice sunny day
okay cool
all right all right so let me I go ahead
and just zoom out and see how this looks
I and see if there's any changes I want
to make to the layout here so first let
me take all of these put those in a new
group my ctrl G and then we'll call this
i-5 day and then we have all these oops
we want select all these layers hit ctrl
G call this radial temp okay so I here
is our template now I don't like how
things are spaced out it doesn't it kind
of seems a little bit funky to me right
now at this point so I'm going to auto
select group with the move tool and I
want to lock those layers we don't want
to select those and if I take these just
loops almost like the group let's give
you a pain in the ass I'll just take
these three
move that up slightly so we have even
white space and then I'll take the
radial temp move that up slightly and I
think that's pretty good to go right
there so we can consider this complete
now what I want to do is show you what
this looks like kind of like an iPhone
perspective view so bring up the
description below this video and you'll
see a source or a credit to a link and
that is going to bring you to this page
right here pixee den comm and they have
this free 3d view of an iPhone PSD and
you could download it right here it's a
large download side and not include that
in the project files for my site so it's
like 67 Meg's but once you have it I you
want to open that up so I'm going to
pause this and just get that opened on
my computer and this is what you're
presented with so if you take I this
group and drop it down you'll see this
right here called your screen you want
to double click on that and it just hit
OK and we'll go back to our original
design hit ctrl a edit copy merged and
then select the top layer just hit
control V and that will paste that in
and if you want you don't have to you
can delete those layers hit ctrl s to
save and there we go so let me zoom up
quite a bit this is large so only 16.7%
view right now I'm going to zoom out i
and then we could change the background
on here to any number of these that they
gave us to use but I kind of just like
this flat background right here and
there we go I that's a pretty quick only
25 minutes design of a weather app I and
it designed in the flat design trend I
so I hopefully you enjoyed this and
you're able you're able to learn a lot
um and if you want to check out design
course comm please do so I plan to have
a course a full
paid course along with certification for
mobile app design it's not done at the
time we recording this but if you're
watching this a month or two or a year
down the road definitely check that out
at design course comm and as always
check out check us out on the various
social media links that are in the
description and please like and follow
us wherever you can all right I
I will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
