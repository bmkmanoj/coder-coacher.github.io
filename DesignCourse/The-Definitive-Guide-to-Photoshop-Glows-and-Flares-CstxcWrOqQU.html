layer so control n or command and on Mac
give a name and hit enter then we need
to make sure that the foreground is set
to white and with the brush tool
selected let's make sure the hardness is
0 and the size is something as big as we
want and glow then just left-click very
simple the non-destructive way of
creating a glow or a flare involves
using the ellipse tool just left click
and drag out the size that you want and
then in the properties dialog box that
shows up you need to specify from solid
to a gradient fill and then change it
from linear to radial an inch into
gradient presets select the second one
which is foreground to transparent and
you can also experiment with the color
stoppers to change the appearance of the
glow and notice you can also hit ctrl T
to transform it and scale it without any
type of pixilation or destruction
occurring we can also add a glow by
adding a layer effect by doing this we
can just create a real quick ellipse
double click the right side of the layer
to get the layer styles and we can
specify outer glow
you can change the blend mode to normal
make it white and then experiment with
the spread in the size to get the
desired glow that you wish this too is
also a non-destructive way of creating a
glow next what we can do is take all of
our layers and duplicate them and then
merge them into a single layer and then
use filter render lens flare this is a
quick way of creating different types of
lens flares that come with Photoshop as
you can see you can experiment with
different types based on cameras
and then finally the best way to create
the most interesting look looking glows
would be to experiment with multiple
layers and also blend modes so here I'm
changing it to overlay and then I'm
going to duplicate it as you can see it
makes it much more bright and we can
duplicate it a third time hit ctrl T
scale it down and also transform it to
make it wider select move tool hit apply
and then you can also duplicate this
layer ctrl T and rotate it and you can
also further manipulate it
