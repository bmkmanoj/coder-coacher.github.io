hey everyone Gary Simon of course etro
today I just want to do a real quick
video that will cover a very specific UI
topic and that is whether or not you
should go to flat design versus maybe
something that's more 3d or has shadow
or gradients so I would say within the
last five six seven years flat design
has really taken you know hold in terms
of trends however I think you've done
correctly you can't really say that flat
is always better so I'm going to show
you my way in my approach of designing
first flat and then also doing a second
variation where you introduce gradients
and shadows and if you do it right it's
not actually bad so I'm gonna show you
here in the desktop we're going to use
just for this Adobe XD or experience
design and of course you don't always
you can use anything else the same
principles of course still apply so I'm
going to use a web 1920 and let me get
rid of the layers here yeah and so real
quickly I'm gonna make a very simplified
almost kind of sort of like a okay call
it like a a wireframe I'm not going to
do a full-fledged sort of layout with
all the bells and whistles but we'll get
most of it out alright so the very first
process or the first step in this
process is to always start with flat
first and then work in gradients after
so we'll replicate what we have here
after we have it done and then introduce
a variations will do actually what we'll
be doing to variations so basically a
total of three different attempts in
terms of color gradients and all that so
starting off going with flat I'm gonna
make a background I'm just gonna just do
like a mid blue here and for the
background I'm just going to keep it
kind of high in the middle in terms of
brightness and on the more desaturated
side I'll go ahead and also add that to
color swatches here next we'll have this
an actual container that will contain
the UI itself
and I'm not too
picky in terms of measurements and
making sure everything lines up
perfectly it's just for demo
although XD makes it very easy to make
sure everything's lined up and at this
point you could actually go with a white
container because it contrasts well but
I'm gonna choose a different route and
I'm gonna make the fill here first gonna
select this so we get the same color and
make it just a little bit darker so we
still have decent contrast on here
alright so I'm gonna take this and ctrl
D to duplicate it and we'll have kind of
just like a vertical sidebar over here
so we'll make this stand out pretty well
in terms of contrast for the background
and this container right here okay
outside of that I'm not going to do
actual icons here however I will kind of
simulate what it looks like when a given
icon is selected so ctrl D and I'm going
to just make this all the way up there
maybe change the hue just a tad bit and
there we go so you see it's very quick
and easy if you know what you're doing
to create you eyes so right here I think
I'm going to put in maybe like a label
of some sort like latest resources you
can't see that yet I'm gonna make it
white I'm gonna use Mont Surat however
you pronounce that I have no clue latest
resource is something like here
underneath here we'll have just three
kind of just container blips I'm not
gonna need to actually put any content
inside of them though and I'm gonna get
rid of the border for this I let's go
ahead and use this color I think that
actually looks pretty decent but maybe
I'll change it up just slightly right
around there
alright cool so now I'm gonna go ahead
and repeat grid pull it out and then
I'll adjust it right around there I
think that looks pretty even all right
and then I'll duplicate that control
I drag it down and then we'll just put
in I don't know some random label here
of other and then let me get out lips um
calm well grab some filler text we're
just about done all right so then I'm
gonna left click and drag out an area
for the type and then make it smaller
secondary we can go ahead and we'll make
the fill let's see here we'll get this
color here but we'll make it lighter so
it's not quite white but you could still
see it enough contrast okay so that is
it for the flat design kind of just like
a wireframe for this user interface so
now at this point let's say for instance
we want to experiment with actually
adding you know going beyond flat and
maybe adding a little bit of depth and
maybe some gradients so let's go ahead
and control D the entire artboard and
the very first thing i'll do is we're
gonna take this container here and we're
going to add a very soft barely
noticeable shadow that comes you know
kind of it'll come off to the sides but
it'll also be down a little bit more so
so the way we do that here is to put a
shadow and then we have our x
coordinates Y coordinates just make
those zero and then actually for the Y
we're gonna pull it down as you can see
it's coming down but we're also gonna
blur the crap out of it so we're gonna
drag that up okay so as you can see
right here it's barely noticeable
however it's it does give you a nice
sort of effect when compared with the
completely flat design on the left so it
would be silly to say that this would
always be superior you know it's rather
subjective so let's continue on with
this
one thing I don't want you to do though
when you're adding shadows onto pretty
much anything I'm pretty you pretty
pretty much never add a shadow onto a
logo in terms of like a nice soft a soft
shadow like this but for almost any type
of element whether you're using you know
you're designing for a user interface or
a poster design or any type of
composition what you don't want to do is
this that just looks like crap yeah it's
terrible you really need to mind how you
apply your shadows so I'm gonna back up
you can see this is this is in my
opinion a thousand times better than
just going you know completely you know
crazy in terms of your shadows like you
don't want to do that either you don't
want too much contrast in other words
all right so let's continue on we can
also add a shadow to this container or a
gradient rather and so what we'll do is
change from solid color to gradient now
let me first make sure we have this
color in the swatches because it's gonna
change up when we go to our gradient
here alright so now we can see we can
drag this around if we want you know if
we wanted to be 90 degrees we can leave
it as it is we can also make it kind of
more like 45 degree by dragging things
over here I think I'll do that
and so let's go ahead and make the first
one the color that we started with right
here and then the second color picker we
can experiment with we could start off
oops
yeah right there let's try to make it
just a little bit darker all right so
it's just barely noticeable once again
you know if we were to do something like
this that would not look good so it's up
to barely noticeable I think would work
well we go back to gradient I'm not
really sure if I like the idea of going
I let me move let's see if I can get
this adjusted here there we go I I think
I might want to just stick
with the 90-degree angle and that seems
pretty decent we can also experiment if
we want with adding gradients on to this
so we'll try that
and again there's really no right or
wrong here for the most part at least
so let's experiment we'll take this
color picker here and to go lighter even
if you wanted to now do you want to try
adding a shadow on this now this might
be a little bit too much so again
there's a fine line between excessive
and just right so let's try maybe zero
will increase this maybe take the Y up I
think is that cutting that off one
second here
okay yeah the actual the repeat grid is
cutting off from the bottom that's why
that was not working so instead all I
can do is this I can take this I'm going
to let's see here
ungroup the repeat yeah there it is
okay and then I'm just take these two
and delete them and then again you want
this to be very subtle I'm at five
percent opacity right there alright and
maybe that's okay we'll see so I'm just
going to take that repeat grid once
again and let's see here just a little
bit more we want the alignment to be
even from here to there basically all
right
and so you could even try further let's
say for instance you want to try added a
gradient on here again if you try to add
it on too many elements it might be just
a bit too excessive but it doesn't hurt
to experiment so maybe this one could be
on a 45 degree angle or so we could take
this I don't know maybe make it a
slightly different queue something very
barely noticeable in terms of the
gradient transition okay so that right
there will probably be ideal in terms of
trying to add some depth and color
variation to a user interface especially
when compared to this so again it's
pretty much subjective at this point
when we're comparing both of these in
terms of which is actually better
ultimately to find out you know based on
the project assuming it's live you can
find out by doing a survey but we could
take this a step further some other
things you can do in terms of
introducing more color with your user
interfaces so I'm going to duplicate
this
and here's just a simple trick I'm going
to show you real quickly so let's just
go to images at Google and you can go
anywhere that you can find free images
that you want to use I'm just going to
type in something random like mountain
all right so I'm gonna go to tools usage
rights and label for you reuse with
modification so you can use this and
we're not even going to see mountains
you'll see what I mean in a second let's
also change the size to exactly 1920 by
1080 which is our artboard size and
let's go ahead and I'll choose this one
alright so I'm going to on my other
desktop on my other monitor I'm just
going to replace that drag it on to the
desktop
close this out and then you can't see
this part but well maybe I'll show you
let me just show you right here real
quick just gonna drag it anywhere on to
the artboard make sure you don't have
any other element selected when you do
that alright so now we can take this
right here drag it up to the full size
and then we'll go to our layers drag it
down to the very bottom that kind of
looks cool already but then I'm not done
yet
let's choose a rectangle tool alright
and then hide the border for now the
color I don't really care about but
let's put it right on top of that that
photograph and then we can choose blip
background blur ooh look how cool that
is so you can control the amount of blur
so if you don't want just a little bit
that's fine if you want a ton like in
our case you could do that too so what's
really cool about this black mount black
around background blur is the fact that
you can change the color too and this
will change basically the the the hue
it'll it'll basically make it barely
notice the bowl so if we choose if we
change this to like a um let's see here
a red and the past let's see here
we turn the opacity up sorry about that
you can really begin to change the
entire original image if you will
depending on the background amount for
the blur the brightness is also you can
change so it gives you a lot of control
which is pretty awesome in my opinion so
I don't want red though let me just make
it let's see here if I stick with the
same blue area the brightness
I think it may just take the uh passing
down all the way yeah the brightness is
too much right there and what I'm
looking at when I was messing with these
sliders is you don't want I didn't
really want this container to kind of
just get lost into this background color
so if I were to select this again and I
took that brightness down you can see
all of a sudden and you get this
clashing of these hues right here so you
don't want that you want the contrast
there alright so again there's no 100%
wrong way to approach this well there is
again under this extreme circumstances
where you're doing something crazy like
you know that don't ever do that please
but yeah that is it really just for this
quick demonstration go through these
once again so this is completely flat
again it's very effective it's very
simple I'm glad this has become more of
I guess you won't call it I wouldn't
call it a trend because it's been around
for quite a while and I think it's been
a push back against we not this
necessarily but way overusing you know
these gradients these drop shadows and
all this other crazy stuff but again
this does not look bad
it's definitely effective in my opinion
you can mix the two styles by the way so
if we ungroup this we got rid of the
shadow and we got rid of the gradient
still looks effective but we still have
a little bit of depth as compared to
this over here and then of course this
one over here is just experimenting with
a different type of background again you
could die export this as a JPEG for
instance a low quality one it would
still work being that you don't need all
the fine edges because we
blurred the out of it all right
guys I the new year's gonna be here in
two days I'm really excited for the
content that's coming up and yeah we're
gonna be focusing on a few new
technologies that can be new at least in
terms of this channels content in the
direction that we've been focusing on so
I'm not going to get too much into that
now though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
