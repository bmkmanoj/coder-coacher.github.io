here and in this video I'm going to show
you a quicker way of getting started
with the QuickStart
for angular 2 all right so let's go
ahead back here and at the angular IO
QuickStart page which you can access
from simply angular dot IO and you click
on get started
you'll notice down here just under
overview you can also clone the entire
QuickStart application from github
so let's click on that so now we're at k
hub and we'll see we have the angular
QuickStart source and one thing I want
to note real quickly is this part that's
bold this is not the perfect arrangement
for your applications it's not designed
for production it exists primarily to
get you quickly started with learning
and prototyping in angular so just so
you understand that the prerequisites
are of course nodejs and npm which we
already went over in the previous video
and if we didn't if you didn't see that
go ahead and check that out my channel
or on the course at course cetera comm I
and also you're going to need get
installed and if you're curious and you
don't have get already installed
installing get we can click on this link
here and it will show you how to install
it on linux mac and windows so i'm not
going to go over that just know that
that's where you find out how to install
it if you don't already because it's
needed in order to run this from the
command line which is get clone and this
right here so what we want to do is just
copy this and I'm going to use git bash
already have it opened up here alright
so I'm in my examples and that would be
the equivalent of your project folder
and we'll go ahead and paste that in and
instead of just my proj
I'm going to name it angular - quicker
start and then hit enter and this should
go by pretty quickly
so now we can CD into that project name
all right and now what we can do let me
get this down first I want to go ahead
and open this up in Visual Studio code
so quicker start right here we'll select
folder and we'll just note a few
differences here based on the default
structure that the QuickStart guide
showed us in creating the initial app
structure we already have here an app
folder called app component tes again
it's the same thing
and we're also noticing that we don't
have the jaws the GS files because we
haven't yet run the npm installed which
would be the next step but you can see
the index dot HTML is here or and
there's also just a few other files that
we're not already created but the ones
that we manually created in the previous
video are already here so index.html we
have the Styles CSS and the main dot es
app module of TS and app component IDs
this spec file here is for testing okay
so real quickly we'll go ahead and run
npm install and you'll see it's
basically the same process also the
package dot JSON file again all the same
and it's currently doing the work so i'm
just going to pause until that is done
alright so it is now done and you can
see we have our node modules folder here
let's go ahead and type in MPM start
just as we did before when we did this
process manually and now let's go ahead
and open up we can refresh this and of
course if we go ahead and change for his
insistence in the app component TS file
what add a couple exclamation points
save it well
see it will automatically reload for us
so that there is the quicker method of
getting started I in installing an
angular 2 application all right so the
final way of getting angular 2 up is
through the angular client and so that's
what we're going to be focusing on in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
