Gary Simon of design course comm and
today is an exciting day for two reasons
versus January 1st 2014 and second this
is the first video in what will be 365
videos completed before the end of 2014
so we're going to be covering all things
design so Photoshop Illustrator html5
css3 we're gonna take a little bit of a
look at 3d in blender which is a free
application so right now if you would
just bring up another browser window
head on over to design course comm and
you'll see an area to submit your email
and you will get frequent emails about
design maybe new tutorials and videos
and also when I launch a full course on
my website so hopefully you'll do that
on your own free will if you like these
videos enough and not just because I'm
telling you to do it so this video our
first video we're going to cover mobile
presentations so basically if you've
ever seen the different designers
portfolios whether it be on dribble calm
or behance net you'll see sometimes it's
really impressive when they have the
actual mobile graphic user interface or
the website that showcase it in a
perspective view on a phone whether it
be an iPhone or Android or whatever so
we're gonna focus on creating something
like that and what goes into creating
that and imposing your own work into a
perspective phone
eye and we're gonna use Photoshop and
something called smart object layers
it's easy so let's go ahead and get
started so to get started the first
thing you want to do is underneath this
video if you're watching this in YouTube
it's click on the link in the
description which will take you to the
specific page on design course comm
where you can download the project files
I've also linked the two different
sources I for crediting the assets that
we're going to use in this group
description so let's go ahead to file
open
and here are the project files so
basically let's just go ahead and open
all three of these and this phone
example is the one phone design example
that we're going to use and this is
something I created a while ago when I
went to create a mobile app for Android
and then here's one view of a phone and
then just another one that's perspective
on its side so let's create a new
document and we're going to specify the
name as just mobile presentation and the
width I'm just gonna choo-choos here 800
and this works well with my current
resolution and then the height we'll
leave it around 2000 so we'll hit okay
and so we're at 25% I'm just gonna real
quickly change this background here to
white and it may already be white for
you I if you went to file new my
background contents that that if it's
been set to transparent so by default
they're white so that's why it would be
different if it was so I we have a layer
one and we've coated it in here with
white and now what we want to do is copy
our phone object here so what I want to
do is just take all these and just
flatten so we're gonna take the top
layer hold shift and then select the
bottom layer hit control E and that will
just basically flatten everything to a
single layer hit ctrl a to select all
and then ctrl C to copy so let's go
ahead and paste that in and as you can
see it's really large so I'm gonna hit
ctrl T and hold shift and scale down
right around there and we're going to
put this one at the bottom we can go
ahead and close this one out and then
I'm going to take this and I'm also
going to go ahead and flatten this I'm
gonna get rid of the glare I don't think
we need that so just take that layer a
top layer and hit ctrl E and then ctrl a
and ctrl C to copy and we will paste
that in right there
all right so I'm going to zoom up now to
100% or you could hit control wine and
we're gonna move this up make sure auto
select is checked with layer up there
and right around here seems good alright
so now what we want to do is create a
new layer so we're gonna go over here to
the rectangle tool and we're just going
to click once left-click and that brings
up the create rectangle dialog so the
width we're gonna specify 480 by 854 and
I'll tell you why and okay we go to our
phone example when we go to image image
size and we change this to pixels we'll
see it's 480 by 854 we basically want to
get the exact dimensions of whatever it
is we're we're dealing with to match
here obviously there's standard
dimensions and that is one of them all
right so I'm going to close out this one
real quick as well and then I'm going to
go ahead and hit control a and then
control C to get this copied and then
I'm just going to exit out of that and
for this rectangle one I'm just going to
get a gray color just so we can see it
and I'm going to drag it down here
alright so now what we want to do is
right-click on it and we're going to
convert to smart object so now it's
converted to what's not called a smart
object and you can see the icon changes
here to reflect that and what this means
is if we double click on this and we hit
control V to paste that our design and
then ctrl s to save if we close this out
or switch to the other one we'll see
that it now updates here now what's
really cool about this is now we can
take this go to edit transform and
distort so we can take this position
that there put this top right around
there and we're going to go ahead and
zoom up a little bit more after this to
make sure everything is placed correctly
take this there
all right and then when you have it
that's looking pretty accurate we can go
ahead select move tool and hit place and
I'm just gonna zoom up real quick and
I'm gonna do that again so we'll go to
file or we go to edit sorry transform
distort and we'll go ahead and drag this
up and that seems pretty good I'm just
going to use a mouse wheel and move
around here real quickly get around
there and then finally right there so
we'll hit place and hit control 1 and
there is our design so what's cool is if
we make any change to this over here it
will automatically reflect back to the
original document so if we went to
adjustments and brightness and contrast
and did this to it obviously you
wouldn't there's no reason to do that
but just to show you we can put anything
we can do anything to this document and
it will reflect here alright so I'm just
gonna undo that and then hit save
alright so now if we want to do this for
this one right here it's basically the
same process all we have to do is right
click and duplicate that and we'll go
ahead and scroll up we'll bring this
down oops
and then we'll go to edit transform
distort and we'll do the same thing
all right we'll hit place and if you
want to you can definitely zoom up and
correct anything mine looks a little
well actually done here and what we can
do so we can see behind it we can take
this app acity down quite a bit and then
go to edit transform distort you'll see
it's kind of off and drag this up
all right hit place get it back up 200
zoom out 100% if you don't think this
really looks too natural which I don't I
think the lighting is off what you can
do is come over here right click double
click on the right side of the layer and
we'll get a layer styles up here and we
can make some adjustments here so we
could do color overlay we can go to
moles make this black and be drop this
opacity down so that it will
automatically kind of match the lighting
it seemed too bright they didn't seem
real so if we just drop it down slightly
there hit OK and there we go we're good
to go
I so one final thing we could do is we
could take this first layer that we
created and duplicate that drop it all
the way down and say if we wanted to put
it there we can double click on the
layer style we can specify a drop shadow
and just tinker around with it just
slightly and play with the opacity and
hit okay and sometimes you'll see this
type of perspective view when it comes
to presentations alright so I that is it
so if we were to take any of these we're
all going to go to the same rectangle
one dot PSB layer and basically any
change that's made here will
automatically be reflected in all three
of these presentations all right so i'm
