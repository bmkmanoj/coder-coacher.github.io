challenge number twenty design what
you're best at and this is the review
alright so basically do something unique
I design what you're best at so in other
words if you're good at designing logos
then design a logo if you're good at
design I cause design icon but it has to
be based on the theme of animals okay so
it has to signify an animal in some way
shape or form okay so this was the
submission deadline was three days ago
in very few requirements so let's get
started so the first entry that we have
here is a 3d kind of a polygonum arced
entry and I didn't really know what was
happening here in the composition itself
I I obviously it is turtle swimming and
then it looks like i may be some waste
barrels or some just some type of
cylindrical I issues me oil spills
possibly if I thought about it enough i
but with clarifications picture of
turtles swimming through poison water so
that's not too obvious obviously because
I the water itself is looks like it's
crystal blue I yeah kind of needs a
little bit of work on the execution side
in the composition side but as in terms
of just looking at the turtles themself
you know it's pretty accurate you could
tell that they are turtle so thanks for
the entry all right and then right here
we have a logo design and looking at
this definitely animal relevant we have
some type of bird or dove or something
here and you know if I were to look at
this you know just without seeing the
type I think big deal it's a bird you
know there's not two unique I mean but
it kind of makes sense it is relevant
based on the name here the heights so
you know you have the heights you think
of the sky you have a bird so in that
regard it is good in the sense that
you're going to use something that's
relevant based on the name of the
company or whatever it is so thanks for
the entry definitely simple as well
always a plus I right here we have
something that kind of really confused
me I wasn't really sure what's going on
here initially so I I'm not the best
anything I think so but i also have an
easy
I can't post anything but still have one
design which I made for my game profile
you could say it is an ill an elephant
hose or a tail or something else so yeah
I definitely would have gotten in
elephant nose out of this thing right
here but let's just say for the sake of
you know me doing this review i'll go
ahead and review what this is so the big
issue is is I'm not exactly certain I
there's well I'm not certain at all I
mean I am certain that the issue here is
there's a design inconsistency so what
that is is you know you have the tank
fighter and you have these lines right
here they're all solid there's no
shadows there's no gradient there you
know pixelation occurring same thing
with this outer circle here but then you
have this thing here in the middle and
you have a gradient sort of effects
going in and drop shadows inside of
these things and what happens is it
throws the entire design off so if i
were to you if you wanted to keep if you
want to keep things consistent
especially when it comes to logos or
icons or whatever this is supposed to be
try to keep things designed in a uniform
and consistent manner so if you're going
to use this these type of effects use on
everything else I or vice versa if
you're going to use stick with flat
design do it on here as well all right
so thanks for that entry and this one
that reminded me something of something
similar that I did so I clicked on this
behance link and this is I the behance
profile page for this particular project
because he designed a tear on paper so
thanks for taking the time to do that
assuming of course you know I you did it
for this specific purpose in this
challenge I and so I just wanted to show
I something similar that I did probably
a few months ago and that is right here
and I put my on behance as well at the
time I and so mine was I based on a
drawing as well that i did and i kind of
just showed the process of I me doing
this design essentially all right so if
you look here between both of these you
know what is it that yours might lack
compared to mine for example I
let me get the white version here I'm in
what that is essentially is a lack of
shading and detail essentially so if you
take a bat look back between both of
these you can see I have a lot of
mid-tones and highlights and shadows all
worked out through here along with you
know just tiny just details and stuff
and it really helps bring everything
together otherwise these kind of feels a
little bit plain so you know if you work
in all these details and you work on all
the coloring and such it really brings
everything to life so that's one
improvement I say you could make on
yours alright so thanks for that entry
so we're going to come down here now
this one I assume is a photo
manipulation of some sort let me spell
out just a little bit or zoom out rather
just so we can see everything that's
happening here it would have helped to
see perhaps you know what images that
you composited assuming that this is a
composite and a photo manipulation of
some sort so I there's not really much I
can say about it because I don't know
exactly what's happening you know if
this this deer here were indeed imposed
into this scene that I'd say you did a
pretty good job but I don't know what's
happening unfortunately so I can't say
too much about it I but thanks for your
submission I silly zoom back up here
alright so want to make simple relaxing
penguin I'm not sure if he's too
relaxing but I that show that awesome
surfing penguins are okay I so looking
at this I there's two things that it can
say about it I the floppy creation text
especially with this design going
through the center of the text and the
amount of contrast it's that you see
between the orange the white and the
blue it conflicts too much with the
floppy kind of makes it hard to read so
that's generally something that you want
to avoid we're going to in here whenever
you have text you want it a lot you want
to make sure it has a lot of I contrast
based on the background that is put on
to I and you don't want a lot of lines
and contrasting elements going behind it
so I would probably move this over here
or there's a little more space that way
you don't run into those issues and then
secondly I would say this heart rate
here you can kind of tell that you know
this side of the heart is does not match
this side of a heart can I just throws
it off especially over here so I've just
taken this duplicated it flipped it
horizontally and knew would have been a
little bit better but that's just a
minor gripe but thanks for the entry and
then finally our last entry this wasn't
too popular of a challenge I we have
here a logo and there's a couple issues
with this I that could definitely be
improved first of all is the color
choice so this this orange with this
blue there's not enough contrast now if
we were talking about this blue right
here like this darker blue there would
be enough contrast for this but with
these two hughes here of these different
colors there's a little bit of a
clashing going on it's kind of hard to
see especially when you look up here
with this cat in the orange and this
very light blue I kind of gets lost in a
sense so you always want a lot of
contrast and when it comes to your
appointment elements secondly you have
they the animals like with this dog
right here on this text it's a little
bit it makes a little bit hard to see
the anim especially the they a between
the N and the eyes kind of just i
scrunched together so it's hard to read
initially so i will definitely extend
those out the spacing between these
letters and then also died i'm not too
certain it's always necessary to try to
depict every type of a and I'm all like
a bird dog cat and mouse I that just
kind of goes a little bit too much into
clutter in my opinion I so I would try
to work on a more uniform symbol aside
from literally depicting every type of
animal essentially all right so thanks
for the entries hopefully that was
helpful to those who did submit an entry
I so yeah look out for the next design
challenge video which will be number 21
here in a few days and I think you need
to stick to I me logo design because the
logo design challenges are always a
little bit more popular I so I
definitely don't want to do something
like this again there wasn't a lot of
entries so I yeah I also look out pretty
soon we're
to be working very hard me and Viv's
from slide nerd youtube.com / user /
slide nerd on coming up with a I mobile
app design and coding crash course in
some other stuff alright so I'll see you
