challenge number 11 and this time we're
going to do something completely
different and we're going to design a
custom letter R so type and designing
custom type is something that most new
designers haven't really done so
hopefully that I'm you know a lot of you
who are new aspiring designers will want
to challenge yourself because it can be
fun but also difficult I so I'm just
going to overview this real quick this
is the contest or the challenge thread
which you can find that design course
com / forums and basically the
requirements are as follows so it must
feature only one letter R and much like
these inspirational examples here you
can see that just feature one big single
letter secondly it must have a sci fi /
high-tech sort of feel so it should feel
like a high-tech or sci-fi font make
sure it's large enough to easily see and
make sure you have a good amount of
white space in or margin and padding
between the letter in the full document
so as you can see here we have the full
document and then we have a letter
inside of it a lot of new designers they
really just try to get a big large see
right up against the edges and it's not
a good thing to do because you want I
you want to frame your design you know
it doesn't necessarily even have to be
typed like anything you want white space
you want a good amount of margin and
padding all right guys let's see here so
the color selection is up to you because
just be a black and white design or it
can contain multiple colors or even
gradients or whatever but try not to
overdo it and if you are going to do it
try to do it so that it looks good and
not cheesy and then second make sure
it's the primary element or focal point
of the design don't try to design other
stuff like sci-fi buildings or whatever
in the background I mean I would mean
you can do that but make sure that this
is the main know the actual letter R is
the focal point all right and then aside
from that submission deadline is set
days from now 12 p.m. Eastern august
first and that happens to be friday
alright so that is it alright I will see
you next video all right now I hope you
enter as well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
