Tetro today I'm gonna show you how to
create a Photoshop mock-up template
alright so those of you who have already
been a fan of the channel know that just
yesterday I released a new course that
shows you exactly how to make five
different types of mock-ups in Photoshop
as well as how to make money by selling
them now some of you may still be on the
fence so that's why I'm creating this
100% free tutorial that shows you how to
create a very simple mock-up so it'll
show you the very skeleton portion of
the process now of course my course goes
into much more detail so if you're
interested in this sort of thing after
watching this free core tutorial rather
check out the description and there's
gonna be a link where I'll show you
exactly where you can access that course
store for 3 hours of content and it
shows you how to create again 5
different types of mock-ups and it also
shows you how to make my cell phone so
what we want to do I'm going to switch
over here to photoshop and we're gonna
open up from the project files which by
the way you can access again in the
description here in YouTube and you can
download them for free and we want to
open up photo jpg I'm going to ctrl H
just to get rid of the grid there and
this is a very simple scene that a shot
it just shows some business cards that
are completely blank along with a paper
by a clip remover or whatever and again
very simple I just going to show you the
very bare-bones process of creating
templates here so the first thing we
want to do is get the rough shape of a
business card using the rectangle tool
so obviously this is a rectangle so the
rectangle tool is what's going to be the
most obvious tool for the job now
business cards they can come in a bunch
of different sizes but the main size is
three and a half by two inches so if we
simply just left-click it'll show it'll
give me the option I just to specify in
terms of pixels so we don't really know
we can't really put 3.5 pixels by 2 it
won't work so what we want to do is go
to file new and everything showing up
off my other monitor no big deal for
the wick we want to specify 3.2 inches
and the height 2 inches and we wanted a
document type I customers fine we'll hit
okay and then we're do an image image
size and it's going to give us 252
pixels by 144 pixels that's what we want
so let's go back over here I'm gonna
left click with the rectangle tool
selected so it was 252 by a hundred
forty four and we'll hit OK now
obviously it's too small so we're gonna
scale that up control T hold shift and
we're gonna make it you see right here
where it begins right there and then
we're ends over here at the top of the
existing card from the photo we're gonna
make it just roughly the same size
alright if it's not too important but
that's okay right now so we're gonna
head just take the move tool and apply
that and what we want to do now before
we do any type of distortion to make
this sit perfectly on top of the
existing card we want to change the name
first I'll just change the name here to
your artwork and then right-click it and
convert to smart object very important
step so now it is a smart object if you
don't know what a smart object is don't
worry you'll figure out in a second now
what we want to do is we'll take down
the opacity so we can see the card
behind it so right around 38% would be
fine and now we want to transform this
so it fits on top of this business card
right here so I'm gonna go to fit
control t and then we're gonna rotate it
just slightly just to kind of roughly
match the card beneath it right place we
can hit cat will T again hit right-click
and then choose distort now you can take
these anchor points right here and we
can move them so we'll move it to that
corner of the card right here we'll move
this one over here to this corner of the
card we'll take this and move it right
here just beyond you see we can see
there's like I this is out of focus so
it's blurred a lot just take it slightly
outside of that blur
then take this final point up here and
we'll situate it right there once you've
done Nats like a move total hit a place
and there we go so now let's take it up
acity back up to a hundred percent and
we can see if you use pure white on your
color or whatever it was set at I will
see it doesn't match the background
obviously which is not a big deal so now
what we want to do is double click on
our smart object layer right here this
is going to bring up the smart object
document from which you can put your
design so let's go ahead and do that I'm
going to file open we're gonna open up
the business card - design AI and for
the resolution I'm going to choose 650
and we're gonna hit OK now this is a
card design that it did for my partner
Viv's
I'm gonna hit ctrl a and then ctrl C to
copy will close this out without saving
and then ctrl V to paste I'm gonna hit
ctrl T and we're going to get this
situated as closely as possible to the
correct size right there okay so now
we'll hit apply and then hit ctrl s to
save we'll go back and there we go now
this isn't perfect because the lighting
doesn't quite match up so if you hide
this your artwork layer we can see even
though these are completely white
because of the lighting settings since
in the camera settings it's a little bit
dark so we can fix that the way we'll do
that is with that layer selected we're
gonna go to I sorry one second window
adjustments and then we're gonna choose
hue and saturation now has a lightness
slider and we want to make sure though
before we adjust anything to click this
little icon right here and this will
make the adjustments only affect the
layer beneath it so now we could see
it's pointing down to it so now we'll
take this down so that it matches the
scene a little bit better right around
negative 17 works pretty well okay so
now what we want to do we could see if
we toggle this on and off the your
artwork layer we can see that the
original card that we place it on top
have a blur it's kind of out of focus
from this portion on and slightly up
here as well the camera was focused
right around here so we can emulate that
because obviously that detail got lost
we come up here we could see how sharp
of an edge that is what we could fix
that
with filters so with this lected we're
gonna go to the filter blur and then
Gaussian blur
now the Gaussian blur dialog right here
shows up and we'll see that it currently
applies it on everything which we will
fix in a second but right now we want to
try to match up the blur kind of
consistent with where it was before I
ran around 8.4 seems to do a pretty good
job down here of matching up what it was
so we're gonna hit OK and now to control
where the blur is placed we're going to
edit the mask right here so we click on
this little white rectangle and we're
gonna choose black for our foreground
color so make sure it's all the way down
here and then we're gonna take the brush
tool and we're gonna use a pretty large
brush around a thousand or eleven
hundred pixels and with the hardness at
0% and also we're gonna take the opacity
down around 31 percent and what we're
gonna do is again we're going to select
make sure this is selected the the mask
and we're going to left-click just in
this area you can see it's going to
start to get rid of the blur in these
areas so we could do it again in the
middle because this is where it is
focused at the most and there we go so
we could see right here that the darker
value that we were sort of painting in
there is now the area where the blur
itself is not being affected as much so
if you really want to crank this up to a
hundred percent to get rid of any blur
you can do that just like that
so now we can see it's much darker there
in the middle
and now we have this natural blur
occurring right here now what about the
other car behind it I it doesn't really
make sense just to have one car design
sitting on the top and then a bunch of
blank beneath it so the way you can do
that will take these two layers right
click well duplicate them and we'll hit
okay we're gonna move them down beneath
we're gonna hit ctrl G will call this
secondary card and then we will hit ctrl
T we'll hit OK for that warning and
we'll just slightly skew it based on
where the other card was sort of like
that let's like move tool hit apply and
then also we'll expand this group and
we'll double click over here for the hue
and saturation just make it slightly
darker maybe right around there and
that's it so now we can just collapse
this and if we want to make an
adjustment
we'll see it will make the adjustment
based on all the duplicates that we
created in this case we only have one
duplicate so if we double click this and
let's say for example we change the
color of the car just to show you real
quickly you in saturation
will come over here we'll hit OK and
then ctrl s to save
voila you see they both update
automatically and that my friends is it
so basically as you can see the process
in and of itself when you're dealing
with a pretty simple photograph like
this is fairly simple however you will
run into other situations where maybe
you want to make a mock-up template
that's based on a t-shirt and you have
to cut the t-shirt out of a background
that you don't want and you have to make
certain adjustments to the photographs
itself you'll see that it does get a
little bit more quite a bit more complex
and that's where the course comes in let
me just show you I'll switch back over
to the monitor real quickly some of the
projects that I have
and I'm going to open up that those
projects real quick from the course
files here and I'll show you real
quickly the type of projects that are
covered so m1 will have M 4 there we go
this was actually from the same
photoshoot as this one that I just
showed you right here except that just
narrow it in on a card but obviously
there's a lot more work that's involved
in cutting everything out here I also
show you another project there's five
total projects I let's see here we'll go
two and three and this one was is a
really fun one as well and there's quite
a bit of work involved in trying to get
everything correctly cut out as well as
creating these masks correctly and
displacements and everything so that's
just something to check out if you're
interested in making money and creating
these mock-up templates alright so check
out the course link in the description
here in YouTube and you can get the
course for dirt cheap alright so
hopefully you learned a lot and I will
talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
