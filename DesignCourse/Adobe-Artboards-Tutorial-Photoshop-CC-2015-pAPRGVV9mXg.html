design for song and Adobe just released
the 2015 CC update or Photoshop
Illustrator After Effects and all their
other applications and the feature that
I wanted to look at today is artboards
now artboards are basically a way to
have multiple canvases within the same
Photoshop document so this is
particularly useful for things like
responsive web design where you may have
mock-ups for different devices or
display advertising when you have
banners for a bunch of different
industry sizes all right so I'm going to
switch over to the desktop and show you
exactly how to use the new artboards
feature okay so let's go to file new
here in Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 we're
going to specify for the name banners
and we're going to specify artboard and
for resolution we're just going to leave
that 72 since this is web and artboard
size we don't have to worry about this
we're going to make our custom and it's
just going to be the size of the first
banner that we want to design so we'll
say 728 by 90 which is a common size
alright so the first thing you notice we
have the artboard 1 we can change this
by simply double clicking over here in
the layers and we'll change this to
728x90 and another thing right away if
you're new to 2015 is the fact that the
default background here for the canvas
outside of the document is no longer
this dark gray it's a real light gray
and I kind of like it a lot better
alright so it works just the same so say
for example if we took the wrap the
rectangle tool and we just come out here
you can see it just stays within the
document itself all right so I'm going
to delete that I rather will delete
after we place another one we're going
to take the rectangle tool and just make
something just a little bit larger than
document itself and delete that first
one and we're going to give it its own
color so we'll double click on the layer
we're going to change the foreground
color to something a little bit darker
so one eighth
five or 180 to five to be if you want to
use the same color code and let's go
ahead and give it to some type real
quick if it's showing up in the outline
when your type tool to say control H all
right so now we'll just type in
something like become a better designer
all right so mine was centering it so
I'm going to left justify it change the
color to white
hit ctrl T scale it up a bit right
around there is good and I'm using a
font called source sans Pro is free you
can google it and download it if you
wish also use the light version okay and
then let's give a real quick call to
action button so we'll use the rounded
rectangle tool this time for the border
radius we'll use for and I'm just going
to left click and drag out and I'll
change that color as well we'll change
this to kind of like a teal color a
little bit darker so that's zero one DEA
seven and we'll give this some text as
well so hit control H left click in here
we'll just say let's do it change the
color to this background color will
change its here to regular or give it a
little bit more thickness because it's
just slightly smaller control T and
we'll just Center that up select move
tool and hit apply all right so
obviously a very simple banner this
isn't a banner design tutorial rather
just to show how the artboards work so
let's say for example this is your
banner and now you want to create
another size I let's say for example to
be 468 by 60 which is another standard
size and basically just see scaling this
leaderboard designed down quite a bit
alright so what we do is left click
choose the artboard tool we have 728 by
90 let's change that to 468 by 60 click
on this right here
which is add new artboard left-click
once it looks like a change that 290
change that back to 60 and that is it so
now we can see the new artboard 1 double
click that will change as well so 468 by
60 and now we can see that we have our
two groups here so what we want to do is
take all these layers we're going to
right click and simply duplicate them so
right click duplicate layers it's
showing off my screen so you can't see
it's at the top and hit OK and we want
to take all these and drag them inside
this 468 by 60 group all right so right
now this right here is at the top that
needs to be at the bottom or inside
rather there we go and then we just need
to make just some really quick
adjustments so we have to become a
better designer text right here probably
going to need to scale that down so ctrl
T hold shift maybe right around there
and then our call-to-action button copy
so that's right here obviously too big
scale this down maybe right around there
so if move tool hit apply and there we
go very simple now let's say you want to
export these I there's also some new
features in Photoshop that makes that
very easy to do especially with these
artboards because we have two different
files essentially that we want to export
one that's 728 by 90 and 1 that's 468 by
60 so the way you do that is go to file
export and we could choose quick export
as PNG alright so basically it gives us
no options I'll have to do is specify
where we want to save it as so I'll just
choose desktop I'll hit OK and I'm
looking at my desktop it's showing off
of the viewable area right here but I
can double click both of them and there
we go very very simple now of course
you're not just limited to that option
of quick export
you can do export as and you can see
this gives us a lot more settings to
control so we have the 468 by 60 and the
728 by 90 and in any other artboards
that you wish to show would show up
there so the format PNG of course
transparency all this information and
then you can just simply hit export and
specify where you want to save it very
very simple to use the artboard source
so I know for sure myself I'm going to
be using this pretty much as a permanent
fixture for every document that I do in
terms of specifying file new artboard
and just because I really like kind of
how you can just create multiple
artboards and be able to quickly export
them so when it comes to web design
responsive designs for showing on a
desktop for his mobile awesome same
thing here for the banners good stuff
alright so if you enjoyed this please
check out a design course comm where I
have video courses right here that are
rather cheap I offer one on one design
training as well please check that out
and if you haven't subscribed here on
YouTube alright goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
