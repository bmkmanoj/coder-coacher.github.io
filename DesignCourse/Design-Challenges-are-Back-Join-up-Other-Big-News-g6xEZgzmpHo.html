calm and yes it's been a while since
I've uploaded a public video here on my
youtube channel but actually I have been
uploading a lot I just haven't been
notifying my subscribers you guys of the
video uploads because I've been
uploading frequently as a part of that
free angular for course so if you want
to check out those videos if course is
almost done I have a couple more videos
just to check out the main channel and
you'll see the playlist near the top
alright so also I've been hard at work
at Crosetti com and i've switched the
billing to a subscription billing
service if you want to access the paid
courses now the reason I did this is
because now you can just pay nine
dollars a month it's like a six pack per
month that you can pay me in order to
access all of the courses rather than
having to pay individually like nine
twelve or fifteen dollars per course so
you can watch all the courses you want
within a month cancel if you want
there's no commitments or you keep on
staying with that said also this is
going to piss off some of you guys I'm
sorry the good news is is that I'm
bringing back the weekly design
challenges where I critique your designs
to help you get better the bad news is
is it's only for the corset rope pro
account members to people who are paying
a monthly subscription on nine dollars
the reason I did this though is because
before about four months ago when I had
the last challenge I was getting so many
submissions and entries I really
couldn't spend an adequate amount of
time to really help each person as much
as I wanted to so this way you buy me a
six-pack every month you can watch all
the courses that you want and you can
also enter the weekly design submissions
and I will try to help you as best as i
can to become a better designer ok so
you can join up right now I add you know
become a cetera pro member right now if
you wish just go to Coursera calm and so
let me go ahead and switch over to the
desktop where I'm going to describe this
week's design challenge alright so head
on over to corset row calm here and i
click on
challenges or bring you to this page and
we'll click on here I design a vertical
navigation for a mobile app so that is
the content of this challenge for this
week all right so challenge description
all right so for this week's design
challenge you're tasked with designing a
vertical navigation for a fictional
mobile app so what I mean what do I mean
exactly by a vertical navigation well
down here under inspiration which you
can check out on your own I have some
just examples of the type of navigations
I'm talking about so if we go through
here you'll see if it's based on a
mobile app and a navigation that comes
out and so these navigation is there
sometimes overlooked because there's
secondary elements to you know the
primary user interface that you design
but it's still very important to get the
design right of the navigations so the
requirements and make sure you follow
each one of these ok the document should
be a width in height of 13 34 x 750 so
any other standard resolution that you
know is within that proportion of a
mobile screen will work but just make
things simple you stick with hair it's
going to be good ok also you can use
this bokeh background picture for behind
the navigation I or the app background
if you choose to show it and so that is
right here it's a completely free image
that you can use and just add it as the
app background the reason I I said just
to use this is because well I don't have
you know like a mock user in their face
a you can use and plus I wanted
something that you know there's a sort
of similarity between the submissions so
people don't have to focus on that other
stuff you know the primary main UI if
you're showing that as a part of your
design so you can just click free
download it download it all right and
also include the following items in a
navigation so the actual links like my
accounts location live search and logout
so make sure you use each one of these
and you're free to include other links
and navigation related content if you
wish for your vertical navigation and
then also this
very important he's follow good design
principles so simple is usually better
good contrast and make the type readable
make sure your type is large enough to
read make use of good white space margin
and padding and keep things consistent
in terms of designs in aesthetics okay
so don't be mixing mashing try not to
overuse shadows and bevels and glares
and glows because i always get
submissions like that but again if you
know if you just can't help yourself and
you're not sure what looks good that's
the whole purpose of this for me to help
rate you so you become a better designer
ok so the prizes you get a one free
month I of course etro pro so yes you
have to join course etro pro in order to
submit an entry here I which it will
show you a button if you're not
currently joined up to join and the
thing is if you win then I can tack on
or three months to your current
membership okay and this is what the
join page by the way looks like so if I
just go to join you see we have two
options so a nine dollar monthly
subscription and also a yearly option
which saves you about twenty-five
percent so if you go monthly again you
have the option to pay through paypal or
credit card right here and once again
you can cancel at any time so yeah I
hopefully you guys will join up and hope
that I get enough members to make this
worth it so I may extend the deadline
right now says n sex six days from that
not sex love and sex six days from now
and you know again I may have to extend
that a little bit based on the entries
and the lack thereof we'll see i have no
clue so alright i hope to see your
entries and also by the way if you
entered these before I you'll definitely
experience better quality and a more
attentive sort of rating for me and a
critique essentially so definitely we're
in my opinion all right but it might be
a little bit biased all right talk to
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
