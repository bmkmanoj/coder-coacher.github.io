today we are going to finish up our
scroll based css3 animations by rating
out some HTML CSS and then some jQuery
and making everything just kind of
animate and come together as you scroll
down the page alright so as always I
check out design course comm and
subscribe here on youtube if you haven't
yet alright so let's get started here
basically we want to work within the
body tags and the first thing we're
going to do is come over here and I need
to move something out of the way all
right there we go I basically we want to
get the HTML for this portion right here
so basically it's just going to be a
single div tag and then this in here so
let me switch over to I have like a
bunch of these windows open there we go
okay so div and I'm going to do one
second alright so ID we're going to call
this above the fold and I'm going to use
an h1 for the title scrolling CSS
animations with J query h1 and that very
simple and then the next is a container
for the actual portion that's going to
hold our three images so div class
container twelve now that's a predefined
class in our eleven forty CSS and so
basically it's just it's not really
important to know exactly what that is
for this tutorial we're going to give it
an ID of scroll so we can reference it
and then inside we're just going to have
our three images so image source equals
images slash phone PNG
we're going to give an ID a phone and
then just take this and copy it
pace that two more times so phone and
then we have the monitor and tablet take
these and copy those there we go
so that's all the HTML is very simple
all right so save that and now we want
to go into our style to CSS and actually
get started with our first tag which is
above the fold
alright so above the fold and inside of
it we're going to put a background color
so let's go to photoshop and get that
specific color copy that down there
paste that there the height is one quick
way the owning it is just getting out
the rectangular marquee tool copy merge
two control in its hide 759 there is a
tool for that I never really picked that
up on that though but yeah I think it
said 759 somewhere around there it's not
too important text - align Center and
then the color of course we want the
font to be white by default it's black
alright so let's go ahead and open this
up so let me double click on this all
right so this is what we're working with
so far alright so what we want to do is
change this to the appropriate font so
let's go back to style it's going to be
oops
bleep that by accident we're going to
put h1 damn my hands are not in the
correct position the keyboard font -
family is source sans Pro font weight is
300 and the font size we want to be a
little bit larger so 3e m and then
padding top we'll choose something like
325 pixels so let's go back and refresh
that and there we go pretty simple
all right so now let's focus on this
area we gave that a the Container 12
class and ID which was scroll so we need
to push things down work with that a
little bit
all right so scroll margin-top we'll try
200 pixels margin bottom 200 or you
could just do a single margin tag no big
deal
a text-align:center we want to get this
thing centered up and then this
reference the actual images so scroll
IMG and we're going to give them
position:relative all right so let's
refresh this alright so we text align we
mean be centered and they are positioned
relative so if we made them what we'll
do when you have a position relative
basically allows them to overlap each
other by using negative margins so
you'll see how that works pretty simply
so right now you know you fresh it
nothing happens nothing's animate so
that's where we're going to start it on
here so let's I go ahead and create a
class here we're going to call animate
and this is going to be the confusing
stuff if you've never really messed
around with this stuff so we're going to
put transition to s 4 seconds ease dash
and dash out all right
now when it comes to different browsers
you have to add you have to like
basically replicate this these a couple
times so oops
so you basically from Mozilla you have -
Mose then you have - WebKit and that
will just ensure that these all will
work on multiple browsers obviously the
older browsers it's not going to work at
all because it doesn't support animation
but anyhow um so that's our first thing
that we need to add and then what we
want to do is add WebKit - animation -
Phil - mo
that's ridiculous for words that makes
it stay on the last frame paste that
just doing what we did up there and then
one more WebKit
- animation - duration 1's
all right and so then what we want to do
we want to add phone dot animate and put
in transform translate 5e M comma 0
alright so basically what this means is
it's going to move it either up or down
based your wherever it's at from its
default position before this animate
class gets added with jQuery so this is
I basically the horizontal left to right
and then this is top or bottom so we're
not going to have it move up or down
we're going to have it move over by five
all right so of course we have to do the
same thing as in the top portion alright
and go ahead and copy that all right so
this is tablet we're not actually having
the when you have the monitor moving
that's not going to be move at all
because it's in a center but the tab the
tablet is alright so this is going to be
this going to move over by negative 10
so that means she's going to move left
or from left from right to left so just
take this copy that alright so still if
we look at the actual site we'll see
that you know nothing animates yet and
that's where jQuery comes in so let's
come out here and get our script j/s out
and very first thing that we have to put
which is what I put in every jQuery
document when you start out all the code
goes inside this so if it looks
confusing don't worry just basically it
makes it execute whatever coding you
need for jQuery so all right so what
makes this function we're going to put a
window scroll function
event all right and we're going to close
that right here with the semicolon and
we'll go inside of it
we're going to put var as a variable
we're declaring a variable y equals this
oops
scroll top and then here's where we add
our actual if statement if Y is greater
than or equal to 300 then inside here is
what should happen
so we'll put oh yeah the monitor is not
animating so why okay so it would be
phone add class as in CSS class animate
oops all right take this paste it and
make this tablet and save it so now
let's see what happens I know it's not
going to be correct but let's just
refresh this all right that's pretty
good except this is behind that so the
way you fix that is with a CSS property
called Z and X so we have to find oh
yeah I don't think we put it there so
it's just phone Z index - there we go
all right so now refresh this you'll see
that they come into place and if you
wanted to you know maybe start a little
later then what you do is change let me
get this out of here maybe - 400
there you go pretty simple so if you
want it to be responsive there's some
extra work that you have to do so you'll
see if we bring this in we have some
issues all right so here's what we need
to do to fix that basically we need to
scale those images down on the various
viewport width so if we go to 1140 CSS
we can come over here we'll see these
media queries and it's basically saying
that if the viewport width is within 960
by the minimum width it's 960 in the max
width it wicks that width is 1160 then
execute this CSS alright so the one that
we want to concern ourselves with the
first one is down here where it's 768 in
between 959 all right so I'm going to
just look in off-screen because I
already have the CSS when I did this
previously so basically what we need to
do is adjust the width the width and the
height of each of those so we'll take
the monitor first and we go to photoshop
and we find the monitor yeah it's right
there
go to image image size it'll let in
specify percentage over here if we take
this down by I think the 60% yeah it
tells you what the new dimensions are
361 by 236 so that's what we want to put
in there so we need to do that for each
of the other ones so let me get that out
now I'm not getting the right window up
there it is okay
and what I'm going to do is just paste
that in alright I already have this
typed out and so you need to do that for
the the actual tablet and the phone
alright so I already typed this out or
and you know what it is so I'm just
going to paste these in here these are
these values I just repeated that
process three times just seeing what
they are at 60% so if you save this and
now we'll drag this in and by the way if
hit control shift and I it'll bring up
this little developer tools here in
chrome the guy Firefox has the same
thing I basically move this off-screen
when I move this around it tells us our
width right here so the viewport width
now if we refresh this you'll see that
it's scaled down and it not works now we
have to do this one more time though
which is kind of frustrating but I if we
come back here well let me take this up
here and well actually I'm not going to
copy that actually let me yeah it's this
one right here for max width 767 so
anything that's within that is going to
get executed here so I I basically did
that same process with Photoshop except
instead of being 60% I made it 30 so
these are these values for that so now
everything's a lot smaller here so let
me get it down to a smaller viewport
width try like around for 12 or so and
you'll see now that these animate
correctly in there like fault you know
over up and down now you just notice one
issue is they animate too much because
it's smaller but it's still kind of
rendering everything I based on that
translation that we did so what we can
do to fix that is take our yeah this one
right here I am I looking at here
yeah these two copy those we'll go back
up to our first yeah right here just
underneath and paste those and this is
where you can decrease the amount that
they are basically moving over so three
three and then for the tablet
we'll try maybe negative six and when I
did this before the it wasn't executing
this so what I had to do is add
important at the end of each one of
these all right and then copy this take
it down paste it in and these values are
also slightly different one one one and
negative three all right and save that
all right so now we'll see that it
doesn't no longer the you know it was
going in a lot further and then we'll
come down here sorry my recording
application stopped because I was
running out of space but basically yeah
now this works correctly I at varying
viewport width so that will work on you
know like a tablet or an actual
smartphone
check out this over here great alright
so that is it for this tutorial now you
can know how to very you know you can
get so much more elaborate you can
happen even add keyframes I which would
enable you to basically control the
animation through different stages
throughout the length of the actual
animation and then you can also do so
many different types you can make these
grow in size you can flip them so it
really opens up the door to experiment
but of course also you want to be kind
of conservative you don't want to overdo
the animation it can make some phones
and devices lagging any of your
computers if you're overdoing it too
much so I yeah just something to be wary
of all right so I'm Garry Simon of
