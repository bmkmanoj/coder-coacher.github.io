calm and today we're going to take a
look at clasp binding and style binding
in angular 2 now both of these really
allow you to dynamically control the
visuals or the aesthetics of your HTML
elements through your CSS properties so
let's go ahead and get started by
creating a new project or if you've been
following along you could just use the
previous project to do this so you could
skip this if you wish but I mean here at
the github QuickStart I repository and I
want to copy this line right here and
then we're going to go to our command
prompt and I have here I'm in my code
examples folder and by the way I'm using
git bash if you want to use that as well
it's free and I'm going to right click
and paste and then we're just gonna call
this CSS binding and hit enter and then
CD into it and then NPM install okay so
once again just because this does take
time I'm going to go ahead and pause and
come back alright so now that is done
I'm gonna go ahead and type in MPM start
and this will real quickly launch our
light server and our browser here should
load up in a local host URL there it is
alright so my first angular app okay I'm
going to close this out here and we're
gonna go to the code editor and I'm into
CSS binding folder that we just created
and let's go to the app folder and to
the app component TS okay so for this
lesson we're going to focus on just
using inline HTML and inline CSS right
here in a component decorator instead of
linking two separate files that just
makes things a little bit easier and I'm
going to give ourselves some space here
and we're gonna define some buttons here
to use for this demonstration so the
first one we're going to put in button
we're going to give it a class of my -
BTN and that will allow us
- we're gonna define that as well in the
CSS and then also we're going to just
for now close this off and just put in
my well what call-to-action there we go
alright and then over here let's go to a
comma and specify styles open it up in
an array and put our back ticks there
which is the little character or key
neck usually to the left of your one and
we're gonna open it up and then inside
of it will define the my button class so
my - BTN and we're just going to make
this font size initially larger just
because on Chrome is a little bit small
so font - size is one point seven p.m.
and we'll save it so let's just make
sure we're on the same page all right
there we go okay so what we want to do
now we're gonna focus on what's called
class binding and here's how we add a
class binding to an HTML element what we
want to do is open up in brackets class
and then dot this is where we specify
the class name so we'll just name this
class extra - class and then we're gonna
hit equals and then some property and
close it off okay so now here in our
export class we're going to define some
property right here so some property and
we'll just give this a value of true and
we could give it a string it could be
anything as long as it's defined and so
what this is going to say is if some
property is an actual property then go
ahead and add that class to the HTML
element so let's go back here and let's
define some property and we'll give it
some type of distinguishing CSS property
where we know it will have been added if
it's actually added so we'll go ahead
and specify extra and
real quickly I think I'm gonna change us
this without the dash and you'll see why
later and we'll specify background is
black and then the text color we'll make
it white okay
so let's save it and there we go
so because we defined some property in
our component it's going to add this
automatically if we hit control shift I
and we click on this we'll see extra
class has been added to the class
attribute for a button and just to make
sure that works just make this false or
we could just remove it and we'll see
there we go it's not add it any longer
so that is class mining through a single
class property or CSS property rather so
let's also take a look at defining a
single CSS property through inline
styles so let's go ahead and I'm gonna
copy this up here and this time we're
gonna change this to style maybe border
and that is a CSS property right here
and then in here we'll specify some
property and we'll put question mark so
if some property exists we can specify
five pixels solid yellow and this is a
value for border and CSS or and we put
the little coal in there we'll put in
just none all right
so now let's go ahead and save this now
by the way we have it currently set at
false so neither of them are changing at
all so let's go ahead change this back
to true
and there we go we have our border if
that's been added and if we take a look
at the difference between these two
we'll see this one has the CSS added
through a class and this one we see in
line style CSS right here okay so that's
the preferred method of handling I a
single change to just a class or a
single CSS property through inline CSS
all right so what we want to do now is
what can we do if we say for example we
wanted to add multiple classes or
multiple styles through inline CSS so
let's copy over here all right said
already instead of copying rather let's
just go ahead and put two BR is here to
give ourselves space I'm gonna put in
button and class is my - BTN again and
this time we're going to specify ng
class equals and we'll specify a method
so we'll be set classes and we'll do
call to action and close the button up
alright and then down here in our app
component we have to declare our set
class's method so set classes and then
inside we're gonna specify let classes
equals and open up in curly braces and
we'll put in our class name that we want
to add or not add depending on the logic
so extra class and then a colon this dot
some property which is defined just
above right here and let's put in a
comma because remember this is only
worth doing if we add extra CSS
properties our classes and so now we'll
add another class and we're gonna have
to define that in the styles right up
here and this dot another property which
will have to create right now underneath
here
and then another class will just come
over here and we'll put in
font-weight:bold just something that we
can easily see and then underneath this
we're going to put in a semicolon and
then return styles or not styles classes
rather so we'll say this will come back
to our page and there we go we could see
it's all black and it also has our font
weight is bold right here okay so what
about multiple inline CSS properties
through this style
okay well it's actually very similar
let's copy this and we'll put in this
time it's defined as ng style and this
is going to be set Styles as you can see
it's very similar and we'll define that
here so set Styles and then let styles
and then inside of here this is where it
gets a little bit different so we're
here we're defining classes over here
we're going to be defining styles here
so these are going to be CSS properties
so we'll just try font - style this dots
some property if it exists then let's
make it italic and then if not we'll
make it normal and then we'll put a
comma let's do another one font - weight
and we'll put this dot another property
if it exists then we'll make it bold and
then if not we'll make it normal okay so
now semicolon at the end and then
specify return styles so let's go ahead
and save this
and there we go it's italic and it is
bold which is defined right here for
font weight and font style and of course
you can also add an exclamation point
and that will change the logic for font
weight and you'll see and if it doesn't
exist it's not going to make it bold
alright so that is basically how in a
very simple manner the class binding and
style binding works in angular 2 alright
so I'll see you in the next lesson where
we're going to take a look at angular 2
animation alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
