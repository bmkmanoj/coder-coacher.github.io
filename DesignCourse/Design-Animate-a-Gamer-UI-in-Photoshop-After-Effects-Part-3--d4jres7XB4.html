calm today is February 11th and we're
going to continue on in Photoshop
exporting our images and then we will
import them into After Effects and get
everything ready to go for tomorrow when
we begin animating so as always check
out design course comm and if you
haven't yet subscribe here on YouTube
alright let's get started alright so I
let us go ahead and start getting these
layers prepared for saving so what I
want to do is probably just start from
the top down
in terms of what we see here so you know
we're not going to need this text to be
you know we're gonna do this text and
after-effects so we don't need to save
that text or anything so I'm just gonna
hide it and then let's take a look at
these button things so I think it would
be cool - yeah there's group on okay so
they're all in these groups right here
I I think it would be cool to make them
not lit up in that little blue kind of
color in the middle for like the LED
lights or whatever so what we could do
is duplicate those three control shift D
and open each one of them up get rid of
the shape one and each one of them okay
and let me close those back and hide
these ones no man I think it deleted the
wrong one
oopsie yeah I deleted the flayer by
accident so let me back up ctrl alt Z I
yeah I got to delete the right thing
here apparently that is that okay so
it's the middle layer and so ellipse one
copy that's what we want to delete there
we go alright so then what I'm going to
do is take all of these and just group
on
on the same or merge them on same layer
so ctrl e with all those groups selected
so now they are all raster din their own
little layer okay so we want to do the
same thing for the ones down here too
so these as well will be grouped so ctrl
e alright so now we have this and then
you know put this at the top and they
light up and they all light up like one
by want to so we'll do that in and after
effects alright so now let's go ahead
and just save this
I just ctrl a and then just select all
and then ctrl C and then ctrl n just hit
OK make sure the background is
transparent that's very important and
then paste that in with control V and
then save for web so ctrl shift now you
know what let's make them not PSD I
forgot so save that control us and
create a folder wherever you're working
called assets and save them in there and
so this is going to be LED lit or light
I meant lit but I put light instead I
and then we'll just select on this layer
I think we're still yeah just hit ctrl C
make sure you had that selection still
going and then um they're all the same
size so just go back to this here paste
that in save as LED not lit alright so
now we have those saved that's good to
go
let's I go back here um zoom at again
alright so now what we want to do is and
also I'm gonna hide this is save trying
to think about how I want this little
interface thing to I kind of build
itself
it's think here see I haven't actually
done this yet so I'm just gonna doing
things on the fly probably not a great
idea alright so I yeah what I'm gonna do
is let's I make sure auto select layers
on
yeah it sits on some layer I think I'm
gonna keep it just like that
so I control Lake which we'll see there
a new layer it okay
save that we're gonna we're just gonna
call this mean UI yeah - UI all right
and then also we have all right let me
see here these these glow things here
let's work with those all right so we're
only going to save out just this side
and then we can just flip them and
after-effects to do you know deal with
this over there so what we want to do is
okay my kids are being loud be quiet
I is I let's take this this first one
right here you know what you can't
probably get away with recreating these
glows solely and after-effects because
they do have tools
it does have tools rather to do this so
you know what mm-hmm we'll see if we can
get away with just handling that
strictly with in after-effects instead
of saving these so yeah we'll scratch it
I think all these can be recreated so
what we'll do is just hide these for now
all right so then we have this thing and
these are all on its what no no let's
take those first and I just kind of will
merge those so ctrl e all right so we'll
just take one of these copy it file new
paste it not safe or whether we just
ctrl s and we'll call this sub - UI all
right so we will just we'll just flip
this so we don't have to create like
this one over there and what else do we
want to do let's take this thing all
right so you know I also believe there
is a plug-in or if in effect rather in
after-effects that will kind of create
these lines possibly so I'm I'm not 100%
certain I think we can so I'm just gonna
know
save that for now let's see here and
over here this portion as well because
you can do you know you can create your
own rectangle and you can create also
your own gradients I believe this as
well can be recreated with in
after-effects so you know whenever you
can create something natively without
having to import stuff it's pretty much
a good idea to do that so we'll leave
this here and if we need to come back
and you know for whatever reason make it
an image we will do that all right so
then we got these things down here
yeah okay so I'm going to take those and
hit ctrl E and now they're on their a
layer and let's see here we have this
thin bar thing in the middle
you know I you could we can get we can
definitely get away with creating that
alright I had to pause a video it's like
banging on my door alright so I let's
see where was hi um let me go ahead and
you know what I'm gonna leave these on
their own layer so just ctrl a ctrl c
ctrl n enter ctrl V paste and control
last save hopefully I'm not moving too
fast am i alright so what was called
these I thin bar and come back here ctrl
D to deselect and okay so let's go ahead
and hide some of these or all them
rather and yeah this is well we can
create this glow and after effects and
then we just have this cloud texture and
I'll save that just ctrl C actually no
edit copy merged so you have copy and
then copy merge what's copy merged well
if you copy this it's only gonna select
this layer and we have an opacity on it
so if you try to save that it would just
be you know like this
thing that did not look correct but copy
merge will copy everything that is
currently in view pixel for pixel so
file new paste that and then save and
we'll call it's cloud or you call
background might be a little bit more
relevant okay so that that's basically
all of our images now to bring
everything back here yeah this one this
one this one this one and I think that
that no it was actually yeah that too
okay alright so now let's go ahead to
After Effects go to file new well we're
already on a new project so composition
new composition I will call this gamer
UI whatever and then 1280 by 720 which
just matches our Photoshop document and
then everything else yeah we don't need
something that's nearly an hour long
more like 0-0 there and then maybe just
I don't know one minute all right so
background color let's make it pretty
dark hit okay and then okay alright so
if you've never used After Effects
before you know don't worry we're not
gonna be doing anything so insanely
complex that you're not gonna you know
your heads not gonna fall off or
anything so um yeah to basically real
quickly you know a hundred percent again
we run into the issue even more so
because there's more stuff going on here
in the interface that we can't really
see it so just use your screw will and
that puts me at fifty percent and that's
fine so now what we want to do is import
all of the images that we just created
alright so let me go back so right click
import file and here's all the assets
that we created so you just take like
all of them hold shift import and you
may have a dialog that comes up that's
asked you if you want to flatten them or
whatever just hit OK it's no big
all right so let's get our background on
first so place it on there there we go
pretty easy so far yeah all right so
let's think about how we want things to
come in so this is our main kind of bar
thing that we created and we just drop
it there I now we have some options you
know in terms of how we want this thing
to come in but let me think here let me
push this up just a little bit sorry I
had to pause it and it's always going
back to that thing I had to think about
you know how I want to approach this I
think what we want to do is kind of just
build everything all the layers back
where they need to be before we apply
any type of animation so we'll do that
first so we have this here and then we
also have beneath that would be we could
approach this several ways you know in
terms of what we want to add it really
should be added like in terms of you
know what is on top of each other and
the the layer order down here I in terms
of what will be animated next
so the obviously we have this background
we're not we're not doing anything with
the background then the first thing that
we're gonna see that's animated is this
the main kind of user you know the
interface or whatever so that comes next
so what would logically come after that
well we could take these and you know
what that should have probably been
baked into this image here that's not a
big deal though we can just add it right
there and we can zoom up here
now you've holds your space you can just
left click and just pan that view a
little bit and then you could take your
arrow keys and get those into position
and let's click on here that looks
pretty good right there and here's a
quick tip yeah you just duplicate that
control D this layer and then you
take LED light hold alt so make sure
this is selected and this is selected
hold the Alt key drag it on top and so
basically that replaces that content but
it's it's the same exact location all
right so we have those all lit up so now
what we want to do is build out the next
piece so what would come after that well
maybe the things on the side or down
here so let's just focus on those yeah
and the thin bar yeah there it is and we
want to get this placed those will be
underneath the main UI all right I think
that looks good all right so what else
yeah we will manually create that little
thin line down here so let's zoom up to
a hundred percent space and left-click
to get this in view and up here we have
the rectangle tool and so I'm just going
to drag a thin line right around there
okay and if we kind of click off of any
anything we can see it's just black
right now so if you select it and the
fill is black there's no stroke because
it's zero we want to leave it at that so
we can click on fill and we can make it
a gradient a linear gradient hit OK and
then we can eat adjust the gradient
right here and I think I just want it to
be like yeah like a dark grey and this
right here is 0% opacity so if you
select this upper portion or upper
picker rather just but it's a hundred
percent oops
drag that off and then take this and
maybe bring these a little bit closer
together okay
now if we look at this because these
outlines are kind of a you can't really
see what it looks like let's just see
right now it's going from left to right
but we want it to go like a vertical
gradient so if we take real quickly if
you take sorry about that Jesus Christ
yeah if you click on rectangle one right
here that is where you see this little
thing that will show up and this lets
you adjust the angle of the gradient so
you click off here
this is kind of you know what I'm going
to take this brighten things up
click on this here click on rectangle 1
there has to be a way I should research
this yeah there we go now it's you can
kind of see that very thin gradient kind
of just more trouble than it's worth
alright so now that we have that ready
to go let's go ahead and add the side
portion so where's that at
yeah sub UI okay um let me think here
yeah you know what I'm sorry we're gonna
go back to photoshop I'm going to hide
some things and ctrl a ctrl c ctrl n
enter ctrl V to save it and we're gonna
call this a sub UI we're gonna overwrite
that file it just makes sense
oh yeah you can't save over it because
it's open for after-effects sorry about
that let me get rid of that and
hopefully it'll let me save now over it
yeah okay I'll just save it as an
entirely new document sub - UI - all
right so it didn't really make sense to
separate those so I apologize for that
import that file okay and I that dialog
showed up off the screen that's why you
didn't see it and place it right there
kind of just snaps into place
automatically and you know we want this
to be below the main UI just drag it
down right there all right
almost done with constructing this
layout here
okay so now what we want to do is take
the yeah where is it ours our lights at
there you know that's right we're gonna
construct those and after-effects
alright so let's go ahead make sure no
layers selected down here we'll take the
ellipse tool and holding ctrl and shift
select right around here we'll take the
fill change that to a radial gradient
hit OK change this here
alright well space those out this one is
going to be like a bluish color and this
one is gonna be like black except zero
opacity all right so we can increase
this by holding shift all right we got
to put this beneath the appropriate
layer so let me find that let's see here
I think it's in between those two yeah
that's it alright so okay that looks
good now let's take this and I'm going
to duplicate that so ctrl D and make it
smaller and move it back into place and
we're going to change the fill color
here we had like a lighter one kind of
like right around here hit OK alright
and then we had that other one you know
like the thin layer one over here so
duplicate that ctrl D squish this thing
down and pull it out
oops what am I doing here yeah if you
just drag it back into place after doing
that change this here to white this to
white as well hit okay and don't worry
we're not gonna see the stuff inside
here in a second all right
and then we will duplicate that control
D and really make this thin take this
one hit T that's a shortcut for opacity
we could set a keyframe right here and
take the opacity down all right and then
oops select that thin line maybe move it
out a little bit more oh man I messed
that up accident let me back up there we
go somehow I screwed that up
okay take the layer above it and just
move it out to the left with your arrow
key alright so if we zoom up looks
pretty good pretty much accurate you
know based on what we had earlier and we
can take those layers let's see here
holding shift selecting all those and
yeah we can go to layer precomposed it's
showing it's not showing in the video
but it's at the very bottom of that menu
and we'll call this flare and move all
attributes into a nuke up into position
it's kind of like grouping layers in
Photoshop except for After Effects
alright and I'm not going to worry about
duplicating this over here yet because I
want to animate it first yeah and so now
we have that did we get that sent no
okay we left that up too yeah we're
almost done here now we still have to
create
eight this portion inside here alright
so we'll go ahead and do that real quick
rectangle tool drag out right around
there now we have to edit the V fill so
we want this to be linear hit OK you can
adjust this drag this portion down and
adjust the gradient so top and bottom
yeah will be black this is going to be a
hundred percent oops and then I want
this to be black as well put one right
around here I never forget I think it
was like a yeah color like that so just
remember that and then will come out put
another one right around here
and hit OK let's zoom up all right and
we also kind of had like these well if
we look back over here this inner glow
type thing so let's go back there and
yeah so if we go to effects in presets
over here and we type in inner glow I
thought they had an inner glow am i
doing well let's just put glow stylize
glow let me just add this and see if
this works hopefully we can change that
to inside so otherwise I'm going to look
stupid
yeah so I had to pause that because at a
stupid moment we're going to remove that
and go to layer layer styles inner glow
alright so now if we have if we come
down here we go to inner glow we can
have we have our options so let me just
move everything up all right so the glow
color once again they use this yellow
color for some reason and I will change
that to black and what's cool is these
are all they can all be animated so
maybe we'll do that when we get to the
animation portion we're like 25 minutes
man all right so now we we can adjust
the choke and the size let's see the
size if we pull that up screaming you
changed that to normal there we go and
that looks like it's pretty good already
let me there I think that's pretty
decent okay cool
and what the hell this moved somehow let
me find those just take both of them
hold shift and just move them back up to
where they're supposed to be on the
hollows got moved oh man you know what
they were in the correct position
already sorry about that
don't do that this is just on top of
everything that's why this needs to be
brought down beneath the correct area
mmm let's see here yeah I'm gonna have
to adjust these layers a little bit
these flare things that needs to be
all right and yeah this needs to be
except beneath it still wears this hat
okay this needs to be right here okay
sorry
there we go now it's all correct okay so
you know what this is too dark Amer but
we kind of applied it a pasady to that
so just hit te capacity take that down
see that looks like maybe a little bit
more and it needs brought beneath these
things weren't these at we're sub UI
okay so take a little shape layer one
bring it beneath sub - UI all right cool
all right so you know just to keep
things consistent let us take our flare
and I am again I am just gonna no you
know I'm not gonna duplicate that and
that's unnecessary work at this point
alright so let me go ahead and we'll get
the text out here so let me we'll just
yeah can we drag out like that yes we
can and then just put our text that's
like way too big no problem and what was
that yeah I think troll ball one dial
100 K or something I let me know what
I'm typing and then I yeah we have
source sans Pro I'm gonna change mine
take the size down a lot go right around
there you can drag this up just like
that move tool bring it there good 100%
the color we can change kind of like
this aqua color and then we can put
agloe on it I think that looks cool
right there all right okay that is it
we're already out 30 minutes practically
so tomorrow is when we're gonna finish
this thing up and actually get the
animation running so yeah check out
these on course.com if you haven't yet
