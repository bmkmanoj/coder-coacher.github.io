today I'm gonna be doing a logo redesign
of the school sucks project so what is
that well it's a they're running YouTube
channel a podcast and a website and they
put out very thought-provoking
information that reveals some of the
facts and the truth surrounding public
education and so this is a topic that I
feel very strongly about and they have
this one particular video that I suggest
you watch I'm gonna link it in the
description the first link here in
YouTube so go check that out it's a very
cool video I think it's like eight or
nine minutes and it's very revealing and
I'd say it's definitely true so anyhow
they had posted on their Facebook that
they wanted a logo redesign and so I
volunteered to do it I'm not sure if
they're gonna use what I produce but I
just wanted to create a video showing me
redesigning that logo and just
describing why I chose what I chose to
do so I'm gonna show you the before and
then the after all right so I'm gonna
use the Adobe Illustrator and subscribe
here on YouTube you add if you haven't
yet and subscribe here on YouTube
alright let's get started alright so
this is the existing logo that is to be
redesigned basically for the school
sucks project now we can see that it's
almost borderline I I guess you'd say
like a banner more like because there's
a lot going on here alright so obviously
first we have the depiction of the
school with a flag and then the children
which these individual guys right here
it's hard to tell what exactly is going
on it almost looks kind of like a penis
I'd say but I would bet high that's not
what the intention is this is probably
the arm and this is a backpack so we
have all these going on and then of
course a student turning away once they
realize that school really does suck so
there's a lot going on here and ideally
when it comes to a luggage line you
is better and which is great because
that is what you know the person behind
this requested so I just gonna just
wanted to show this the preview first
before I go ahead and just try to
reorganize it so I'm gonna go to file
new here and 1000 by 750 points actually
that's when I have my desktop at a
higher resolution I'm gonna choose 860
by 600 and that fits pretty well I I'm
gonna leave the color mode to RGB that
way you guys could see it easier
brighter colors and hit control one just
to get 200% alright so looking back here
one of the things you know when it comes
to locate redesign or a rebrand you want
to try to keep some of the elements I
with that transition so I knew I wanted
to keep like a a thicker font a bolder
font we wanted to keep it
sans-serif and wanted to keep the red
for sure so with that in mind I found a
font I'm just gonna type in real quick
school sucks as it does true the
statement and for the font I'm gonna use
future Extra Bold alright so you mean
just how it's designed of each letters
it kind of makes you feel just schoolish
in a way but it's real it's a thicker
font so I'm also gonna take the letter
spacing it's around negative 50 and then
I'm going to hit ctrl C and ctrl F and
then change that to project and I
shifted it over here and then finally
we'll get the tagline education
evolution and this is going to be in a
different font I don't have future in a
and any other weights unfortunately so
this font that I chose I think it was
called hammer Smith it's a free font
future is not a free font by the way but
I
I think this went this worked well with
these two so I also took the letter
spacing I think to about a hundred and
got it in right around there and a
project as well I because of there's
gonna be a design right here I took that
size down roughly right around there so
you can see the difference already
between these two I decided to instead
of just squishing down school sucks
and having project real big the most
important part of this logo in terms of
the name at least would be school sucks
so I wanted to make that the emphasis
rather than having project so I'm going
to go ahead and just take all this text
and hit ctrl shift and the letter O and
I'll convert it to outlines and I'm
gonna move first I'm going to right
click on this and hit ungroup and then
select these five letters hit ctrl G to
group those and then these two ctrl G
and to group those as well so I'm gonna
move this over just a little bit holding
shift right around there and I'm gonna
make it red very simple and you know red
of course is a color that's associated
with passion and anger so it's perfect
for sucks right there I want to move
this over just a little bit and because
I want the emphasis to be on school
sucks I I decided to just make this an
outline so I'm gonna hit ctrl H to get
rid of those vertices and then go ahead
and put in a value over here just maybe
three just a start and then also it's
like none for the fill and take this
down to maybe two I think that'll work
all right so
now that I have that what I want to do
is scale this down just a little bit
more all right
and actually this will be scaled down
just a tad bit more all right so if I
just copy this and bring it to hit
control one over here actually scale us
down we could see an immediate
difference already terms of simplicity
this obviously has much more although
we're not finished with it yet but when
it comes to the type we have the
emphasis on school socks as opposed to
project over here I understand they
already have this red and make it a
stick out but just in terms of the
layout and the orientation of it we have
this works much better in my opinion so
now what I want to do is switch back
here and so when I was trying to think
about you know what I wanted to do in
terms of the symbol whether it be a
separate symbol or something that's
works in conjunction with the letters I
came up with an idea just as I was
sitting here just looking at these two
O's and thinking about okay maybe we can
use the O's to emulate eyes and a face
so that is a direction I took it so I
took the pen tool and I left clicked
right there and then left clicked again
right around here and just created like
a grumpy mouth I guess you could call it
so I take the selection tool just click
on it come over here and I I got rid of
the fill and then gave it a stroke here
and it was a pretty thick stroke kind of
match the text up above it and pull this
in just a little bit so we already have
a grumpy face and to further emphasize
and make it relevant towards a student
or school I put a graduation cap on top
like this so what I did was I took the
pen tool actually no not yet regret
tangle tool create a perfect square by
holding shift alright and then rotating
it holding shift
and then I took the free transform tool
and if you hit ctrl + alt you can kind
of create a perspective out of it and so
that gives you the flat sort of diamond
graduation cap top portion all right and
then real quickly create the portion
that actually fits on to your head and
for now I'm just eyeballing this and
ctrl Z to try to make these line up over
here and then create this portion down
right around here and what you would
want to do ordinarily is get out the
grid and make sure everything is
identical but I'm just kind of quickly
going through this just to show the
thought process rather than being too
specific yeah that'll do for now this
isn't the one that they're actually
using I and then just to create the
little string that dangles down there
whatever that's called I take the pen
tool right around here in the center
have it come out there and then hold
shift and just make it come out there
click on it with the selection tool and
then get rid of the fill make the stroke
black no no no what am i doing white
sorry about that and if you control
whine that's a little bit too thin so
take it up to two and then finally so it
doesn't look like it's an owl and it
looks like an actual mad angry face or
whatever I take the pen tool and create
like a brow line actually real quick
before I do that make that white get rid
of the stroke
now just come down here now it looks
mean or mad or frustrated having to do
all that busy boring BS work you never
have enough to use painted dr. nated
your life
alright I'll shut up I now I'm gonna
leave that yeah I'm just gonna leave
that hate there for now and what I'm
gonna do is actually gonna move it down
sorry about that
alright so essentially this is the final
logo that I came up with so let me move
this over here and so there we go
I take this over here and just get these
aligned up so that they look like
they're around the same size oh also
object path and do I outline stroke
there we go alright so now that we can
see I know and also what's cool about
this is I let me ungroup that is this
individual can be used separately as an
icon it works pretty well
alright and so there we have it so you
know we have all these separate elements
here that we've basically been able to
condense into something entirely
different but though it has the same
general idea and overall the entire logo
the mark is much more simplistic and
you'll be able to use it a lot more
easily on various mediums such as a
website or print or anywhere and that is
it now of course also it should be I
should note that this was isn't the
final 100% finished logo they may not
use it but you would also of course want
to use the pathfinder to make it so that
this is all transparent and stuff which
i did and that look the final logo but
yeah if they use it cool if not I don't
really mind
I supported other projects in the past
just
by doing free work just because I agree
with their message so yeah that's
certainly one way for you new designers
to build up a portfolio you know there's
a little if you're interested in
something or you're passionate about
something you can find people who have
sites or websites or starting businesses
and you can offer your design work just
because you agree with their message all
right so yeah check out design course
comm if you haven't yet I'm going to be
releasing or launching design course
premium very soon I hope within the next
few weeks so check that out and
subscribe here on YouTube alright I will
see you tomorrow with a new video
