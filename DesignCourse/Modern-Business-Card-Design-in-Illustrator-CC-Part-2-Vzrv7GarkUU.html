calm
today is February 6th and we have our
second video of the business card design
so yesterday we created a business card
design for a front and back in adobe
illustrator CC and today we're going to
going to use photoshop to take those two
front and back business cards and kind
of create a cool perspective 3d ish type
of view a presentation of the business
cards basically alright so if you need
access to the project files they're
available free here in youtube down in
the description and if you haven't yet
check out these on course comm and
subscribe here on youtube all right
let's get started alright so I now we're
going to take this and get started by
going to Photoshop here now we don't
want file new we'll go to file open and
we will open up the back a I in the
front - outline so hit open and
everything basically stays the same on
this dialog so three hundred and three
point seven five two point two five hit
OK and ok again for the second one so
now I'm going to just take the back hit
ctrl a ctrl C to copy everything and
paste it in here alright so now this not
this is not the actual size of what the
business card would be it's a little bit
too big because of the bleed so with the
rectangular marquee tool selected come
up here specify 3.5 in4 inches by two
inches for the height so we can just
click once around right around there and
that gives us that exact dimensions you
can use the arrow key to kind of adjust
this an eyeball it's you know kind of to
where it would be when it's cut so this
is where it's actually going to be cut
so now we hit ctrl C to copy this ctrl n
hit actually you know what I going to do
I'm going to change this real quick to
860 by 600 and make the resolution 72 if
I hit OK and I hit control 1
I know for my resolution at 1280 by 720
for these tutorials this fits a hundred
percent and it kind of just fills up the
whole area so then I'm just going to hit
control V to paste that in and then just
click down here for the front card layer
hit ctrl-c ctrl-v to paste that in as
well then I'm going to take both and
scale them down so ctrl T and we're
going to scale it down to right around
right around there I'd say select the
move tool hit apply
control-shift-n for a new layer drag it
to the bottom and we want the background
color to be a little bit darker than
this white so we can see it so we'll
fill that in with the paint bucket tool
and now we can only see you know the
back is behind it that's why we can't
see it so what we want to do is go ahead
and take both of these layers blend
shift and selecting both and we'll go to
edit transform distort and take this
upper right and just very slightly push
it in and then just go to edit free
transform and just kind of tilt it to
the right a little bit alright so I can
move tool and hit apply alright and then
what we want to do is take the bottom
layer and we can leave it maybe around
there and then what we want to do is
create some kind of like shadows just to
make this look more 3d in a sense so
ctrl shift and for a new layer hit ok or
enter take the brush tool and we'll make
this kind of large click around for 72
and then we'll make the color darker
maybe around there just click in the
middle once hit ctrl T hold alt and
scale
this down and then hold all again and
really drag it out here select move tool
hit apply take the opacity down alright
and then we're going to create another
layer control-shift-n hit enter we'll
take our brush tool again down around
150 click once and hit control t hold
alt and scale that thing down a bit
we'll position it right around there
take the eraser tool kind of get rid of
this outer edge just a tad bit so it
looks a little bit a little bit more
natural I guess you could say and take
the opacity down a little bit more
duplicate this control shift D or just
right click and hit duplicate layer okay
take the move tool move this thing over
and if you want you can probably extend
these a little bit longer so ctrl T
alright so we're not quite done yet
because this backyard is behind the
front we could probably add a little bit
of a shadow and also maybe add somewhat
of like a shadow on the right portions
of these cards so what I want to do is
take this top one will call this front
double clicking the name and
control-shift-n use previous layer to
create a clipping mask it okay and we
can take the gradient tool and we'll go
dark here and also make sure this is
this the preset foreground to
transparent and then you can take the
opacity down just a little bit that way
it gives us just some some shading going
on there and we could do the same thing
to the back which we can rename to back
trill shift n tab space just to click
this real quick for clipping mask it
okay
and we'll do the same thing all right
and then finally for one final kind of
touch I guess you could call it
control-shift-n on top of this layer
seven that we created make it another
clipping mask and let's see if we can
try to make kind of like a shadowy type
of thing you could use the paintbrush
you can see how this kind of works but I
don't like that so what we can use is
the pen tool make sure shape is selected
and kind of just go click right here
right here and then maybe just have a
fade out a little bit more up there and
connect it right there
ctrl H we can right click rasterize that
go to well let's see we can do this
manually with the blur tool get a bigger
size strength is at a hundred obviously
take this down quite a bit
all right and then if you know that's a
little bit too close so we can take the
move tool take our arrow keys kind of
just move that up and there we have a
very faint sort of shadow thing that's
casting on to the back from the front
alright so that looks pretty cool I see
here alt so that's basically what this
thing looks like and it looks you know
kind of cool so it says it's a way that
you can present your different type of
identity if you ever do identity design
and I'm planning on releasing a visual
identity course that design course comm
it's not up at the time recording this
but depending on when you're watching it
might be so head on over there and that
will give you a very solid understanding
not just business cards but letter has
logo design visual identity design as a
whole so as always check out design
course comm and if you haven't yet
subscribe here on YouTube and the other
social networks if you wish so I will
see you tomorrow with a new tutorial
alright goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
