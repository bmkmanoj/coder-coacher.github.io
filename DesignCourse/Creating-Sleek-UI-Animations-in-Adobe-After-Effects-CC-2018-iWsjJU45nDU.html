tetro today we're going to be creating
this right here alright so as you can
see it's pretty cool-looking and um
we're going to be stepping into Adobe
After Effects we're gonna be working
solely there we're going to create this
user interface from scratch and then
apply these animations to it so there
could be different use cases for this
for instance you could be creating a
promotional video for a web service that
has a user interface or you could be
creating portfolio there's a lot of
different reasons why you would do this
and its really fun so I'm going to
assume you have little to no experience
in After Effects and I'm not going to be
speeding through the video everything's
gonna be real-time and you're gonna see
every single step and I think you at the
end if you follow along and then I
definitely watch till the end of the
video you're gonna have a new skill and
you're gonna want to keep doing this
because it's really fun alright so I'm
gonna switch over to that desktop oh but
real quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera comm
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it and I have Adobe
After Effects CC 2018 with which just
released recently and along with a bunch
of others in terms of CC updating to
2018 we want to click on new composition
and so what happens here is there's a
few things I'm just going to call this
UI we want to make sure that the width
is 1920 and the height is 1080 and then
also framerate 60 frames per second
that's what we want because if you have
it at like a film framerate like at 24
or so then it's not as smooth looking
and you want that smoothness
alright so 60 there and then for
duration
we'll just it's not gonna be 30 seconds
long so we're just gonna give ourselves
a little room to work with there and
just make it 30 seconds here okay
background-color doesn't really matter
at this point we're gonna hit okay all
right so the first thing I want to
mention now if you have never touched
After Effects let me just give an
extremely simple rundown because I'm not
going to go over the entire interface it
would take too long
basically over here is where your assets
are stored like your graphics and all
that if you wanted to import them down
here is the timeline and right here is
where you know your actual composition
is so we're gonna be working chips
basically in those three areas over here
are settings on there's like your your
type settings paragraph settings
alignment settings that's the only area
that we're gonna be working in in terms
of this this tool or area over here and
then we have the tool bar up top and
we'll be working with that a little bit
as well okay so the first thing I want
to get right here this simply means
we're working on a transparent
background so let's create a new layer
or a solid rather and we're going to
make it
sorry everything's showing up off the
other screen I was working on the other
monitor we're gonna make it a very light
gray so it's like right here it's F 2 F
2 F 2 and hit OK okay so I'm gonna need
to click right here I'm just going to
put fit up to a hundred percent and that
will fit it on my screen and so now we
want to not by the way this point is
where you have two decisions
you can either I create the user
interface in a different application
like sketch or Photoshop or illustrator
or Adobe experience design and then you
can export each asset individually as
you know a higher resolution PNG file
for instance and then you can import it
here into After Effects and then just
repeat the layout or your other option
which is what we're going to do we're
going to create the the user interface
from scratch here in Adobe After Effects
and if you can do that and you can get
away with doing that and that's what you
want to do so coming back here I didn't
through your first thing we're going to
do is create the actual user interface
containing element order they get the
container and so to do that we're going
to click right here I'm going to left
click and hold and choose rounded
tool alright so by the way you want to
make sure this is not selected on this
background in fact let's lock it so we
cannot select that back around here and
so now notice the fill we're working at
a hundred percent white fill hit OK with
no stroke so when you click on that
stroke make sure it's on none all right
so I'm gonna left click and drag an area
right around this size right there now
to align it we can click on a line
choose this middle and this middle over
here for vertical and horizontal
alignment alright so that's what yours
should look like at this point ok so now
let's begin to actually create the user
interface elements and there's gonna be
a portion that says users right here
with two icons so let's focus on that
right now and temporarily I'm going to
lock this as well so I'm gonna take the
type tool I'm gonna left click and we're
just going to put with caps lock users
now I'm gonna make it a little bit large
you're gonna hold shift and just drag
that up now sometimes when you let go
it's gonna warn you that the Clapp caps
lock is turned on you can just turn that
off to get rid of that black screen it
showed up and over here under character
I'm using a font Railway everybody gives
me grape about always using railway well
there's a reason it's it's a
nice-looking font I already have it
installed and I'm assuming you guys
already also have it installed and that
way I don't have to keep on introducing
new fonts alright so users here that's
loops we don't want to scale that down
it's gonna give ourselves some padding
to work with we're also gonna make it
bold that looks pretty good right there
alright so next we're going to import a
couple of icon finder dot-com fonts are
not font icons rather so let me find
that real quickly here darn I don't have
it up already
um let's get a new window let me just
show you real quick of course every
every brow every window is showing up
off okay
icon finder icon here if I just type in
user
and I type in free and look no link back
we can get absolutely hundred percent
free to use icons here the ones I I'm
going to be using are like right here
like this plus right here so if you
click on it then you want to download
the SV or the PNG format right here and
I'm also downloading the the minus
version like to add a user or remove a
user or whatever like that so drag this
to your desktop somewhere and we're
gonna import those just by left clicking
on them from your desktop you can't see
this portion by the way and just drag
them right here and momentarily he'll
show up okay so I'm just gonna click on
one and just drag it over here alright
way too large obviously so I'm just
gonna scale it down holding shift right
there that seems like a pretty good size
alright that looks good now coming over
here selecting it down here I'm going to
hit T which is the shortcut to show the
opacity I don't know I don't know why
they make that oh but whatever it's T
now I'm not gonna create a key for I'm
just gonna set the default opacity to
around 50% so you just click there hit
50 and you're good to go so now it's a
little bit lighter there I didn't want
it to be to have a ton of contrast
essentially so let's get a position
right around there select it we're gonna
hit ctrl D and that will duplicate it
with that duplicated selection right
here we're going to select the other one
which ends in 1:6 right here left click
hold it drag it while holding alt on top
and then that will copy it except it's
going to give us a different version
sort oh it's going to give us a new
asset in place of it well we're
maintaining all the adjustments that we
made with the opacity here so now you
can see those two right here one is plus
and one is an X all right so next let's
continue on by creating these little
areas where we have just three different
users here we'll go ahead and take just
the regular rectangular tool not the
rounded and I'm gonna left click right
on the edge here and make it around this
large
and for the fill we're gonna make a
light blue I'm gonna use een ein f 9 f F
for the color code if you want to follow
along there and if you're not matched up
evenly you can always hold alt in your
scroll wheel pull that over same thing
over here we don't want it to extend
beyond either all right there we go okay
so now let's go ahead and put ooh it's
looking like that was oh that's right
every time you scale it and you drag
that it also affects the other side too
so just a warning that looks good to me
though let's go ahead and I'm gonna just
take this pick control D drag it over
here and drag this to the very top and
this is going to be a name like Gary
Simon this is going to be regular and
it's going to be a lighter blue color
around 379 49 I'm gonna make it a little
bit smaller so it's at 20 right now I'm
going to make it like 16 now I'm not
going to use an avatar but this is in
place of an avatar so I'm gonna use the
ellipse tool I'm going to left-click
drag hold shift all in control so it'll
size it from the center of our selection
and we want it to be white and make it a
little bit larger
right here and also we'll give it a
stroke and where is that stroke color at
oh you have to click here we'll give it
a stroke I like that make it like three
pixels alright so in terms of design you
know you want to make sure your elements
are all aligned up correctly and not
looking terrible etc make this a little
bit bigger 18 next we'll take this
duplicate it ctrl D move it over here
move this back up and I'm going to put
over here just like a location like a
city Warren let's go over here to
paragraph and we'll right align these
and this is going to be scaled down
quite a bit so we'll try 14 and we'll
make it
just regular all right that looks good
so now that is it for the actual list
item design now we're going to replicate
it a couple times so now we'll take all
those and you want to make sure you
don't have anything else selected by the
way and it's just these right here
so with all for those selected we're
gonna hit ctrl D and then move them up
to the very top like that so they're
situated is gonna make our life a little
bit easier a little bit and then just
hold shift and move them down and then
do that one more time so control D move
them up move it down okay right there
looks pretty good alright so now I'm
going to unlock this containing element
and just scale it down just a tad bit
and then move it up
okay good all right great making
progress so far so good so now at this
point now that we have the interface
actually designed this is the end state
that's all we need to design now we need
to start grouping it up appropriately so
that we can animate it easily and this
is key because you don't want to sit
here animating every single layer you
want to group these things up
intelligently and so watch what happens
it basically now we have if you're
familiar with the a photoshop or
illustrator you can create groups a
pre-comp is basically like a group so
once we have that we're going to double
click it and this is where we're going
to spend our time actually animating
inside of this UI pre-comp I probably
should have named it something different
to rename it we can enter and we'll just
put in UI animation that way it's named
something differently so now let's go
ahead and we're going to take all of our
layers with exception to this container
so just all peer and we're going to move
them off to the side like this so now we
just have our container here and what we
want to do is to start out with the
animation we're gonna scale it from 0 to
100% so coming down we're gonna hit s
for scale and we're gonna move off just
maybe right around a just under 2
seconds basically I'm gonna hit a
keyframe right here at a hundred percent
then at the beginning we're gonna change
it to zero all right so now if we come
here to our main composition and we hit
the zero on our number pad we'll see
what that looks like now we can change a
couple things we can change how the
keyframes in terms of the velocity we
have easy easy easy in and easy ease out
so I'm going to put ease in you see it
changes the icons just
briefly down there now mind you when I
you're watching this on my screen I'm
recording at 24 frames per second so it
may not appear as smooth as it should
I'm gonna drag this in to make that a
little bit faster so next after that
we're going to take these three layers
right here and we're going to show them
and we're going to animate them slightly
different so right here we'll say we'll
put a keyframe for opacity and position
so to do that we hit T for opacity why
all three are selected and then hold
shift in P for position so now we have
access to those two properties through
all three layers so we're gonna put a
keyframe for each one of those we're
gonna move back here near the beginning
and we're going to drag it down while
holding shift right around there and
then also changing the opacity to zero
now I'm gonna take all those right click
keyframe and easy ease in now if we go
back and hit zero on a number pad there
we go
very cool alright so continue on on
after that we have all these layers
we're not going to sit there and animate
each one of those we're gonna make
ourselves our lives rather a little bit
easier so we're gonna take these four
which there's four layers that comprise
those you know those the list over here
and we're going to pre compose those a
layer pre compose which is control shift
C for a future reference let's call this
user one and oh by the way I'm going to
backup ctrl Z to undo that we're gonna
take all these and just move them to the
very beginning because if you don't then
there's going to be a space in your pre
comp so let's do that again real quickly
take these for control shift and see
user 1 do it again up here
control shift ste user 2
and control sis I can't even talk user 3
alright awesome so now we have all these
three and we're gonna take this one put
it right around here alright this is
where it shows up so if you want to view
a little bit more the time frame you can
now or the timeline here all in your
scroll wheel and you'll be able to see a
little bit finer details all right so
this will also do basically what the
users and this top portion is doing in
terms of animation so we're going to
once again come out here we'll make this
a little bit longer animation we're
gonna hit T shift P and then we'll put a
keyframe there for both of those and
then also we'll put let's see here
one right here and there we go we'll go
ahead and drag it down holding shift
right around there and then also make
the opacity zero select all of the
keyframes
Easy's in alright so we're just going to
copy that drag this one over here paste
it right there so control V I just
pasted so if you hit you you'll see all
the available keyframes animations and
we'll do the same thing with this one so
we'll bring it over here paste it and
there we go so now we hit zero awesome
very smooth let me show you one of the
thing that's really cool about free
composing your layers so right here in
our main user interface composition we
can turn on this little icon right here
and that means it's going to be a 3d
layer so if we draw this down and go to
transform we can see we have X rotation
Y rotation Z rotation and orientation if
I change this middle one here
look at that we can create a sort of 3d
perspective and so now if I hit zero now
is it loads a little slow initially but
this is real time right here very cool
all right awesome so let's continue on
let's simulate what it looks like to
click on one of these so we'll say the
middle one all right so after a certain
point about a second or so or maybe
about a two seconds
we'll turn it blue so let's go ahead and
double click that and so now we're in
this user pre-comp right here so right
around here I'm gonna take this layer
hit ctrl D and hit alt and the left
bracket and then I'll basically take
that current time of that frame and put
it right to where you're at in the time
line and we're gonna change the color to
blue all right next we're gonna do the
same thing with the two type layers so
right here right here and right here
right control D and then alt and then
left bracket and these are gonna be
white very easy awesome
what I also want to do instead of just
abruptly making it blue we can reply its
light
fade-in animation so we'll hit T opacity
will be zero initially and then 100%
okay so now let's go ahead and try that
out awesome
so let's drag it in just a little bit
these three there we go
oops yeah you do want to save this for
sure okay so now we go back hit zero
there we go perfect now what if we
wanted to move it up and then hide the
other ones
alright well let's go back to UI
animation and right here we'll start
moving this up so we're gonna put a
position keyframe right there and then
move it up maybe just right around here
sometimes you can get a eyeball these
things in just experiment and then we'll
move the position up by holding shift
right there alright great so then the
other ones right here and here let's go
ahead and hit U for both of those and at
the same time this is moving up we'll
move these down and fade them out
so we'll put keyframes let's see right
here and here and then we'll make these
fade out faster maybe we'll move them
down and change the opacity to zero
let's go ahead and take all four of
those and keyframe assistant easy ease
in alright save it hit zero awesome
all right so one final thing when you
get to this point we'll go to our user -
we'll go ahead and copy this so
duplicate it ctrl D and just after it
changes to blue we'll drop down a
secondary panel all right so let's hit
you on here and clear out any keyframes
we'll delete those we're going to also
position this underneath and I'm gonna
use my down key for the arrow just to
move it down also make sure the opacity
is at 100% and we're gonna change the
color to a darker blue right around
there it's one C four eight five nine
now let's move this down make it a
little bit taller let's see what it
looks like in the UI animation panel in
relation to the height of the parent
panel make it a little bit taller
alright that's good and then go back
here we're going to grow this so right
around here we'll put in a let's see
we'll do a size so we hit or a scale
rather hit s and we'll also do P so
shift P for position make two key frames
there and then down here will scale it
vertically and then we'll also move it
up behind so it'll just drop right down
all right so let's put some keyframe
velocity there we're also going to add
some type here so left-click and drag
out to create a type area and we'll
left-aligned it in paragraph and for now
I'm just gonna put some lorem ipsum text
here so I'm going to lip simcom I'm
gonna copy all of this close that out
and paste it in we'll make some
adjustments to the type and character
panel right there seems to be pretty
good and the line height seems to be
decent there let's also change to color
we'll get this background color and make
it lighter right around there that's 7 c
BB d3 and this one we're gonna alt left
bracket will just fade it in so at t4
opacity initially would be zero so put a
keyframe there and then 100%
save it alright guys we're getting real
close let's try this out it's loading
slow needs to preload first awesome
alright so let's take the end of this
timeline just drag it right around here
at zero awesome okay so now let's also
rotate this thing this is gonna be like
the final step by the way thank you for
watching so far so now let's go ahead
and we will start to rotate it right
here I think so we'll put in a keyframe
for orientation and then once it gets to
the very end right here in the middle
it's kind of hard to see we're gonna
make it face this way alright I'm just
gonna let it preloads loading extra slow
because it still needs to get this into
memory here and render it alright so
here it is awesome that is sleek and
this went very well I'm glad I didn't
make any major screw-ups so obviously
you can do a lot more with this we kind
of just ran through it and so now the
sky's the limit because you learned a
ton just in this tutorial so make sure
you check out my site course tetra comm
you have a lot of different stuff this
is a full stack developer channel so
today we're focusing on you know more
the design animation side of things and
you know who knows maybe tomorrow I
don't even know what I'm doing tomorrow
it'll be it more on the coder side if
you haven't subscribed here and make
sure that the notifications are turned
on so you get notified every time I
upload a new video all right I'll talk
to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
