course comm and today is January 15th
with our 15th video of the year and
today we're going to continue on with
the from the previous lesson from
yesterday with creating the game layout
interface in Adobe Photoshop cc alright
so as always visit design course comm
and put in your email to get notified of
future released courses and also the
project files for today are available
for free in the description below this
video alright let's get started
okay so I first just to preface this I'm
gonna have to speed through this as fast
as possible right now it's 754 p.m.
Eastern time and that means I have very
little time to get this done plus I have
the wife wanting to get a shower and our
toddlers you know they're just going
crazy cuz they're tired but I told them
listen I have to do this this is a video
every day of the year I gotta get it
done it can't miss a day so I'm gonna be
going quick through this unfortunately
but you know what you'll just have to
pause and I move along as I do if you
want to follow along exactly that is
life so I I'm gonna make some
adjustments to this I and this is
something that happens routinely in a
course of designing the website
throughout several days you may look at
something say you know what I want to
change this or you may have a better
idea so that was the case for me today
so I what I want to do off the bat is
kind of just take this layer one rate or
the rectangle wine which is the
container for this layer mask right here
for this building and hit ctrl T hold
shift just scale down well you don't
even have to hold shift early but we're
gonna gift it all the way down and of
course there's a helicopter outside so
it's probably really loud but oh well I
just to the bottom of that image yeah
you know what we're gonna go further
maybe around there and we're gonna also
take auto-select layer make sure I've
selected with the move tool and move
this down a bit we want this to go down
a decent amount
all right so then now what I want to do
is go ahead and I'm gonna take up I pull
up this website this is linked in the
description of this video and the bottom
here of YouTube if you're watching on
YouTube if you're not make sure you are
and that way you can get to this link I
and these are blood spatter brushes and
they're free and if you just go to
google and type this in you'll get a ton
of you know free blood spatter brushes
for Photoshop or whatever you'll see
there's a lot to choose from so it's not
really important what you choose from
just so you get some that work and just
download it and then if you have a later
version of Adobe Photoshop you just
double click on your extracted brush
file and it will load automatically into
Photoshop so to access that all we have
to do is take our brush and we can I've
clicked down out of here and we'll see
all of these brushes that are added and
there's a ton of them by default
Photoshop has you know these brushes
right here I and then anything that you
load externally is just loaded beneath
that so these are blood spatter brushes
right here before I get to that I want
to move some things around so I want to
move the skull down a bit so if I just
select on this right side it gives a
skull right we'll hold ctrl select these
two layers here and then also the
circles and wire as well and we'll just
move these down right around here and
then if we just click over here to
select these ellipses and it's like
those 3d select Auto Select layer that
we can click anywhere without it
selecting it and then just hold shift
and bring it down I'd say right to
around there right so now just above
layer 1 that I have labeled take control
shift and bring up a new layer hit OK or
enter and now we want to get our blood
spatter brush okay so I'm just gonna
choose one of these I want to choose one
that will work well I'm not sure which
one I'm gonna choose so we'll also have
to see how we choose it and these are
large 1250 px so if we go over here this
is a real large brush so I'm gonna scale
down I'm gonna just put in 800 by
default hit enter
then choose and just click right there
make sure you have a red color alright
so that kind of looks cool you know what
I'm gonna undo that let me go back and
try to find something else obviously you
can see I have quite a bit here I'll try
that that's 1250 as well so I'm just
gonna put 800 now what I want to do is
go to edit transform and flip horizontal
and then take the move tool maybe go
like a right around there okay that's
cool alright so now what I'm gonna do is
we're going to move this stuff around
just a tad bit over here so I'm going to
take the move tool with auto-select
layer applied we're gonna take place car
Wars now we're also going to take and
hold shift I that layer and then hold
control and select those two layers and
we'll drag all those down right around
there and then I want to take the bottom
layer and this is the one that's
actually orange and I'm gonna change the
color to a red right around there will
work so that CC o EoE hit OK and the
black text is not enough contrast and I
actually want to make it white so I'm
gonna select our all-out action layer
right click copy layer style and then
click back to it right click paste layer
style and I'm gonna zoom up just so we
can get to 100% here and then I'm gonna
take just underneath this layer right
here I'm gonna select this layer hit
control shift and for a new layer take
our brush again and we're gonna choose a
different brush so I want some blood to
kind of just show around the button here
now you don't want to use the same one
to look a little bit too repetitive
that's not the same okay cool
all right now oops
now I'm going to zoom out here that
looks good now I'm gonna take our text
up here take these two take them down
and I'm going to add some more text to
this portion so I'm just gonna zoom up
so there be like three more lines so I
rip apart your enemies solely through
decapitation and yes I'm messed up so I
came up with this silly description here
of this game with only your hands no
weapons allowed and then I'm gonna take
this right here I'm gonna bold that and
okay right-click we'll zoom out all
right so far so good
I now what I want to do just beneath
here first I'm gonna select on the
background layer we're gonna make this
all black and then just fill that in
with the paint bucket tool and I'm gonna
take the eraser alright so we're at 332
for the size we want to select the
building image and and just kind of get
rid of and fade that off okay same thing
over here because we dropped that image
down a little bit all right and then
down here I'm just gonna have a three
different video thumbnails that a person
could click on just to view content of
the actual game so obviously for a game
the first thing person who'd be
interested in want to see is actual
gameplay footage so we're gonna bring up
her grid and when since we're gonna have
three of these we want these to span the
width of four columns because this is a
twelve grid 12.com grid so we
go ahead and take our rectangle tool and
holds I alt just to scale out just to
around here hit ctrl H twice to get rid
of everything and get rid of the grid
drop this beneath there or maybe at the
top and can't really see it so we could
change the color slightly and now what I
want to do is obviously in the context
of actually developing this website or
designing it for a real game they would
provide you a screen shot so you would
have that but we don't so what I'm going
to do is open up the project file the of
this warehouse from the previous lesson
so assuming you've watched that first
lesson go ahead and open up the
warehouse image from the project file so
I've gone ahead and done that so hit
control a Cosi close that out and with
these this eye rectangle selected it can
patrol shift and n use previous layer to
create clipping mask hit OK patrovita
paste ctrl T to transform this or scale
it down and hit shift in all and just
scale this thing down a lot maybe around
here so this would be one image of the
game and then we will create a real
quick play icon on top of this so
somewhere in the center with the ellipse
tool selected we'll hold shift scale up
Center it with your arrow keys if you
need to and then the actual play arrow
I'm just gonna real quick try to eyeball
this and that's not right so we can use
our arrow keys and we will change the
color by double clicking over here on
the layer and change it out to white and
that's obviously incorrect so we can
take the direct selection tool and
adjust this as needed alright that looks
pretty decent now we could take the
bottom layer right here the black circle
take that pass that you down just a
little bit just around 63
and we can give these names if we wanted
to so I can go ahead and take both of
those layers and the
basically all four of these layers drop
it down just a little bit we could take
this all out action text we'll duplicate
that just so we have the UM the layer
star already applied control T scale
that down we can give each one of these
its own sort of caption and I'll call
this one
I don't know catacombs action and
whatever and changes to start twenty
will move that into place right around
there get rid of that get our grid back
and we want to well before we get the
grid let's take all these layers so we
got the text layer we got this layer
which is the actual image then we got
the layer beneath that acts as a
clipping mask and hit ctrl G and we'll
group those and we'll call this or video
all right so now we'll get the grid out
right click video duplicate the group
I'm sorry I have to go so fast but I got
a warning from my wife I'm such a pansy
alright didn't duplicate it one more
time over here and get that lined up
correctly and there we go okay so if you
wanted to make this look different you
know for whatever purpose this isn't
real obviously maybe I'll leave this up
and down with this one over here okay
now they actually look somewhat
different for the thumbnails and if that
is basically I'm gonna stop there of
course you can have different things
down here or maybe a little bit more but
you know I looked at a couple of
different current games like Battlefield
for their website they they keep the
landing pages that sell the game pretty
minimal and they let the content and the
videos do the speaking for themselves so
I I'm going to end it there and so
hopefully I can be excused about how
quickly I rushed this I wanted to get
the video done so yeah tomorrow we're
gonna tackle something quite different
I I know this is only our 15th video in
today's January 15th I but I'm going to
tackle something different we're going
to work with a little bit of an
introductory to photo manipulation and
so I got that project
and it looks really cool so hopefully
you know if you're a front-end guy or
you're only interested in website design
or front-end or you're only interested
in visual identity I hopefully you just
keep your mind open and you try to learn
something new and so that's what
tomorrow will be all right so I'm Gary
