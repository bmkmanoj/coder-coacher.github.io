of design course calm and this is design
challenge number 22 and this is going to
be a challenging one so this is going to
be based on creating a snail based on a
circular grid construction so what does
that mean essentially if we look at the
inspiration down here yeah some of you
may have seen this sometimes you'll see
a mark which is you know you know the
non tight part of a logo I constructed
using these circles so this might be the
logo and then they'll show it you know
how this logo all the angles every
single line is based on a perfect circle
I and so this one doesn't show it but
you can see clearly everything here even
the gradients in the middle are based on
perfect circles now this is I one of
those things you know it's kind of
trendy I you definitely don't have to
create every logo of course using
perfect circles but it is a very
interesting task and a kind of difficult
to do you really have to play around
with it a lot in order to get something
good so I could just came up with a
snail out of the blue there's no
particular reason why I tried it of
course the back portion I I would what
is that called the shell is you know
that's going to be easy to do but the
rest of it you know i'm really
interested you know considering this is
this is a blind competition or a
challenge rather just seeing what people
come up with for their depiction of what
a snail using perfect circles looks like
so I the requirements make it at least
500 x 500 pixels give it a lot of white
space between the snail in the document
you know like this there's white space
here there's there's a lot of room for
it to breathe essentially i don't like
logos that are shown real like right to
the document edge also center it to
horizontally vertically that's easy must
be a snail don't put any type it should
ideally work with one color but you can
use
as many as you wish of course make sure
it looks good in the colors work well
together and show a variation with the
circle grid visible so you can just show
it I like this or like this I I mean
like this if you want but if you do just
show it without the grids submit another
one that shows them kind of like a half
transparency it may be like fifty
percent so yeah that is it basically you
have a week from today Wednesday may six
to 12 p.m. eastern standard time and
obviously the best application used for
this will be something like adobe
illustrator of vector application I and
so yeah that is it so if you're unsure
of how to do this and how to even
construct a logo based on a circular
grid do yourself a favor actually I was
going to tell you to research it but I'm
just going to show you real quickly in
Adobe Illustrator how to use how to
combine shapes using circles so if you
take the I the ellipse tool right here
and let's get us off a perfect circle
maybe duplicate it here maybe right here
too so we have these three circles
overlaying each other if we select all
of them I we can kind of see the outline
here based on a stroke and we click on
this tool right here the shape builder
tool first before you use it though and
before you're ready to go ahead and
actually you'll combine the shapes go
ahead and ctrl c ctrl f just to copy
them so in your layers panel you'll have
all of those and group them up ctrl G
bring them to the bottom and just hide
this that way you take this and you're
ready to combine them to create the
shape you use the shape builder tool and
look how this works so we can start
combining certain portions of this so
now we've created this out of this here
and could just over lay it on top just
so you can get an idea get rid of the
fill and now we can see
me obviously if you had more shapes and
was more dynamic it would look a little
bit more interesting but I that's how
you would essentially build a shape from
circles ok so again you have a week
submit your entry and you can submit
multiple of us no big deal and I will
review them in one week I talk to you
later goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
