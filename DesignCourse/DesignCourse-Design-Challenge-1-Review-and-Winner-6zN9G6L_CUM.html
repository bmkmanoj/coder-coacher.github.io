calm today I'm going to review the
submissions for the first design
Korsakov design challenge which was for
designing a logo a letter mark logo for
a fictional pet company called fit cat
I'm also going to choose the winner so
just remember if you're one of the
people whose logo I reviewed you know I
was nice and reviewing every one of them
and then put anybody down but if you
disagree with something that have to say
you know this is just a very quick
review of each logo so in no means is an
exhaustive list maybe I forgot a couple
things or I just didn't see something
that you meant for me to see or whatever
to be conveyed to the logo so it's no
big deal don't take it too seriously
alright so I'm going to switch to the
computer to do that review alright so
let me go down here with the first one
and this is from bigger Verne and when I
first saw this initially I wasn't
exactly sure what was going on I'd say
within the first couple seconds I but
then I realized you know if you look at
it the f is flipped upside down to the
right and the same that the sea and the
point of doing this as he knows he said
you know the efficacy or unfortunately
not to a parent I but he wanted to get
the cat ears in here and so you know in
terms of relevance that's definitely in
you being unique that's definitely good
i would say also in terms of simplicity
the letter mark in and of itself is also
good I but one area where it does fall
short as he kind of pointed out himself
it's just it's a little bit difficult to
make out you know what is you know here
I would say most people would see it and
be kind of confused if you think you
know if you ask them what exactly is
going on here so I i would say it just
only falls short just in that one
specific category but any other ones in
terms of being able to scale down and
being able in terms of simplicity it
definitely is pretty good so one note I
would make it yeah I definitely wouldn't
present both of these together I would
probably not even use that same F and C
over here for the actual type so if
you're trying to present these two
together I would just use the same font
I for all characters I otherwise it
becomes a little bit too cluttered all
right so I ask this person who enlarge
it so we could see it and in terms of
well-designed in terms of you know kind
of eye candy they have the highlights on
the shadows that's definitely good I the
color usage is definitely good as well
it really sticks out but in terms of
what exactly is happening I was kind of
lost I immediately when I saw it I
thought to myself because I have two
small children I and sometimes to eat
those goldfish crackers I thought that
was like a goldfish cracker head being
eaten by the f I don't know if exactly
that's what's going on that's what's
happening here I just don't see it so I
know definitely there's a tail here we
have the paw print obviously which is
relevant I I'm not sure it may take away
though from my simplicity to have all
these things here like this this band
here and this over here I but yeah I in
terms of you know aesthetics I like it
but in terms of what exactly is
happening i'm not too sure I mean
there's an eye here but yeah maybe you
Sauron can sort that out for me alright
so over here this is from in a neo 1212
I they came up with two different
concepts and in terms of simplicity well
good that I like it a lot to certain if
you needed to separate the color of
these these are ears presumably I and
I'm not too certain just you know I
guess if you've rotated this it would
kind of look like a cat head but not so
much I understand they're trying to
maintain the c-shape and then over here
I would say if you just flip this F
because I don't like
f being backwards it doesn't really make
too much sense to me or why you would do
it just the lines in and of himself they
make make it feel like a cat I guess you
could say when turn when it comes to
like the tail and the body and such I
but again I'm not too certain what's
happening here but if you just flip this
I would say this would probably be a
little bit better than this one and also
when it comes to the colors two colors
clashing I'm a big fan of trying to
separate those and not just have two
colors colliding like this it kind of
takes away from the simplicity really
and that's too I complexity and
sometimes clutter so I would I either
make them the same color or add like a
stroke on the see that I kind of
overlaps it so that creates some
negative space separation between these
all right so then over here I this
person tons ER or tonder p basically
resubmitted this i would say in and of
itself whenever it comes to presenting a
logo it doesn't hurt to sometimes
include one with a different gradient or
our background or whatever but always I
would say present on a white background
and do and offer other views of a
secondary to it but anyhow when it comes
to this logo I you can definitely see a
cat in here but in terms of complexity I
if you scale this down so if I copy this
and I bring it into Photoshop and I
paste this in and I hit ctrl T I scale
it down quite a bit with the colors you
can't really see it too well it's and
also with all the fine details and the
lines and such you can't see it as well
either switchback here I for the cat of
course I would make that like a black or
a blue or a dark blue something that
stands out a lot more but yeah in terms
of the F and C
it's just a little bit cluttered here in
this variation will get down to his
other variation which is an improvement
in my opinion but I'm going to move on
alright so this is from swoo Wayne bow
I'm not even gonna try to pronounce that
this logo I mean it is simple although
it gets a little bit cluttered with the
legs and stuff down here so if that were
scaled down that could possibly be an
issue I obviously you do get it right
away which this is a plus that has over
some of the other previous logos and
that you can see the sea is a tale of a
cat and that's pretty identifiable but
one issue here i see is i the type
that's used for the word mark is a block
bold font but up here it's a rounded
font i would rather see a rounded font
and keeping it consistent with the I the
smooth rounded nature of this font other
otherwise you get kind of like a
cluttered feeling and it's not
consistent so I would definitely change
that so again in terms of complexity
it's pretty simple I would also say that
the proportions of how the f is the FC
letter mark is displayed with the fit
cat that could probably be adjusted it
kind of feels like everything's just
kind of separated if you will it doesn't
feel feel like one single mark although
I guess you could try to remedy the app
by encasing it in an oval or an emblem
but in and of itself it kind of feels
like either the fit cat needs to be
larger this needs to be smaller and may
be placed in a different area all right
so also it doesn't doesn't hurt to
include you know a real world usage as
well all right so bigger verne this is a
second one that he submitted and right
off the bat I would say that this is
definitely in terms of being unique in
relevant you know the scores high marks
in terms of being able to be used i
would say it's a separate symbol and
then also having a fit cat over here I I
would say it would be best to take this
idea and then just use it in the name
itself and a letter mark itself
but in terms of thinking outside the box
you know using the traditional type of
cat I don't know what you call this toy
like a scratch board or whatever did to
make it with the sea it's definitely
unique like the idea the the T over here
that's a little bit difficult because it
could kind of look like a why now but
yeah that's no big deal then we have
quell Crist over here and I had a hard
time kind of finding couldn't see what
was going on exactly with this but I see
that there's a I an F right here and
then a see right here and this could be
construed as being a cat tail but when
it comes over like this and bounces up
I'm not too sure I think that's the part
that kind of clutter is it for me I and
so obviously this is a very abstract
sort of thing but I'm not sure how
effective it would be and it may make
people kind of confused about exactly
what's going on with the actual letter
mark um and in terms of mixing the
colors here I don't know I think it
would probably be best to keep it all
one or all one color and also provide a
different variation which never hurts
and then tons ER this is the second one
and this is definitely an improvement
from the first one he's submitted up
here as you can see I this uses a
negative space well with the sea which
is a unique idea you can see that it's
like a cute unique type of cat and
what's also cool is that you know even
though it's like for a fit cat company
it's like a pudgy looking cute little
thing but it looks willing to this is
what I'm just gauging from it I willing
to play I guess it looks eager just the
eyes and such um the fit can I would
probably move the fit in the cat over
here a little bit more but I would say
that I this is pretty good and we come
down here to psy ops and
basically I I I think I see what's going
on there's effort here the F also serves
as cat ears and then they see right here
also serves as a tail kind of gone over
and and then you flipped it to kind of
make like a single unique icon and so
you know when scale down this would work
well I I mean it's not one hundred
percent very immediate and just note to
see the efficacy and the know what's
going on it takes a little bit of time
to understand it I but still it's unique
and it would scale down well so those
are pluses all right and then we have
korbin j sm and I right here nothing's
too specific to the actual cat everybody
everybody's been focusing on a cat knows
not so much the fitness aspect so
thinking outside of the box and this
this way is a good idea when it comes to
joining of the the colors here like I
said I I'm not a fan of it I I think it
could just kind of create clutter but I
he did create that sort of openness
between the barbell and the sea I but i
would say I not necessarily do the same
thing but do on a lesser level between
right here right here and right here on
here that way the colors don't clash so
much or keep them the same color so yeah
in terms of its scaling down that would
work well so not a bad logo and i also
had one email submission which i
specified you can do so if you wish and
I I didn't get their username but I got
their first name and this is what they
sent me and so seeing this immediately I
thought well the Seas coming before they
have so I'm not kind of a fan of that
also when it comes to the ears and end
up being a cat there flipped to the side
and so it's not one hundred percent
identifiable of what's going on
immediately at least I like the type
it's simple and the colors there are
good as well I but
usually you want your logo to always be
to to always work in a gray scale so if
it was black and white you would
definitely have to create separation
right here our in terms of white space
and go down and then I from Khalid
Harris now these guys submit it in a
different thread so I just pushed them
over here to the same thread and I in
terms of eyes do I mean I can see the
cat obviously I I would definitely
change the orange here just to the same
color and we could see the tail although
it looks kind of like a rat tail so I
would address that in terms of the font
you know I like that it's you know
playing to the cute cuddly nature of a
cat I guess you could say I will move on
down here and then from I don't know how
to pronounce it x is or something you
could tell me maybe after this and then
we have just a simple logo this is this
would be more of a word mark not so much
a letter mark because we're supposed to
focus on F and C as being a separate
symbol but you can't see immediately
what's happening here anything to also
add a paw here unnecessarily I would say
clutters the logo in terms of what
you're trying to point out we could ever
see it's a cat here so you don't
necessarily have to add this over here
so remember trying to be simple as
possible and memorable as possible so
yeah that's just a quick review of all
the logos I and so based on all these
submissions I a lot of them were really
close in terms of quality and I think
ultimately what I would feel personally
it would be best in terms of you know
comparing all these against each other
would be thanh sirs second submission of
F and C just in terms of you know simple
colors simple lines yeah we're just
using the negative space here and see to
create I an image of a cat that is
immediately identifiable it's not
confusing at all it's
you know whatever so I'm choosing tons
ER for this week's design challenge
winner still going to go ahead and
switch back to the video ok so I just
wanted to thank everybody for submitting
entries I didn't know if it would be a
good contest or not but fortunately we
got a decent number in our early stages
so in a few days I'm going to announce
the second design challenge i'm not sure
what i'm going to do yet you can offer
up suggestions if you want all right I'm
