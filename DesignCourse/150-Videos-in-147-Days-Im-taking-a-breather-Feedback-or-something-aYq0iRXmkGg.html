today well actually technically
yesterday mark the 150th video I've done
for 2014 and there's been technically
about 147 days so I'm ahead of schedule
by three days so I today I in the
yesterday have been extremely busy
because at the end of every month as
some of you know who followed the
channel I have a to our monthly course
that I'm obligated to record for a
different network and so I've just been
working on that all day and so today I'm
not going to be doing any type of
tutorial so given that you know I've
done so I've reached sort of a milestone
of 150 videos and I'm sticking with my
goal of doing a video every day of 2014
I was just going to make this a quick
video and just leave this open to you
for feedback and any type of suggestions
or if there's anything that's annoying
you or you want to see more of anything
that comes to mind that you might want
to type into comets here at YouTube or
design course com forums just go ahead
right now it's late and so I'm just
going to stop talking and we'll have a
new video tomorrow something maybe of a
little bit more substance all right so
check out design course calm subscribe
here on youtube if you haven't and i'll
see you tomorrow goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
