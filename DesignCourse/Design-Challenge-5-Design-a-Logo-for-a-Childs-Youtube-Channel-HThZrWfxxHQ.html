comm here I have my six-year-old
daughter Natalie I and she's here
because for this design challenge you're
tasked with designing a fictional logo
for a child's youtube channel I where
you know her name is Natalie of course
it'll be called Nats pics where she'll
just do toy reviews of course this isn't
actually for a real case because you can
see she doesn't talk really she just
laughs you would be horrible at YouTube
and so I have to having said that let's
switch over to the browser here and
here's the requirements and by the way
you can access the challenges page now
at the footer here at corset row column
just click on challenges and so it must
be feminine you know girly so use
appropriate styles and colors to
indicate this it must include Nats pics
as the logotype now you're free to
include a symbol along with the type
where you can just leave it out white
background only please stick to that and
avoid overusing graphic effects such as
gradients drop shadows bevel etc use
good contrast as well now do not submit
more than three entries and if you do
make sure they're different concepts and
not just slight revisions on the
previous now the deadline is November
20th so you have three weeks from the
point of uploading this video to get it
all done the winner one winner will
receive free access to all current paid
courses at course cetera com there's
only two right now but there's going to
be more very shortly especially on
angular 2 development and here's just
some inspiration alright so I'm looking
forward to the entries and get
submitting see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
