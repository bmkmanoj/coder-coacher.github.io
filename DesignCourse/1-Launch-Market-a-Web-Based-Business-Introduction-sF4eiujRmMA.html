Network tuts+ premium course instructor
welcome to the introduction of what I
hope will be an amazing series of videos
that will document the entire process of
building and lodging a web based
business the purpose of this video
series will be to show you how I
personally approach web design
development and marketing the ultimate
goal of the featured project will be to
build and market a successful logo
design business using a domain name I
own logo design co the first step will
be to designed actual logo in adobe
illustrator then we'll use the adobe
photoshop to design a homepage mock-up
based on the Twitter bootstraps 12 grade
columns with the intention of making it
responsive then we'll take that mock up
and write the HTML and then be CSS after
that we'll go back into photoshop to
create the remaining mock-ups necessary
for the website aside from the friend of
the website they're also be a back end
as well used for client management
once the website is complete will then
focus on marketing to bring in some
actual customers this phase will include
research landing page development
utilizing paid advertising and organic
search I encourage you to follow along
but not with the same project the
process that i use can easily be
translated and adapted into the
development of any web based business
there are plenty of other ideas that
would work as long as you follow the
series ideally you would choose a
service in an industry that you have a
passion for and also has a good enough
demand so that you can be profitable so

to this channel and you'll be notified
via email every time the next video gets
released for this video series all right
