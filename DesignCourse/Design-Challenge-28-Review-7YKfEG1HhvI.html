calm welcome to design challenge 28-day
review and that challenge was based on
designing a clever / witty tech t-shirt
alright so I sent over Glenn Jones d
thread with all the entries we had about
thirty five I think and he did choose a
winner and the winner is PA bombs
chicken star wars-themed and that's
basically you know why did the chicken
cross the road it's to get to the other
side the dark side alright so if I were
to choose the winner or I've chosen the
winter it would have been breached
designs jpg I think it's a little bit
more relevant to the intended topic
which is supposed to be about you know
programming or just the Internet in
general all right so anyhow nonetheless
the official rules stated that Glenn
Jones would be picking in the eye the
winner so i'll be getting a cold of upa
bombs very shortly alright so let's
fast-forward to the review side I and
I'm going to go ahead and do a review
like I always do make sure you subscribe
here at YouTube if you haven't yet and
check out design course calm let's get
going alright so here is the challenge
thread let's get started so just to
reiterate here um you know the idea is
it must be the concept must be clever
and thought-provoking and it must have
some relevance to the internet tech
industry so web design web development
program etc unfortunately a few of the
like I mentioned earlier the concepts
were a little bit off that mark or
completely off the mark okay so the
first entry our hero arrives okay so
this obviously is in reference to the
asteroids game which I never played
strangely enough and so I kind of had a
hard time understanding this concept
design wise it's really good i like it
execution initially i thought you know
this is a cursor and that's what the
relevance has to the tech industry I
wasn't exactly sure so I'm sorry for
that but it is actually a good design so
like I can't really take it bad in that
sense so thanks for that submission
alright so I was a double post alright
so supposed to
represent that you're in love with your
computer okay so this isn't really witty
I were clever i would say for what it is
in terms of the design it's not bad but
it you know it's pretty much
straightforward and we were really
trying to look for one of the you know
those witty ideas you know like the type
that you see on the glenn jones t-shirt
website so for what it is though it's
not bad you know i like that the pixel
art and that's really cool so thanks for
the submission first attempt all right
um this one I had quite a I I pretty
much failed chemistry and science and
all that miss classes I hated them so I
had a hard time piecing together you
know the 333 I in what relevance it has
to you know I know this is CSS and suede
elements but add a hard time just kind
of piecing together exactly what's
happening here for what it is in terms
of design you know there's not a ton
here that I can critique you know it
wasn't done bad but yeah that's
unfortunately these first initially
these initial entry entries kind of
really just threw me off and so
unfortunately I don't have a great
review for you thanks for this mission
though all right now this one there
would be some major issues with this
this one if you were to try to get this
placed on a t-shirt you know because
this text it's even hard to read almost
here at this size now if it's put onto a
t-shirt it'd be even more difficult
because it would likely be smaller than
this and you wouldn't be able to read
what this says I understand the concept
here Jesus press ctrl s 4 and 4 saved so
that concept there in and of itself
isn't bad it's pretty good but in terms
of you know trying to portray you know
the idea here it kind of falls short so
you know you would really want to make
this stand out a lot more and having
such a long paragraph here I would
completely scrap it I I would just focus
on this and really emphasize the control
you know and trying to draw a parallel
between the religion and christianity
and being saved and all that so thanks
for that entry all right size down
because if I was too big okay looking at
this here all right so this is just a
kind of a very simple play off of the
phonics of words pause or P AWS sounds
the same so yeah the perhaps in terms of
maybe like a dog lover or something this
would be a pretty effective concept in
terms of design and execution I really
like it everything simple the colors
work well the type is good i like the
thick strokes and how you emulated the
monitor very good so thanks for that
submission all right so sitting on the
dock of the bay so for a lot of younger
people they probably wouldn't you know
of course everybody's heard this song
but if you're just reading this that
might be a little bit hard to understand
but I the concept itself I do like it um
let's see here lieth they have these are
the same in the same individual leaf who
did these so I could tell the the style
is kind of same so yeah this is actually
a pretty good concept I given you know
assuming a person we're going to know
this song sitting on the dock of the bay
because most people would probably read
that without drawing unless they really
knew those lyrics which most people
don't but given the lyrics and it's
assuming you understood it this would
definitely be a good entry right here so
thanks for that all right next one all
right chemistry oak no tripping on acid
so I guess chemistry not exactly in the
same field as I you know web programming
or you know it certainly is nerdy I but
this isn't you know for what it is it's
not too bad I think there it got a
little bit too cluttered in this area
right here maybe simplifying this would
have been a little bit better before it
is it's not bad even though it doesn't
really have much relevance to you know
the internet itself but thanks for the
submissions all right first attempt
let's see here
let's see something real quick yeah
Sarah I I see the only thing that was
changed here is this number right here
and I just you're gonna have to let me
know what's going on I'm such a failure
all right so Sarah all right second
attempt from Terra again basis idea on
open source not sure if it works all
right so open source it's chili sauce so
basically we come up with the idea of
trying to open a bottle of sauce aka
source it's it's kind of the reach to
really get people to draw that
connection between you know the internet
and open source and just the sauce so
yeah for ignoring that aspect of it
though i do i think the the design and
is in and of itself is pretty good
looking at this right here I like this
one a little bit better stands out more
thanks for that this one unfortunately
has no relevance whatsoever so I'm just
going to go ahead and have to
unfortunately skip that arm let's see
here anchor text so this one I the for a
t-shirt design this wouldn't be ideal
just because it's kind of like as a very
square thing that's kind of thrown on
there um ideally if you really wanted to
portray the same idea you would you get
rid of the background you would focus on
just showing the boat itself that way
the book kind of stands out a little bit
more it's a little bit hard to see here
in this context and you would work with
just the boat and I this portion and the
actual anchor chain link down here so in
terms of the concept it's pretty good
but the excitation just needs a little
bit more work in my opinion thanks for
that all right I ok so this one
basically conveying frustrations of a
developer trying to figure something out
not too bad I seems like there's a
little bit going on but still
not not enough to the point at which you
know person would have a hard time
understanding it so I terms of the the
graphics and how everything was designed
here everything here is pretty good so
thanks for the submission all right and
then this one is just obviously the best
out of all of them should have been the
winner no I'm just kidding this is my no
I so when I was doing this I was
thinking to myself copy and paste but
generally scanner you know you think of
a scanner isn't generally copying I so I
may fell short in my own attempt so this
is it's quite a challenge when you're
trying to come up with these all right
computer art the monitor is the canvas
pretty straightforward died the designs
not really that bad but the one thing
that is not correct is the shadow and
specifically the color of the shadow
you're looking for a little bit
different darker type of red this looks
like it's in a different hue I possibly
so it doesn't look very good in terms of
being a shadow I but for what it is not
bad I definitely a good illustration in
terms of the ideas you trying to convey
here so thanks for that submission all
right an Internet pun that always made
me think what is true behind the tech we
use nowadays ok ok chosen mine all right
so one issue here is this text right
here bad contrast issues basically makes
it really difficult to read so if
specially it's on a t-shirt you wouldn't
get this color anyway so I would remove
this completely and then just focus on
the dice and to the text here not too
big I think it would be a little bit
more effective to if you really increase
the stroke of the black and as well the
stroke here and make them even the same
stroke weight on both of these all right
so thanks for the submission all right
so USB port not quite sure how a known
port wine is so I'm still doubting
whether i leave the label or just remove
it honestly
I do drink wine but I'm not like a wine
expert definitely not and so I was kind
of confused honestly because I didn't
know so I ignoring that just focusing on
the design itself yeah it looks like we
could have made this stand out a little
bit more either by changing the
background or making this you know these
colors stand out a lot more because it's
a little bit hard it just the whole
thing seems dark so you wanted to stand
out quite a bit more so aside from that
though I definitely pretty simple good
concept that you have going here so
thanks for that all right let's see here
now this one does stand out more like
this a lot better so definitely a big
improvement here so thanks for that all
right so Yoda with his lightsaber
transformed into an umbrella so I'm not
exactly sure what relevance the umbrella
has or this whole image has in terms of
you know programming internet deep web
design etc for what it is you design his
character it's not too bad but again
we're kind of just missing the relevance
issue thanks for this mission though all
right so i just realized missive on the
tech element hello upload to join me by
name all right so right now obviously
missed the whole tech stuff but I for
what this is pretty good illustration
though um and I think you know barring
the relevance issue it could possibly be
pretty you know a decent seller so I may
want to change the I would maybe make
this quite a bit darker of a purple so
that stands out a little bit more
because there's not a lot of contrast
between him in the background I so yeah
thanks for the entry all right so let's
see here press it word what why can I
hopefully I'm not missing something that
draws you know that's obvious to
everyone else that's why I'm kind of
worried about
I and so I'm not I'm not able to figure
out how this has relevance to you know
the top the intended topic I with that
to having said that looking at it in
terms of the designs very expressive so
it's not bad I'm just having a hard time
this is one of those entries I was just
going to confused about unfortunately
thanks for the summation though all
right so all right the donut revenge
okay again this is one of those issue
where this had nothing to do with the
topic but in terms of the design in and
of itself I like the design of the V
donuts and the characters and the
expression I specifically if we're
looking at the strokes though you know
you have strokes on almost everything
but then the policemen are you know non
stroke you know I designed characters
and it kind of throws off the
consistency of the design so when you
have all these strokes here but then we
have these that are designed in a
different fashion it kind of throws it
off the concept in and of itself Duncan
policeman that's pretty good so I thanks
for that submission all right watch the
resources um looking at this down here
the extent of sorry I realized that I
failed the topic so this is one again
one of those issues where the top it
wasn't you know covered unfortunately
but having said that looking at this
there's not too much for me to critique
to be able to even say anything
unfortunately that would be a value to
you at least so sorry for that now look
at at second page okay I it took me a
little bit time to figure out what was
going on here and what the concept was
but that's only because I never knew
this was called a peg like these things
that you know you clip on I usually hang
clothes on such I just calls like
clothes clothes hangers clothes hangers
but this once once I realized it was
called a peg in this in the form of a J
then I was realized okay that's pretty
nique concept and its really done well
as you know I think maybe the strokes
can made a little bit thicker but that's
a tiny gripe I think in terms of you
know all the detail and the concept
itself definitely has relevance to you
know the intended topic and it's it's
designed well very good so if I were to
have chosen a winner out of all these
these submissions the party would have
been this one so thanks for this motion
here although one thing to say is the
the shadows off unfortunately the shadow
doesn't feel it feel like it fits this
well enough but that that's not a big
deal at all all right so looking at this
I so the landing page again it would be
best to completely get rid of the
monitor and only focus just on the pages
and the helicopter and maybe not even
mention the landing page either you know
try to make people think about it I and
then it would be a little bit much more
effective in my opinion I'm so having
said that in terms of the design you
know a lot of time is spent on this very
good I just think it would be a little
more effective which is just completely
got rid of you know the the monitor the
clouds or you could possibly leave the
clouds actually but just not in case it
in something like this so good concept
and good submission all right web
designers I posted a new thread by
accident new to the site okay all right
so this is pretty literal um I'm not too
sure about having all these I what do
you call the different commands here
inside each block of the web I like the
idea the general idea you know we have
web and you know web can mean internet
or it can mean spider web and combining
those ideas but I'm not just I'm not
sure that if this was the best execution
of that idea so I would be interesting
you know maybe if you want to try it
again try to simplify and started
instead of having all these different
symbols here because then it gets a
little bit cluttered and just a little
bit hard to follow but
for the submission it's a good concept
jquery let's do more let's see here so
one thing that I was confused about is
this character right here Elmo swing
Mike my children watch Spongebob and I
see Patrick all the time this reminded
me of Patrick I I think I might get the
idea behind this so we have jquery but
in front of it we have i think this is
reference what to Ajax I would assume
with a Jack's right here um yeah I'm not
too sure about how obvious this is
unfortunately though in portraying what
you're trying to portray assuming that's
what you're trying to do let me come
over here here thanks for the submission
no column one all right all right so
Frank design I wanted to represent all
things that go into web design
development food and drink use pizza and
energy drinks this is me and okay so
this is unfortunately way too much going
on for this to be effective so the
shattered I'm not sure what this blue
thing is this right here this right here
see when it comes to really effective
concepts when it comes the logo design
and this these types of t-shirt designs
you want to really want to stick with
just a couple of elements to focus on so
when you try to bring in all these
different elements it becomes too
cluttered and just kind of confusing
unfortunately so thanks for the
submission now all right so here we go
bad gateway so this is obviously in
reference to some error code that were
on a website loads it says bad gateway
and the broken connection here not sure
what the asterisk we represent this is
one of those concept this is
well-designed concepts design-wise
there's nothing there's not an issue
here it's it's it's done quite well but
in terms of the concept in it being
witty in unique or clever i that's the
one that's kind of eluding me unless I'm
just not seeing something that I'm
supposed to see are you intended me
see but thanks for the submission and
here we have a penis alright so this
look I've done reason for your design
studios some people cannot see penis but
but this is actually idea of creating
something decent pure and controversial
at the same time so how could you get
something decent and pure but also try
to make it controversial I don't know
anyhow unfortunately there there's no
relevance here in terms of you know
internet tech and web and in and of the
visual aspects of itself alright so
let's come down here okay this is my
design of course now if you ever heard
of the dongle now add on go of course is
a small like a USB stick and some
expensive software requires you to
install it and this is a means of anti
piracy and whenever ever heard of dongle
I've always sort of like dong so I just
had to do this but I wanted to make a
little bit more elaborate and kind of
maybe summarize this into some stupid
robotic I'm messed up I know okay I
looking at this alright so PA bombs okay
so why did the chicken cross the road to
get to the other side the dark side thus
the star wars reference so this is an a
bad design and of itself i think the
this highlight here could have been a
little bit thicker just because it looks
pixelized even at this um you know if we
just brought this that a little bit
thickness right here and maybe just make
a tail off it would have been a little
bit better but for what it is definitely
a good concept but i would say
definitely not relevant to the intended
topic of it being internet tech web
design etc so of course you know there's
a lot of geeks and nerds who love Star
Wars but that that's not really it's
inclusive to or specific to internet
tech you know I web design development
programming etc because there's a lot of
other people who love Star Wars
but I don't think Glenn really realized
that perhaps when he chose this as the
winning design so that's that not a big
deal though I thanks for the submission
and here is the last one ok so you are
the CSS to my HTML so a little bit
difficult I mean I understand what this
is saying but I'm not too sure about the
execution in terms of you know what
exactly is the witty part I or if the
idea in and of itself makes sense so CSS
is the beauty aspect ok I guess that
kind of makes sense to my HTML so
because CSS makes things look pretty in
the browser I guess and the HTML is just
died you know maybe that's a reference
to himself or the guy or something
traditionally this is yeah not too bad
I'm not too sure if it were work I
ideally this kind of like a one of the
issues we face in a couple submissions
back where I said get rid of the monitor
in this case get rid of the the browser
here just focus on the text in and of
itself I would probably even get rid of
the press Y and I would just focus on
this that's it right here and it would
probably be a lot more effective in my
opinion but thanks for that and those
are all the entries so make sure you
subscribe here on youtube if you haven't
yet check out design course calm but the
one-on-one training the video courses
and I will see you tomorrow with a brand
new challenge alright goodbye
