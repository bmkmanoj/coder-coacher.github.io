I'm launching kind of a new little
series gonna happen every Sunday where
we preview the coming content the
upcoming content in the next week
regarding this channel and also my
website and also I'm going to pick out a
topic that's relevant to design or
coding and I'm going to give you my
thoughts and I want you to give me your
thoughts in the comment and see what you
think and see if we kind of line in
terms of the same thinking or am I just
being crazy the very first topic I want
to get this out of the way before I
discuss the upcoming content is smashing
magazine.com
now smashing mat whoa oh sorry but my
eyes just got blasted by just bigness
the sheer scale of this Smashing
Magazine com is a very well-established
blog they create awesome articles and
content and they've been around forever
they get tons of traffic they're like a
seven thousand on there Alexa ranking
and they've recently rebranded their
site and also their layout so this is
what this is all about today's topic I
want to show you this is a rebranding a
lot of people are noticing first the
navigation is taking up about you know
one fifth of the vertical viewport
height which seems a little bit
overblown a little bit quite a bit
excessive coming down here if I hover
over these secondary pieces of content
the first thing that I notice is it's
cutting off freakin first character of
the article to the right of it which I
don't know why you in just you know
maybe cut it down by 10% so that you can
see the content also look how slow these
animations are whoa and I don't have a
slow computer but you're just gonna see
how this actually ends up remedying
itself as I scroll down so let me go to
the bottom of the page by the way is
this performance a very ironic let me
scroll down nothing much happening here
nothing really to note but if I go back
up and start hovering over these look at
how smooth they are so there's something
happy
in terms of elements loading or not
loading that is leading to this issue
with performance and by the way this is
a release candidate candidate it says it
right up there however there has also
been you know a round of beta testing as
they mentioned do you think that would
be something that you would kind of
figure out beforehand but all in all to
this point it's not horrible but wait
until we get to the article page what is
this right here now mind you in this
article they mention where they're
talking about welcome to the new
Smashing membership they mentioned that
they they don't believe in ads anymore
and they want white space man they gave
you white space and it doesn't really
make sense to me the title you know the
whole purpose of what this page is about
is shoved over here kind of as an
afterthought to the lower right hand
corner and they have this more really
large you know kind of image of the
author and about the author as if as if
this actually has priority over the the
actual title now if I scroll in here to
a data or not prior zoom in rather to a
tablet size this starts making more
sense they have appropriately the actual
content and the title of the page right
here but if you go out here things are
way too jumbled so let me know what you
think some people like it I think most
people don't let me know what you think
about that so also in terms of the
content that's coming up is next week as
soon as tomorrow we're going to really
have a focus on this week and probably
next on electron which allows you to
create native desktop apps that allow
you to hook into native you know desktop
functionality across Mac Windows and
Linux writing and using JavaScript HTML
and CSS so that's really exciting for me
it's kind of like ionic except for
desktops so I have a whole crash course
that's created for this around an hour
long or I'm planning it to be an hour
long I have the project already done
it's going to be a cryptocurrency sort
of project related to Bitcoin so that
should be cool and then also we will
part
see a video or two about you know
intermediate to advanced topics
pertaining to angular 5 and or ionic 3
alright so also one final thing to note
is tomorrow ends the Black Friday
promotion so if you go to our joint page
here you see regularly I charge $80 for
a year membership to access all my
courses here at course central.com slash
courses it's only $29 drawer pretty much
the next 24 hours expires here at the
end of cyber monday alright so make sure
you check that out a lot of people it
really surprised me a lot of people have
joined so I'm really excited about this
and also I'm gonna be pumping out
content insanely in 2018 because I'm
going full-time I pretty much at the
beginning of the year I have one more
course left to do for another network
alright so make sure you subscribe here
