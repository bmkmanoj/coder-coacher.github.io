video where we're going to design our
logo now just to preface this I as I
mentioned into the introduction video it
would be a good idea to kind of come up
with your own business and own company
name that you can follow along with this
and that way you're able to kill two
birds with one stone and the idea that
you can watch and follow along and
experience and gain some knowledge in
terms of you know how I go about
building a web-based business but also
maybe even come up with something of
your own that can make you money so I'm
gonna go to file and new and I'm working
with Adobe Illustrator CC here and this
is the latest one currently at the time
of recording this video but if you have
a previous version or even maybe a
future version everything I'm doing here
should be pretty much standard across
almost all versions of Illustrator
within reason so I'm going to name it
logo design and for the width and height
I'm using 750 by 500 points and I'm
basically just using this because it's
going to fit well with my 1280 by 720
resolution so you can use whatever fits
well with your resolution so I'm going
to hit OK hit control 1 to get to 100%
here and for my name here it's going to
be logo design and when we're just
talking about the name itself in a logo
we can call it a work mark and I'm going
to use the font called trade gothic and
this is the font that I purchased I but
you can use there's so many other fonts
out there and if you don't want to spend
the money you can go to a site like da
font comm and you could browse and just
sort it by free fonts only and they have
a ton of them so I I'm gonna leave it
just like this and then I'm going to add
a CEO over here for the domain extension
so a control C and control F and change
it to just dot CEO scaling it down or
hold shift and just putting it right
around there
alright so that will serve as our word
mark and this could be a logo in and of
self but I'm going to add a symbol over
here in the form of what's called a
letter mark which will take the L and
the D and combine it into a single shape
so I I'm going to take this here and
copy that L and then copy that again
and make this one D all right so now I'm
going to do is take all these and hit
control shift in Oh to flatten them or -
I convert to shape rather then I'm going
to go to view show grid and then view
snap to grid now I'm going to zoom up
here I'm going to increase the scale of
those quite a bit and have it match up
right here with this point and then what
I want to do is zoom up again here and
I'm going to take the rectangle tool and
start at this point right up here and
just connect there and then temporarily
just turn off snap to grid take the
opacity down a bit and I'm going to make
it match up evenly here this doesn't
have to be perfect I and you'll see why
in a bit
okay all right so now what I want to do
is take the D here and I'm going to
scale it a little bit and make it match
up just to right around there so if you
let me zoom up just a little bit more
here and what we're gonna do is take
this portion right here in the lower
right hand and we're gonna make it
combined with this area and then do the
same thing up here and let me get this
up here and take the D I'm gonna put
this to the top and I'm going to extend
this just a little bit above the L all
right okay so now what I want to do is
go ahead and take the D and then this
layer right here the square and I'm
going to move them over zoo back up now
for the D I'm going to right click hit
ungroup right click and then hit release
compound path so that gets rid of that
central area right there
and then what I want to do is take this
layer go to object path divide objects
below alright so what that does is I can
take this middle section and just hit
delete and then what I'm going to do is
also delete that portion with the direct
selection tool and now what I want to do
is take these over here and line them up
now let's go ahead and make the opacity
100% and one thing I want to do is scale
this up just a little bit
take this up just a little bit as well
just so it almost matches the bottom of
the L alright so I'm going to go to view
hide grid and if I scale this up a lot
you can see the intended effect
I is the L right here and then the D is
the negative space right here which
serves for the letter mark being LD for
logo design and this of course can be
used independently as an icon separate
from the word mark here but as an if we
take both of these and we combined them
and present them together then to
combination mark and it's our logo okay
I so let me just position this up a
little bit that is basically the logo
design that I'm going to use so in the
next section what we're going to do is
go into Adobe Photoshop and take this
logo design and get it prepared onto a
document in which we're going to begin
the design and the mock-up of the
homepage all right I will see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
