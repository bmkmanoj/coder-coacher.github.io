lettering with the site's name design
course so that's what you're going to be
hand lettering so you're free to use a
pressure-sensitive tablet as I mentioned
or pen and paper cool go free and brush
pens work well though they're not
required you just use a pencil and pen
and just create the outlines and fill
the type in with the pen it's a little
bit more time consuming but you could
still do that in of course here's a link
to a good learning resource on hand
lettering it just has a bunch of
different resources that you can learn
from I should have loaded this up
beforehand i'll let that load for some
reason is going slow yeah there it is 50
top resources for learning hand
lettering so you can just browse through
this if you wish so the requirements
feed your only design course no other
symbolism or graphics don't try to add
anything else to it just feature the
type and if you do this by hand try to
get a good scan or picture for
presentation purposes you know the one
