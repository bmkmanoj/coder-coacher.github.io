today we're going to get started with
the second portion of our photo
manipulation and photoshop CC so I of
course if you need access to all the
project files and the resource files
they're available for free in the
description below this video all rights
get started alright so let's continue on
with our war is hell photo manipulation
so now what I want to do is get in an
image I've an asset that we can use to
kind of create a ground right here so
that image is right here and we're going
to use the let's see here the 1600
version so right click copy image and we
will go to just above just click right
on the background layer ctrl V to paste
that in all right so a lot of
adjustments need to make be made to this
as well of course so let's go ahead and
go to image adjustments desaturate and
i'm going to get rid of with our square
marquee tool just a rectangular marquee
tool rather and just hit delete after
selecting the top portion and then we'll
get an adjustment layer I for the
brightness and contrast and right around
there so negative 1 26 and 98 for the
contrast so I also make sure you're only
selected on that layer alright so we'll
call this ground real quick and then
what I want to do is take the eraser
tool and use a brush may be right around
367 for the radius and we're just going
to slowly just kind of erase around the
edges
kind of just like that so let me zoom up
to see this all right all right so I
let's see here basically I I'm not going
to start working on the center too much
yet I'm with exception you know to the
ground i just added basically I now what
I want to do is get some flag images
alright so those flag images let me get
out real quick all right here and so you
can find that in the description and i'm
going to use just this default large
1024 right click copy image and oops
we'll go to the top layer and just paste
this in and then once again leaves the
pen tool with path selected up top and
we will go around this very quickly so
I'm not too worried about being one
hundred percent precise although you can
if you wish obviously if you're doing
this for a serious project you want to
be you want to get in there a lot closer
and just make sure you're cutting
everything out correctly and on point
right click make selection hit OK ctrl
shift I control C and ctrl D to deselect
then hit delete all right so i'll paste
that in hit ctrl t hold and then just
rotate it so it looks like it's on the
ground and also pick it shift + alt +
scale that down we'll put it right
around there select move tool hit apply
all right so i'll rename this to flag
flag one and i will go to image
adjustments desaturate ok give it an
adjustment of for brightness and
contrast
alright and that's good i'm going to
move on to the next flag and you can get
that link in a description right click
copy image and I'm not choosing any
specific country's flag for any reason
there's this ones that were kind of good
images to use if we're going to
manipulate them to look like they're on
the ground alright so little loops it's
going to hit to apply that was an
accident move this up so we can see the
whole thing and then once again perform
this tedious task although for this
image since you're probably could have
used the background eraser tool that's
no problem though I can kind of just go
pretty quickly but yeah if you select
your eraser tool or left click and drag
out on top of that eraser tool there is
a background eraser tool that you could
probably use which might be quicker ctrl
shift I ctrl c ctrl D and then hit
delete and then just paste that in all
right so I'm going to zoom out here I'm
going to go to image adjustments
desaturate ctrl T hold alt key and then
drag that in and then hit shift to scale
that in and then I'll put this may be
one over here select move till it apply
and we'll call this fly to and we will
give it an adjustment layer right around
there looks pretty good
alright and we'll continue on with a
third flag which is let me find it right
whoo that's not good i think i move that
around love it too much made everything
hide on my desktop yeah it's right here
okay no it's not that's the one from
before sorry about that irritating right
there all right click copy image ctrl-v
to paste I think this is the Iranian
flag all right take the path
all right click make selection hit OK
ctrl shift I or comanche thigh and
patrol C ctrl D and hit delete and paste
that in all right same thing image
adjustments desaturate and we will hit
ctrl t just flatten that by holding alt
scale that in and right around there and
then we'll take the adjustment layer for
brightness and contrast right around
there alright let me zoom them out so
far so good let's continue on and let me
get out my notes here because I of all
these linked basically and then take
this this is another one wait is that
the one we used already looks like it
let me alright this is the right one
right here and when I'm going to go over
here select download all sizes right
click copy image ctrl-v to paste all
right path it's okay if it's cut off
their it's not that big of a deal you
kind of want to stay inside so you're
not getting into that blue the light
blue at least
if you go in that's not that big of a
deal you can't really tell going too
much so right click make selection hit
okay control shift I and ctrl c ctrl d
delete control V ctrl T scale this down
holding shift and alt hit apply and then
once again image adjustments desaturate
I know this is so tedious so you
basically want them to look like they're
in the same brightness and contrast all
right so basically now what I want to do
is move those around a little bit get
rid of that so I'm going to take I we
rename this to flag 3 and then flag for
up here and I'm going to yeah the first
one I think it's a pretty good position
right around here second one holding
shift selecting both of these will be
possibly right around there third one
and then the fourth one okay so
basically just a couple flags here a few
flags now what I want to do is get some
I interesting stuff here in the center
so I'm going to create a new layer and
I'm just going to call this it's kind of
like blood / fire so these are I free
blood spatter brushes which is also
linked in the description I and what I
want to do is yeah these are them right
here we want to find kind of the right
ones here if I could use that so red is
in our foreground color when you have to
scale this down probably you're around
i'm going to try seven hundred and then
just click once like that hit ctrl T and
then hold alt
and drag that down there in the center
right around there hit apply I'm going
to zoom up here to one hundred percent
and I'm going to ctrl shift n hit fire
to for a new layer I'm going to try a
different brush this time okay take that
down to 700
hit ctrl T
all right and it'll apply all right and
then I yeah above those layers so select
the top layer ctrl shift end for a new
layer will call this glow we'll take our
brush tool take a large feather brush
not quite 700 though all right more like
around 367 click once in the center ctrl
t hold alt and drag this out that apply
alright and i'm going to try overlay
actually going to go down the list here
so basically you select normal hit your
down arrow key and you can experiment
with various glows soft light looks
pretty good and color looks pretty good
as well i'm going to use color for that
alright so now what we want to do is
kind of add some I highlights on these
individuals so it looks like they're
being illuminated from the back I from
this portion over here so what we want
to do is hit ctrl + left click and that
will automatically select around the
layer for there and what I want to do is
create a new layer on top of the last
clipping mask so ctrl shift n let's call
it highlight and make sure it's a
clipping mask and what we want to do is
take our brush tool will try around 25
initially will change this layer to an
overlay and as you can see what I'm
doing I'm zooming up here and you kind
of want to get
go down to 13 kind of want to get down I
just kind of just like that slightly so
it looks like they're being illuminated
all right and then what I want to do is
go even smaller around six maybe even
make a tad bit smaller around four for
the size and go around some of these
individuals
and just try to make it look natural all
right I'm just kind of seeing if there's
anything else you know you could spend a
lot of time working on this but you get
the idea
alright so now we want to do is I'm
going to zoom out just a little bit
holding alt and if it's standing out a
little bit too much it looks too
prominent basically you can take the
eraser tool with an opacity maybe around
40 or you can also take the opacity of
the layer down as part do that it's not
destructive but that's okay alright so
that looks pretty decent and now we got
to do the same thing for these guys so
yeah let me take the brush start off a
little bit larger around 20 and their
soldiers one I believe yes control shift
end for a new layer create a clipping
mask and now the which also changes to
overlay now these individuals are there
to the right of kind of well the fire is
so I'm going to focus on adding the
highlights to the right side of their
body
come down in size I like five all right
all right so all right I let me go ahead
and zoom out here take the opacity down
slightly around 69 that's what I've done
and then we also got to get these
individuals in the back some color so
there are there at the back here so
where they get well I'll select layer
just click OK there there all right so
on top of that adjustment layer ctrl
shift n create a clipping mask layer and
we'll call this highlight and basically
they don't look kind of correct when
they're all one hundred percent black
and white so I'm going to take the brush
right around I'd say 30 and make this an
overlay layer so right there take the
opacity down 68 just kind of go on the
back row
alright and then what I want to do I'm
going to take this army BG under
right-click earth I have to get my
recording thing out of the way I'm going
to right-click and convert to smart
object and then that way what that
allows you to do it works much like an
adjustment layer because if you add a
filter and you go to blur Gaussian blur
oh no oops that's the wrong one yeah it
no I'm right sorry filter blur Gaussian
blur take this amount down drastically I
yeah I think point eight might work
pretty well so hit OK and go two hundred
percent so now they're in the eye
there's blurred out a little bit it
makes these guys a little bit more
realistic and also want to take them and
do the same thing except not that amount
of blur it was point eight before so
right click convert to smart object
filter blur Gaussian blur and we'll try
maybe point three okay hit OK and then
do the same thing with these guys over
here so right click convert to smart
object filter Gaussian blur and point
three alright looking pretty good so far
I we're already at 20 minutes so I think
this is going to be a good place to stop
for today and continue on tomorrow all
right I'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
