design course comm and today is January
30th with our 31st video of the year and
we are going to continue on with our
iPhone breathalyzer website design in
the HTML and CSS process so today we're
going to get finished with actually
doing the HTML and CSS but we've still
are going to have one more day tomorrow
where we get the menu working and also
do some other finishing touches so as
always check out design course calm and
subscribe here on YouTube and the social
channels which are available in the
description all right let's get started
ok so this is where we left off from
yesterday we have this text right here
so we're gonna continue on working by
adding the HTML for the resulting are
the text afterwards and then we'll go
ahead and style it in CSS so let's go
ahead and get up our editor here alright
so inside of here
I if we switch back to our Photoshop we
need to add this text so this is
basically going to be in a P tag
paragraph tag for HTML and open it up by
P and paste that in and then close it
oops
now we're gonna want to be able to
control the look and feel of this text
and certainly in the margin as well so
we're going to give it a class of
subtext alright so we'll save that and
then underneath we have our button our
call to action so right here is order
your Baxter now real quickly I'll just
get that text and copy it and this will
just be a single link in AF so a href
equals we're not pointing it anywhere so
we'll use that I'm we also want to give
it a class of CTA - BTN as a button and
remember you can name these classes or
these IDs anything you want
so it doesn't have to be specific to
what I'm using and so let's go ahead and
yeah paste that in and then close that
so if we save that and then we go ahead
and look at what that looks like we'll
see we have some ugly text here so now
we have to go in and first we'll change
the font and the colors and then we'll
work with the actual margins and such
all right so we have the h1 here this is
white our black currently so we need to
change that and then make this as well I
white text so what we can do instead of
trying to make these white or whatever
it was is we have an ID here of top one
we can just make that white so let's get
our CSS out here and custom and we
already have it open here so we can just
put in color all right and save that all
right now it's white alright and now
what you want to do is change the font
and because most of our text is basic
with with exception to the links at the
top and the navigation since they're
going to be the source sans Pro that we
used you see if we have that up here
yeah we have it right here we're going
to reference the body tag which is
inclusive of everything inside of it
basically so I'm just going to come to
the top here and just put in body and
we're gonna put font - family source
sans Pro save that and then bring our I
think back here there it is okay so this
is thicker than we want it because if
you recall we're using this thinner
weight so all we have to do is come back
into our where's that editor our CSS I
have too many of these windows open I'm
trying to find the right one okay I
could just minimize that okay we'll go
to I'm just gonna go to the bottom here
h1 font - wait 300 and remember that's
the one that we chose right here alright
so go back well refresh this and there
we go we're also going to want to change
the size of this so let's go back here
and change will put font - sighs 2.5
eeehm alright so that's a better size
and let's see here we want to work with
the sub text right here a little bit so
I'll just type in sub text and we want
to do make it a little bit larger so
font size by default it's 1 so we're
gonna make it 1 point 2 p.m. and then we
also want to adjust a margin it was too
close to the title and the link so I'm
just going to put it in margin here for
that we're going to specify the top
value as being 12 pixels right value 0
the bottom value would be a little bit
more and 0 like that so let's save that
and see what this looks like
all right so things are spaced out a
little bit better let's work with the
link now make that actually look like
this so let's get the color here and
it's FF 960 or 0 we'll copy that
and the
class was CTA - BTN alright so this is
going to have quite a few properties
just to get this working correctly
alright so the first thing we want to do
is make sure the the only color is white
so color alright we don't want text
decoration on it as and we don't want
the underline so we want to do tech text
expert a decoration none we want the
background color to be that just paste
that in and we also want a border radius
I think we had a corner radius right
here I think it was three or four that
doesn't really matter we'll just say for
the border - radius 4px and then also
Mo's as a Mozilla border radius for
pixels let's just save this and we'll
see what it looks like it's not going to
be correct yet but we're getting there
as you can see so let's continue on we
want to add some padding because padding
between the text and the actual button
so padding will do ten pixels and you'll
see it's not going to look correct 100%
we want to be a little bit wider on the
sides so to control that we just put in
a different value this is top bottom
this is left right so we'll save that
and it will look a little bit better all
right and then let's say I make the font
size bigger 1.4 let's I also do I let's
see here text-align:center and we're
going to hit display:block and then with
50% so watch what happens now all right
so now the width of this containing
element of this background is going to
be 50% of whatever the parent element is
so take this down it's still only 50%
and it's not in the middle so we're
going to make some adjustments for that
and that will come in with
Media queries now I also want to add
some margin this is too close between
here and here and so let's see here
we had no margin already so let's just
try 20 pixels just to experiment yeah
that didn't really make it a much of a
difference
let's try 40 all right that looks a
little bit better and also if you notice
here I there's not an even distance
currently between this portion and this
portion so I think everything both these
blocks and right here are going to need
to be pushed down probably another good
I don't know 40 pixels so I'm gonna go
back and work with that a little bit so
we need to find which one that was
so I believe it was where's the phone at
yeah I think it was a phone - top that
we had that margin on so if we go find
that has margin top 1/10 let's just try
like 150 and save that and see if it
gets pushed down a little bit more
evenly
all right that's a lot better in my
opinion there we go and then we'll push
this down as well
and if you ever you know if you're
working with your HTML files kind of
getting large and you kind of forget you
know what the the the IDs are the class
names are that you're trying to work
with you can see it you know in chrome
it's control shift die and I believe as
well in Firefox and Chrome you if you
just take this little you click this
little magnifying glass and you come in
and you click on like a in element
that's around where you want to find it
shows you right here and it shows
automatically when you click on it
you'll see this this orange portion at
the top up here well that's your margin
right there so that's what we want to
find to be able to adjust and if I bring
this over here let me just bring the
width in here you'll see it shows all
the CSS of whatever's currently selected
so we'll see it stopped
on the idea of toppling with margin 200
pixels and another quick thing is if you
just want to experiment on the fly and
have it I show you in the browser you
can change these I basically the values
and it will update in real time so I put
I changed it from 200 to 240 and already
that's looking pretty good so I think
that's what I'm going to use and now
this this doesn't save it it just gives
you a live preview so if we refresh it
of course it's going to go back up so we
just have to find the tag here top 1 200
change that to 40 and then we'll go
ahead and refresh okay all right so so
far so good we could see a couple things
happen here when we start getting this
thing in I'm gonna hit ctrl shift I
again just move this off-screen so that
we can see the pixel value right here
when we scale this so right off the bat
the reason this is going to the second
line is because there's no more width in
that element so that's fine there's
several ways we can approach this we can
try to scale down bring down the font
size a little bit or this actually
doesn't look too bad but I think there's
too much height a line height in between
this I you know that the h1 tag so what
we'll do is I think what we'll do and
will make more sense is go ahead and
just bring in the line height a little
bit with CSS so let's go ahead and do
that
that is HOA ok right there now I I
didn't do this like when I did the test
one the project before is I usually just
run through everything so we're gonna
have to experiment just to kind of get
an idea so real quick I'll just try a
line height I'm gonna put it like 25 I
think that's gonna be way too and you
know what I'm just off the bag I'm gonna
try 30 and usually a lot of this is you
know just kind of experimenting so when
you change the line height it will kind
of bring everything up even if it's on
one line
so that's a little bit too close so
we'll just change this real quickly to
like 36 and that looks a little bit
better all right and then we have kind
of like an issue here where this is
coming down because we have remember 50%
of whatever the containing element is so
we can come in here let's see yeah that
will use the media query to adjust that
so let's find the CTA button is what it
is and I think between these two values
right here we'll put this in and the
only thing will change as the width by
default was I set 50% so now we're gonna
change it to let's try 80% so let's
bring that back up and refresh it now
it's it works better there and then when
we scale this all the way in we see like
a massive issue everything's pushed down
so what's go ahead first before we get
to this and work on this obviously if
you're viewing this on a tablet or a
phone this does not need to be this big
so we'll go ahead and adjust the width
and proportionally it will scale down
based on the percentage we give it and
so let's go ahead and do that real quick
the idea of that phone was phone - top
and we're going to come down here just
to everything that's less than 767 and
reference that and change this to with
50% so let's go ahead and see what that
looks like so now it has a obviously
it's quite a bit smaller all right so
let's bring up this again real quick and
see how we can bring all of this closer
together so if you control shift I and
click on that little magnifying glass
and I'm using chrome again to do this
let's click right in here I'll bring
this up real quick so we can see this we
could see all that orange which is
basically margin I've that is applied to
this top one and we can see the margin
top is 240 which is what we set for the
larger view so what we want to do is
take top one and take that margin down
significantly for this portion right
here so just put top one oh man
hands in the wrong area of the keyboard
all right top one margin I - top I'm
gonna put 20 pixels and then also for
the text that is inside of top one we
wanted everything to align in the center
so we'll add text align Center all right
so let's refresh this and see what
happens
now where everything moved up
significantly so let's see here I think
it would also be worth it to cut down on
the media query that's within 767 on
this up there so real quickly ctrl shift
I will find this and that it's phone top
and we see we have a margin top of 150
so it's take phone to top it's already
there so margin top I don't know I think
we had 150 so we'll put in just try 100
just to see what that looks like it's a
lot better
all right and then let's get back here
and work with this thing and we want
this basically to go a hundred percent
across so that I don't think we had that
down here CTA button right there let's
paste it right here with 100 or no not a
thousand there you go there we go
all right so once we start we're gonna
start working on everything kind of
beneath this portion and then we can you
know once we understand what's beneath
it and how much room there is beneath
this portion we can work with that a
little bit later so let's go ahead and
look over here and see what we have
going for these two portions right there
all right so basically if we get up our
grid we'll see that each one of these is
six columns wide so we're gonna have to
have to clot to div that are six columns
and then inside we're gonna have one
that is two in four so let's go ahead
and get started with that sorry I'm
clicking on the wrong windows all right
so let's get out the HTML and look at we
have what we have going here so
basically we want to get outside of
right there and just start at the bottom
and so I'm going to type in div class
equals container 12 okay come inside of
it and div class equals column six close
that up and then basically you know
these column six is there gonna be
duplicates so we'll focus just on this
one here all right so inside of that
we're going to also have a call to and
this will contain our image of the foam
and then also div class equals column
six no four sorry and then close this up
and this is going this will contain the
text and this will contain the image so
the image let's bring this down is
breathalyser good for this first one so
I'll type in IMG source equals images
hush breath eliezer
good PNG and we'll give it a class I'm
just gonna call it SD all right and then
and the reason I gave that a class
instead of an idea again is because this
is going to be duplicated and so there
will be two instances so you can't use
an ID there all right
and then let's put in a P tag we'll go
back here to photoshop wait that's not
the ones down here ctrl a ctrl C copy
that paste that in get P okay let's see
alright so now what I want to do is just
save and we'll see how messed up this
sucks because we haven't really adjusted
anything and CSS alright so we could see
that they're not floating left of each
other and the reason that is because we
have to add a couple classes that was
that were built into the framework that
were used in 1140 and so we need to get
rid of the right and left margin that's
on the columns here so basically right
here after column two we put in alpha
and then Omega like it gets rid of
basically left and right margins so if
we save that they now float left and
right all right all right now let's go
ahead and give the container 12 an
actual ID so we can control the margin
basically between these elements so let
me go over here ID equals I'm just gonna
call MDC I can mid content come up here
just after her before the first media
query
and we want to give that let's see we're
here we're quick margin-top and I'm
gonna try like 2:30 turn 30 pixels from
the element above it yeah that's too
much and again you know if you want to
fine-tune this or if even if you want to
make it specific - which is always a
good thing you know I believe the
element that it's taking this from is
from the bottom of this to there so this
would be the distance so just a copy
mergers are quicker I think there's a
tool you can use by just do this I
always done it for some reason like that
202 so take 2 a to save it and that is
the actual distance consistent with our
Photoshop document and then of course
we're gonna have to use a media query to
come back and take that margin down all
right so basically that is within the
767 media query so let me just take this
there you go and it's only gonna have to
be like 50 I think or 40 mm-hmm well
we'll see
basically yeah we also want this
centered obviously so let's I let's see
where we have what we have going here so
we want this to be centered and we want
that to be centered as well so we
previously created a class called ALC
and we want that to add that on to this
right here I believe for ya so
alpha-omega
ALC and we can also add it on to this as
well so let's save that and it's a lot
better and so we're going to definitely
want to drop down the the font size here
for 767 for the h1 so and that way when
we do that it'll scale everything up
that way this isn't so close to the edge
there so let's go ahead and there I
don't think we have h1 inside here yet
so I believe the fonts I was - it was
2.5 right let me see yes right here we
may have to adjust the line height as
well so I'm just gonna copy everything
just kind of paste it in there and bring
this in and that oops
alright so let's go ahead and take that
we don't need to adjust the font weight
or anything let's try just to just to
see what that looks like and this will
probably have to be dropped down too
I don't know 32 I'll try it alright so
now we have like a better more even
alright that still looks pretty good
except this does not so we have to kind
of figure out how we want to adjust this
instead of making it a hundred percent I
think we're gonna make it 90 so that's
right there
alright now that's better
all right so right here we have an issue
because we dropped down the size of this
we have to increase that distance and
that was or was that trying to remember
here yeah it was MDC yeah okay so margin
top let's try 70 okay just try 100
alright that's a bit better
and now I let's go ahead yeah that we
don't want that to be left centered on
that portion kind of forgot about that
where was that let's see it's on MDC I
think
yeah I was on ALC except it's being
applied to everything any type of screen
width or device width so what we can do
is make it so that when we're up here
we'll put it right after the first one
if we put MDC as a big Content ALC
text-align:left and hope that works all
right that's better
and so now what we have to do is since
it's it's still affecting that we have
to come down here and it's kind of
redundant actually text-align:center
there okay so let us go ahead now I
think that will be it for that LOM code
right there so if we just take this we
want to copy this right here paste it
and this is going to be breathalyser -
bad save it all right so this is what it
looks like which looks pretty decent I
and then it comes in a little bit and
it's too scrunched up I don't like
that's like too close let's look and see
what happens though when it gets further
in
okay that's not too bad let's see here
so let's work on that this portion right
here remember we gave it a class both of
these so we can control them and that
was right here so I want to make the
width or the scale of that thing from a
hundred percent down to 80 usually when
I have just one property you can just
put it all on one line all right let's
see here so that's Kellis everything
down just a bit and that way when it's
it's brought in and of course because we
put 80 percent and it was not on a
specific media query of course this is
what happens so we just come down here
well first let's grab that come down
here oh sorry
what I meant to do was see because if
you put 80 like a hundred percent it'll
look good the absol 100 percent of the
parent so what we want to do is just put
width:auto so it'll be the width of the
image itself and we also want that
centered so to center an element in and
of itself you can use margin:0 auto and
that will auto adjust based on the width
from left and right so now that's
centered alright so
alright alright cool now let's continue
on with the final section which is down
here so we're gonna need a container to
make this gray so that's the first thing
we'll start out with so let's go back
here we'll specify you know there it is
okay so we'll go at the bottom of
everything put in div id equals gray
container close that up and inside of it
we're gonna do DIF class equals
container twelve and then also add the
ALC align center class because if we go
back over here you can see how
everything is just basically aligned in
the center this this this the text the
image and this as well alright so let's
close that out alright so then inside of
that we're gonna have to put a class
called div class equals row and that is
also defined in 1140 CSS and I'll
explain that a little bit and then
inside of it we're gonna put if we go
back here turn on our grid each one of
these if you remember is four columns
wide just like that so let's go ahead
and close that out so we're gonna need
div class equals column for Alpha Omega
and leave it at that and then inside of
it we'll have the image and the actual
quote so for the image images and it was
person jpg
and then we had let me get rid of that
we'll go up a hundred percent you can
see we have the name and then we have
whatever they said and you can see that
they are styled differently and that one
is on its own separate line and then
also this is a gray color copy that real
quick so the way you work with this and
you could do it within a single
paragraph tag is like this so we'll put
p class equals we'll give it a class
that we can control
so quotes and the reason we're gaming
o'clock is because it will appear three
times we can give it a span HTML tag
span is I perfect for the usage of what
we're about to let's see here Jer his
story span and just to make this a
little bit more readable and then we can
come down here oops that was the wrong
one let me
and then just type that right there P
alright so now let me go ahead and take
this everything from here and paste that
three times alright so if we look at
this it's not gonna look good at all let
me see here so let us first go ahead and
work on that gray container ID all right
and
right here alright so inside of it we're
gonna give it the background oh my god
background color we don't know because I
initially copied that at the wrong time
so it's like 79 79 79 alright and then
we also need to give it a lot of margin
and padding so margin from the top will
be 70 pixels where you just do this 70
pixels and then padding from the top and
bottom 80 pixels zero so if you save
this and refresh this Oh ridiculous I
got the wrong got the text color instead
of this which is e 5e 5 e 5
all right good
all right so now we have to work on the
text a little bit so basically if we
want the to control that name portion
it's going to be P or R is going to be
dot quotes space span so what we can do
is control that so quotes span and we
want to make sure that nothing will
float to the left or right of it and the
way you do that is just display block
and then font size will make that a
little bit bigger and we're gonna want
to make sure it stays black because we
come down here we're gonna make the
color the one that I initially tried to
get I think is seven nine seven nine
seven nine right there yes so that's
when we're gonna use it appropriately
that appropriately and let's just save
that there we go and I want to give this
thing a little bit margin you know from
the picture so let's just put margin top
10 pixels now pushes that down a little
bit all right we're almost done well not
entirely but with the actual CSS stuff
for the most part now we need to put the
image and the image will go just after
the row so that's right there
and we'll put image source equals images
phone - I had a typo I called it CID and
suicide and it's not a phone I came out
doing that all throughout this it's
ridiculous ID equals phone - side all
right so let's see what that looks like
and the reason we give it an ID so we
can push this stuff down so we'll go to
just beneath here margin - top 50 pixels
just experiment and see if that works
there should work pretty good all right
and there we go so let's see what this
thing looks like when it scales down
cool all right so you know we are gonna
have one more day until we're done with
this and the reason being is because we
need to make some just finer adjustments
we're gonna make these kind of do we
really have that issue again the links
are working in one second and that's
because I kind of forgot to add a
necessary kind of class reason this is
happening is because the absolute eye
this is kind of sitting on top of it
basically so we need to bring forward
this and kind of layer it on top so we
can actually click these things you're
all supposed to be links so basically we
want to go and find let's go here real
quick scroll up and it's on
I believe container 12 this is all of
our header stuff and I'll add an ID ID
equals Z fix as in Z index it's called
it's like a CSS property I let's put it
here at the bottom z - index is we'll
just put it - but it's Fault
everything's kind of just on the same
path so now we can hover over all right
cool so getting back to where I've
trying to say is will I will style the
links a little bit so that there's hover
effects and off obviously as well when
we scale this down we're gonna probably
use JavaScript I haven't really figured
out the way I want to approach - I think
it's probably a necessity we use
JavaScript I it's very lightweight you
know
it's not intense or anything but
basically you just have to capture the
click and then reveal a show the the
menu again that was hidden and then make
it so that when you click it again it
will just kind of go back up alright so
that will probably you know that's
definitely worthy of covering again I
