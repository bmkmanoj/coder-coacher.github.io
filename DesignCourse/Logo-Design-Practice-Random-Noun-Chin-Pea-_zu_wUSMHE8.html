today I'm going to be doing the second
random nouns where I take two nouns and
I try to come up with some sort of logo
design / illustration based on these
random downs that are generated and this
is a logo design technique it did this
side about a week or two ago as well and
it was ridiculous and i just got done
recording the one you're about to watch
and I i crack a few inappropriate jokes
in it's a fun video and the end result
is actually pretty good based on
denounce that were generated and those
are chin p so all right check out the
time-course calm and subscribe here on
youtube alright so let's get started
alright so i'm here at this random now
generator i can specify how many random
nouns i want so I'm using 2 i'm going to
hit generate act jogging see that
doesn't really make sense i mean to act
that doesn t seem like a noun so I'm
going to just do another one unless I
want these to be literally tangible
objects so generate again comma Trixie
what is it can you get a trick like
that's not a physical object dammit chin
p alright so I'm gonna have to go with
this ok chin p all right go file new and
let's leave it there actually I'm going
to file new and I take this down
actually all i could do is go talk in a
set up at Art boards and scale is down
and in
alright that's better all right so chin
p all right let's I think of something
here I'm just going to take out the pen
tool and come up with a rough shape of
sorts maybe i'll use the ellipse tool
actually for this so I'm just going to
draw out an ellipse and just will serve
for what we're going to have a butt chin
basically I'm thinking kind of like how
I have one and I want one of them to be
bigger kind of like cartoonish and I
want to do another ellipse over here so
if I go out take these
I think maybe roughly may be right
around there will be good and I take all
three layers just by selecting them like
that and then come over here to the
shape builder tool I can one second take
all these there you go holding shift and
all and then select them all of them and
that will merge them onto the same path
all right so this is essentially a head
which i'm not going to show I maybe I'll
only do it up to a certain point and
yeah I think that'll be fine and then um
what I'll do is come over here and just
drag around this top portion and then
hit ctrl shift D which will basically do
the same thing as by going to object
path divided objects below and I can
select this top portion and get rid of
it all right so this is our chin port
part report part i just woke up recently
and all right so we still want to make
this identifiable as a actual chin of
course um so maybe i'll give it a skin
color as well real quick so for the fill
to come out here let's just kind of
showing up off-screen obviously nobody's
orange like that maybe just like the
skin color right around here all right
and I let's see what else I want to do
yeah I think maybe we'll have some hair
on it I'm going to focus on undoing the
actual p though so it's always a good
idea to get a reference I mean I know
what a chin looks like so i don't have
to get that um i'm gonna get that the
browser on the other side of the window
and i'm just going to put in p i mean i
know what a pia looks like as well it's
just like a green ball but i just want
to be certain because it does have like
a
stem area portion like right there it's
like an invitation yeah this is pretty
simple all right so I'll come over here
you know which side because I wasn't
really thinking about having both of
them have a pee we'll see though now i'm
not sure if i want this to have a a
black stroke but we'll see so let me
come over here and choose a green color
yeah now to work and be nice to give
this up sort of a highlight alright so
first of all let me see take this off
real quick maybe we can give it a stroke
except make it a dark green I'm not sure
we'll see we'll experiment see what it
looks like at the end alright so now
what I want to do I I'm going to get rid
of the stroke I choose a light color
oh come on right here
oh man this is silly these are always
going to be silly like the last time I
forget what the last one was it was
ridiculous though alright so I'm come
down here and she's like a darker color
and maybe real quickly I will come over
here and get this color here and well
first I want to take this shape because
it's not a perfect sphere the P so we'll
go ahead and add an anchor point right
here and maybe right here and take the
one in the middle at down just at a bit
all right and then I I don't like that
color at all let me see here you know
what we just make it the same color as
the stroke take the pen tool
we can just make this wide actually I
think you know what maybe I won't do
that
all right and I let me think of what
else I want to do I think having some
thick hair as if this guy has a beard or
something might make sense so let me
just draw a single line like that but we
want these to be kind of come out
naturally and we wanted me to be
randomized of course so
and I may take the stroke thickness of
these down just a tad bit after I get
these done
oh this is nasty almost looks like a
pair of nuts oh yeah and not the type
that you eat unless you're a porn star
yeah we could do some I'll push up
position knees underneath the P the ones
that go underneath it we don't want any
overlapping obviously over the P
okay so let me take these real quick
will position them I down at the bottom
here and now what I want to do is I will
take the magic wand tool and just select
those but hit shift and deselect the
rest and that way we can take down the
stroke width of these oh these do not
have a fill so we get rid of that these
that's too thin right here so yeah maybe
right around there is good and let's see
here what else do I want to do want to
experiment with this again I'm not happy
with this
I think that's a little bit better right
there and then um one thing i could do
is come out and add a sort of shadow i
guess you could say as if the light
source we're coming from the upper left
and i want to get rid of a stroke here
real quick hide that and we'll make this
one darker all right actually I want to
do real quick is hit ctrl H I way we can
see the points and I'll bring this just
above this portion just this real quick
and we'll be aligning it beneath this of
course come up right around here come up
back well yep come up right around here
and then just come up and around right
around there will position this beneath
almost everything like that
alright does that look okay think it
might of course we can always experiment
with the color I'm going to leave it
that color for now actually and come
down here come up and around this circle
area
and then position epic against beneath
all the portions over here like that all
right and then I guess finally I I don't
want this line right here so what i can
do is take the add Anchor Point tool
will first select it and add Anchor
Point just add it anywhere and then hit
delete and that will give us the
intended effect and then we could take
the stroke and we could adjust the caps
here so that they're rounded at the end
just gives it a nice look and then also
we'll get our magic wand select all the
hairs and we'll do the same thing like
that so they're rounded all right and
you may have some issues like you can
see like just barely in the center here
this little thing that looks bad so you
just readjust this specific well if I
can get access to it because it's
beneath there we go alright alright and
all right so what I want to do is group
that control C control f to save that
just duplicate it rather and then um
yeah I only want one because I think two
would be redundant so what I can do now
is this if I'm happy with this I can go
ahead and go to object path and outline
stroke so now everything's outlined it's
something that you could I give to
printers or whatever and just for the
fun of it I'm going to add in some text
chin chin peas
alright and then maybe a little bit
bigger and I have a font that I know is
rounded station medium I think that's a
fridge that is a free font and I go
ahead and take this in real quick and
control shift in Oh outline the object
which is the same thing that's going to
object path and I'm actually I forget
where you get to that I've always used a
I've where you go the keyboard shortcut
all right and then right click ungroup
these and I can just adjust the letter
spacing here all right and then for the
fun of it we can also take these five
objects and we can make them our color
over here and yeah there we go pretty
cool so we kind of created a logo out of
this I chin P word that we had to deal
with over here yeah so yep it's a good
exercise just to experiment and see what
you can come up with on the spot so yeah
I do these every now and then and I
people seem to like them so yeah check
out design course calm if you haven't
yet and subscribe here on YouTube all
right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
