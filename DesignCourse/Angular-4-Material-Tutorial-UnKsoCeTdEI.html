comm today we're going to be revisiting
a topic that I covered a few months ago
back then it was based on angular 2 in
material now it's going to be angular 4
in material and this time we're not just
recovering it just because angular 4
came out because there's breaking
changes associated with using material
and angular 4 compared to angular 2 so
that's Toria that I wrote a few months
ago no longer works with the new
material design so I'm going to cover
the new process of integrating and using
material design let's get started oh but
real quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera comm
where you're going to find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like expect
each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on all right
let's get back to it all right so we're
going to start a new project here with
the angular command-line interface or
the CLI and I'm just going to assume
that you already have it installed but
if not and you're not sure what I'm
talking about you can check out our free
angular 4 course from scratch and it
covers installation and all that so
assuming you have that already installed
let's go ahead and type ng new I'm just
going to name this ng 4 - material for
the project name now it takes a couple
minutes so I'm going to go ahead pause
I'll come right back alright once it's
done let's go ahead and CD into it all
right so now we're going to use NPM to
install two different packages so npm
install we're going to save it to our
package of JSON
angular material and also at angular
animations so of course we're installing
material because well we want to use
material and then second then this is
something that's different for angular
for verse two we have to install
animation separately because it's no
longer included in the angular core
library and we're also installing it
here because material component some of
which need access to the animations
library okay so
now let's go ahead and just run our app
and now let's have pop into a code
editor I'm using Visual Studio code all
right I have the project open here and
let's go ahead to our source app and app
module ts file so we did install the
animations so let's go ahead and import
that real quick so the line for that is
import browser animations module alright
and then we add that as an import but a
comma there and then also what's
different compared to the angular 2
material is we're going to import just
the modules or the components from
material that we intend to use okay so
let's go ahead and real quickly I'm
following along on the written tutorial
I'm just going to paste in that line
real quick so I'm importing I plan on
using the buttons cards menus the
toolbar and icons so there's a lot more
of course depending on what your needs
are so let's go ahead also I'm going to
import all those after our browser
animations module so that's those six
right here or five rather sorry about
that
alright so let's save that and one thing
you may be wondering to yourself is like
okay well how do you know the names of
these well that's when we get out the
official angular material documentation
which is right here so we can see if we
click on any of these like menu for
instance say it's say for instance you
want a menu well we'll go ahead and
click on API reference and there you go
it lets you know the module name for
that particular component and then
basically the same thing for all of
these okay so let's go ahead and save
this control B to get up here and from
this point on I mean basically that's
all the setup is required you just have
to make sure that you import the
necessary modules here as well as in the
imports based on what you want to use
and then you're free to develop your
application and work with your template
in integrating
material components in here so before we
get to the HTML section I just want to
real quickly do a mock just a very
simple sort of I will didn't even call
it an app I would just called a
demonstration about how to use material
and of course I this is not a tutorial
that's going to go in depth in terms of
how to work with angular angular
material I but again it's just to show
you how to use it real quickly so real
quick I in our main component I we're
going to you import the HTTP library
because we're going to use something I
called JSON placeholder dot type
eco-tour type ID code dot-com basically
let me get out the website real quick
this is it real quickly and basically it
just provides you with different jason
endpoints that you can i grab json data
from so we're going to use this photos
right here just to get just some dummy
data just to work with and we're going
to use i material cards for that just to
list some of those out alright so let's
go ahead back here let's get rid of this
title property so let's create a
property real quick quick i'll call it
my data will be a type of array of any
and then in a constructor we'll put
private HTTP in instance of the HTTP
library right there and then we'll
reference it and we'll pass in that URL
for the photos api baby
and then we're going to use the map
we'll take the response the response in
JSON format and then we'll go ahead and
subscribe the response to this stop my
data equals response all right that's
all we're going to do in the this app
component here in the typescript file so
now in our HTML before we get to this
section there's a couple other things i
want to do in our
miles that CSS file right here we're
going to import a default theme
now there's four which you can use we're
going to use indigo pink eye there's
also deep purple - amber there's pink -
blue gray and purple - green so it just
gives you some predefined Styles real
quickly also you don't have to add this
but just for demonstration purposes for
this tutorial I'm going to add body
padding a lot of padding on the right
and left and this will help simulate
kind of just like an app user interface
okay so after that let's go ahead back
to our component HTML and first we'll
use a toolbar now let me just show you
how to use the documentation because
like I said I'm not going over every
single one of these so we have the tool
bar here and the way all these are set
up by the way is they're set up with I
an overview and API reference in the
example so it's it's really structured
well to kind of help you learn how to
use it so we can see it's an MD toolbar
tag here I can click on this just to get
the source of what it's being shown in
the overview however if you go to
examples I it will provide you with a
little bit more to go off of so with
that in mind let's go ahead and
structure a toolbar real quick and so
I'm just going to paste this in so you
have to sit here and watch me type
everything but simply we're putting an
empty toolbar colorprimary
you can use some other default eye
colors which are alert I believe there's
secondary I believe and it just change
the the toolbar color essentially and
then I'm just putting a span of my
company we're putting in a span class of
example spacer and that's grabbed from
that documentation and also we'll go
ahead to our app component CSS and just
reference that class that's going to
push everything over and then we have a
button here and we're also going to
trigger a menu over here and again this
is just
copied from the documentation for the
menu I've also used MDI con
so again this is why we're importing for
instance when we use MD icon right here
MD icon module see if I didn't import
that then that would not work the icons
with dot work alright and so more
quickly by the way if you're not sure
how these eye icons work the fact that
we're pointing a menu here you can go to
material design icons calm eye and you
can do a search right here like menu for
instance and that's where I grab that
from since the name is menu and that's
what you put in between these tags and
it will automatically show the icon font
and it for that to work by the way we
have to real quickly step into our
index.html and we're going to paste in
we hit control B so you can see I have
two different lines here on ten eleven
that I pasted in the first is the
material icons font from Google API s
and then also we have a font over bow to
or Roboto and this is a font that
material design uses so we'll save that
and we'll go back to our app component
HTML now if you save it at this point
make sure you still have your ng serve
command ran and we take a look at it in
the browser this is what we should have
so far let's make sure this works I
thought that was supposed to work up no
we didn't add the actual menu we add
that through MD menu right here so we
create a local variable of app menu and
this is referenced by the way right here
for the MD menu trigger for so we mount
it to a local variable called app menu
we defined it here with an MD menu
component and then for each button
inside the menu that's going to pop up
once this is but this buttons clicked
then we create an MD menu item as a
button so let's save that and now click
it and tada there we go so we can use I
click event binding or whatever to make
certain things happen here and control
from our component class okay now let's
go ahead and iterate through the results
that we're grabbing right here all right
not right there from right here I which
is bound to my data right here so we
have access to this and in the template
and I'm just going to paste in the first
line all right kind of a lot of
happening here so we have MD card
classes example card I'm not referencing
that so I don't even think we need this
again I was just copying this from the
documentation then we're using the ng
for so let data of my data now this line
right here all this stuff right there is
so that we can just limit the results to
ten the first ten otherwise 5000 will
show up based on that API and then we're
going to access the index right here
with this semicolon let I use index now
we're actually going to do anything with
the index but this is a common practice
because we're also going to real quickly
just add a like and a share button
they're not going to function but if
they were to function you need access to
this I right here all right so then
let's go put the closing tag and inside
very just simple stuff so I'm just going
to paste this in alright so we have an
image so part of the the data that's
returned has a URL property for an image
and then we have a card header
I mean think we probably should put that
there
I think there's I'm D card content I'm
not sure but either way we're just going
to have a title beneath the image right
here and then also card actions we have
a like and share very simple stuff and
you can of course you can also add in
icon for each one of these if you want
like inside just embedded in there but I
chose not to just to make this quick and
now if we go back there we go
we saw at the end this is this is the
exciting images isn't that just now kind
of ugly by the way yeah that's how you
use material for
or angular 4 plus all right so I
hopefully enjoyed that be sure to check
out course cetera comm again I have
courses that I've been adding I just
developed this I create a mean app which
is a three hour and 33 minute course
which is a full-stack course it's really
awesome learn angular 4 from scratch of
course you probably don't need this if
you're watching this particular video
but yeah go ahead and check it out I
look forward to more videos subscribe
here on YouTube all right guys talk to
you later good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
