said today we're gonna take a look at a
design tool and it works for multiple
operating systems and it's called
gravity designer it's free and it's also
something that you can use in a desktop
app environment but also on the web and
I'm a really big fan of the tools of it
there are some limitations which we'll
talk about but let's go ahead and get
started but first make sure you
subscribe here and check out corset
eurocom okay so first you go to grab it
dot IO and this is where you can do -
one of two things you can actually
download a you know a desktop app and it
works for you know multiple operating
systems or you could use the online
version alright so you click on this and
this will load up this page right here
and this is basically a replicate of the
desktop app which is right here so you
can see it looks almost exactly the same
and I let me go back to file new design
here and this works because this is a
this right here is an electron based
desktop application and for those of you
who aren't coders I've actually covered
a course on electron but basically
electron allows you to build a app using
web technologies like JavaScript and
pork them over to an installable
executable that works in a desktop app
environment so it's really cool
so I'd have to assume while I didn't
investigate all of the differences
between you know this this desktop view
and also you know the web based in
browser version there's probably not
very many difference there's if there
are they're probably pretty small all
right so I'm just going to use this
desktop version right here and to get
started you can specify you know your
canvas size and width by height they
should probably make this a little bit
more obvious I could barely read width
right there not a big deal but I'm just
going to use the iPhone X preset right
here so
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it here we go
now first my first impression in mind
you have not used this application a ton
but my first impression that I really
like the GUI here it's well-designed
obviously they have somebody there who
knows how to design while which is great
so first just to move around in this
canvas area too I scroll up and down
just using your mouse will you can hold
ctrl and while using your scroll wheel
in that will also zoom in in and out
shift will make it so that you can
scroll horizontally also space left
click will let you pan around okay so
there's a few things that I you know
you'll be able to get started right away
it's very easy here's your shape tools
very simple stuff you can create you
know you start creating your header of
your app or whatever you want with
minimal ease I mean everything's very
standard which is a good thing
your type tool here we have I your your
different rotation and flips vertical
and horizontal quick access up there
over here we have some shape tools which
is really handy so if you have ever used
Adobe Illustrator then you'll be
familiar with their Pathfinder tools and
this is basically what that is up here
we can clip we'll do that shortly you
can also split things bring forward
being bring backwards you can export
your graphics and we'll take a look at
that and then you can also do a play
slash present now one thing to note
there is no protocol prototyping if
you're used to the latest sketch or
Adobe experience design or any of the
other ones that allow prototyping this
does not allow it it kind of allows just
kind of like a slideshow presentation
view between your different screens if
you have multiple screens in your DS
here which we will alright so I by the
way I should preface this or I should
say they do have plans to integrate
prototyping and plugins and animation
but there's no concrete date on when
that will be available so if you want to
look up that stuff more specifically
just go head on over to discuss dot let
me make sure I get this right it's
discussed dot gravity oh and you'll see
people have been requesting certain
things and they've been good at
responding so they're on the roadmap
when it comes to animation and
prototyping it's just not there yet
without you know having said that
everything else is really solid I like
this as a design tool so let's go ahead
and just design a a certain just I a
quick I don't know I guess you could say
kind of like an app layout in a mobile
version just so we can get a little bit
of muscle memory and figure out how all
of this works so first over here we have
our layers section we can see we have
its eyes set up into two different
panels we have our pages alright so this
would be considered a page in and of
itself and we also have the layers down
here and this is where your different
assets go when it comes to your pages if
you toggle this on you want to toggle
between single and multi page mode so by
default it's off but now it looks much
like Adobe XD and where you can select
the canvas width with a page title you
can change the page title up here I'm
just going to call this menu and over
here we have all the properties
associated with whatever is currently
selected so in this case we have the
canvas that's selected we have the width
height the opacity we can change all
this stuff this color this is this
applies to the background color this
color picker or selector I as you can
see it's very fully featured it supports
gradients both linear and a radio even
angular and textures as well so fully
featured I and we have different a lot
of different options down here so this
is a lot more powerful than even Adobe
XD currently and some of the other tools
out there right here this is for your
opacity and of course all the other
normal color picker stuff we're just
gonna stick with a white background
now the reason I named this menu is
because one of the core concepts to
understand about gravity is the notion
of master pages you'll see this right
here
we can't select anything because there's
only one page but you'll see how this
works and it basically allows you to
define templates if you have elements
that are reused throughout your designs
all right so let's create a just a menu
up here with a little hamburger icon so
we'll go ahead and start with a shape
tool and you can cook down you can
access different types of shapes here
and I'm just gonna left click and drag
all the way out and it does have nice
snapping features so that's good and
let's change the color so you can see
the properties panel based on the fact
that now instead of a canvas we have a
shape it has changed up quite a bit and
you can see there's a lot of options
which is awesome awesome I'll do a real
quick overview but let's go ahead first
and change the fill you can see we have
fills down here in this panel and we
have advanced fill settings we can
create multiple fills which is pretty
awesome but we just need one we're gonna
go almost black so I'm choosing one C
one C one C alright okay so I you can
add multiple borders we're not going to
do that we're gonna do that shortly but
for this one we're not gonna have
borders and there's also effects you can
add blurs color adjust drop shadow inner
shadow there's a lot so really fully
featured which is a great thing we're
gonna zoom up holding ctrl key and our
mouse wheel and we're going to add a
hamburger hamburger icon menu over here
now what's really cool about this is if
we go to symbols wait nope sorry
libraries and we we search for what we
want like I'm not sure if hamburger was
what I searched for before it must have
been menu you'll see you have a lot of
different options here this is awesome
so simply take it and just drag it over
there you go so obviously we need to
scale this
and change the color here so if we go to
our layers we'll see that automatically
it's a group and we have a compound path
in a path itself so if you want to
change the colors and then we need to
double click into this area to select
the actual path a compound path here so
the fill now we can change the white and
let's get this moved up here perfect
to scale down and I'm just gonna use my
keyboard arrow keys yeah something like
that's pretty good alright great so now
let's create a secondary page and this
right here is basically a template that
we're going to use so what we can do is
create a new page here and we'll click
on it and we'll choose master menu so
now it's going to replicate we can't
change anything here it's just going to
replicate whatever is over here that way
if we have a bunch of pages like five or
six different sub pages they can all use
this this this master page one
limitation though I found that you can't
have nested master pages they're only
going to use whatever's on this one and
if I'm incorrect about that let me know
in the comments but now we can start
working on page two which we can just
call double click over here I'll just
call this home and now let's define kind
of like a hero section of sorts so we'll
zoom up here and we'll go ahead and use
the pen tool this time we'll do
something a little bit more trendy
instead of a boring you know a rectangle
so I'm just gonna left click hold shift
and we'll go right around here hold
shift and then we'll come down at an
angle right around there okay so now
let's give this a gradient so of course
like I said it does accept gradients so
we'll choose a linear gradient
and we're gonna click on this very first
color picker right here and we'll see
that applies to the left side and we'll
choose let's see here
maybe up just up a blueish color right
around there all right and then we'll
choose the second color picker up here
to the top and this one now make it more
of like this eye tone right there
alright and of course we can adjust this
around to the exact angle that we want
right there looks pretty good now let's
also take this and let's add a drop
shadow to it so under effects we go to
drop shadow click the plus sign and now
we're gonna have your X Y and blur
amount I'm gonna make the blur zero but
we're gonna take the X note the out with
the Y the vertical and we'll go down I
don't know maybe like eight pixels all
right and then we'll change the opacity
to go even further down or on 20%
alright now this is also have a border I
don't want a border so it puts zero
alright good so now let's go ahead and
work with the type tool for the first
time we'll just left-click once your
text here we'll just say company hit
escape to select it after you're done
and we'll choose a white color and
instead of open sans I'm gonna use the
one I've been using for past couple
months Montserrat for these tutorial
demos alright and I will make it bold
all right so now let's say we want to
make an adjustment on this so that this
is more in line
I own a horizontal level we have to make
the adjustment over here there we go
yeah I might move that up there we go
all right so continuing on let's do a
text area where we could just drag so we
can left-click and drag and then what
say we want some lorem ipsum filler text
we just type in lorem space very very
handy so you have to go to lip simcom or
whatever change the font size let's try
13 maybe like will select all 30 13 okay
there we go
and then of course you have all of your
other you know your typical options you
have alignment you have spacing just
looking down here scale font on resizing
so that's a nice handy and I don't want
this amount of text actually I just kind
of want like right there all right hit
escape we can I'm gonna make this a
little bit bigger like 16 no 15 there we
go that looks good
we'll take down the opacity just a tad
bit so just a yeah around 72 and then
let's do a call-to-action button and
it's just gonna be a circular one I will
say go or something like that by the way
don't use don't use call-to-action
button text with go I'm just making it
simple though so let's go ahead and
choose an ellipse coming here in the
center shift and alt will allow you to
scale from the center and we'll just
keep it white with no fill or border or
no border rather and then inside of it
let's left-click and drag from the very
left to the very right I mean we have
guides to help us there I'm just going
to type and go hit escape center it and
then we'll change the color here
and we can use this eyedropper tool just
to use something around the same area
and we'll make it bold so we can see it
so montserrat old I wish it remembered
the previous font selection but no big
deal and there we go so we'll just say
that's the header all right
let's let's I fill this out just with I
make maybe just three different feature
areas just so we can demonstrate more of
what's happening with the app so let's
see here
we'll have um just like yeah there's
three sections with a subtitle a little
description with lorem text and we'll
replicate that three times okay so the
first thing I'm going to do this is sort
of like a trendy thing recently we're
going to take the rectangle tool and
it's gonna make a square and then I'm
going to use this corner tool like this
very handy I
you can even have advanced settings
which I assume allows you to okay you
are you're able to um like what does
fancy do oh that's cool so these are
really cool and you can adjust these
that's awesome and of course you can
export the SVG's on with the export too
well after this so they're actually
usable all right so we're just gonna use
round let's round to nice alright so I
yeah we'll say like that and then we're
going to rotate it while holding shift
and so now it's been rotated about 45
degrees and we're just gonna put this on
the edge it's one of those trendy things
people have been doing um make it a
little bit smaller now we don't want
this hanging off so how do we deal with
that well we'll take I this a rectangle
tool we're use a pen tool whatever
doesn't matter
and then look and just put it right on
the edge and the guide will help you it
kind of snaps there hold both of them
with the shift key so they're both
selected and now we can use these
Pathfinder tools and I'm using semi
illustrator terminology and now
we can just do subtract tada awesome
so now this is you know an actual vector
thing I would assume gets exported don't
quote me on that I would hope that
that's how it behaves
alright so now I'm inside of here I
guess man I don't know I mean you could
make this some more solid color instead
of this gray I'm gonna leave it at gray
and I'm gonna put an icon in here
alright so let's go back to the
libraries and I don't know I'll just
type in bike okay so now we got all
these cool well designed with some of
them some of them are well designed this
is a pretty good one so if I click this
by that way we don't have to drag it and
just click it and goes there
automatically based on the currently
selected artboard and will just scale us
in with them I don't know right here or
so now okay there we go so now we'll get
back our type tool just to save time
I'll hit ctrl D to duplicate this he'll
you know what I'm as I'll just take both
of these ctrl D to duplicate them now
we've got to change the colors here
we'll make it both black for now and
then we'll drag this in we'll make this
one more of like a grey just create some
separation visually this one will put
subtitle here we don't want to be the
same size as those logo so we'll take it
down just a bit maybe like two sixteen
this one will take it down a bit too to
around 13
we'll brac drag this up just a bit
all right cool so now let's say okay we
want a three of these we don't have
enough room so to go back and adjust
that we'll go to home we'll take the
height I wish you could just left-click
and drag up to change these but you
can't I know you can do that with XD
though but we'll just type it in
manually we'll just put in 1500 so now
we have more room and so now we'll take
these and we'll duplicate them and by
the way I you can also create what are
called layers these aren't layers in and
of themself these right here if you
click new layer no see it says layers 0
there's nothing in it and you're
supposed to be able to select these and
just drag them in here but it's not
working for me I don't know why I'm
might be doing something wrong or there
might be an issue I looked at their
their videos and it shows them literally
dragging it and it goes into this but it
won't select the damn layer so if
someone can you know help me out if I'm
actually doing something wrong or letter
or something I don't know let me know
either way the layers just give you you
don't have to use them it just helps out
a little bit in certain context it's
probably like this one so now I'm just
going to take this we're going to
duplicate it ctrl D and I now at this
point we can take this one and we can
use this rotate or this flip horizontal
tool rather and hold shift we'll drag it
over here and then drag our text that's
over here and there we go
this might be worth adjusting so that
it's right aligned
maybe yeah that kind of makes sense it's
better there we go
they're pretty good-looking so far so
again if you want okay well we can put
in I don't know like a medical okay so
it's just replace this real quick just
getting more repetition here alright so
I selected this and it's not going in
there uh-oh well it's way over there
that's why it's probably multiple copies
now nope we want these to be around the
same size so I'm going to just compare
it against this one alright
and finally I'm just gonna copy this one
duplicate it again I'm not gonna bother
with making the icon adjustments I just
want to make sure everybody's you know
we fill it out a little bit more awesome
okay so now I find myself saving alright
I paused and saved it somewhere now I
again to say just to get a little bit
more muscle memory here let's take let's
go to layers here and we take this and
hit ctrl D will duplicate it so now we
have this home copy it's not over here
oh there it is
alright so let's drag this over here
okay now we could see that it lost us
this header that's because when we we
have to select it and we have to choose
menu once again alright and so now we
can create you know yet another page
which I will do here let's take this so
let's say for instance we want to have
like a forum or something in this case
we can if I double click this we get
access to the anchor point so I can
select both of them holding shift and 1
so that got drag it down a bit maybe
we'll make it go the opposite direction
alright I'll drag this down decent
amount maybe around there and then umm
let's play around with one some of these
tools these selection tools up here so
I'm gonna take a rectangle tool right up
to around here a little bit of padding
or margin away from the Go button and
I'm just going to take this layer right
here I'm going to duplicate it ctrl D
actually said ctrl C and then ctrl V
alright so now it's placed in the exact
same location we'll select that one in
this one and then we'll choose under
these tools intersection
now that just selects the what was
currently over this part and then so now
we can change this fill here oh yeah we
got to double click it or at least I
thought we did change our fill how
strange
it's not working come on all I want to
do is just make this one black so let's
see here
okay they can double-click a couple
times I pause there and now I see the
actual fill we're gonna make it a solid
right here there it is solid black and
we'll take down the opacity almost
create a little bit of just the visual
separation just contrast there a little
bit
and now we can put in a title actually
I'll just take this duplicate it ctrl-c
ctrl-v instead and then we'll just drag
down using shift and this is now
underneath so now we need to take where
is it at right here and we can just drag
this up there we go now it's on top and
we'll just put a like a text area I
don't know your name escape
we'll put 13 regular let's zoom up here
okay so now we'll take a rectangle for
the text area or the text field rather
we'll make this black with a lot of
transparency I don't know something like
that that'll do move it up the arrow
keys I think that looks fine so now
we'll just die duplicate ctrl D and then
we'll do it one more time and now it
remembered the spacing so that's kind of
handy and of course if you want to
yourself actually these kind of look a
little bit far away you can add a call
to action button down here if you wish
maybe in the same I'll screw it I'll
just do it two takes like two seconds
being lazy
alright you probably want to use
different oh by the way there or the
there we go it's these two they need
drug up top there we go
yeah you would want to use different
call to action text button that's fine
so let's say for instance you're happy
with this you want to present it or
something you know make sure you save it
and now you can click this play slash
present button so we click it and you
can use your keyboard arrow keys to go
back and forth so obviously it's less
preferable than you know it would be
nice to be able to click this and show
the page transition animations and and
go before them and but there's no
prototyping here yet so that's just
something to consider but it's free so
you can't really complain too much and
it's also on the roadmap so hopefully
you enjoyed the tour the tutorial and
you've learned quite a bit I like it as
a design tool there's some things that
are a little bit strange but really it
has a lot going for it so I'm definitely
a fan a very soon I'm probably going to
cover another one another prototyping
and design tool figma I believe I might
start doing so I'll see you guys very
shortly
all right good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
