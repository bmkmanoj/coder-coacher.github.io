calm today we're going to step into
Adobe Illustrator and design a forum
icon or symbol and do so in such a way
that is consistent with a company's
visual identity and basically they their
aesthetics all right so if you haven't
yet check out design course calm and
subscribe here on YouTube alright let's
get started alright so basically go
ahead and download the project file
associated with this tutorial I and you
can find the link at youtube com if
you're watching us on YouTube or it's at
design course calm for this specific
video page tutorial and so once you
download that go ahead and extract the
files and open up the DC logo de I here
in Adobe Illustrator so this this is the
design course logo basically which you
know if you have the D we have to see
here and I've been working on developing
a custom forum for design course calm my
site and so I wanted to create a
specific form icon or logo if you will
and so you know most people you know you
could probably have a form without your
own logo that's no big deal but I kind
of just wanted one and I wanted to
design it in such a way that was
consistent with the overall branding the
visual identity to look and feel of
design course calm alright so what I
wanted to do is kind of come up with a
way to create a form icon in that
conventional kind of like the right over
here I'll show you real quick like this
little blip thing over here let me get
rid of the stroke come down here give it
some color and then go ahead and create
you know some type of chat blip like
that but try to do so in such a way that
you know kind of makes it just look and
feel as though it's a part of the design
course common brand alright so basically
the way I came up with you know a way to
do that basically is by taking
the logo and duplicating it so ctrl C
and ctrl f and really it's just a matter
of playing around and trying to come up
with an interesting concept so if you
right-click and flip this altar we don't
have to flip this one funny hat one
doesn't really matter we could see
centrally if we just move this over by
holding shift you can see that it kind
of already has this center portion that
acts as like a little chat blip or
whatever so I took that idea and
basically I wanted to recreate this
center portion because right now it's
destructed over here so I wanted to
recreate that so take out the rounded
rectangle tool if you go to edit and you
go to preferences in general you could
change the corner radius I have mine at
80 points so you can change it right
there and then just click out you know
right around here and you want to try to
match it up as closely as possible and
then use your arrow keys to get that
centered up and take everything and
scale it holding shift alright so we
have that what we want to do basically
oops is get rid of the fill so over here
with knee gradient taps selected and
click this little x over here to get rid
of the fill and then over here we want
to give this a fill that is the same
color as this which happens to be this
color all right so I'm going to enlarge
everything again by holding shift and
alt and left clicking and dragging up
and we can see the center area we
basically want to get that so that it's
perfectly in line with everything else
so what we can do is take this a hold
alt and then just drag up a little bit
and by the way it doesn't have to be
exactly perfect I think right there is
pretty good and then what we want to do
is increase the stroke width by quite a
bit so I'm going to try rec 40 and I'm
also going to temporarily change it to
another color just so we can see
where this matches up or it doesn't so
you can just keep on going until we get
the rough portions down and I'd say
right there is pretty good all right so
now what I want to do is go ahead and go
to object path outline stroke so it's no
longer a stroke now I and we can't edit
the actual stroke alright so now what I
want to do I'm going to get rid of this
one over here and now I'm going to give
this some transparency and by lowering
the opacity around forty percent alright
so what I want to do is create that
portion that little blip off the side
here kind of consistent with how this is
kind of itching into that portion right
there so I'm going to take the pen tool
and I'm just going to kind of follow
this line right around here and then
just come up follow that edge just like
that by left-clicking hold alt and left
click and then come down here and then
kind of end it right there I may take
the direct selection tool right here and
then just make some other adjustments I
pull this down a little bit kind of did
want this to be a little bit bigger
there's no problem though all right
right around there is pretty good and
then what I want to do is I'm going to
get rid of this portion over here we can
go ahead and bring this back to one
hundred percent opacity also change the
to the correct color and then come up
over here and we'll make this white and
just kind of follow along this line
right up to around here now I'd say up a
little bit higher
alt left click and then just come out
right around there and then join them
alright so if I were to get back the
other logo real quickly and let me go
ahead real quick and use the Pathfinder
so if we get a window Pathfinder we can
take both of these shapes and select
minus front take this in this shape and
join them and if you wanted to you can
get in here closer and fix up these
edges just by deleting those all right
so now if we got back the I let me go
ahead i'm going to save this as a new
file we'll just call this forum logo and
then open up the previous one just copy
that paste it in here we'll just be
around the same size that'll happen
there that's strange I must have
accidentally selected something that I
was not supposed to do not strange the
hell maybe I didn't copy the whole thing
when I selected it I don't I don't know
anyhow you get the point so now we can
see that we basically have a chat icon
that we need for a specific purpose but
we've designed it in such a way that
looks and feels consistent with the the
core of the visual identity which is
this I symbol right here the DC design
course calm letter mark alright so
basically where did I use this well this
is where I'm going to first show the
design course com forums which I custom
coded I've been working hard I mean past
like four or five days on making this a
reality and so you can go there right
