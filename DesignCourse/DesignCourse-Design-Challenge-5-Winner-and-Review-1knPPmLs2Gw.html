today I'm going to go ahead and review
the design course calm fifth design
challenge which is all about designing a
front of a business card using a logo
provided all right so basically check
out design course calm if you haven't
yet subscribe here on YouTube and let's
get started alright so let's go ahead
and i'm just going to real quickly
overview this so we had to design a
business card front card only just to
make it a little bit more simple um used
to provided logo I blah blah blah blah
blah you know I don't think we really
need to overview this too much oh I so
we'll go here with the first one psy ops
I alright so I kind of wished it we
would have seen this a little bit bigger
I just to see it well I mean you can see
everything just fine here but just to
see it a little bit larger would be a
little bit more helpful but a couple
things they definitely do right is I
kept it simple relatively in terms of
color definitely influenced the color
and used it consistently which is always
a good thing I the one thing that it
would definitely change about it though
is the relation of this text compared to
this text over here all right are the
logo rather so you would definitely want
this logo here to stand out more so than
the text over here and so that's not the
case so that's why if you had a you know
if you showed this or you uploaded this
on a bigger resolution to be easier to
you know scale attacks down in relation
to the logo that way it'd be easier to
see so you did definitely get some
things right you know contrast
everything's good I complexities kept to
minimal so yeah just that I sizing
probably would've made a big difference
in my opinion alright so beat to dl I by
the way did you ask if you could change
your username I think you did and then I
forgot to respond anyhow let me know if
that's the issue
alright so I be to dl entered several
different entries is the first one I
would say right off the bat just drop
the usage of the soft inner shadows and
then also the outer shadow because what
happens is I mean it makes for a cool
effect visually usually but when it's
used so much to this extent it becomes
overused basically so I would try to
just you know you don't need to use
these especially in relation with the
you have like a stroke probably like an
inner stroke on on these right here and
it seems like you know just from my
opinion it's just a little bit too much
so I think you did enter some other
entries I'm not sure though that I'll
address here so this one's an
interesting concept I but the one thing
I'm curious about is how this would play
out right over here if this were an
actual business card so you know would
you have to sit there and cut this out I
that would be a little bit tedious I'm
not sure if their services who would
actually do that for you I but anyhow I
actually aside from that I like the
design it's very simple you could see i
if i zoom up here oops for some reason i
go too much you can't see it anymore I
you can see in here there's kind of like
a honeycomb pattern so I like that I let
me get back to one hundred percent and
this is not too bad either I would
probably make it just at a bit bigger or
make the text black and ditch the outer
glow I can see there's a nado outer glow
or a drop shadow of some sort which is a
little bit darker to make it stand out
more but I think just changing it to
black against this lighter green would
be better in my opinion but yeah overall
simplicity I like it contrast is good it
has a peel and yeah it's good good stuff
so I quelle Chris we have a bunch of
entries here I so let's see let me copy
the image here real quick see if it's
okay but it's a little bit bigger just a
view in this area so basically I yeah
there's a lot happening all these I
can't really
through all them but if I had to compare
and just like look at them real quick
and say which one that I think would be
or that I personally think is the best
and just in terms of general design I
would probably say real right away I
would get rid of this I had this trill
thing is probably meant to emulate sound
wave or speaker or something but I in
terms of like white space there's not
too much of it there's a lot happening
so I would just I would cross this off
the list I in this one there's kind of a
lot happening here to his head is almost
a little bit too close to the basics
part and then down here you have like
more space so that kind of throws things
off just a little just looking at the
space between the bottom of this
illustration at the top like if you were
to scale down a little bit more I maybe
move them over to the right because you
can notice this area gets over here so
just in terms of adjustments how to
adjust things like that this over here
there's not a lot of contrast this is
like a gray type of colors and this I I
would definitely say between these
bottom ones i think these bottom ones
are better than top ones honestly look
over here I yeah I'm not to mention fan
of this because the the John Doe the
contact information is just kind of
hanging up here in the middle maybe just
in terms of positioning I would
basically okay up here we see basics on
the top of it we have a certain amount
of white space which is good it's equal
from the left in the top but down here
believe beneath this text we have a lot
more so to really frame a card and a
design in general you've got to try to
keep the alignments all I similar and so
if you drop this down then you might
want to drop this in between in the
exact middle and the card would just
flow better the design would just look
better with just a minor change like
that I so yeah I this over here this
text is kind of big but again I this is
shown like the card sizes are a little
bit small to really be able to review
them real well but but yeah
I would say either this and again maybe
dropping this down this text just down a
little bit more away from the hands
because you can see it gets a little bit
cluttered right here I this might be
pretty might be the best or this could
be the best I think this text would be
it's just a tad bit big but again we're
shown as small size so it kind of has to
be four to be readable but anyhow I
overall not bad and sometimes it's good
to show the card and a real life concept
like this I like this one more than this
one all right and over here when we just
see the card I could submitted another
variation of this when we see just the
card in and of itself I flat like this
what we can see some issues with I the
the font aliasing or we can see it just
looks like jagged around there I but
when you look at it down here you really
can't tell because of the perspective
and all that but it's something you want
to be where we have it looks pixelated I
but aside from that I try to stay away
from these soft inner shadows there's
something that they were you these were
used huge back like in the late 90s and
early 2000s would be everybody every new
designer gets a copy of photoshop and
they'll just apply one of the layer
styles and one of them would always be
either drop shadow or inner shadow so
it's something in terms of modern design
that you just don't see often anymore
because it was something that kind of
just it came in and gone in terms of
pads so there's certainly uses for it
though but applied as it is here I would
say you know I would say I would stay
away from him maybe I would take the I
make it so it's not feathered at all or
in maybe decrease the the distance and
it would work fine but I yeah I like
this area over here especially we kind
of see it I in a 3d context I side from
just the inner shadow I definitely like
it I and it works well my opinion so I
like the speaker so thanks for that
entry be to dl got another one here this
one the basics logo with the i guess you
could say sound bars
when I design at I don't mean to what
the hell is doing I think that's what my
intention was I just did a real fast
anyhow inside the text it makes it kind
of hard just to read the actual logo if
we can see over here and over here maybe
I would have if you wanted to go after
the effect maybe just I take capacity of
these inner ones down a lot or make the
inside of the text black anyhow I and
then I would probably also this looks
pixelated for some reason I'm not sure
if it's something I did or not but yeah
this kind of looks like blurry for some
reason I don't know why but anyhow I
yeah in terms of again like the drop
shadow from the speaker it's just the
same it would be the same khatik that I
have up here in terms of just something
that's been overused and you don't
really see any talk designers using the
drop shadow thing too much in this type
of usage I guess you could say or
context I but yeah I i would also notice
the the white space in a barge between
John like the E&amp;amp;O and then over here
it's like real close so it would
probably be an improvement if you just
take the 555 in the email put it right
over here underneath smaller size as
well I but yeah just a couple of grapes
with this obviously just this drop
shadow and then the alignments over here
and then DJ see all right so this is
real simple obviously hi I like it I in
terms of it being simple I like it
almost almost too simple i would say
maybe just like a slight type of water
Marco most could go in here I but yeah
in terms of the design i like it you can
see the number down here and the
information and you can also see this so
it has good contrast color white space
so pretty good and then X matrix I let's
see here at first I didn't know what the
heck was going on honestly but then if i
did this i could see okay this is the
card because the back room was
completely white I so again with the the
whole
shadow thing right here I would
definitely minimize this I may be
scrapped it I or definitely take that
pacity it down a lot on it that way does
a stick out so much same thing over here
over here on the sides and I'm not too
sure about the the the yellow I would
use green or something just to try to
keep it consistent with the color scheme
of the logo itself which is shades of
green and white I and then I would also
probably get rid of these two it just
seems like it's a little bit over doing
it for the sake of a business card I and
then maybe even baby rearrange it so
that the telephone number in the email
are kind of an essential location and
then this one same grape with the the
inner shadow the soft inner shadow to
try to get rid of that not try avoid but
I and also there's kind of I would say
this is a little bit too bright of a
igual its turquoise and it just kind of
clashes with the white a little bit and
also the green it doesn't really go
together too well so I if you just made
this this circle black it almost just be
better or do one of the honeycomb
pattern overlays on it but I when it
comes to these two cards these top two
these top these I bottom two are
definitely better from submissions the
only issue it's just I this turquoise
color again even though there's like a
drop shadow on this it's still you can
see these two much better in terms of
contrast so I would just I would make
this green actually to stick with this
color and then you would be able to see
it like a darker green you'll be able to
see the text on top of it so in terms of
layout and how the card is designed
overall this is definitely better than
those two up there and then I in terms
of this one definitely better than these
two up here I would say I when it comes
to the size of this inner portion and
the text inside of it it just kind of
seems too small I would either decrease
the size of this or probably increase
the size of
John Doe and the graphic designer
underneath it but things are lined up
pretty good here so that's good all
right so Tobias this one not too bad I
when it comes to the speaker especially
for print and even just viewing it right
here I would have when it comes to this
inner when it comes to the speaker time
we have darker parts and then we have
only slightly lesser darker parts I I
would make the lighter portions a lot
lighter that way we can see the details
of the actual woofer or the speaker
aside from that I would almost probably
take this John Doe in this text move it
away from the edge so much a little bit
maybe starting right here and then maybe
right align the basics to that same
vertical axis I guess you could call it
other than that good contrast aside from
the inner speaker design in simplicity
as well all right you guys see the same
thing here all right this one man this
is starting to take a long time and get
we're getting more entries here I
actually like this it's simple there's
not too much to say about it because i
like i said it's kept simple I if I copy
image URL we could see this bigger um
yeah I like this as that cool honeycomb
sort of speaker cover pattern which is
relevant reinforcing the brand colors I
like that I and everything else kept
pretty simple so I would say good job
not would I am why do I say stupid
like that and yeah daniel kerr or
whatever I yeah this is one of the you
could definitely do inset business cards
I'm this is a good representation of it
there's not too much to say about it
because it is very simple I I would say
though it seems like yeah the all the
font size seem pretty good and then we
have like this tiny portion over here so
I would just find a way to lay it out so
that you know
to change up the font size so much in
between these but yeah otherwise good
and be to dl these ones i would say are
better than his other entries though i
think a couple small changes with this
would really make it a lot better in my
opinion so over here when I would say I
definitely like the darker card better
but to change this sort of sound wave
thing going over here maybe make it sort
of like a darker green color that way
it's not sticking out so much I and then
maybe a change at the font I know you're
going for that sort of look but when it
comes to the email and the numbers are
there almost a little bit too hard to
read but you can still go with that type
of font maybe just not so extreme as the
letters are but anyhow and then maybe
just move this down a little bit over
here that way you have a good use of
white space there's one coming up an
entry that I kind of suggests it did but
I'm suggesting all right and this is
from brian i like it just different
views different looks and then we have
the whole business card down here so
this is what I was talking about from
the previous entry there's a lot of
white space usage that I really like it
I I think let me see here I mean maybe
the font size could be increased just a
tad bit but not too much more I and I
really like it I very like when it comes
to okay so he used an inner shadow I and
also a drop shadow but you can barely
tell and you could see it let me copy
the image 0 so you can see this bigger
well no I you can see it I'm not sure if
you'll be able to see on my video but I
the drop shadow is like a very maybe a
one or two picks a line and it's not
feathered at all and you can see that's
very it's just a little bit lighter than
this color and that really gives the
appearance of light coming down or being
3d in assets same thing with this up
here it's like an inner shadow and this
time it's darker so this is a technique
that you can use
I think it did like a GUI graphical user
interface design tutorial based on like
redesign in some of the adobe photoshop
the GUI basically and i show how to do
this sort of effect it's pretty easy but
it's also pretty nice looking so yeah I
like it and then Maddie her easy as I
always just chop the name up when I try
to pronounce it I I like this as well we
have kind of like a this isn't a
honeycomb but this is I kind of like
just a bunch of circles and they have a
probably an inner shadow on the bottom
and I like it because it just makes it
feel like it's I like a speaker cover we
have a lot of good usage of the color in
relation to these colors right here
reinforcing them I I like this kind of
makes you feel like you know the general
speaker when you think of a speaker you
think of round so increase incorporated
that into the design and a unique kind
of f'd abstract way so I like it it
definitely helps to see as well I when
you're designing a business card good to
see it like in a 3d sense so I like this
a lot as well so these were good entries
all right then the BOK bamhi big bay me
right now is probably right here's the
submission I good usage of you know the
the logo design colors over here I'm not
sure to sure I don't like the the
tagline I the font no I'm not the actual
tagline I but the font and i would
probably almost make it make it regular
just to keep you know the font type or
the the logo the word mark is a regular
it's not italicized and generally when
it comes to designing logos and your tag
lines or slogans you want to try to keep
them of the font the same font styles so
either have them both be italicized or
both be regular that way it keeps it
consistent in terms of you know the
appearance all right so and then down
here you can see there's a very faint
watermark of somebody listening to head
phones and so that could work pretty
well I although when it comes to print
it may not show up too well so just
something to keep in mind I yeah and
that is it so now I'm forced to i choose
a winner based on all these and I like
this one and in terms of you know just
trying to remember through all these
submissions I like this one as well and
i also like this one so this is a tough
decision i think it's definitely between
this one and this one though only
because i have one the toe cut off edge
just that would be kind of difficult in
terms of having thousands like a hundred
or two hundred of those i'm not sure but
but anyhow in terms of design i like
these um I'm going to pause and I'm
going to really have to think about why
i'm going to choose the winner because i
haven't done it beforehand all right
this was a tough one you know because
there's things that I like about both of
them and then things that would maybe
they're both in a sense different up to
different they're almost like apples and
oranges I guess you could say in terms
of I I know they're both business card
designs but the approach that each of
them took is different but they executed
it well so this one I this this socks I
hate doing this I don't want to pick
have to pick a winner between these two
and it's a good thing because no one's
wins anything there's no prizes or
anything I like this for simplicity and
I like this I just for I guess you could
say effectively using I all the space
pretty well and AH the layout i like it
so you know what I'm not picking a
winner because I don't want to I don't
feel like there is a winner between both
of these personally at least so I you
know in boxing you can have a tie or a
draw we're going to have a tie for our
first time here and a draw as well so
yeah it is between Brian
and mad hope you're not mad over this
you guys got a tie I but yeah they're
both very well designed cards and thanks
everybody else as well for the
submissions I I definitely think you
know when it comes to these bit like
business cards and logo design you know
there's just a few things that some of
you will get wrong and I think there
would be a moment where you say aha and
you know in terms of just very small
changes that you can make that can make
big differences in terms of just the
overall quality of your designs so yeah
definitely thanks for submissions and I
let's see if there's anything I can show
yet I've been working on my site i'll
just throw here this in here at the end
i'm getting premium ready and um and
it's a lot of work i gotta do page for
viz ID mentor wise manner and then you
order page and we will be ready to rock
anyhow yep that's what i've been doing
so thanks for the entries look out for I
the design course a comp design
challenge number 6 i'm not sure what i'm
going to do yet you can always offer
suggestions though as you guys have a
writing and I'll look over those and
then decide what we're going to do
alright check out these on course com of
course subscribe here on youtube and i
will see you tomorrow
