calm today is February 8th with our 39th
video of the year this is not something
on crack addict pumping these out but
anyhow today we have Andrew price from
blender guru calm and I'm gonna switch
things up a little bit by doing an
interview slash kind of exchange of
ideas
now Andrew price he's I primarily
focused on 3d while I'm mostly focused
on 2d type of stuff but I we're both in
the creative field and I think this
would be a good exchange just to help
out our listeners who are aspiring to
enter into the creative field so we're
going to talk a little bit about our
experiences the good things we did and
maybe the mistakes that we made so let's
go ahead and do that
hello Gary Simon here of design course
comm today I'm speaking with Andrew
price of blender guru calm and just a
quick introduction from myself I'm AB
design course comm of a freelance
identity designer which you know is low
design stationary front and GUI graphic
user interface for websites apps etc and
I'm also in a bottle network tuts + comm
course instructor for the last year and
I also own design course comm and that's
why I'm focusing I kind of rebuilding
relaunching and that's why I'm doing
this crazy video tutorial every day of
the year I and so that's why Andrews
here and we're just going to talk a
little bit about our experiences as you
know getting started in a creative field
so go ahead and introduce yourself
Andrew yeah hi everyone my name is
Andrew price I'm from Australia and I
first got started I got into art pretty
early on drawing and whatnot and then at
one point I was heavily into video games
and then I wanted to get in and start
making something in 3d in particular
cause I was really interested in like
Need for Speed games so I wanted to make
a 3d car and so I
any money of course so I went online I
tried to find some free software that
would you know allow you to do some 3d
stuff and then at some point I came
across a picture that someone had made
using a program called blender and it
was like this fancy red car kind of
thing and then I found out that blender
was open-source completely free you know
so so I got started with it and it was
at the time within a very small
community there was almost no tutorials
out there but it was basically through a
process of experimentation and just
trial and error and then several years
later I finally actually accomplished my
dream of making my first sports car in
3d which was cool and then after I
finished school I did a series of
terrible jobs such as construction work
I worked like a grocery store McDonald's
I did all of the stereotypical you know
no degree kind of jobs and then at some
point I wanted to become a freelance I
figure that's the best way that's what
everybody does they do freelance work so
I figured to get known as a freelance
you have to do something that people
will like on the internet so I decided
why not make tutorials because you know
people interested in tutorials and then
they'll see you and then they might hire
you to do some work so I started doing
some tutorials and I was doing that for
about a year and a half or so and then I
went to my very first blender conference
which was in Amsterdam and I went there
and a lot of people knew me from online
and they said they really love the
tutorials and I realized that there was
a growing market for people that were
interested in paid educational stuff so
I I did one freelance job which was not
good it did not go very well at all but
I realized after that that I could
basically continue doing what I love
doing which is making our work and just
having fun with it and then make
tutorials on it and so and then get paid
for it basically so all my tutorials are
basically free but I have three paid
products and that's where I make all my
income now
and um yeah that's my ink guys nice so I
you know I remember watching one of your
videos as I alluded to before we started
recording you know about kind of you
can't just focus on creating awesome
artwork and then expect to be found or
expect to be paid or have a job or
become successful at freelancing and so
I think that's one of the things that I
had a problem with personally when I
began I you know you could have the best
product out there best design out there
best website you know whatever it is but
if you don't know how to market yourself
correctly and you're not proactive in
finding those ways then you will
obviously have no success and so I think
one of the things when it comes to you
know people who are aspiring to enter a
3d field or any of the creative fields
whether it be you know becoming an
identity designer you know handling the
visual identity of businesses through
logo design or whether it be websites or
app design or whatever I did a lot of
people they kind of get all focused in
on the artwork and building their skill
of course as they should but if you have
you you know the anticipation of doing
freelance work you have to almost 50/50
spend your time on your skill of course
but also learning how to market yourself
and putting yourself out there and so
that's why I I didn't watch yet like
three-part video series I'll go ahead
and link that too as well I
you were doing a live speech on a stage
I think do you recall
yes yeah okay right right and what you
were saying I didn't get to watch all of
them but I know what you're alluding to
is you know you really gotta put your
art out there in order to really
maximize I you know your potential of
being found so I think you know for
people who are starting out that's the
biggest issue especially if they're
trying to do freelance stuff yeah and so
if you have any thoughts on that
yeah I do I totally agree
there's I mean it's it's of course it's
absolutely important that artwork should
be something that you should be able to
spend most of your time
you know and mastering that but there's
a lot of people I found where I can see
their I work and I know that they're
horrible
they have the skills they clearly know
what they're doing they're past the
point where they should be I mean you
know where they are horrible you know
but they're not getting any work and
they're struggling you know they're the
starving artists mentality and you know
they're just trying to get by and
they're this and that maybe doing a few
odd jobs here and there and and and I
think that there's a lot of artists
that'll like that and I think I don't
know where he's along the way but maybe
it's partly blamed at schools or
something I don't know but no one ever
seems to talk about the actual marketing
aspect and actually getting a job at
something like that and and really like
nowadays with the internet I mean it's
so much easier than of course it was
years and years ago where you had to you
know like basically hand put something
in the hand of somebody who worked at a
company and hoped that they wouldn't you
know look at it but nowadays it's all up
to you and like like the how much effort
you put into your online marketing which
is going to enable people to hire so
that's doing things like having a
website which is continually updated
it's got your contact information it's
got your a photograph of yourself your
real name I mean just those things those
basic few things there is something that
like eighty percent of people don't have
believe it or not and then it's putting
it on all the websites that anybody
could possibly go to so like some people
think like oh you know the big place
everybody you know the cg artwork is on
maybe CG society and so they just put
all their artwork on CG society but in
doing that they're forgetting that
people that are looking to hire somebody
for 3d artwork they could be just like a
small business owner and you know they
maybe want some type of graphical logo
or something like that and they think
we're all the artists hang out I have no
idea
I think deviantART has our work and so
they go to dvn our and then they just
click on stuff on there now if you're
not on deviantART you're not gonna get
the job somebody else's they could be
completely under qualified and way worse
than you but they
the job because they were in the right
place at the right time so nowadays it's
not so much as like standing in the
doorway waiting for somebody to come
boss and handing them your demo reel or
anything like that
it's about being on line in the places
that you should be and basically I mean
there's an element of lock in it but you
increase your luck exponentially when
you put yourself out there into numerous
places right yeah so you know odd people
probably you know who are most of most
of my subscribers you know they're here
from you know non-3d you know and so cg
society that's a 3d kind of like a our
gallery slash community basically right
but but what but you know you have other
sites you know that you can definitely
put your stuff on if you're not with 3d
you know like the dribble comm and that
behance net yeah and you know one thing
that really bit me in half when it comes
to you know maximizing you know your
exposure in terms of trying to really
just build up in and put all your work
out there as much as possible trying to
build up like in a social awareness or
social proof I guess you could call it
in terms of having you know a Facebook
page that's active with a lot of
followers I what was that that something
just came up on my computer
alright so I we had a technical issue
and basically a stop recording is that
insufficient face so unprofessional
but anyhow to pick up from where I left
where I left off basically
so what bit me in the butt was you know
not having that full social proof and
really actively trying to build up my
engagement in terms of you know having
an active Twitter Facebook and
everything else I could do I in the
reason was is because I how I really
kind of got real established and really
just started making a career making
money out of what I do is was kind of
from an accident I sit back like six
seven years ago there's a real popular
site called Digg calm are you where yeah
because of you know what some changes
they made everybody want to read it but
anyhow I thought one day we would just
be interesting to write a tutorial on
how to make an awesome logo and it was a
really bad tutorial and
I wanted to do it solely for the purpose
to see if I could get on the front page
of digg.com
because if you did back when it was real
popular that meant you're getting like
over ten twenty thirty thousand visitors
within 24 hours I just thought that
would be cool I wasn't monetizing
anything you know whatever so I wrote
this crappy tutorial within like a few
hours and I put it on there and I had my
friends like you know dig it and it got
to the front page and I thought that was
quite like their way so I forgot about
it you know it wasn't a big deal I was
gonna be getting married soon it's gonna
have to move out and stuff and I just
randomly decided about six months later
to check my website stats for the
website that hosted that tutorial and
there was like nine hundred visitors a
day coming to it and was like what the
heck I never did anything with this but
then I recalled you know looking into
the statute a little bit and it was from
that tutorial ranking in Google for
keywords that related to how to design a
logo how to make a logo blah blah blah
and so I thought to myself how am I
gonna monetize this maybe I can monetize
a strategy so I made this these five
crappy logo tutorial videos and I sold
for $6.95 let me know why chose such a
low price but so I started getting like
an order a day no big deal right alright
so then I thought you know maybe these
people also realize you know they're
business owners and they're starting out
maybe they can make their own bill one
that you want me to design the logo
they'll order a logo from me so I put up
I built my own system for managing
clients and stuff and I advertise for
like and usually $75 per logo you know
and then once I put that up and I
launched and I advertise on that
tutorial page you know I started getting
about one to two orders a day so that
gave me you know really good freedom to
to basically I knew I didn't have to get
a job I never had like a regular job you
know unlike and so it's reddit it like
it's just so scary to me
so that's how I started off and of
course I increased the logo prices and
about five years later six years later I
handled like two thousand clients it's
nuts but anyhow 2000 client it's it's
well probably around there 2000 logos
but I know $75 so oh yeah it is low you
know what I well what now I'm almost
kind of out of it because what happened
afterwards is and this is why it's so
important going back to the original
point to really make sure your eggs
aren't in all one basket all right what
happened was after five six years
Google's made some changes to their
algorithm in terms of how they choose to
rank web sites and so it's it's kind of
complex you know and there's so many
different barriers people try to game it
or whatever and what happened was I
don't know if it's because my the page
was old a little bit aged I or just
competitors started going up but anyhow
I started going down into ranks and when
you go down I mean just going from the
first spot to the second spot is like a
jump of like 40% of traffic practically
or worse and so what happened was you
know and that's not the only thing I
mean I everything I could with that page
and also another page that ranked for a
how to design a website I then I
registered design course comma charge
4995 month for 4995 a month monthly
subscription and I you know I was really
making good money for several years but
then once they start started going down
like I realized oh man you shouldn't
have you shouldn't have got complacent
basically and that's what I did
alright so my income kind of went quite
you know down quite a bit and I kind of
neglected the other ways in which you
know you really what you need to do to
establish yourself whether you're gonna
be freelancer or whether you're gonna be
doing a service of some sort but but
yeah so why another thing I wanted to
ask you about and we probably agree but
we'll see I want to ask you what your
thoughts on traditional education is in
terms of going to art schools or
colleges as a means towards entering
into a creative field whether it be 3d
or anything web-based versus kind of you
know offering what you do or what we do
now I have my opinions and thoughts on
this and I can answer that first or you
can just give your you know okay
somebody came up to you who knew nothing
they wanted to do what you do or do what
I do or or just enter the field you know
become proficient at it what would you
tell them in terms of the college route
or you know maybe just utilizing
everything you can everything you can
via the web to learn
and the problem is is that I've never I
never went to college I never went to
yes I'm here and I I've never done um
you know aside from high school of
course which I hated
but whoever says they like high school
anyone say that you know a see daughters
and they're they're staying home so I
mean it's tough that way but I have very
strong views on education and public
education but I but yeah I mean
basically you know to answer that
question you know I think it's awesome
because it's it's the Internet and the
availability of the Internet and the
fact that you know so many things are
free you know most of your videos are
free mine are free I people are in and
even you know your courses or your back
whatever you know you consider them you
know when you contrast that to the
extremely expensive nature of colleges
it's kind of a no-brainer because you
know I had friends you know they'd a
bunch you know who went off to college
like a computer science degree after
four years and they have like a mid five
figure you know school bill and you know
when it when it came to skill sets I
found that a lot of them are kind of
inferior to you know what I was doing
because you know a lot of the the I
guess you could say the material that
they're taught and the instructors or
the professors they're kind of like
outdated so I think what we're gonna see
is you know kind of you know sites like
udemy you're probably familiar with that
right I mean you de and eat you d eat my
comm they're like a huge online resource
we're learning right and sites like that
in sites like you know more specialized
like ours that are specific to you know
an application or a specific field
they're going to basically I think
they're gonna knock out two colleges or
force the colleges at least to really
come down in price which is awesome for
us and it's awesome for everybody else
yeah so I one final note you know we're
what should your focus be on in terms of
I because you know you have so many
people
and they fail at it unfortunately I know
this from my when design course comm was
previously launched and they enter into
it most people datas fail I you know
whether it be issues with I I think a
lot of the issues it doesn't come from a
lack of talent usually I it kind of
comes from I think a lack of staying
consistent and and having that right
correct amount of work ethic I guess you
could say because I think you did a
podcast recently or maybe not a podcast
but a video about staying motivated or
how or increasing by what you call
productivity yes that's right yeah but
guys it's kind of kind of veered off
that question helping people who may be
aspiring into entering a creative field
yeah I
it's an idea I've I started out with and
I think it's uh it it'll help anyone I
said a lot but basically what you do is
you tell yourself I'm gonna come up with
one finished piece of artwork every week
so once a week whatever day you pick it
saves some day or Friday whatever you
are gonna post whatever it is you've
been working on that whole week and
you're gonna post it on your blog forums
everywhere and you're gonna do that and
you're gonna do that every single week
now that's gonna work really well
because one it's going to teach you
about deadlines and finishing things and
not just working on something and Leslie
until you run out of motivation and just
kill it if you're gonna work really hard
right up into that point and then you're
gonna post it and that's the end of it
and then you have to get started on the
next one and so you're gonna improve
your skills drastically that way it's
also going to give you some consistent
following by doing this regularly enough
especially if you have a website and you
have like you know a following on forums
and things like that is that you will
you know people will grow to expect
certain things from you and that you'll
have you know new work coming in
constantly you'll get a name for
yourself when people are looking for you
know searching the forums for somebody
to come
you know do a job for them or something
your name keeps popping up all the time
I mean increases your chances that way
but solely for the fact of just
improving itself and just working on
like one piece of artwork per week and
just do that for a long time it's not
like something like some people will do
it and that's the other thing is like
you have to do something like although
people expect quick results over a short
time like that's the problem with a lot
of websites as well but people will
start a blog or a website and they'll be
at it for you know three months and I'll
be like I'm not getting much traffic
amount you know it's like well you have
to do that you have to continually
consistently post work or content as
it's called and you have to do that for
a year maybe two years you have to do it
for the long haul before you start
seeing results like there was a site I
can't remember what it was oh that's
right it was this it was a stupid uh I'm
living in career at the moment so I'm
sort of interested in like kpop or it
used to be well there's this site called
all kpop calm or something like that and
it's this huge website it gets massive
amounts of traffic and it's become like
the hub of anyone that's interested in
Korean pop music or something there's
like this niche audience everyone that
loves that they just obsessed with it
right and anyways I thought like man
this site is huge I don't know what
they've done you know to market
themselves or something anyways I went
back through their posts and they had
started this site like seven years ago
or something and for the first about
three years and they were posting like
every single day for about three years
and they weren't getting any comments
right like could you imagine that like
doing something for three years and
getting like zero feedback oh yeah
ridiculous I mean right yeah yeah I mean
that's you know I set out this whole one
one video a day thing that I started it
kind of started because last year I did
the same thing except for running I
wanted to at the end of you know all of
2013 by the end I wanted to run 365
miles I don't know why I just wanted to
do it and end up running like 40 percent
of the days but you know that's life
getting in the way and stuff so I
decided to do something a little bit
more
do you know business-wise just one thing
a day and so that this was my idea just
to record something like one video day
yeah that's a piece of content you know
and so eventually it gets picked up by
Google it gets shared a lot and stuff
and you start building a following i if
you're doing it intelligently and that's
kind of you know like you would say one
thing a week you know it's kind of the
same process
so really it has to do with the
consistency staying motivated and just
doing it no matter what even if you have
a job I think most people probably who
work as a designer for you know an
agency or something it seems like a
no-brainer
to have the freedom to want to do that
in a freelance environment you know in
just because maybe it's just me I've
never had a boss but it kind of just
makes me dread actually working for it
so I'm just saying you if you if you
have a job you should certainly I that
way you don't have all your eggs in one
basket kind of like I did initially
right when you come home do something or
at least once a week do something put
out content so hopefully that you know
if you do get fired you know you have
something to fall back on or even better
you're gonna be able to quit your job
because you're gonna have that you're
gonna have all the clients because
you've worked on putting out stuff
they're so constantly which is really
important for Google and also the social
networks as well yeah so I yeah unless
you have anything else to add to that my
kids are going to be there probably like
screaming downstairs because they're so
tired or whatever no I'm I was gonna say
yeah I mean I totally agreed that like
putting all your eggs in one basket
that's something did some it's
constantly talked about in business and
they give so many examples of people
that do that like people that have
invested all their time into a website
or a business online and they get 100%
of their traffic is from Google well I
wasn't gonna say but yeah it's yeah and
so it goes great like everything seems
like it's fine and nothing is gonna go
wrong we're just going to continue like
this and everything is fine the trouble
is is depending on anyone and
and all by doing that you're putting the
power in somebody else's hands and that
means you're vulnerable so as I mean I'm
I've heard of people that had a site in
which they were making like a thousand
two thousand dollars a week Google
changed the algorithm now they make zero
dollars a week oh yeah I have a lot of
webmaster friends who are into internet
marketing and I know you took a few
internet marketing course these are
specifically affiliate marketers they
don't make their own products they just
sell other people's stuff and there's
there's some guys you know when the
algorithm change who were making six
figures a month and bam like they're
down like you know a month or something
practically you know just from the
residual traffic but but yeah you're
right I cannot put all your eggs in one
basket you just gotta just maximize you
know you're probably services too you
know you put out a piece of content that
would probably automatically just kind
of put it out there on all the other
networks as well so it doesn't you know
because I know when it comes to
recording videos at least I think there
are a couple services that will you
upload it once and it just puts it out
there so that way you know this whole
other business of not making art or
whatever it's kind of minimized in terms
of your investment in your time in terms
of putting out content yeah right yeah
so that can be applied to anything I
mean not just Google but I mean YouTube
any website if you're depending on
anyone for any sort of traffic or any
person like if you've got some guy that
like he's always like dishing you out
jobs it's like hooking you up like
requiring less work for example like
your best friend and he always giving
you jobs it's like you're right I'm
gonna be like this forever and then
suddenly right he gets employed by a
studio and suddenly you know get any
work from him and now you're like just
yuck in the mud like dammit it got to
the point I was so comfortable people
would always ask me like my my
father-in-law he's like how's I you know
how's business oh yeah it's good what do
you think it's yeah it's always been oh
man talk about stress but anyhow but now
I've gone SPAC since then but I but but
yeah definitely
I'd say that's hugely important it
doesn't matter what field you're in I
mean you could be a coterie
you know somebody's doing you know
back-end database stuff you know this is
applicable pretty much to anything but
yeah alright so I guess I'm gonna head
out now yeah once again I'm Gary Simon
of design course calm and that is Andrew
price of blender guru.com check it out
all right
alright see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
