there have been 50 days in 2014 and this
is video number 50 awesome so most of
you know that I'm trying to do a whole
video a day every day of 2014 and so far
so good anyhow so we're going to
conclude by the four-part video tutorial
that we're doing on the light bulb today
and this is going to be a quick video
we're going to take the light bulb into
Photoshop and make just a couple
adjustments and add some text so as
always check out design course calm and
if you haven't yet subscribe here on
YouTube all rights get started alright
so I basically made just a couple
changes and I mentioned that in a
previous video I changing this area
inside here um all I did was let me
switch over to photoshop just to show
you the render basically i took this
circle a and I kind of put it in there
and made it that same emission material
and what I found is that because this is
a larger surface it naturally kind of
lit everything up a lot more than just
that single I you know cylinder that we
had there so I really didn't have to do
any type of compositing adjustments I
just took it and rendered it and this
was the result um real quickly I noticed
I had my eye my render settings at 1,500
I think our 2500 and which is pretty
high and what I did was I there was
still like some just graininess here so
to fix that I just took this blur tool
and you can just kind of actually and I
just kind of blurred like this area a
little bit around this edges and over
here too so that's one way you can help
fix that otherwise you just have to
really increase the sample size for the
renderer and it takes quite a while but
anyhow um so yeah I
basically I there are some adjustments
you can make after rendering ideally you
would do everything while you're
rendering obviously but I I wanted this
to kind of stand out more well here's
one way in Photoshop that you can kind
of hack that so you know open up your
render or whatever you're using and I by
the way you know I'm going to going to
save this real quickly okay I saved the
off-screen real quick just so that I can
provide you guys with the same file if
you want to work with this file and not
your own render is to take just this
area right around here if we want to dig
this to glow a little bit more I just
hit ctrl-c to copy that selection and
the ctrl-v to paste it in so now we have
two copies of those and go to blur or
filter blur i see here gaussian blur you
can see kind of I think for works well
and then you can play with the blend
mode so you just select this and then
use your down arrow key i also i'm going
to take the eraser tool the larger
feather brush and kind of just go along
the edges and so now we have something
that blurs quite a bit more or glows
rather and screen seems to work well for
that I let me see here play around with
it more that kind of looks cool but yeah
you know I think I'll leave it at that
which is color dodge I so you know the
idea behind this this composition is
basically I just to make a statement or
a message or something that people can
share or something on facebook I already
did share actually an image i created
yesterday i'm on facebook and it got
some pretty decent traction from a page
let me see here so the idea here is just
got to take the type tool and then just
put wake up
around there and I'm going to use source
sans pro and make that black so real
bring a pretty thick and then I'm going
to to i right click on it and then
convert to shape so now we can't edit it
anymore but it is a shape layer I and so
what that means is we could take the
direct selection tool and up here we can
get rid of the fill give it a stroke of
white and we'll make it one point for
the weight and I'm not 100-percent this
is one hundred percent right here and
real quickly I should have done this
before I converted it get rid of that a
and move every take this and just move
things over a little bit all right and
the idea here would be to take
that's put an a make it light now you
want to adjust this weight 22 and we
just need to get in here make sure
nothing is right there I hand control t
it apply and then take this text and
bring down the opacity quite a bit and
then take our type tool and this of
course is kind of just a somewhat of
like an image or something that people
can share on Facebook who identify as
much like as I do myself with stateless
societies I'm not a fan of government so
the whole circle a thing
anarcho-capitalism volunteerism to
believe that you know we don't need
hierarchies and all this craziness I
basically the goal is to create an image
that's something that people will want
to share and I I've done it a few times
let me get up that page real quick just
to show you people I'm off screen right
now just want to find the right page
I've done the images in the past that
have been shared over a thousand times
and let's see here
right here this is a page it's pretty
popular but I 1004 and 18 people saw it
only three shares it wasn't particularly
I you know successful but that's okay
and but yeah so basically that is it I
for today's for this whole tutorial the
end result I looks pretty realistic I
like that they're probably should be a
little bit more transparency here but I
did just the materials a little bit let
me come in here just to show you let's
bring out the node editor right now it
has that this is I basically this is the
change that I made I adjusted this a
little bit um so that wasn't included in
the previous tutorial but I yeah that is
it so I'm getting excited I'm learning
more about blender in 3d and I'm
definitely going to be doing more
tutorials I but I think we're going to
focus on something a little bit
different starting for tomorrow I'm not
sure what we will be focusing on I think
maybe some front-end web design type
stuff but I'm not sure yet so we'll see
all right so I check out design course
com if you haven't yet and subscribe
here on YouTube all right goodbye
