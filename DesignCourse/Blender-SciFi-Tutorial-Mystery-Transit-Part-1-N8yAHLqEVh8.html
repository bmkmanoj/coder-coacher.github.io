comm today we're going to begin creating
a sort of sci-fi transit laser-beam
system and it's something that I was
just experimenting with I decided hey I
might as well I reported there were a
few tutorials on how to do it so this
will span over the next day or two or
maybe three I'm not sure yet so we're
gonna be using blender which is a 100%
free 3d software you can find that
blender.org and we're also going to be
using Photoshop
afterwards although it's not required
alright so check out design course comm
if you haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube also today will just be the
initial modeling all right let's get
started alright so first I want to
preface this by saying I the preview
image that you saw you know of the
project we're about to cover before this
before I started talking that may not be
exactly what I come up with so because
I'm just gonna be doing that by memory
so it may differ a little bit hopefully
it'll be better alright so if you've
never used blender before this may not
be the best tutorial to follow I'm going
to consider a beginner to intermediate
type of tutorial so it'll be a crash
course if you've never used it so just
real quickly I'll just to show you how
to interact and use this basic interface
over here so to select objects to
right-click them to move around the
viewport you hold a real quick I need to
turn on my screencast keys just so you
guys can see that really quick and
addons screencast turn this on and start
display okay so now you can see whatever
I'm clicking and typing and or whatever
letters I hit alright so basically to
move around you hold your middle or
third mouse button to zoom up you use
your mouse scroll wheel and to pan you
hold shift and that middle or third
mouse button alright so that's the only
entry you're gonna get from me all right
so basically we're things gonna be based
on around around a very simple cylinder
shape so we need to delete the cube
delete and enter shift a
and it gives us the add menu unless it's
add a bunch of different type of stuff
so we want something to mash up a 3d
object and here's just some initial
starting points so we want to select a
cylinder right here and yours probably
if you left click anywhere that's where
it's going to get added so that's just
something to note real quick
so I'm just going to Center it up a
little bit all right so right now it's
it's facing the wrong director in
direction so we need to hit R for rotate
and then we only want to rotate it on
the x axis so we hit X and then we type
in ninety four ninety degrees and then
hit enter very simple all right and then
what we want to do is just scroll up
here a bit and we're gonna go to edit
mode right now we're in object mode and
the way we switch that is right here
just click on edit or what I'm going to
do for now I'll just hit tab and that
will toggle between object and edit mode
all right so in edit mode you have three
different ways to interact with the
object so in edit mode you can really
deform the actual shape object mode you
can do things like scale it rotate it to
move it etc but edit mode gives you a
finer level of detail in terms of
actually transforming the geometry so
you have three different modes by
default we have vertex mode it lets you
select by right-clicking individual
vertices and you can have edge mode as
well which you can do the same thing and
then you have face mode all right
so we want to get rid of the faces we
were going to make this cylinder Hollow
basically so we want to get rid of this
one so you right-click on it near the
center and hit delete key and then make
sure you have faces select and then the
same thing over here right-click delete
and enter all right very simple now what
we want to do is make it solid by
default there's no sort of width to this
thing so we have to go over here to the
modifiers there's a little toolbar or
theydo wrench rather
add modify and select solidify right
away we can see it kind of changed and
if you zoom up you can see it's actually
solid so it has a thickness to it
and you can adjust the thickness right
here which we will be doing I once we
replicate this a few times all right so
just somewhere around here is fine for
now all right so now what we want to do
is go back into object mode and we want
to also add another modifier before I
forget real quick and that's going to be
the subdivision surface all right so it
kind of makes it look funky as you can
see right off the bat down here we want
to have the subdivision set to 3/4 view
in render all right and so what that is
the view is this current view and
especially if we go to rendered right
here and then render is when we actually
go to render and save them in an image
all right so just just to note that
alright so let's go back to solid here
and let's see here yeah so what we want
to do now is duplicate this or replicate
it rather so to do that all we have to
do is hit shift D and right now we can
kind of just move it around i if you
undo that hit shift D and then just
enter and that gets it right there in
the same exact location and so you know
depending on how you want to do this
part that's entirely up to you um you
could just you'll see what I mean real
quick let me just scale it down hey s
yeah and let's get it down roughly right
around there's no there's no right and
wrong in terms of this approach so I'm
doing and we're gonna move it forward on
the y-axis all right if you right around
there is good and then do it a another
time shift D enter move a forward hit s
to scale you could do this however you
wish there's no right or wrong way and
then maybe one more time
shifty enter scale it maybe take this
one down a lot and then to scale along
the y-axis you hit s and Y all right
and that seems pretty good to me I'm
going to take this the first one that we
replicated and hit s and why drag it
back sy
well actually an easier way what I want
to do I want this to be visible right
here and also visit over here we could
use hit tab it's like this right here
this will let you see kind of and be
able to select faces behind so you could
see those and go to vertex mode hey an
aide to make sure everything is
deselected that toggles between select
all and deselect all hit B as in brother
and select all those you can just move
them back all right okay so this is the
perspective that we're going to get in
terms of the final render so we just
gotta kind of note that and when we do
this I so now what I want to do is come
in and add some detail to these things
so if we go select this first one right
here by right-clicking in object mode
hit tab we can play around with it a
little bit by adding some loop cuts so
if I hit ctrl R we can see this little
purple line i if you left click you can
set it there and then you can choose to
position it wherever you want to you can
see how it affects the geometry towards
this rights portion like the more of a
crease it will be if you add it over
there so I just want to add mine maybe
right around here and I want to get rid
of a couple of these faces so if we go
into face mode face select mode and we
hit delete faces you'll see how it
distorts the geometry and that's because
of the subdivision surface we have on
take this one maybe delete that one as
well
all right that's good right there yeah
the way you make these things smoother
is by adding loop cuts so ctrl R you
could position that up right around
there ctrl R over here
now you could also hit ctrl R this way
oops one second
ctrl R right let's see here right there
and then right here to make it more
solid but you would probably notice a
little bit of a line going along here
see you can see just very faintly those
lines that I don't really want that so
I'm gonna ctrl z twice yeah just leave
mind for now just like that I'm fine
with it looking smooth alright and then
I go back here to solid view alright and
you can also add some other detail to
this pretty quickly by doing things like
you can control are maybe right around
here control are again put it real close
to it and then controller again left
click and drag oops
ctrl R yeah there we go
and then only select the middle and so
the way you do that is I with edge
select mode hit Alt + right click it'll
select all those edges along the edge
loop and then what you could do is hit s
for scale to scale it in just a little
bit and then hit ctrl R again to make
that a real solid crease just like that
so if I go to rendered you'll see it now
has a little bit of a live like a fine
detail there alright so let's go to
solid again
and you know what I kind of don't like
this is just like almost - I guess you
could say curry so we can add some edge
loops here and I'm not too concerned
about any issues that creates over there
so I I'm just gonna hit ctrl R along
those edges
ooh let's see here we have an issue
right here there we go
notice that that created an issue let me
there yeah something happened
oops that was on the other side yeah
that happened whatever that is I don't
like it so you may notice issues like
that and then control are here control
are here all right so let's see what
this looks like at the rendered view
yeah that's okay if these show up like
these lines I'm not too concerned about
it we're gonna have a material on it so
no big deal just go back to solid and I
want to apply this solidify so once we
hit apply we can no longer adjust you
know how solid it is and if we hit tab
and go back we'll see there's a lot more
geometry that's visible but that will
allow us to if we hit control R right
around there make these points more
solid like that I let's go back into
this mode we want to make sure smooth
shading is set on for all these I'm not
sure if they were I can't remember if I
specified that or not all right so make
sure that smooth I think these are
smooth already but I'm just yeah all
right so let's go back here to solid
take this one hit tab I'm going to hit a
vertex select mode hit B just pulls out
a little bit more and we'll go to face
select yeah it's like this one actually
maybe I'll select the one just beneath
it right there it delete basis yeah that
looks pretty good maybe you want up here
delete faces and then do the same thing
that we did before so we'll add some
edge loops control our control our
control are there control are there and
we'll apply the solidify modifier first
we have to go into object mode so we'll
hit tab apply control are on the edges
control are there alright go back into
object mode right click this will go to
edit mode control R right click that
oops
control are there into tab and edit mode
then what I want to do is make these
ones a little bit more thicker so it
comes down
I mean if we have a view like this it's
I mean the reviews gonna be like this so
that's not really gonna be much of
importance but that's no big deal I
might as well do it all right
so that is our interesting looking
whatever the hell it is almost looks
like an engine so now what I'm going to
do is go ahead and take you know what we
could probably add a little bit more
detail the more detail you add to these
things the more interesting it's going
to look so let me tab back out or select
this one here I go to edit mode ctrl R
yeah you know what I'm not gonna do it
there I'm just going to undo that just
like this one and hit tab control our
control are again ctrl R again we're
going to do that in set sort of thing
alt right click oops
all right click like that hit scale
control our control are there
all right I'd say that's pretty decent
for now
okay so just remember the more detail
you add the more interesting it's gonna
look all right and by the way I'm kind
of talking not very loud because
everybody's sleeping and it's like 10:30
or so anyhow um yeah that's good for
this portion so oops let me see
something real quick there we go add an
edge loop over there probably important
all right let's get rendered I'm gonna
change some things I'm gonna go back
render settings I change to the cyclist
render and I'm gonna change this to GPU
compute makes it a lot faster if you
don't have the option go to file user
preferences go to system and see if you
have CUDA available if you do select it
and then you'll see this GPU compute
option all right so this back-end area
that's fine for now I'm not doing being
trying to be too specific I'm gonna do a
sampling preview we're gonna leave at 10
render probably something more like 800
or so the more samples the higher
quality the less grainy it's going to be
but we're gonna be working with a lot
geometry so it'll take a long time to
render each one of those so I'm just
moving around here this is what that
looks like what the hell is that like
say some gun messed up there ooh what
are you doing right there
I'm just selecting these and pushing
them in because I don't know what
happened there that's better
all right so yeah that'll work this will
work so let's see here
all right so what I want to do now we'll
just consider this part complete I'm
gonna take this one this guy in the
center yeah right there and I'm going to
hit shift D and enter scale them down
hit s and Y now I'm gonna try like 50s
just to scale down the thickness this is
gonna be like our beam or whatever you
want to call it I'm gonna hit s in like
five again or wait sy and then five
there we go
so it's like really long and that's what
I want
that'll work for now okay and then I
want to hit a to make sure nothing is
selected and then B and then left-click
and then hit shift and right click to
deselect this being part and that way we
only have this right here selected this
is also the light might have been
selected as well so if so just zoom out
see if it is shift and right click that
twice now your geometry these angles
here this axis should be right in the
center of this thing
so that's i/o before we go ahead and
replicate this kind of forgot about a
step we want to UV unwrap it I
so actually I'm just gonna hold off
right here for this part for today for
this tutorial tomorrow we're gonna get
into actually applying the material
replicating this so this may be a three
day tutorial we'll see but yeah for now
we are good to go for our actual shape
of whatever the hell this thing is so
check out ds9 course comm if you haven't
yet subscribe here on YouTube and look
out tomorrow for that next tutorial or
otherwise if you're watching it sometime
down the line it's already done just
search the channel alright I'll see you
tomorrow good bye
