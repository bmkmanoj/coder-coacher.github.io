comm today is February 9th and we have a
new four-part video tutorial for you so
over the next 4 days we are going to
create a kind of like a gamer user
interface type of design I first in
Photoshop so we'll have two parts today
and tomorrow where we focus on designing
this type of really cool design in
Photoshop and then the next two days
after that will get wrapped up in
Photoshop and also animated in After
Effects so as always you know if you
need access to the project files they're
available for free in the description
below this video here on YouTube and I
basically you're going to need some of
those files and I've also linked a image
to a background texture that were metal
texture rather and that's also in the
description as well
so I basically I'm going to show you
what we're going to be creating right
now
so in Photoshop
go to file new and we'll just name this
game or you I I I'm actually going to do
something a little bit different than
what I normally do I'm going to specify
1280 by 720 instead of trying to fit it
perfectly on my resolution I
we don't want CMYK want that to be RGB
background contents I always just leave
it transparent and that is it all right
so okay and for me you know this is
what's going to fit and that's 66.7%
ideally you know you'd have a larger
resolution but anyhow I so what I'm
going to do is take the paint bucket
tool and we're going to use like a dark
blue kind of somewhere over here yeah
just right around there the color isn't
too important so whatever you want to
use so what I want to get started with
is getting the actual shape I
constructed here so for view we're going
to go to I show grid and then just make
sure Snap is on like that alright so I'm
just going to zoom up here I just maybe
around one just one time I'm at 100% now
so just take any of these random spots
just kind of take make sure your pen
tool with shape is specified first and
we'll just click right around here and
then the amount you know it's not
entirely important if you can eyeball it
that's sufficient so I click right there
and then I'm just going to go up just
one grid point to the eye diagonal so
people shift you can just click right
there and then maybe right around here
and then you want to come down probably
right around here and we'll get the
centered up afterwards and then maybe
bring this one right around here so it's
kind of like half the distance of this
one and then maybe we'll come in to over
here I don't know just to make it
different and then make sure you have it
we get here to the same.i gridline
vertical grid line and then just click
right there alright so I basically now
what we want to do is I'm going to zoom
out here first and I'm going to change
the color just so I could see it and
then I'm going to duplicate it so ctrl
shift D I don't think that's a default
hotkey just right-click in duplicate
layer and if you want to set that up
yourself you can always just go to edit
keyboard shortcuts and find you know
where you need to go for like the panel
menus I this would be for layers you
would scroll down right there and then
you would find duplicate and then you
could set that up I always use a ctrl
shift in D for duplicate layers alright
so that's what I will use from now on so
ctrl shift D just hit OK go to edit
transform flip horizontal and then we
just want to move this right into place
just right around there so now that once
you've done that take the direct
selection tool and you'll see the little
points that show up and now what you
want to do is take all of them and then
hit ctrl C and just delete the layer
entirely and then with this layer
selected hit ctrl V and that will add it
on to the same path so they're all on
its own path looking pretty good
ok alright so now what we want to do is
also go ahead and kind of cut out this
center portion alright so we'll take the
rectangle tool I'm going to zoom up once
I can just kind of see what's going on
and let me first hit ctrl T and try to
get these lined up evenly so that
they're both along a vertical grid line
alright so now what I want to do is take
the the rectangle tool and
I'm just kind of noting you know where
you want this basically to be even so
it's true for me it's three grid squares
from the yeah let me change this to
black real quick and if you just let go
you can also adjust it of course so if
you could hit ctrl T drag that up and
that's in three I think I might want to
pull this out so if you'll all and just
pull it out you can adjust it like that
and I think that's pretty good
and select move tool hit apply take out
your direct selection tool make sure you
know everything is selected hit ctrl C
and then just delete and then hit
control V and then you want to go to one
second here click it you'll find this
subtract front shape alright so now
let's get rid of the extras and also get
rid of snap and this is roughly what you
you know should have come up with not
that not that big of a deal if it's a
little bit different so if I control one
or rather zoom out here this is what I
have going so far I just another thing
that I want to do I I'm going to put
kind of like a design down here so I'm
going to bring back the extras and snap
this and I want to create a I will pull
this out through the rectangle tool I'll
just select beneath this and yeah
I'm just going to go to somewhere right
around here along the bottom and I'm
just holding alt and dragging this out
and I want to go right around here I'd
say all right so I'm also going to
change this just to a slightly different
color so I could see it and then what I
want to do is duplicate that drillship D
and move this over here all right
so let us get rid of the extras and the
snap and then we could take both of
those holding shift take control T right
around there all right okay so now what
I want to do is go ahead and yeah I
think we can just merge those layers to
those two little things as bars that we
created and just hit ctrl e by selecting
those and I'll make it this color again
real quick all right all right so now I
we want to get a metal texture so that's
linked in the description I below this
video here in YouTube and that will
bring you to this and this is a free
kind of metal texture so if you're just
going to click on download all sizes I
you could click on the original I think
this should be big enough
we'll see so it's right click copy image
and then what I want to do is control
shift end for a new layer on top of this
shape line which is basically this whole
thing and we'll call this metal and then
we'll also create a clipping mask so
make sure that it's selected hit OK ctrl
V to paste in so now you can see we kind
of have this metal texture working for
us I I'm going to before I do that
though I'm going to hide that I'm going
to double click on the shape 1 layer in
order to get the layer Styles dialog up
and I want to choose bevel and
all right so by default this is what it
looks like
and what I'm going to do is change the
depth to be you know pretty high it's
like seven hundred percent right there
and then I'm going to change this down
here to ninety degrees so the light is
coming directly from the top down and
then we can also adjust the size if we
want I have mine like around three and
soften we don't want that at all all
right and for the gloss contour I want
to change it to ring right there and you
could experiment with these you know a
lot of them really changes the
appearance quite a bit so the one I'm
going to use is right here all right
I may want to adjust the size after
doing that just a tad bit
yeah maybe around there it's around five
now and then we're going to going to do
a color overlay no gradient overlay
sorry and I'm just good I'm going to try
just leaving it at that and then hit OK
now let's bring back the metal texture
oh and if this ever happens to you like
you turn on a texture it's a clipping
mask and for some reason whatever is
inside the layer is not showing at all
it's because you have to change with
this selecting the blending options you
I check this on and then uncheck that
and then just hit OK all right so now
you can see we have that metal showing
up and we could really experiment with
the layer blend modes using the down
arrow key after selecting this and we
come up with a lot of really cool kind
of appearances basically and I think I
found before starting this tutorial that
difference kind of works well and that's
due to the gradient I believe all right
so I'm going to leave it right there and
alright so I also kind of want to work
with these things down here so what I'm
going to do off the bat is just take
click copy layer style from our shape
line let's also rename this to main UI
and then go ahead and right click paste
layer style onto those so that kind of
doesn't look bad in and of itself but we
can make some adjustments I think this
needs to be pulled down for the size a
little bit so let me come up here just
push it up a little bit take a size or
maybe the depth rather yeah you can see
just taking that down or around 200 150
it gives us some interesting chrome
situation looking there I and then we
can also control shift n create a new
layer we'll call this a shadow make it a
clipping mask take our paintbrush and
that weight we create some you know
making it a little bit more 3d in a bit
in a sense I all right so let me think
what else I want to get started with I
think would be yeah I'm going to take
these two layers and to just duplicate
them I'm going to get rid of the shadow
copy and I'm also going to drag this
beneath I'll just call this thin bar
thing bar that alright
thin bar and if we just move this down
we have both of these I want to get rid
of this one so we take a direct
selection tool select it and of course
it selects both of them I there we go
and if you ever want to do the view
extras jaquise control H so yeah we just
want one of those and it's going to be a
tad bit thinner so if he ctrl T and hold
alt and then just drag it in slightly
now hit ctrl T again and we want to hold
alt and drag it and eat those
and you know you get experiment maybe
with the opacity or maybe go back into
the you know the bevel emboss and change
that around if you want I'm going to
leave it right around there from now all
right I let's see here what else do I
want to do we're going to create like
kind of maybe I three or yeah two or
three little I've circular light bulb
LED things over here why I don't know I
don't know just to fill it out alright
so let me come to the top here create a
new layer hold shift and I should have
closed out skypes almost message
messaging me oh well in a big deal i and
if we take i let's say we'll just take
through this rectangle one copy which
i'll just call that thicker bar copy
that layer style and then just paste
it's not going to look right i although
that kind of makes it look like a bolt
or something that kind of looks cool
well whatever take bevel emboss and
change this style from inner to outer
sort of affect only the outer get rid of
that gradient overlay i yeah i'm just
experimenting a little bit
maybe right around there and we can
experiment with these a little bit if we
want to I might leave it right around
there it's like - you know anything like
- dramatic alright so something that
looks like that basically and then we
will take this ellipse one and duplicate
that again and I'm going to hide any of
the effects and I'm just going to change
the color here to like a blue color like
that and then hit ctrl T shift and alt
and just scale it in a little bit and
sometimes it won't scale like if you
control T and hold shift maybe and you
can get it right in the center there
alright so let's see what this looks
like so far pretty cool we can make some
a changes so we can take the direct
selection tool if those outlines show up
hit ctrl H twice and I'll go away and we
could change the fill here to a gradient
radial and one second this is in my way
I usually work with this screen
maximized at 1900 by 12 honor but
recording this tutorial so you know go
back to radial flip this so that the
white is inside and then we could change
that color picker right there to maybe a
bright blue color and yeah hit OK if you
control T we could probably scale this
up a little bit more like right around
there and we can also add like maybe to
make it look like it's like a glass
piece over this we can add a reflection
with the pen tool so control-shift-n for
a new layer and will come out maybe
right around here
control h twice alright cool
alright so now I let's go ahead and just
like copy that and then duplicate it a
few times so if we take I think it's
just those three layers so control G
group them up we can take our move tool
with Auto Select group and then we want
to duplicate that layer control shift D
and then ctrl shift D right around there
and then take all three of them and if
you want these two space yeah it's
probably worth spacing them out evenly
based on the width of this little corner
thing there all right okay cool I let's
see here I think this is going to be a
good point to end today's tutorial and
we're going to basically tomorrow work
with I continuing on you know adding on
to this thing and then I think the day
after that we'll start bringing this all
into After Effects and create a really
cool kind of just animation of this
thing kind of just constructing itself
possibly alright so I check out design
course comm if you haven't yet I don't
have any courses up yet paid courses at
least but you know I have plans here to
first release a visual identity course
hopefully within the next month or two
and then from there we'll see about
doing possibly a really robust you know
modern front-end web design type course
and then I want to do also a user
interface course it's going to do stuff
like this but like I'm just insanely
complex and really I guess you could say
comprehensive level so I'm looking
forward to that I also subscribe on
YouTube if you haven't it's always
helpful when people subscribe so that
when I push out tutorials a lot of
people are able to see them and learn
from them all right so I will see you
tomorrow all right goodbye
