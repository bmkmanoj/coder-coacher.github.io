today we're going to focus on fav icon
design and implementation so you might
be thinking why the hell are we focusing
on a fav icon tutorial well it's a 16 by
16 graphic not much to it but it's
something that we all should definitely
have integrated on our website because
it's just another area that we can
reinforce our identity alright so
basically we're gonna focus on two
different aspects basically focusing on
saving and implementing the actual fav
icon and then also briefly cover best
fav icon design principles alright so if
you haven't yet check out design course
com and if you have not yet subscribed
here on YouTube do that let's get
started alright so basically there are
two ways to save fave icons and usually
most people would just use a web based
service or a webpage to actually save
the ICO file the second way is to
install this photoshop plugin that will
allow you to save in the ICO format so
by default let's create a new real quick
16 by 16 a document here and if we go to
file save as we'll see that down here in
our potential file extensions ICO
is not available alright so I'm going to
close out Photoshop and basically if you
come up here you click up click on the
download the latest version here you
will have this zip file and it contains
this plug-in right here so basically I
am using the 64 bit version now it gives
you some installation instructions for
me I'm using the 64 bit Photoshop CC and
in the plugins folder it tells you on
their website to put it in plugins /i
file formats but that's not actually
that doesn't exist
so what I found is just by dragging it
right here I'm gonna hit continue now
it's in here
and once we reload Photoshop we'll see
that if we create a new quick document
control shift s for file save as come
down here and now we have the ICO
windows icon format alright so basically
it's a real quick and easy obviously so
instead of using a web-based service or
some webpage to take an existing like
like a PNG file or something and
converting it I you know if you have
Photoshop it makes pretty much it's a
no-brainer for certain just to get this
installed that wait enough to mess
around with other webpages for some
reason when you select it though it it
adds like this ridiculous parenthesis at
the end but anyhow so now you know how
to save an actual ICO file it's really
important to understand you know how to
best design an IC o----
so really it's kind of difficult if if
your if your visual identity is kind of
off from the start to create a good ICO
file so because ideally I when you
design your logo design and you're
coming up with your company's identity
design you will have started off with
some sort of simple or simplistic mark
or association with your brand that
could be easily put into nico so let me
just show you real quick what i'm
talking about i i'm going to give this
just a background color here just a
random dark blue and a lot of people
especially those are inexperienced
designers they'll come up with a like a
real complex logo for example and
they'll try to stick it and use it as
their actual ICO now this is only 16 by
16 so what becomes visible what's
visible at a larger scale I really will
quickly become unreadable at such a
small
sixteen by sixteen sighs they were up
1,200 this is basically what you have to
work with so I'll just show you real
quick what I mean I just take the type
tool and hit like ABC it's only three
letters to work with I put that in the
middle and then I'll save this as an ICO
I'll call it fav icon dot ICO I already
have one in there and I just hit OK and
then real quickly also for the HTML for
an ICO I'm going to show you quickly
what that looks like and that is in here
so basically you have your standard HTML
right here in the ICO goes in between
the head tag alright so the two basic
lines of code that you have to concern
yourself with are right here link or a
local shortcut icon' href is basically
where you saved your favicon dot ICO and
then type equals image - 2 X - icon so
basically take both of these the only
difference is this adds the shortcut
attribute there so basically that's all
you need to do in order to test to see
what your ICO file looks like so if I
right click and open this alright let me
refresh that I as you can see you can
just barely read out ABC so I ideally
you will have some type of identifying
marker symbol that is simple enough and
readable reviewable at small sizes so
you know my upcoming visual identity
design course
you know really goes into that because
one of the core tenets that makes up a
good logo design is it readable at
our scales our sizes so I let me go
ahead and come down here go back to
photoshop and so one thing you can also
play around with is the you take an
alpha background a transparent let me
just choose this color and if I save
that as the ICO file overwrite it hit OK
come back to the browser refresh this we
can see that you know you don't
necessarily have to have filled in with
color so still when it comes to a good
ICO file this is not good because it's
hardly readable so let me just show you
an example we'll use the custom shape
tool and just one of these random shapes
very simple I let me go ahead and just
get rid of that oops
save for web ICO favicon dot ICO okay
and then refresh now when it comes to
the visibility of this icon file or fav
icon opposed to the other one
we can tell exactly what it is and it's
a very easy identifying mark so I when
it also comes to the other browsers of
course this works just the same as we
see here in Firefox this by the way is
chrome up here Firefox and one thing
that I thought was interesting and I ran
into I and of course in typical fashion
Internet Explorer was a pain in the ass
let's see here I think I have like
adware and spyware I never use in our
Explorer but still what I found is that
if I try to open up the the local file
on my hard drive
I did not work like where is the ICO
file wall what I'd had to do was
actually upload it to an actual website
and then I found it worked I'm doing
that off screen real quick design course
calm down the stupid Java thing see and
let me that was a previous one from the
other see I think it's cached that's the
issue so anyhow as you see you know in
an actual real-world environment if you
have it loaded up and and I on the
actual website it will work in Internet
Explorer as well alright so yep very
quick in easy tutorial on ICO files how
to save them I and also best practices
for them simple is better for sure
alright so today yeah that was kind of a
quickie tutorial
my dad is having a heart surgery today
so I had to bust just a simple one out
real quick but yeah I'll be back
tomorrow with another video tutorial and
check out design course comm wait you
know what I'm gonna show you guys real
quick a preview of the course I'm
working on so let me get out design
course comm and I'm gonna go to here and
this is I just the beginning portion of
what it will look like when you actually
have access to the visual identity
design course so if I click on this we
have the course content and I've
requested feedback from some people and
I've given them access to this but
basically there's going to be a lot more
lessons here this is just kind of quick
as you can see these each one of these
are very quick I but I load this up
so a lot of these videos right here I
went I did a lot of work and trying to
illustrate instead of just having me
talk on the video but yeah working on
that hard hopefully within a month maybe
a month and a half it'll all be done and
you will certainly receive an email when
that is ready all right so check out
design course comm if you haven't yet
and subscribe here on YouTube
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
