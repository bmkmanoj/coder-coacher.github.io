cetra calm today I'm going to do
something I've never done before and
that is kind of I give a first look at a
piece of software I'd never heard of
before in fact I've never used it ever
I've only just installed it and I have
the the installation screen right here
or the not the installation screen but
the very first prompt that appears after
you install it and I have no clue what
the interface is like I've never used it
and so I'm just gonna give my initial
impressions of this tool and the reason
I'm doing this tool is because it caught
my eye
because I it works seamlessly with Adobe
experience design CC and what it allows
you to do is to add on-screen
microinteractions within this app so you
can import your Adobe XD files and you
can add Micra interactions and if you
follow Adobe XD at all they do not have
micro interactions now I think it might
be on the roadmap but right now it
doesn't so this does cost money
download proto pie for free but there's
a free version and it's like a seven day
trial or whatever I think it's like a
hundred bucks but um I'd figured you
know what I'll do something interesting
and I will see if I can figure this out
as we go so I just installed it haven't
gone past this screen so here we go
new pie it's probably going to show up
real large yeah one second no thanks
login do I have do I have to login ok I
guess I don't sweet alright so I'm gonna
get this I situated real quick and it
looks like there's two windows actually
ooh ok there's this preview right here
see here
put this up here I I'm just gonna hide
that just so we could see what's
happening here so can I good so control
mouse will okay good all the typical
ways to manage the canvas are here kind
of like similar to Adobe XD i like the
the design of the interface nice colors
click here to add a trigger for an
interaction all right so I guess because
there's nothing on here we need to get
something on here so again this is it
looks like in and of itself this app
proto pi is kind of it's an Adobe
experience design competitor and that
that you can create user interfaces with
their tools here but it can also work
with it by importing so that's cool let
me just go ahead and add I don't know
maybe a button okay so let's go ahead
and I want to make this a little bit
larger okay
so Center it up nice I like that holding
alt to scale up okay alright so how do
we change the color there we go
normally I'd be on a 4k resolution but
just for this tutorial we have that
let's just make herself like a blue I
wish there was a preview while I was
doing that that's okay
text let's add a call to action here
and let's Center it there we go easy so
far I like it color see here all right
type something um where's the font all
that stuff okay that's kind of
interesting I'm not sure exactly where
you adjust the font had in this thing
well whatever that's fine I'm sure it's
somewhere I'm just not seeing it okay we
will say here call-to-action there we go
okay so let's get this aligned here more
evenly we got our size here let's size
and height I think that's just of the
container size of this there we go that
you would think the font would be right
here
well whatever okay so now what's cool is
I'm noticing on this panel it's uh it's
updating automatically alright so we
click nothing happens obviously so let's
let's keep on working with this what I'm
really interested in trying out is the
my crack interactions um so we'll see
here okay
so let's try to apply one of those micro
interactions I would assume this is
where you would do it add trigger so a
trigger put would essentially be some
type of action
I like that some mouse over a mouse out
tap hello let's just do tap we'll keep
it simple
all right now we select a layer from
which we apply that tap I would assume
so
let's see here
it's like layer okay so with layer
wonder if you can group here take this
one and this one by holding shift and
then ctrl G sweet all right that's cool
so now we click on our tap ok and then
we click on container one alright so now
what
so we've adder let's just click play see
what happens
yeah nothing yet so we have to make it
actually do something so I click on here
number of triggers I'm trying to think
if there's or trying to ascertain where
we we start to add some more stuff what
is this - okay that's nothing
let's see here all right here okay so
it's underneath this okay so now after
you tap what happens so it would be
let's just try the first one
move okay all right what do we move
perhaps it's it's this okay so um let's
see here I don't know if I really want
to make it a move how do you I can't
delete okay cool we'll make it do
something else
we'll say how about we just change the
damn color alright that makes more sense
and tap obviously you would probably
want to change color if I was on hover
but no big deal
change - okay so
what is the current color there's a
picker I could get that all right not
let's see here
double-click on here to get there and
then we'll copy that color code all
right so color you change it to that
let's just play this and see if that
works
oh wait what the hell am i doing
obviously it needs to be a different
color value I just want to get that
initially so we'll make it a little bit
darker there we go
play okay
okay I noticed there's two like a fill
maybe that was just the stroke I would
assume this is hex fill I don't know
what I know I honestly have no clue what
that means all right so to figure this
out ease in out easing blah blah blah
that's obviously nothing color we change
container one oh maybe because you can't
change maybe it has to be on rectangle
oh there we go
this is interesting ease in and out here
to blah blah blah it's making it hide I
don't know what that means I one second
here there we go
crew finally all right so let's replay
that you click on it there you go so how
do we I adjust the tap like say we want
to change the tap you know do we have to
delete this right click umm yeah I wish
I could edit this trigger you can't just
not at least from not what I see
let's go ahead and just delete delete
we'll add a trigger this time it's going
to be a mouse over and we're going to
click oh yeah we have to select the
layer mouse over we'll just say the
rectangle and then we'll add a color
we'll also try to add multiple actions
here so let's put this in now let's try
this oh there we go
then we can add I guess what a mouse out
so let's add does that by the way oh
it's like a keyframe I think all right
so now we'll add a mouse out all right
so we add the original color which I
don't think I have so we'll get that
Phil is a hundred percent oh that must
have been opacity okay and now we click
let's see the mouse out would be color
and then this and now let's try it okay
that doesn't make sense this is just
mouse over Mouse out the hell bro
wondering do I ha
let's see your mouse out it's continuous
we got this conditional you may have to
set that up with a conditional possibly
so chop long-press fill playing mouse
over mouse out color wait that was about
to work oh we have to select layer
stupid all right there we go
I was saying stupid on my part there we
go and there we go sweet now I notice
because I didn't apply to the group I'm
gonna hover over this this label right
here it's not working quite as I would
imagine so let's go ahead and adjust
this so that it's we mouse over the
container and mouse out the container
and then we change the color of
rectangle 1 and rectangle once and now
there we go now it's gonna work the way
it's supposed to I like this I mean
obviously trying new software from the
very first time you're gonna run into
these issues okay so let's try something
else
let's try perhaps I don't know adding a
scale we're gonna scale what well how
about container and scale by factor of a
hundred and ten percent
all right so let's try that
ooh nice now of course we would have to
add the opposite using induration start
delay repeat or just repeat okay um
let's add scale down here and we'll put
100 first there we go on this would be
onmouseout we're adding scale and we're
taking it back from a factor of
container 1 to 100%
why is that not working oh wait hmm
let's check this just like make sure
that we have things set up as we need it
to this is just changing the duration as
I could see down here all right so yeah
that's kind of weird I don't know why
it's doing that
I'll stop messing around with that
though let's also try something else
let's add like another a blip of text or
something so let's move everything over
here temporarily
and we'll say we'll do this remove this
right here and let me get some I'm let's
see here
lips um
texts here at lip simcom coming down
blah blah blah you know something like
that alright
okay and now okay so let's make this by
default let's give ourselves like an
opacity I'm assuming this is how you
would do it probably not
opacity of zero okay so we click on this
let's add a trigger of tap and what
we're gonna do now is opacity add it to
our text to change it to 100% okay let's
try this
tap sweet that's pretty damn cool really
easy
obviously I'm surprised that worked the
very first time all right so what else
could I possibly want to do what about
art words let's see here let's see
what's I assume it supports we have
scenes okay so how do I select the art
board itself container scroll container
a paging container scene scene one will
try add a new scene whatever the hell
that is
now let's go ahead and put in
just some text that says scene 2 or
screen 2 rather I like screen better now
can you go back and forth between these
that's what I'm wondering
let's add a trigger of DoubleTap and
we'll say let's see here this is it
would be none of these but we have these
other things scroll reorder playback
vibrate jump or send how would sin be
channel yeah no clue definitely not that
one let's try hmm trying to think about
how would we do this Wow what's managed
scene scene 1 scene 2
oops don't want to do that
let's close this come on figure it out
let's go device play blah blah blah
upload trigger
what's a lair trigger oh yeah
that means clearly there has to be a way
to go through your different scenes you
can also run this on connected devices
that's pretty cool so we have our double
tap trigger here move scale rotate
texts conditions send jump
what does playback nope how about jump
ah jump is it transition tight let's
just I slide in right to left and then
reset the selected scene alright let's
try this oh it's a double tap oh nice
that's awesome what is this down here
original size
so we replay tap DoubleTap and there's
our screen - I like this I like this a
lot
let's see here okay I think if there's
anything else we can have a video in
this thing let's try adding an image to
see how that works
scene 2 we'll do that and we'll click on
image yeah even the gifts work okay
sweet let's move this out of the way
here we go the hell come on
I was holding shift maybe that's why
okay cool alright so that's pretty
straightforward obviously so if we go
back here oh that's because I hit play
at scene - lets go back to scene 1 click
double click nice hahaha awesome
yeah I like this a lot I mean I did see
something else called a conditional or
where the hell did I see that at I want
to try experimenting with that c1 c2
blah blah blah add trigger
maybe it was in this section down here
so if we do double tap where did I see
that where was conditional Oh a
conditional okay you know what I
probably shouldn't even try messing with
that but this is really cool I assume
for the sensor section this works when
you have a device connected right here
so you have to run your PI on your
prototype layer that you have to install
which is for Android and iOS
that is cool you know what guys I think
I'm probably going to do a proper
tutorial on this eye and stick I figured
I would do something different and try
out software I've never tried before but
I like this a lot this is AI pretty
powerful and it seems like it would be a
worthy contender of some of the other
major ones like especially Adobe XD
because it's it's doing things that
Adobe XD simply does not or cannot at
the moment at least awesome alright guys
I like I said like I mentioned it does
cost money it is a hundred dollars but
when it comes to great software that
does things that I that are this
intuitive and easy to figure out
definitely worth supporting obviously if
you I have the demand for that if you're
dealing with clients and you wanna you
want to have these nice type of mock-ups
and such alright guys I'll see you very
soon I think I probably will do a
tutorial probably maybe on integrating
micro interactions with Adobe XD alright
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
