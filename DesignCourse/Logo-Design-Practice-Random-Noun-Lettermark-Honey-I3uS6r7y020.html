on this random noun generator alright so
honey all right well I got to stick with
it so we got to do it
all right so honey all right we ready to
go file new I'm just going to leave that
thousand why 750 points RGB 72 hit okay
control one and get out an H you know
lowercase H as well and scale this thing
up and kind of figure out how I want to
approach this so it's always good just
to get reference images sometimes I so
just a Google and I type in honey and
just see what I popular images show up
that can depict the idea of honey
alright so we have the drips of course
and you know we have the colors are
associated with it's the honeycomb
effect as well are the patterns alright
so how can we best illustrate the idea
of honey ruin H alright so I might want
to work with the honeycomb idea so
basically the geometry here is six sides
so you would call that a hexagon I guess
so we'd use the polygon tool alright and
we got six sides I went to three four
five six just making sure right there
let's get rid of this all right so I'm
gonna copy this and just see where this
idea leads me all right so
all right so do you see an H in there
yeah I basically do in the white space
right here all right so I'm gonna run
with this idea I'm gonna go to view show
grid views snap to grid and I sorry it
wasn't snapping my grid I had to turn
off a line to pixel grid real quick so
what I want to do is um come out to here
and redraw this alright and around there
and then come down here control C and
ctrl F and wait one second
here it's a line to pixel grid thing is
throw me off there we go alright so in
between my operator on there it's five
grid lines between them all right and
then I'll copy this one
and then what I want to do is well you
know what I wanted to be thicker all
right so all right so now what I want to
do is I take the rectangle tool right
there and control shift and D which is
the same as going to object path and
then divide objects below and take these
two and just delete them sure we'll see
control F reflect right there I need to
space these out a little bit more yeah
and I'm going to turn off all right hide
the grid rather and turn these off as
well hide this get a window Pathfinder
and join those up
all right so in and of itself not much
going on I so what I want to do is use a
get some color here and I'm going to
take them in ungroup and go ahead I
think we use a gradient here radial oops
I'll remove that one double-click on
this all right let's choose a light by
our yellow color
yeah something maybe not that intense
let me eye
take it down just a notch right there
take these three I still think it's a
little bit too bright so I'm going to
take those and making another adjustment
that way it's a little bit more subtle
and I'm going to take them I group them
back up again control G yeah let me see
what else I give it a stroke here try
like 20 align it inside right there and
change the color of the stroke hmm let's
come down you could just barely barely
see it here
they don't want experiment with
something else so I'm gonna right-click
and ungroup this copy this control H to
view my anchor points and my path all
right so we're coming in here and I'm
going to get rid of a couple anchor
points so I'm going to take my direct
selection tool get rid of that one and
this one oh and this one as well okay so
just gonna try something real quick oops
you want to select on this one yeah I'm
gonna come up right around here this
isn't going to be a stroke by the way so
I don't have to really worry about those
crazy things going so let me get rid of
this stroke on this all right yeah yeah
what we'll do is make this color this is
just going to be a solid color actually
so come over here
I don't want to be that I don't want to
stand out that much I think I'd have to
make it adjustment for this to seem like
it's gonna work well I'm gonna
experiment real quickly so what I'm
gonna do is just take everything so I
have a copy saved up here and I don't
delete that point continue it on all the
way to the edge here holding shift I'm
not gonna worry about that being perfect
at the moment do the same thing here
so I think that's better may not make it
well let me see what they all look like
with this added here I'm just gonna
eyeball it real quick bring this to the
top let me get rid of these
I'm gonna go window transform yeah that
doesn't look too bad I guess so yeah
ordinarily you'd want to make sure these
are all replicated and these are
positioned but just for the purpose of
this video I'm gonna leave it as is and
so now to maybe further illustrate the
concept I I'm going to group these up
real quick and scale them down and type
in honey and find a suitable font that
might match this alright so I think I
kind of like this font and alright so
let's take this and get lit up quite a
bit so we could see the H throughout
here but it's using shapes that are
familiar with you know when people think
about honey the whole honeycomb be high
type of thing and so that would be an
effective letter mark logo design letter
mark symbol for illustrating idea of
honey in the letter H alright so not
just for the fun of it I'm gonna delete
this real quick and
this isn't necessary I just I don't know
why I want to do it let me come down
here and give this a radial gradient
make this one white no we'll make we'll
reverse these and bring down the opacity
a bit bring this up
gee make it larger there we go that is
our honeycomb alright so hopefully
enjoyed it I maybe it helped you in some
way and trying to connect ideas to
concepts make sure you subscribe here on
