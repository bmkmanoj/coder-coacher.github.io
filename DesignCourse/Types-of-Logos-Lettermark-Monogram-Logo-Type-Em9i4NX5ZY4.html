a letter mark a letter mark logo is a
uniquely Illustrated abbreviation of a
business name some famous examples of
letter mark logos are as follows
those examples are very straightforward
however other letter mark logos take a
more unique approach by not just
depicting the letters but also by
simultaneously referencing an idea
relevant to the business
I've designed a letter mark logo
specifically for this guide which will
expand on this idea the name of this
fictional company is so frost let's
assume this company sells snowboard
equipment and have contracted me to
design their logo the first step in
designing a letter mark logo is to take
a look at the name the letters we have
to work with here are s and F the next
step requires the consideration of the
business itself what is it that they do
what do they sell what ideas come to
mind that can illustrate some core
aspects of this business some
possibilities include frost snow ice
speed cold etc the next step is
combining the letters s and F while also
conveying one of the ideas above for our
example I thought of fire fire is the
opposite of ice but if ice can be merged
with the intense nature of fire we might
have an interesting concept the question
is now can we combine s and F while also
illustrating fire after experimenting
with a number of sketches
this is the letter mark that I came up
with we can see the S here we can also
see the F here we can see the fire here
and finally the frost can be seen here
and with that we have an effective
letter mark logo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
