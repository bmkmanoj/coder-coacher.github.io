comm today we are going to move into
Adobe Photoshop and we're going to
import our logo and we're going to begin
designing a mock-up for the landing page
or the home page of our website so as
always check out design course comm and
if you haven't yet subscribed here on
YouTube
alright to get started alright so you're
going to need access to a project file
in order to get started which is just a
12 grid
PSD file so if you just go to a design
course comm and find this video or in
description here on youtube you cannot
register for a free account real quick
and have access to that project file
basically and so I'm going to be opening
up that file it's grid PSD right here
and I'm going to hit ctrl one and that
gets me to a hundred percent but because
I'm working on 1280 by 720 resolution I
can't see everything when it zoomed up
so I'm just going to take the magnifying
glass and just die zoom out once and
that gets me to sixty six point seven
and that way I could see everything
alright so I'll just go up here it's a
pretty tall document we're not going to
use all of it at all but I I just have
that set by default so this right here
this group right here is I just the
columns and if you've never done
responsive web design before or really
designed with a grid in mind you know
don't worry too much about it you'll see
how it works as we go along so the first
thing we want to do of course is import
the actual logo that we created from
yesterday so I'll include that as well
if you didn't design your own logo I'll
include the one that I did so you want
to open that up which I just paused and
open that up I wasn't sure what forward
that was in I in that side basically I
had three artboards here one for a color
version and in a black version a white
version we just want this one right here
and the resolution changed up to I think
I'm going to go actually a little bit
smaller like around 50 and hit OK
pay and control a and then control C to
copy that and close that out and then
ctrl V to paste that in and take your
move tool and we'll just move this
straight to the top and I think I'm
going to go a little bit smaller so ctrl
or command T hold shift in alt and then
left click and drag that down roughly
right around that size alright and we'll
have this grid at the top okay alright
so I was trying to think you know what
is the best way to structure the first
page that a person sees you know a brand
new person they never registered yet
they haven't used it this is the first
time they seen it so what is the best
way to go about creating this landing
page well I thought to myself okay well
anybody who's interested in bartering
they they need something or they want
something and secondly they can have
different things that they can offer
okay so that's two things they want
something and they have something that
they're willing to give up for it so I
the first thing that I'm going to put is
a headline and then we'll address those
other two issues so the headline let's
go ahead and get the gridview out or
make it visible and we'll take the type
tool I'm using source stands Pro I use
that a lot my video tutorials just
because you know if enough of you follow
that you already have it installed
otherwise I'll link it and it's a free
font and you can find that in Google or
just link the link to that in the
description alright so this is just
going to be a single line of text so we
were to left-click and drag from that
very first column all the way to the
last 12th column just right around here
and then we want to Center that right
there so this is going to be our
headline in this is something that you
would absolutely want to split test so
if you're not sure what split testing is
basically you know usually the first
idea that you come up for copy for
example I it's not always the one that's
going to result in the most people using
or completing whatever the desired
action is so the first one I came up
with is need something
to mark someone might want to barter
okay
so let me increase that by quite a bit
and we'll be Gap black and for this font
size I'm just going to try 50 yeah a
little bit too big so I'm going to try
like 38 I'm also going to push this down
hold shift and just left-click and drag
right around here and I want this this
again to be real simple this is pretty
much this is going to be a squeeze page
so squeeze page is like a landing page
except the only action that they really
should be able to take is to click on a
button that's going to reside over here
so you know just like with Google very
simple landing page and I that's what we
want to go after that type of the feel
all right so basically now what we want
to do is address those other two issues
so there's going to be two text boxes
one where they specify their once or
needs and then the other one where they
can specify what they have to offer all
right so there is there's there will
also be a line of text down here that
kind of just specifies you know separate
your wants and your offers with a comma
so that way if the person needs multiple
things they can separate it with a comma
and if they have multiple things to
offer they could do the same all right
so basically it's get our grid out here
and let's take our rounded rectangle
tool I have the radius at 7 and starting
here left click and drag I'm holding alt
because if I don't it does this so right
around 4 column widths just like that
all right so let me hide that real quick
I'm going to make the background color
white and then hit ctrl H to get rid of
the outlines there double click on this
and we're going to make the stroke here
1 pixel and say right around 80a ei e
for the
color-code hit okay I'm going to zoom up
just to see what this looks like so far
at a hundred percent all right so I'm
going to zoom back out and I'm going to
type in here I need this
make sure it's left aligned and I'm
going to change the color here this is
going to be placeholder text in the
actual input and I'm going to change
this to do maybe about 32 all right then
we're going to take both of those let's
get the grid back out and duplicate that
so right click duplicate the layers or
ctrl shift D that's the shortcut key
that I set up which I will do from now
on
and we'll take the direct selection tool
and we'll make this one grid longer so
hit control H so you can see that hold
shift and just take it out one grid
longer oops
make sure we select on there and then we
can edit I can offer this alright and
then we can I create a button right here
so this will be our call to action and
we will duplicate that layer I'm going
to move it up top just call this button
and I'm going to move it over with the
move tool holding shift and then I will
take the direct selection tool again
just select those on the right hand side
hold shift and scale it into 3 i grid
columns all right so let's hide that and
so let's get rid of the stroke or the
effects and change the color to this
green right here you guys select it hit
OK and then we can go ahead in here and
put in our call to action text find
matches alright and we'll make that
color white to move it over
you use your arrow keys as well to
adjust that and then we're going to come
in here and we're going to create a
custom magnifying glass icon basically
all right so my skypes on I should close
that one second well hopefully they
don't keep talking to me
all right so anyhow I I'm going to take
the ellipse tool right here
hold shift left click and drag right
around that size and we'll get rid of
the fill
oops up here and you could also do that
up here and then also give it a stroke
color of white and that should be white
and then increase the width here right
around there looks good
which is like 3.2 and then go ahead and
we'll take the rounded rectangle tool
real quick and then just left click and
drag down holding alt and then hit ctrl
T hold shift so it's at a 45-degree
angle select move tool hit apply move it
over right around there so take control
1 we're going to have to scale this down
just a tad bit let me shift select the
move tool again right around there looks
pretty okay alright so so far so good
I'm going to zoom out back here again
alright so now I what I want to do is
add that little piece of text down here
so we will take the move tool hit ctrl
or command and then left-click on need
something and then we will duplicate
that text holding ctrl shift D or
right-clicking the layer and hitting
duplicate layer and just right around
here a little bit down further and we'll
change the font size as well to I'm
going to try 20 and we will type in
separate your wants and offers with a
comma
baby-sitter
washer fixed cheap car and then we'll
take those examples and make them a
darker green color run here now let's go
to a hundred percent and see what this
looks like okay so that looks pretty
decent alright so let me zoom out
there's one final thing I want to add
which is a login for people who already
have who have already used the site
basically so if we get out our grid here
and come up here and just type in login
here left aligned net hide the grid and
it's white so that's why we can't see it
just a pretty like a gray color right
around there and let me go to a hundred
percent here and that size is 20 which I
may make 18 and then we will make that a
noticeable link by underlining it just
like that alright so I'm going to zoom
out and that is basically the very first
page very simple and the reason I'm not
showing any other like any of the
potential listings is because when you
start out and you don't have any well
it's not very people aren't going to
want to use it so
that's my idea or reasoning behind not
showing initial listings
alright so okay let me go ahead make
sure you save this I'm going to save it
as I want to overwrite my project file
we'll just call this I home step 1
okay also another thing to note if you
really want to increase your chances of
people entering their needs in their
offers there's two things that you could
add basically once you get a lot of
people putting in their information you
can probably be worth putting in a
number count like maybe like two
thousand five hundred sixty active
barbers or something up here and then
also you could if you have if you ever
get any type of media coverage or
mentions you could put those those logos
down here like as seen in or whatever
that really does help to increase
conversions so just as something to note
all right so that's going to be it for
today and then tomorrow basically I'm
going to we're going to create the
second step so when a person clicks on
find matches it's not going to
immediately show them the matches
because we still need a couple more
pieces of information so that will be
three pieces of information one will be
the the email address and then second
will be their city and then the third
will be their state so you could include
the country but I'm just not I'm not
going to do that I'm going to make this
only just for the United States just
where I'm am just going to make it a
little bit more simple I but you can
still emulate the same thing if you're
in a different country it's no problem
but I but yeah so the email address city
in the state and the reason I wouldn't
include this initially on this page is
just because it would be too much
information and I would definitely
decrease our chances of people actually
using this and entering this so when
they click find matches it's just going
to say something like great just one
more step and I'll have your email city
state
and then I basically a very similar
call-to-action button and then it will
mention down here an email is required
in order to save your information and it
won't be shared or whatever so yeah very
simple I say yeah if you haven't yet
