comm and today we have a 100% free
tutorial in which I'm going to show you
how to design a unique illustration
something that's witty something that
you could use on a poster an internet
meme or even a t-shirt design and so
before I go any further please click on
the link that you see right there and
this YouTube annotation and check out
more of the other tutorials that I have
that are a little bit more in-depth that
are hosted on my site so yes please
check those out and I so the idea behind
this is to come up with something that's
just kind of creative and unique and
witty essentially and so one such way of
going about that is just just try to
think of I popular quotes or phrases and
you can even I do search on Google for
you know popular phrases or popular
quotes just to get an idea and one that
I came up with I didn't really come up
with but remembered rather is I love is
blind very simple three words and I of
course the idea behind that is is that
you know some people make stupid
decisions based on their partners or
their relationships right so love is
blind I think most people are familiar
with that term and so the idea is to
take that quote and try to illustrate it
and try to convey the meaning of it I
without really just putting the type
there or love is blind and without
saying it so how could you do that so
one such way as well okay how can you
represent the idea of love well the
first thing that probably comes to mind
is a heart and that is the route that
I'm going to take now blind how do you
illustrate the concept of something
being blind well you have the
traditional blind persons black
sunglasses you know Ray Charles and then
you also have like a the the walking
cane or the walking stick that they use
which with the two red stripes on it and
so the idea is to combine both of those
into some unique character or form so I
was thinking about having a
heart character that's wearing you know
the blind person son the shades and also
with two legs and two arms one of which
is holding a walking stick and I they're
smiling and they look like they're in
love or this this character and they're
about to fall into it a crack or
something like that so let's go ahead
and get started off stop rambling
alright so let's just go ahead and I'm
gonna go to file new here in Adobe
Illustrator and I will be using a
drawing tablet for this
pressure-sensitive drawing tablet so if
you have a Wacom Intuos bamboo I Cintiq
in my case I have a Cintiq 202 HD you're
good to go otherwise it might be a
little bit difficult to follow along if
you're just using the mouse though this
is gonna be a rather simple illustration
so you probably could get away without
having to use a tablet so a number of
artboards just one of course a thousand
points height 750 we're gonna use yeah
we'll stick with RGB although if you
wanted to get this printed you want to
switch that to CMYK iraq's are effects
300 and hit okay and right now and 118
if you control one in your keyboard you
get to a hundred percent okay so first
before we start designing we have to set
up our brushes so over here in the
brushes and by the way if I reference
any of these panels you don't see it
just go to window and then find the name
that you need alright so I'm just going
to double click on this first one and
we're gonna change the size to pressure
and that basically means you know how
hard you're pressing the stylus against
the the surface of the tablet and we're
gonna choose view somewhere around 12
and then the variation I'm just gonna
put 12 as well and then hit OK alright
so the first thing we need to design
here our draw is the basic heart shape
itself now I don't want this character
to be looking a hundred percent you know
front or facing us but rather slightly
to an angle maybe looking left okay so
with that in mind we'll go ahead and
draw out this heart shape here and it
may take a couple of strokes to get it
right so just
to go out and draw something that's a
little bit more of a thicker heart and
nothing that's too tall and I don't like
this edge right here it's not exactly
smooth so I'm just going to undo that
real quick and try to get a better
variation and that might be okay
actually now let me go out and get this
thick that's good and then for this side
this half of the heart it's going to be
a little bit further away from us
because she's gonna be standing and
pointing looking this way all right so
we'll start here in the center I think I
may have screwed that up one issue is I
have this microphone right in front of
my face and it's making it a little bit
difficult for me to get in there as I
traditionally would to try to focus and
get this looking correct all right so I
think that actually is pretty good now
if you switch to the direct selection
tool right here and you have an area
that doesn't really match up you can
just select one of the anchor points use
your keyboard arrow key to move it up
just slightly and this is the basic
shape that we want for the heart okay so
the next step is we want to draw in the
hands and the feet okay so switch back
to the brush tool and we'll start with
the feet here are the legs kind of just
coming off right here and like this
maybe like that you know what I don't
think I want them to be quite that long
it's a little bit shorter just like this
not going to have any knees or anything
like that and we'll have a little feet
that come down here kind of like that
and we don't have to worry about this
cutting off we'll fix that later and
then we have this foot over here or this
leg rather oops click the pen on my
starter button or my stylus accidentally
a little bit too thick there now come on
Gary get this right one more time there
we go all right and then we'll go ahead
and do this foot really sorry about that
someone just arrived home with our loud
garage door opener please shut up all
right thank you there we go now we'll go
ahead and instead of doing the arms
right now I'm just going to focus on
doing the glasses the sunglass area all
right so that's the top portion and
we'll come down here and one second the
nose area like that and I'll exactly
like that one right there let me back
this up real quick now ordinarily
sometimes you would just draw this on
paper first like some guys prefer oh
that's way messed up looking one second
all right that's good let me draw a
little nose real quick we'll draw a
little smile cheek thing right here a
little mouth like that so he's kind of
just happy based on what he's found
which is a disaster let me do all little
teeth area right here oops
all right that's good and what else
let's see okay so now we just have the
arms here to deal with and we'll start
this right around here
all right like that and then finally
we'll have an arm coming right around
here like that that will shoulder right
here like that and we'll have the cane
probably starting roughly right around
here connecting yeah right around there
seems actually gonna make it a little
bit higher up like that there's the
other end of it
like that
kind of like that okay so let me get
that green marker off there so kind of
looks like it's grip maybe I adjust that
in a little bit and I alright so that's
the basic shape of our character here
let me think if there's anything else
that I want to do before we get to the
coloring section I yeah it's probably
worth going ahead and I'm gonna take the
pen tool and just stop over here going
to create a crack kind of like just some
type of random shape I'm just tapping
anything random like this will do
alright and we're going to take this
we're gonna hold alt and scale it down
we're gonna put it into place just right
around here okay and this is gonna be a
noticeable basically crack and we're
gonna you know fix it up it's not gonna
just look like this alright okay I so
now that we have the basic design and a
form down we're also going to add in
some other little tiny hearts coming up
and like kind of emanating from him i
but i this is pretty good so what we
want to do now is focus on coloring it
in because now right now we have issues
where things are kind of intersecting
each other like right here and here so
to make everything basically colored in
initially instead of trying to sit there
and color everything in separately with
the stylus I we're going to do something
that's going to make it real quick
essentially just to get a single solid
red color in everything before we do
that though you want to make sure I
anything that you want to appear colored
in is in a closed shape there are two
issues I think I see right off the bat
with mine
if we zoom up here we could see this
right here does not connect up so what
we want to do real quickly just click on
one of my existing paths here take the
brush tool get out my stylus here and
just connect it
oops
connect it just like that that's fine
and I up here as well the fingers I'm
just lightly pressing and there we go
okay so the way we do this is we create
a new layer so just click on this little
icon down here create new layer and
we'll take out the rectangle tool
well draw out just enough to encase
everything doesn't need a stroke so
we'll switch over here to stroke then
we'll switch to the foreground color and
just choose like a mid red color right
around here and now what we'll do is put
it to the bottom so we have layer one on
top of with our outlines we're going to
take all layer one and then we're going
to with everything selected we're going
to go to object path and outline stroke
so no longer all these are these
editable strokes they're converted to
actual paths wait let me back up before
I do that though so I'm gonna I want to
make this thicker though so before I do
that we're gonna increase that the three
alright so now we could take it make
sure you don't select the red actually
if you select the red object it doesn't
really matter we'll go to path in
outline stroke okay so now we're gonna
take everything so with the you know
everything in both layer wanted to and
we're going to go to make sure you go to
window and then pathfinder make sure
that's open and that will open this up
and click on merge so when you do that
switch to the direct selection tool just
select the outer most Anchor Point and
hit delete twice so now it's filled
everything in with color which is pretty
handy okay so first thing we have our
outlines like the black outlines right
here and we have the red as well all in
the same layer so I kind of want to
separate them so I'm going to take out
the magic wand double click on it and
that will bring up our magic wand
settings so we want to make sure fill
colors specified 32s fine for the
tolerance go ahead and exit that and
just click on a red somewhere and we
want to make sure that we take this and
first I'm just going to group it ctrl G
just so we can have all those in
don't layer now I'm going to create a
new layer here and I'm going to take
that group and put it into it all right
so I'm gonna take that beneath there and
that way we have this layer with all the
outlines and the paths and then beneath
that we have our color layers and so
this is just the first layer we're going
to have several so the black glasses if
we take this eye with a direct selection
tool
let me see you here oh yeah more quick
one second we what we want to do is go
back into that layer right here take the
group and we're going to right click
ungroup alright with the direct
selection tool and we want to use the
shape builder tool and that is right
here and if we click if we click on it
and hover over see how this left part of
the Sun grass is it's kind of outside
this portion well we want to join these
so you left click and just drag we could
drag this one to I one second here make
sure I have this set up correctly make
sure to select everything supposed to
make it black one second okay I found
the issue basically I make sure we
select the right one
so if in layer one the outlines open up
the group and we click on this one right
here then take the shape builder tool
and combine them then it sets it up
correctly basically we want this to all
be black black sunglasses sorry about
that it kind of got screwed up a bit
which happens often ok so now I let's go
ahead and give this some kind of like
just white reflections to make it look
like it's obvious that it's sunglasses
so to do that we'll go ahead and choose
our brush right here and we'll make it
for the stroke I'll have a white we
don't need a fill here all right and
just I kind of experiment here kind of
like that
maybe like yeah that's okay it's not
that bad
all right and we'll do one over here
kind of want to go in the same angle all
right that's fine that's good I let's
see what else let's go ahead and create
a new layer in between of those layer
three and one and inside of it I let's
go ahead and first I'm going to zoom up
a little bit and give the teeth a white
appearance and we can go over the black
portion because right now we're in a
layer that's underneath it the black
underneath it let's just switch to a
black color real quick with a stroke
we'll make the rest of the mouth black
actually I kind of got in the way of
that white so let me undo that real
quick
all right control one all right it's
coming along coming along okay I let's
go ahead and start adding some in
highlights and shadows for this so let's
I let's see here yeah we'll focus on
just the heart itself here I'm going to
add a new layer and right now if we take
the direct selection tool and select
this red color we'll have the red color
right here let's go ahead to swatches
and just drag that in there just so we
have that in our swatches and we'll go
ahead make sure we have our new layer
layer five there selected and we'll
choose a slightly throwing up on another
monitor a slightly darker color maybe
right around here D 3,000 or 30,000
rather and choose this and I'm gonna
zoom up just a little bit just alt in my
mouse scroll wheel although if you have
a a tablet you can also use that
and we'll go ahead and start drawing
kind of pressing hard you know what it
almost makes sense to me to create a new
brush that's a little bit thicker so
actually what we'll do is come over here
new brush calligraphy brush I think
that's how you pronounce that and we'll
choose maybe 18 with pressure and hit
okay all right so now it's going to be
show up a little bit thicker I forgot to
put my glove on so it makes these angles
a little bit difficult when your hand is
kind of sweaty and it's not really
sweaty but there's still friction on the
surface but that's okay this isn't a
real complex design all right so we have
like a light source that's kind of
coming from this way we'll go ahead and
add that same color again maybe on the
inner portion up here oops we don't want
to go outside kind of like that let's
see where else would it make sense to
add any type of shadow I think that's
pretty good right there
well add a highlight on the list left
side so we'll just take a slightly
lighter color than what we have on our
swatch here so we'll choose this we'll
double click on it make it a little bit
lighter so FF FF 5 a 5 a you don't have
to use that exactly of course anything
that's a little bit lighter and
noticeable will work and so now we're
gonna do that same thing over here up is
that lighter no it's like the same
colors before oh that's because I didn't
change it on the stroke that's no
problem all right just come up here okay
there we go
all right so
and keep on going can't see underneath
the glasses and I'm going to don't go
out there yeah a little bit sloppy right
there see if I can just fix that with a
Anchor Point usually if I didn't have
this microphone right in front of my
face I would be able to deal with it
much better but you know it's so light
he can't really tell anyways if this was
like for a serious project I would kind
of fix that down there but that's not a
big deal actually I can't still fix it
let me just zoom up here take the brush
tool again and kind of just smooth this
out we want it great there right there
yeah that's fine all right all right so
now I what else okay
so we'll work on this over here we have
some overlapping issues so what we'll do
is get our red color right here
and I'm going to draw we're going to
need to put that and this uppermost
layer right here so let me I don't want
to select any of those layers but rather
just be in the layer itself and we'll go
ahead and fix that all right
and we're gonna have to do the same
thing over here and right here alright
so actually I the top portion of the
canes gonna be black so let me just
change that real quick so we're gonna
fill this all in and let me go ahead
real quick and switch to this color kind
of make it look like a hands are there
or fingers rather and we'll come down
here let's see and this is going to be
yeah the rest of this is going to be red
so let me find or white rather let's
just take that change it to white I'm
actually gonna delete that one that I
made this here will be white as well now
this path right there yeah what we can
do is just die let me see here
leave that be and make it white oops
don't want to do that I'm just going to
take a white color
and yeah I think that'll work and we hit
control one to see how things are
looking
okay and usually there's like a red like
the bottom portion is red so let's go
ahead and do that real quick we'll make
the stroke here get rid of that make the
stroke this same oops now this red color
that we've been using and will come up
roughly they right around there
I'm going to use black real quick and
the bottom does need to have a white tip
so think of me there we go just like
that and then of course we switch back
to that red
alright so that's in a different layer
of tops and let me switch real quick
all right so let's see what this looks
like so far
all right so far so good let's go ahead
and I'm going to work on this portion
right here
so I let's find out where this is all
this stuff
now with the direct selection tool I'm
going to select this and just select one
of these anchor points and hit delete
you may have to do that twice by the way
for that to work properly I and this
kind of creates the crack that we're
looking for you know something that's
simple you could fill an inmate with
different shades with Nick and I like
sinking in here into the ground but I'm
not going to worry about that really I
think it still works effectively as it
is uh and so let's see what else I want
to do some hearts so I'm gonna create a
new layer on top of everything and we're
going to use white for the stroke and go
back to brushes will use this original
one we created and let me just zoom up a
little bit looks like I have a random
area right there make sure we go back
and make this as white and we'll just
draw some heart shapes here just kind of
coming up so oops that guy needs to be
black initially it's too thick so what I
want to do is we'll create a new new
brush right real quick this time we'll
make the width only we'll say four with
pressure for hit okay yeah I don't like
that portion right there so
all right that's fine and we'll take
this
we'll make it white for the fill and we
can start placing this around here oops
it didn't show up in the right just put
that in 6 there we go
so we'll just go ahead and take this
control C control F and start moving it
around in various places and let's see
maybe over here some of them can be in
front so I'm gonna be in back maybe one
right here maybe one up here move that
over just a bit alright that's good and
we're just about done let me go ahead
and put a new layer and put it at the
bottom of everything alright so we have
this new layer 7 we're going to choose a
really light gray use our brush tool
here let's see how light that is
yeah that's not right try that again if
we use a thicker brush probably this one
okay and so it's just going to emanate
off kind of like that same thing with
this inner leg see what that looks like
not bad looks pretty good and that is
essentially it so this is our design as
you can see you know it took us roughly
about 30 minutes there are some issues a
slight issues like for instance these
hands right here sorry about that loud
banging like the fingers probably need
outlined in black but not too big of a
deal but you understand now and have a
basic understanding of how to use a
tablet in Illustrator to illustrate a
simple concept plus I is just some
unique ideas in terms of how to come up
with
unique concepts maybe using popular
quotes that can be used on shirts memes
you know illustrations books you know
whatever and you see very fairly
straightforward you just have to get
your layer orders correct over here and
I if you're interested in this sort of
thing check out this annotation I'm
gonna mention right here again I where I
have a lot more elaborate tutorials that
go into this sort of thing and as well
as other things as well in terms of
design web development etc so check this
link out here make sure you subscribe
here on design course calm if you li
enjoy the tutorial and yeah that is it
talk to you later alright good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
