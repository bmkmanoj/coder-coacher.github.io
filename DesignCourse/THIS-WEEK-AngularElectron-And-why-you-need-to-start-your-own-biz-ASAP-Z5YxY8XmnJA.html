Etro and welcome to the second edition
of this week where I preview the content
that I'm gonna be creating the tutorials
and all that stuff for this upcoming
week and also I pick out one subject
that I'll just talk about very briefly
all right so first let's get out the
content out of the way that we're gonna
be covering I'm going to try to cover in
this coming week so I have definitely
three pieces of content that I want to
get to so the first is angular 5
authentication with firebase while also
using maybe a custom email option as
well as one of the social options for
logging in and outside of that I also
want to store and persist data using
that you know the currently logged
logged in user using cloud fire store so
you can get an idea of how you link you
know data that is saved to cloud fire
store and associate it with an actual
user account the second thing I want to
do is cover an electron intermediate
tutorial of some sort so I just released
that free beginners course on electron
or electron development for creating
native desktop apps using JavaScript so
I want to just create you know a series
of tutorials throughout the next month
or two that get into more specific
things that you want to do with electron
and then also finally I also want to do
UI design of some sort so you know as
many of you know I'm full stack
developer and I want to cover you know
also the aesthetics or the UI design or
identity design and all that stuff
that's pertinent if you're a full stack
designer so I'm not exactly sure what
I'm going to cover yet but and that's
kind of just a rough idea of what I have
alright so for this week's topic that I
wanted to discuss I one thing being that
New Year's resolutions are coming up
here in January first I one of the
things that I really want to emphasize
to every single one of you subscribers
is if you have not yet you need to start
a business in 2018 l even 2017 if you're
feeling that compelled to do so normally
when it comes to these new year's
resolution Year's resolutions in waiting
for that I'm not a big fan of do what
you need to do and do it now however
being that we're really close to January
first go ahead and set aside the time
you know this is not we're December 3rd
to start planning and set it you know
some sort of business plan up and a plan
of attack or plan of action who are
establishing some type of business I
don't care for you're a designer or a
coder and you're currently an employee
or subcontractor or freelancer try to
set up and start a business now you may
ask yourself why if you're already
getting paid and you're already happy
with your current situation well what
happens of course if you get fired you
just have to go to yet another employer
employee and you have downtime really in
that scenario it is out of your hands
and if you live on the internet in this
day and age you have access to all this
information especially a lot of free
content in terms of how to market and
you know all these opportunities that
are available there's no reason not to
start a business of some sort and like I
said I don't care if you're designer or
a coder you can come up with something
at least now also the flexibility that
brute you know having your own business
gives you in terms of you know not
having to wake up at an exact time in be
somewhere at an exact time is awesome
not having to answer to somebody
specifically is awesome
now of course I probably do work more
than your average person especially if
you're going to start a successful
business you will probably work more
however the payoff is so much freaking
better so I just want to give you my
personal kind of story here my you know
my anecdotal story just to kind of show
you you know what I have done in the
last year that has enabled me from being
a subcontracted course developer for
different networks like photo site
LinkedIn learning who just recently
purchased lynda.com and he's allowed me
to go from that to now to focus solely
on my own course business as you know
course cetera and I'm gonna be focusing
in that 100% full-time here the
beginning of 2018 this is my analytics
google analytics for my website corset
row and this is showing the users from
January 1st to December 3rd basically
this entire year to this point now as
you can see if I hover over where it
says 400 users back on January 2nd I was
getting you know just a few hundred
visitors per day not very much now as
you can see over time it has steadily
grown considerably all the way to
current day where I'm getting close to
10,000 visitors per day so I've gone
from you know measly a couple hundred to
ten thousand and that's because at the
beginning of the year I made it a huge
priority to really work on my business
even though I had these monthly
commitments in terms of creating courses
I thought to myself you know what at any
point in time and it has to had happened
before with Envato Network I was doing
courses for them they didn't they've
pretty much cut out the whole design
department for instructing they weren't
gonna cover that anymore and I was
pretty much out of my subcontracting gig
yeah I got to work at home but I'm still
at their mercy
so that could happen at any point in
time with these other networks that I
work for so I decided are going to
really start focusing hardcore on
chugging turning out content left and
right on my site and so I was I've done
probably I think it's well over a
hundred tutorials so far both in written
and video format and having a lot of
traffic is one thing but it doesn't mean
anything if you're not monetizing it
right so I monetize this stuff in a
bunch of different ways from Google
Adsense the ads actually show up on this
tutorial
most people don't mind because they're
getting something for free
don't ever let the socialist/communist
people tell you that yeah it's wrong to
try to profit from your free content
completely bs I also monetize it of
course through the subscription service
that I offer that a lot of you are part
of I also monetize
is it through taking those same courses
uploading them to udemy
and I also monetize it by having ads on
my youtube channel I know there are
probably pretty annoying however it
helps pay for my mortgage so I can keep
doing this on a more full-time basis so
that's what I did personally to kind of
turn my situation around to where I'm no
longer at the mercy of an employer or a
you know a subcontractor type of
relationship I don't have to rely on
that anymore and you know what once you
get the ball rolling you'll find that
your time will be more valuable when
you're focusing on your own business as
opposed to just working as an employee
for somebody else's and so there is a
quote that it heard wants that really
resonated well with me if you're not
going to make your own dreams happen
you're going to work by making somebody
else's dreams happen so again there's
nothing wrong with being an employee
there's a lot of positives to that such
as a stable income and all that however
when it comes to you know having your
own business that is the ultimate
freedom and you can definitely do it
don't doubt yourself so I think you know
talking about this business stuff and
that the business end especially because
I have experience and it directly is
going to become one of the topics that I
start discussing more on this channel
because I think it's relevant to
everyone especially you if you know
you're a designer or a coder presumably
watching this and so I really want to
start talking about that more maybe give
ideas maybe do case studies and I may
even do something where we do a follow
along sort of internet-based business
and where you can follow along and watch
every step that I do to try to grow
something small that has a lot of
potential and then who knows maybe at
the end I'll keep keep it going or I'll
try to flip it on a website selling
service of some sort alright so those
are my thoughts for this evening so make
sure you subscribe here if you haven't
yet of course
sure you have if you're watching this
and also check out course cetera
comm if you have any comments definitely
leave them alright see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
