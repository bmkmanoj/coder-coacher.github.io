passing data from the component class
and setting the value of a given element
in the view so property binding is one
way and that the data is transferred
from the component to the view so the
benefit of property binding is that it
allows you to control the element
property values from the component and
change them whenever needed so let's
take a closer look at property binding
based on the previous lesson from this
course so in the console go ahead to
that folder if you don't already have it
running and run ng serve and in our code
editor I'm using Visual Studio code go
to your app component es file and this
is the template information that we had
from the previous lesson so I'm just
going to remove this right here and this
property right here okay so there are
really three ways to define a property
binding in angular so the first way and
I'm just going to copy and paste all of
these just to show you real quickly
alright so the first way which I'll
outline right here is through
interpolation to define the value and
you can do this as long as the value
that you're defining is a string now if
it's not plus such as like a boolean
then you must use the method two or
three which are right here in here
respectively
all right so additionally the most
common method of defining a property
binding is by wrapping the brackets
right here around an element attribute
and binding it to a component property
right here and then also another way of
achieving this is just to prepend here
bind - right behind the element
attribute name which is source and then
also binding it to a template expression
which is usually a component property
alright
so to make this work all we have to do
is define this angular logo property
right here in the component class so to
do that and get our logo equals and I'm
simply going to link to an official
angular PNG file like this we'll save it
and we'll see that it shows all three
logos because all three methods will
work for property binding so another
common use case for property mining is
on an input element disabled attribute
and it allows you to control when a
given input element should be enabled or
disabled so let's go ahead and add the
following templates go ahead and get rid
of this right here and we'll add it on a
button disabled so this is property
binding equals and we'll bind it to a
component property call button status
which could either be true or false and
we'll name it my button here and then
come over here we'll remove this and
simply put in button status equals true
so we'll save that we'll go back and we
could see that because button status is
true the disabled attribute is applied
to the button so we cannot click it so
if we change it to false real quickly
and then go back we'll see that we can
now click it and if we viewed the dome
right now we'll see that disabled would
not be added to button okay
so we can also real quickly change the
template expression to equals and some
strings so we'll so say enabled will
change button status here to enabled
and we'll see now it becomes disabled
because it the typical expression
evaluated to true right here alright so
that in a nutshell is how property
binding works
so to recap property binding allows you
to define element attribute values from
the component class and it is also
one-way data-binding as you can only set
data from the component to the view
alright so in the next lesson we're
going to take a look at angular for
event binding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
