today we're going to step into blender
with a quick well kind of quick it's
about i think it's like 25 to 30 minutes
long video tutorial about creating
really cool reflective surfaces and
materials and so we're going to create
just a pretty simple 3d compass needle
type of thing just to illustrate
different types of reflections alright
so if you've never used blender before
you'll be able to follow along pretty
decently although you might want to
follow a few other be absolute beginner
tutorials first but yeah check out
design course comm if you haven't yet
and subscribe here on youtube alright
get started alright so if you've never
messed around with blender before
basically a quick introduction the way
you I select objects is right clicking
not left clicking to move around in the
viewport you can just hold your middle
or third mouse button and then you use
your screen your scroll wheel rather to
zoom up and down and then to pan hold
shift in that middle a third mouse
button like this alright so that's the
only only introduction I'm going to do
so go ahead and delete this cube so
select it hit delete and enter very
simple alright so I'm going to create
kind of just like a what's that thing
called what the hell am I thinking of
compass needle and so the way we'll
create this I actually I shouldn't have
deleted that cue but it's going to hit
shift a real quick
and right here select cube shouldn't
have deleted at initial I'm all it's
such a habit I just lead it
automatically but anyhow um so yet with
this cube what we want to do is make
some adjustments so we're going to go
into edit mode right now in object mode
down here click on that gets you to edit
mode or just hit tab to toggle between
both of those so edit mode allows you to
do things like this and a lot of other
things it allows you basically to deform
the actual object and then object mode
allows you to do basic things like scale
it up rotate it move it around etc so in
edit mode what we want to do is hit one
on our number pad and that gives us into
the front view
you and just real quick seven is top i3
aside right and all that hitting control
that gets you the left control seven
bottom control one back cetera so you
get it I actually we're just going to
talk to you real quick on seven and hit
control R and you'll see this gets
placed here and what we want to do is
just died
oops sorry left click once hit enter and
that adds an edge right in the very
center of this then what we want to do
go back to seven is turn this on there
just click this button and hit a and
then B as a boy to select those now this
wasn't turned on it would only select
these to the visible Porsche vertexes
right now this will select the ones
behind them as well so that's the
purpose of that and so now we want to do
is delete and vertices then we want to
come over here I'm going to hit end to
get rid of that part and we're going to
add a mirror modifier so you click on
this little tool add mirror what that
does is it's going to allow us to I only
have to work on this side and this will
mirror everything over here I I'm also
going to make it so that we can mirror I
the other way as well so the way we'll
do that is hit ctrl R on this side left
click hit enter hit a B select this
portion delete vertexes and hit Y so now
whatever we do over here for exists is
going to be mirrored on those other two
accesses very simple all right so now
what we want to do is get this into a
basic shape of a compass needle so right
now this is obviously a cube not like
the actual shape at all so what we want
to do is I will go inside you
hit I or front view rather this is
actually back so control one what we
want to do is scale everything down so
hit a then a hit s for scale but we only
want it to be on the Z there z axis so
hit Z and then scale this down quite a
bit
alright simple enough and we're also
going to scale it in let's hit seven to
get the top view we hit eyes if we take
these hip a and then B and then take
these by left clicking and dragging
we're going to make it longer and then
to hit a and then B and make rotate over
here real quick and we want to make
these real close together I think right
there will be fine and if you want to
get absolutely dead close you click on
clipping move it over that way they
won't intersect alright so now what I
want to do is also bring these together
these two points so with them selected
what we can do actually they weren't
both sock did I hit a and then B make
sure they're all selected because
there's four points they're not just two
and hit s for scale and then Z just like
right around there all right so now it
kind of tapers and ideally we'd want it
to taper like this so if we hit one to
get into well or three we could see that
everything evenly comes out like this
let's take this and just drop it down
like that so um it's almost flat alright
very simple all right so I want to make
another adjustment so we're going to go
into edge select mode
right click this top edge right there
and we're just going to raise it up a
little bit so the more different type of
geometry that you have the more
reflections we're going to get basically
all right and so just for the fun of it
just so we can really see the metal
reflections that we're about to do I we
can go ahead go to tab to object mode
and we can add a subdivision surface you
can see that really distorts everything
we're going to increase this to three
for the view and render and let's go
back into I solid mode rather or edit
mode by hitting tab and what we want to
do is add some more edge loops to get
this more structured control our sorry
about that
wrong side going to hit ctrl R over here
ctrl R over here move it all the way up
alright and add another one right here
control R this time I'm just going to
left click and then left click again set
it and hit s for scale and then we're
going to try yeah the hit yep X exit
work right now
sorry I'm being slow as hell right now
yeah Z and the great around there will
work hit ctrl R again and move it up
against it ctrl R again to move it up
against it there ctrl R to move this
over here
alright kind of just looking at this see
how it's looking now we also want to go
to tab into object mode and hit smooth
for shading alright that's looking
pretty decent for now now this should
give us some pretty cool looking um
views for the reflections we're about to
do alright so now what I want to do is
go ahead and start setting up the scene
a little bit I'm going to hit control a
our shift a rather hit plane and hit s
for scale and we're going to choose 50
just hit 50 and we'll scale it up 50
times so to be huge we're going to
right-click our object here and move up
just a little bit like that and we're
going to go to the world tab first
before that we're going to right after
rather go to cycles render change that
from blender render to cycles render
some I always do make the real color
bright what that does if we go to
rendered I mix everything real bright
otherwise the default color makes
everything is just great I de fault so
we'll make this bright like that and I'm
going to go over here into the render
section change to GPU compute makes
everything load we render rather a lot
faster I'm going to change and sampling
10 samples for the preview which is this
is the preview and the render is very
low it's why it's grainy right there so
let's go ahead I'm going to change
I'll try this 2004 the render when we go
to render and then this one for up to a
hundred so now it's a little bit better
looking and then we're going to go and
change to from performance if you're
using GPU compute 256 by 256 for the
tiles and that will help for a rendering
so GPU compute
completely real quick if you don't see
this option just hit ctrl alt in you or
go to file user preferences and go to
system and if you have if you see
compute device down here you can select
CUDA and then it shows your graphics
cards right here and then select those
and you'll have those options alright so
now what I want to do is get set up with
our actual material for this so right
now it's just like this white clay or
whatever let's wet switch to the
material section and we want to make
sure that our needle is selected right
now the plane selected selecting that so
and put in this eye what is that the
rendered mode you can't see what's
selected I guess we can switch real
quick to solid this is selected so what
we want to do is hit new and for the
surface this is diffused by default
change it to this right here now if we
go back to rendered we'll see that it
changes it quite a bit all right and it
looks pretty cool but I want about to do
makes it look a lot cooler I there's an
issue right here which I may fix but
anyhow what I'm talking about is I this
isn't really reflecting anything except
for light so what we want to do is
left-click and drag out up over here and
we want to switch over to the node
editor now the node editor is basically
a much more dynamic version of
everything you see here and all these
options so you know what real quick I'm
going to join this area by
right-clicking it I'm going to pull this
down instead of to the left that makes
the view a little bit bigger all right
so now in here we see these little nodes
are called we can move them all around
what we want to do for this is add a I a
reflection texture of sorts and so the
way we can do this
is
we can hit shift a texture environment
texture connect the color node to this
color node right here switch to rendered
and this eye pink purple color or
whatever because there's no file
currently selected before we select that
going to hit shift a and I'm going to
add input and texture coordinate and
then right here you see reflection just
connect that real quick hit open and
just select a photo I mean it doesn't
really even have to be anything specific
I this is actually I'll show you the
picture later on but yeah you can't
really tell what it is at all i but
right now this doesn't really look too I
guess you could say realistic or doesn't
really look good it's certainly not any
type of eye now I guess you say like a
chrome because it has all this color in
it so we can adjust that real quick by
adding in a few color adjustment nodes
here so if we hit shift a and we go to
color mix RGB actually I'm going to
delete that one shift a color and go to
ya hue and saturation connect this color
to this color this color to there now we
can adjust the saturation of this down
to zero so now it's just black and white
and that looks pretty cool because
you're getting this random sort of
reflection a reflective material based
on whatever you chose here for this
image alright so you can also adjust the
brightness and contrast of this so if
you wanted to shift a color and
brightness and contrast if you hover
over it it'll automatically connect
those so now if we change the brightness
you can really do a lot of cool things
obviously with this now what's even
cooler is we can say for example you
have a specific view or perspective that
you like but there's not much I part of
the the image texture that's getting
reflected like right here well the way
you can do this is move this over hit
shift a and we're going to select vector
mapping and this massive monster comes
up here and you can decide when you
hover over this line it becomes the
orange click on it and now we can adjust
through these three accesses the
location of this so if we want it to be
on the Y we can just left click this we
can see how the material is adjusting
weather location and you can play around
with it just to get some cool looks I
think that's a little bit too much but
anyhow that way depending on the
perspective you can get some good dye
results alright so you can also adjust
how this appears by adjusting the
roughness right now it's at like zero or
it was at zero by default
turn the roughness up you can mess with
that a little bit
and I'm just playing with these really
alright
if you want some more I like shadows
casting off of this or anything like
that go into solid real quick I'm going
to click up around here shift a mesh and
plane it's kind of far away I move it
over RX 45 degrees pull it up
R&amp;amp;Z make sure it's facing our needle
thing s2 just to scale it up two times
and hit new and make it an emission
plane you'll act like a light that is if
I can find it right there
we'll try ten at first just to see how
this affects the view let's go into
camera mode so you just hit zero on your
number pad see what this looks like hit
n as a nose and lock camera to view that
way and when we change the hit and again
too high that that way we change our
view the camera gets moved along with it
alright so now let's see what this looks
like rendered alright and so this of
course we try 10 what this 100 do what's
500 uparti ech way too much try 100 all
right
trying to get a perspective that I kind
of like from this
right click this play around with the
location a little bit more I kind of
like that and this looks pretty cool all
right so then I'm going to right click
over here join area down just to hide
that portion hit end to get out of there
on i-10 rather hit zero on the number
pad to get out and want to see what I
can do real quick because this issue is
annoying the hell out of me yeah I think
one of the vertices that I adjusted got
scaled up and out so let me go ahead and
switch into edit mode by hitting tab
alright so let's go to vertex mode a and
B
a and B
a and B B let's get that up all right
that's better so now we'll go back to
rendered and that's looking a whole lot
better hit zero all right I like it so I
just for the fun of it I'm going to go
to object mode right click on the plane
and give it a diffuse texture and I'm
going to hit zero real quick let's see
what we can do with this I background
color there now we have some lighting
information in there we hit zero I like
it
cool um yeah that is it so now what we
want to do if you want to render this
just some quick tips for the render we
have a thousand our preview is 100 so a
thousand is going to be more than enough
to get a good picture here when it comes
to the resolution 1920 by 1080 is
default this 50% thing means it's only
going to take 50% or half of 1920 and
half of 1080 and your so you're not
going to get 10 1920 by 1080 on the Y
it's 50% by default but take that up
high and I'm going to make mine 1280 by
720 just because that's the dimensions
that I record these videos and you are
ready to go hit render and so depending
on the speed of your computer and how
many samples you use this may take a
little bit of time for me it's not going
to be too long maybe thirty more seconds
or so so I'm going to pause until this
is finished and that is it that's the
image I think it looks pretty damn cool
so that's how easy that you can add
reflective chrome surfaces our materials
rather and it can really just impact the
look of your final render so if you want
to save this F
three and then save it wherever you want
to let me go there where I need to I'm
gonna pop all right I paused real quick
I mentioned I would show you know what
image I use because literally when it
comes to these reflections on a type of
surface like this you can use almost
anything as long as it's just there's a
lot of variation and it's not just like
one solid call it the color or something
and so the reason I use this image just
because I when I chose just a row just
to show you this is so funny I when I go
to node editor yeah when I chose when I
was doing this project beforehand I open
up the folder I wait where is it at yeah
when I opened it up it just went to my C
Drive and I saw just one image I didn't
know what it was I just clicked it had
no clue well I went to go take a look at
what that was exactly and I it's
actually this image right here of my
wife and this is probably like this is
several years ago when she was pregnant
or something and obviously pregnant and
she had like these these eyes this
picture done of like I don't know she or
some friend was a photographer or
something and she took his picture and I
thought it'd be really funny to like
Photoshop her smoking with this a Jack
Daniel's bottle over here anyhow that's
what the picture is
right here how awesome anyhow she wasn't
a fan by the way of the whole smoking
and drinking stuff while pregnant which
understandably so right anyhow yeah
check out design course calm if you
haven't yet subscribe here on YouTube
and yeah look forward to a new video I
don't even know what yet I but for
tomorrow so yeah see you tomorrow good
bye
