use a damn Mac although I'm really not
sure why but because of this those of us
in the front-end design PC community
world have had to suffer because sketch
won't release for Windows ever and adobe
has only made XD or experience design
available for you guessed it Mac until
now so just yesterday Adobe released XD
experience design available in Creative
Cloud and holy I download that faster
than the first time I discovered cat
memes in the mid-90s on my 56k dial-up
modem upon installation it opens up
right away and the UI is very very
minimalistic very much unlike Photoshop
or illustrator
the first thing I noticed was where is
the campus or how do I start a new
document but then I noticed this bloob
jammed down here the artboard tool now
this lets you draw your own artboard or
select from a predefined list of device
specific sizes then you use the very
limited supply of tools to start
building your interface now when I say
very limited supply that's a good thing
because it's going to stop a lot of you
newbie UI designers from adding lens
flares and inner glows on every element
possible
now here I'm building out a simple list
and in the past when a tool like
Photoshop or illustrator you would have
to manually group and duplicate a ton of
laters but with XD you simply group them
and then click this little grid tool and
voila
very very simple now something not shown
here in this video is you can import
photos or even text elements to quickly
change up the repetitive nature of the
content produced by the repeat grid tool
now to fully realize the potential of XD
you need at least two artboards so I'm
creating one here to simulate a screen
that will appear after a user has click
one of the list items once that's all
wrapped up you click the prototype tab
and you select any items and in this
case the original group that you want to
remain clickable and then drag it over
to the screens that you want to appear
upon clicking and of course we're given
options such as target transition easing
and duration do that one more time for
the FAQ button and press the play icon
in the upper toolbar and there you go
we have a very quick and easy
presentation of the layout in action as
a user interacts with the mock-up now of
course this beta is very limited in
terms of features in Adobe has mentioned
that they will be releasing monthly
updates with new features and as that
happens of course I'll be here to guide
you oh so gently alright until next time
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
