of Zhang course calm and this is the
19th design course I column design
challenge and this time we're going to
do something completely different it's
not another logo design just something
we haven't done yet as a part of a
challenge and this is to design an
isometric graphic a building to be
specific alright so the objective here
is to design a single isometric
isometric building it can be a
skyscraper or any other commercial sort
of building so if you're unsure of what
that is then scroll down here to the
inspiration and this these are basically
isometric buildings or graphics and you
know what is isometric well basically
it's a certain sort of perspective
that's not really based in accurate 3d
all right so everything's very square in
a sense and you can entirely design
these in Photoshop you don't have to use
like a 3d graphics application although
you can such as blender but you know how
you which software you want to use
that's entirely up to you so you could
use illustrator Photoshop 3d application
you know you can even draw it on paper
if you wish I don't really care i just
want to see the execution and this would
be a fun challenge for people to really
just put yourself out there and try to
achieve something very interesting so
these are some more simplistic examples
this is a little bit more intense
graphically I and they even get more
intense than this as well they almost
look realistic in a sense so you know
whatever approach you decide to take
that's entirely up to you so the
requirements are just designed a single
building that you can do more if you
wish but it's not necessary because I
don't want this to be really
time-consuming I make sure you get the
isometric perspective correct now if you
do a Google search you could type in
something like isometric grid Photoshop
or PSD template and you know there are
grids and templates that help you create
your lines and get everything correct
all right so as I have noted here I
haven't actually done a tutorial on this
before but others do
exists simply do a google search for
isometric design tutorials it's
something I do definitely want to cover
in the future but I just haven't yet so
the submission deadlines a week from the
day as always so it's wednesday the 18
days 11th and submit by midnight and
eastern standard time alright so looking
forward to the entries and reviewing
them maybe in a week and a half I or two
all right I'll talk to you later goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
