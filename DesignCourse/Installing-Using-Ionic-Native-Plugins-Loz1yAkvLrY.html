comm and today we're going to take a
look at onic native now first this video
that you're watching here is a part of
my free ionic course and a third lesson
video and you can find that link here in
YouTube to course cetera comm so what is
ionic native well basically it's a set
of plugins that allow you to add native
mobile functionality to your apps and it
can even allow you to access other
services so in this video I'm going to
show you how to install these plugins as
well as how to use them and even remove
them so let's go ahead and get started
all right first we want to set up a test
project if you haven't been following
along with the course if you have been
and you already have your first project
set up and you can skip this step
however if you're landing on this
particular tutorial or lesson page and
you weren't following along we want to
type in the following command first we
want to CD into your code folder
wherever that may be and we're going to
type in ionic start first project blank
template and d2 for ionic 2 so I'm going
to let this run and I'll come back
alright great after that's complete
we'll CD into it and we're ready to go
alright so how to install an ionic
native plugin now installing a native
plug-in is made simple with the ionic
command my interface or CLI so the
format is as follows ionic this is how
we reference the ionic command-line
interface very simple and then plug in
add this lets ionic know that we want to
add a plug-in and then the plug-in name
which can either be in the form of a
plug-in ID a local path or a get URL so
when this command is finished running it
will place the plug-in and a plugins
folder inside of the project root so how
do we use an ionic native plug-in after
it's been installed
well first
you have to select the intended
component file that we'll use to plug in
and then we add the plugin as an import
at the top so as you can see you can add
multiple ionic native plugins with a
single import statement and these native
plugins will always be added from ionic
- native so after a plugin has been
important neither then free to use it in
your component class so the
documentation provides you with a usage
example along with any associated
methods and options with the plug-in so
let's go ahead and give it a go
ourselves first I want you to visit the
ionic native documentation right here
and as we can provide you with a list of
all of the available plugins here on the
left and as you can see there's quite a
few so let's say for example that we
wanted to add the geolocation ionic
native plug-in to our application so as
we can see right here the very first
line shows you how to install it into
your application so I'm just going to
copy this and we're going to go back to
the console and make sure you're inside
of the correct project folder I'm going
to right click to paste it and then hit
enter alright
once that's complete let's go ahead over
to our code editor I'm going to use
Visual Studio code and if we come in
here into the plugins folder as I
mentioned earlier we'll see that it adds
Cordova plug-in geolocation along with
any other associated plugins that this
particular plug-in will use okay so
let's go to source we'll go to pages and
here we have our home tes file now going
back to the documentation we'll see we
have usage and the very first line is
the import so we can go ahead and copy
that we'll switch back to our component
and at the very top I'll just paste in
geo location from ionic - native now
reverting back to the documentation we
could see
we have something called static members
and it lists get current position with
options as in argument and also watch
position with options as an argument as
well now we can see there's just two of
them and if we look at the usage
examples it shows us how to use each one
of these methods so we have geolocation
dot get current position and then also
watch position we go back down here we
could see each one of these also returns
a Geo position as well as coming down
here for this watch position it also
returns a Geo position so what exactly
does that even mean let's go down here
until we find geo position now we could
see we have two parameters we have
chords as in coordinates and the type is
coordinates now what exactly does that
mean that's not a string or an integer
light or any other usual type that we're
usually accustomed to seeing for a
parameter type so if we scroll up we'll
see coordinates right here so this is
reference to this right here so we'll
see we have a parameter of latitude
longitude accuracy altitude and all
these other ones and it gives us a nice
description along with their types now
additionally if we come over here we
also see for each one of these four get
current position as well as watch
position we'll see that
the parameters except the type of called
geolocation options same thing right
here under watch position so if we
scroll all the way down we'll find that
as well
so these are optional parameters there's
three of them that we can pass to it so
in the example up here though we could
see they decided not to pass any type of
parameters with either of these methods
so if you want to know what those
parameters are of course you can read
down here we have a maximum a
it gives you a description a timeout and
enable high accuracy okay so let's go
ahead and hop into our component TS or
our home TS file rather and we'll go
ahead and say for example we want a
button when clicked it will call a
method will name it watch and it'll
return on the screen the latitude and
longitude as well as the accuracy now
remember latitude longitude and accuracy
are just some of the returned values
that we can use so let's go ahead and
first define three properties here at
the top so we'll have chords type any
accuracy type any and error as type any
as well so let's come over here and
let's create a watch method and
reference geolocation get current
position so then responds to open up in
squiggly braces
we'll make this chords which which is in
reference to this property up here will
equal the response dot chords dot
latitude alright and we also do plus a
space and also do response chords dot
longitude there we go we will also do
this accuracy equals the response chords
accuracy let's put plus and the space
meters so again where did I get this
from the chords and the accuracy if we
go back to our documentation we'll see
we have down here we
cords and its type is coordinates and
then up here we have latitude longitude
accuracy altitude etc so it's chords dot
any of these alright
so let's also add a catch for the error
if there's a potential error that's
returned so much in the same way open
this up just that error equals error
getting location plus error all right
that's it so we'll save it and we'll go
back to our home dot HTML and I'm going
to select all and then just paste what I
have here from the written tutorial
which you can find by the way and all we
do we do is have an eye on card I on
card content a button which we're using
quick event binding to the watch method
that we just created and then we have
position using interpolation for the
chords accuracy and we're using an ng if
conditional if the error exists then
show the error all right so let's save
that I'll go back to the console will
type in ionic serve - L for LabVIEW and
here we are so let's go ahead and hit
get position oops I have meters in here
I have to remove that real quickly
we'll go back to our code editor get rid
of that remember to update that and then
we'll go back get position and we have
our latitude right here and then the
longitude right here and then we also
have accuracy which because I'm on a
desktop it's really really off however
if you were to connect your phone with
us via iOS or Android and type in the
command let's go ahead and get out of
here ctrl C type in the command ionic
run and if you have Android you type in
Android and hit enter and by the way you
may have to do a little bit of setup
initially for this to work if you
haven't done it yet but if you have your
phone connected through a USB it will
run the app on your phone and then when
you press that button for get position
it will give you a accuracy that's
probably a lot better long obviously
when you have your QPS turned on so why
when I did it I think the accuracy was
around 70 meters so it worked pretty
good alright and that is essentially how
you use install these ionic native
plugins and there's a lot of them here
so you know I would really just
encourage you to experiment with them
and really it's the same thing for all
of these we have the name we have how to
install it we also have usage and then
it provides you with all of the other
necessary information such as parameters
their types etc so it's really just a
matter of understanding the
documentation and also how to read it
and eventually you'll be able to use any
of these with relative ease so let's
also discuss just one final thing I
sometimes you're going to be
experimenting with different plugins and
if you not ended up using them then you
want to get rid of them from their
project because if we go back to our
code editor and we look inside our
plugins folder we start adding a lot of
these it's going to just unnecessarily
bulk the project up so how do we remove
them well it's very simple if we go here
we'll assume we're done with this
project we're going to type in ionic
plug in remove and then the plug-in name
so in our case it would be geolocation
so we'll type in geolocation and there
we go so now if we're back to our code
editor you'll see it is no longer there
and of course we would also obviously
need to remove any reference up here as
well as it won't work
all right so hopefully now you have a
good understanding of how ionic native
plugins work so in the next lesson we're
going to take a look at how does deploy
your ionic app I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
