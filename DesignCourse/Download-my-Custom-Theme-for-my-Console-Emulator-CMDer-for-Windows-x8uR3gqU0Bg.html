hey everyone Gary Simon of course cetera
with a really quick video that's gonna
address a kind of a topic that people
keep on hitting me up and they have in
for the past I don't know six months to
a year about what console do I use when
you see this one right here if I switch
over to my desktop it is commander or
CMD er and I've mentioned it throughout
several tutorials but I figure out to
make a dedicated video just because so
many people ask it and then outweigh I
could put it at the bottom of the
YouTube description I've edit every
video going forward so to get this it's
free go to CMD er net and download right
here once it's finished also check the
YouTube description the very first line
in this video is going to be the custom
theme that I created so you can use the
same colors if you wish and once you
have it loaded right-click it the status
here and commander and go to settings
then you hit import and locate the XML
file that you downloaded from the
description here and hit yes and there
we go everything will change to the
colors here in your console so I really
like this one again most of you aren't
going to care about this video but it's
late on a Sunday night and I wanted to
put out a video so this is going to be a
helpful one you know so I don't have to
keep on responding to people in YouTube
comments alright so look out for a lot
more content coming up work contact
coming here in the very near future as
you can see I have my new background and
all that stuff before I had that black
there was a black screen it looked like
I was recording in space or something
I'm getting sick of that so yeah a lot
of new stuff coming very soon so I'll
talk to you guys real soon goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
