hey all Gary Simon of course Tetro we're
going to revisit a topic that I covered
in angular 2 four and now five and it's
also worth doing simply because material
that has updated and changed and
integration process is a little bit
different so let's go ahead I'm going to
jump over to the console and oh but real
quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera comm
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it
now also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on alright let's get back to it
I'm just gonna assume for a second that
you know you already have the angular
CLI or command line interface tool
installed if you don't know what I'm
talking about then probably pretty good
idea to check out the angular 5i
beginners course at course cetera comm
so assuming you have that already
installed we're going to ng new we're
going to say ng five - material for the
project name I'm not gonna add any
routing or any other type of flags here
for that although you may want to add
the - - style equals SAS or SCSS flag in
case you did want to make custom
adjustments to the material theme I kind
of forgot about that but then that's no
big deal we're not going to do that in
this video you can check out the
documentation for that specifically
so come on install install install
install yeah just before this my
children both go to dance and is the
most horrible process there's screaming
you don't want to do their hair I'm
yelling like dude I got to do this video
sucks anyhow they're out of the house
okay so it just installed like you guys
wanted to know that ng5 material and now
we're going to run ng serve and this
just serves it builds out the project
we can access at a local host 4200 which
we'll be doing
periodically throughout this tutorial
and we're also going to get our new
console window so I'm using commander
it's a console emulator with a custom
theme maybe I'll release that some
people always been requesting it alright
and then next we have to integrate
material so at this point we created a
new just fresh angular 5 project with
the CLI now we have to integrate
material to do that we're going to hop
back into ng 5 material here we're going
to run npm install at angular material
and also angular CD k and then save it
as a dev dependency in the package.json
file that was created with the CLI so
this will install momentarily normally I
would just pause and speed this up but
kind of pressed for time
all right good then and take you long
alright the next we have to install
animations because angular material rely
on angular animations as some of the
components rely on having that installed
so we also have to install that so npm
install save it at angular forward slash
animations alright and i'm gonna go
ahead while this installs and get out my
code editor here i'll open up the
project folder off-screen alright and
that's done sweet okay so I'm gonna
increase this just so you guys can see
it one more yeah that's fine okay so by
next we have to go to source app and our
app module because we just used NPM to
install animations now we have to
actually import it so I'm going to copy
this and paste this off-screen by the
way when I'm pasting stuff I'm getting
it from the written version of this
tutorial so pretty much every tutorial I
create I do a written version and if
you're watching this on YouTube and you
probably are they look in the
description in the very first line it
shows written too
toriel and it has all the code there so
you don't have to worry you know what
the hell why's this guy pasting all
right so right here import browser
animations module from this library here
in the animations and then we just copy
this and we put it as an import save it
alright so very very simple so now what
we need to do is import each material
component that we want to use in our
project now normally we can do this here
right here in our app module ts file but
really for the purpose of organization
and keeping our app module brief you can
create a custom module file specifically
for your material component imports and
then we'll just import that in here so
first let's create a new file so ctrl be
here and visual studio code and we're
gonna create a new file in the same
folder called material dot module dot TS
alright so in order for this to work the
first thing that we need to setup is
just two different imports right there
and then we have an NG model oops sorry
engi module rather not model and then
inside of here we have our imports and
exports and then we export our class
we're going to call it material module
that's what we import in our app module
momentarily
so now right here in this line is where
we're going to import any of our
components we're in here within these
squiggly brackets so we'll import the
matte button module or in other words
the button module from or the button
component from at angular Ford slash
material so that's the first step you
import it up here and then in ng module
module this needs to be a capitalized by
the way we put an imports property and
then the name right here and we will
separate these with comma if you have
more and we will momentarily and then
also we have to export them as well the
same exact thing just like that alright
so now we can save this and we go back
to our app module TS and we import the
name of that module which is material
module right here from material module
then we take this and we add it right
here awesome okay so let's go ahead and
save that so the next step that's
required is to include an angular
material theme and so a theme provides a
set of predefined colors that will be
applied to your material design
components so the colors consist of
primary colors accent colors a warning
set of colors foreground and background
colors and now at the time of writing
this tutorial they provides you and I
think this is pretty much been standard
they didn't like sit there and make a
bunch of these themes there's basically
four that you can choose from so what we
want to do now is visit the source
Styles dot CSS file and we're going to
add the fall
line so import see angular material
pre-built themes indigo pink dot CSS so
the other ones are deep amber dot CSS
pink blue gray and purple green I'm not
the greatest names but you know whatever
so let's go ahead and save that and now
we have to import with NPM or install
with NPM hammer J yes and that's because
some of the components require this for
full feature support for in terms of
gestures so let's go ahead and go back
to our console here and we're going to
npm install save it to a dev dependency
hammer j/s all right so I'm gonna let
this run now we just have to import this
in our apps entry point at main TS so
we're gonna go right here and we just
simply add it right there and save that
okay so we're almost there we have one
last step and that is a lot of a
material design in general if you're
building like a full-featured app that
has you know superior material design
you're probably going to run into a
situation where you need icons in order
to use the icons you have to import the
icons in your source index.html file so
that is right here so I'm copying this
code from the written tutorial make
control-b and this is right here what
you want to import just from the google
api is calm here material icons all
right so that's it it's pretty much
ready to go and ready to use at this
point now we did import one material
component which is the button so let's
try that out and test it out and make
sure everything works at this point now
before I even do that I'm gonna step
over to the browser and check out just
to make sure there's no errors going on
in the console so let's go I'm gonna get
out our well just get a new window here
not very organized
am i we're gonna put in localhost sweet
control-shift i alright no errors okay
so let's go ahead and test out make sure
material is actually integrated and by
the way I know it's integrated but you
know we just have to be certain of these
things so I'm going to my source app app
component HTML file just getting rid of
all that and let's just put in a button
and what's going to designate this as a
actual material button is when we add a
directive mat - button and this is all
in the documentation and we'll see then
how all this works momentarily my button
so let's just save that let's go back to
our look where to go right here and
there you go so if I hover over this and
click this all that animation and this
hover is coming directly from angular
material so it works alright so at this
point it's probably worth developing
some muscle memory and also
understanding how to look at the
material official documentation so that
you can go on and really understand how
to use a specific component that I'm not
going to be covering because we're just
gonna do a few here get your feet wet
understand how the docs work and you'll
be able to you know pretty much do
everything you want with material on
your own alright so let's go ahead and
I'm going to come back here let's go to
our let's see yeah I think we'll start
off with looking at the documentation
actually so let me come over here
material de angular IO and we're going
to click on components now you can see
this is structured in such a way that it
gives you quick access to all the stuff
over here so let's click on for instance
the I think we'll try navigation so
let's say we want to integrate a tool
click on toolbar and we'll see these
three tabs up here and so each component
is structured in the same exact format
so you have an overview contains you
just with basic information and
potential possibilities an API which
shows you the name that you need to
import and in our case that that's in
the material dot module at TS file and
also the directives that shows you down
here and then also the examples so
they'll give you just various examples
and if you click on this view source
you'll see the HTML associated with
these examples down here along with the
typescript which gets defined in your
component class and a lot of them don't
have any custom type script some of them
that are interactive will show you
actual code within this section down
here and then the CSS if there's any
special CSS that we need access to ok so
simple enough so let's go ahead and try
adding at this toolbar based on this
documentation so if I go to our API
we'll grab just this right here we're
going to go back to our material where'd
that go right here and we're going to
add a comma and then we're also going to
edit here and here
alright so we'll save that and next
we'll visit our app component HTML we're
going to get rid of this and I'm going
to paste in again don't get mad at a lot
of people get really mad when I paste in
like a bulk of HTML don't worry it's
right in that written tutorial so visit
the link down there so right here I'm
gonna paste in this it's very simple so
we simply have our matte toolbar
directive color is primary we also use
the mat toolbar row and then we put a
span for kind of like a logo area called
my material this being class example
spacer and then three buttons alright
now in order for this to work when you
may be wondering where did I get this
HTML from well it actually comes from
that documentation I just edited it
slightly based on our needs so for
instance we could examples we'll see
it's actually very
to this I just I didn't need three rows
obviously and the CSS we also need to
put this in so I'm going to copy that
and we're going to go to our app
component CSS save that and now make
sure you all of your files are saved and
if we go back here
voila there we go
so let's go down and let's also add a
few more so let's create I mean
something like in a form where someone
can put in I like in a text area text
area input or text input field given the
answer click a button it'll show a
progress spinner from material and then
it will show the result very simple but
it shows you how to work with multiple
components and also in relation and tie
them in together with the logic of your
component class so the first thing we'll
do is go back to our material module and
we're going to use one called the Matt
input module and again this all comes
from the documentation let me show you
real quickly that's not it the hell are
you doing there we go so like I wanted
an input click on input go to API BAM
right there and it shows you this is
what its gonna look like very slick
inputs here all right so I'm also going
to use a progress spinner that's also in
the documentation on the Left bar you
can find it there and then also a card
module so anga are not angular but
material cards are huge in just material
design in general so we have these three
right up here that I just added now I'm
going to copy just right from there
that's beginning comma paste it there
and there and there we go so let's save
that and then next we're going to go to
our app component and just beneath this
stuff we're going to add some more you
know what I'll be nice and I'll do this
from scratch so we have our matte card
so we're going to contain the entire
warm inside of a card so then we're
gonna put a mat form field this will
hold the input it's gonna be Matt input
we're gonna use two-way data-binding
three ngmodel why do I say Iman oh it's
not okay
sorry a ng module it's not module oh man
I need some coffee
so we're basically if you don't know
what this is by the way
basically it's two-way and that it
communicates the property from the
component class to the template and also
from the template to the component class
if you're kind of still confused based
on that answer I check out the free
angular 5 course at course cetera
placeholder who has the best dev
tutorials I think we know who that
answer is hopefully all right and there
to put a line break here and then I'm
gonna put in a button of Matt raised
button again you can find all that stuff
it gives you different options in the
button section of the documentation
we're gonna have a click event once
somebody clicks on it we're gonna call a
method called show answer answer me and
then finally at the bottom here we're
just going to show a Matt - spinner and
we're gonna use CSS style or property
binding so style dot display that refers
to the CSS display rule set or not rule
set put property and we're going to bind
it to a property that we haven't yet
defined called show spinner which is
going to be a true or false
boolean if it's true then we set display
to block otherwise which is what that
coin is we said it's none and that's it
now we also want to show the result or
the answer so we're going to put a new
matt card we're going to say ng-if
equals answer display this is another
property that we will do fine put an h1
through interpolation we put answer
display
and then comma you're damn right alright
so we'll save that and next because if
we if we try to use this by the way it's
I'm going to show you it's going to
error and it's no big deal
can't bind to ng model since it's not a
known property of input so the reason
that happens is because in order to use
ng model we have to go to our app module
right there TS file and we have to
import the forms module so we'll do that
right there and then add forms module as
an import now if we go back there we go
awesome awesome options it's not going
to work yet so let's go back real
quickly we'll go to our let's see your
app component TS file ok all right so
this is fairly straightforward stops
gonna be real basic we're gonna define
three different properties at the top so
first we have our answer which is what
the ng model was I looking at which is
we're gonna make that a string we're
gonna have answer display property that
we referenced and then also a show
spinner of boolean which is true or
false and set it to false initially so
when the app loads we don't want to show
it all right and then we're just gonna
do show answer which is the method that
we reference on the click event we're
gonna say once it's clicked Show spinner
equals true and then to emulate you know
like an API call like if it's saving
this to a database somewhere or
persisting in or whatever then we're
going to I to have a set timeout so set
timeout
we'll just emulate a little bit of a
delay so we can actually see the spinner
so in here we just put in this dot
answer display equals this dot answer
and then this dot show spinner equals
false
and then in the second argument we put
in a delay I'll say two seconds or 2,000
milliseconds and guess what that is all
it is all right so let's save that and
give it a go
damn thing better work all right I think
it's yeah it's all ready to go
I heard someone who'd be sure of course
I'm gonna answer it with the correct
answer course set row answer me
oh yeah kind of looks ugly just sitting
there and there you go
course set your oh you're damn right and
this here is technically a material
angular app albeit you know pretty
crappy app and it doesn't really do
anything much but that's it I hope
hopefully you can probably have a lot of
confidence now going forward you know
integrating your material in your
angular 5 app all right if you enjoyed
this make sure you subscribe here like
it leave a comment I don't really get
many comments on my videos and it sucks
I sit there crying all the time I don't
I look at other people other competitors
and there's like 100 comments I put the
hell man so anyhow
also check out corset or calm and I'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
