calm today we're going to step back into
blender and we're going to create the
image that you just saw and it's just
going to be kind of like a cool neuron
brain neuron connection sort of seen
it's only going to take 25 minutes total
we're going to get everything started
and finished today and we're also going
to bring the end result into Photoshop
just to make some quick adjustments all
right so if you want access to the final
project file that's available for free
in the description below this video here
on YouTube and also if you haven't yet
check out design course comm and
subscribe here on YouTube alright let's
get started ok so if you're new to
blender basically the way you select
objects is to right-click them and to
delete you know you can hit the Delete
key or the X key and to move around in
the viewport you just use your middle
mouse button and to zoom up you use your
scroll wheel and to pan you hold shift
and your middle mouse button alright so
basically I'm going to get started here
I want to get too much into over viewing
this so if you're new I basically just
follow along and you'll start learning
things as you go alright so basically I
for this we went to delete our cube and
hit shift a or go to add and we will
choose UV sphere alright so the first
thing I want to change is by default I
believe it's 32 segments make sure it's
16 segments right here I and everything
else is the same right here so what we
want to do is go into edit mode so you
can go over here and select edit mode or
just hit the tab key which is what I'll
do so that will switch back and forth
between edit and object mode so in edit
mode we can just basically edit the
object so what we want to do is to
select the face so by default you know
we can select the vertices with this
mode we can select sides with this mode
by right-clicking and then we have face
or here alright so basically obviously
the the inner shape of the neuron is is
a sphere obviously so we want to create
basically kind of just tentacles that
come out of it now but by default if I
pull this out that could work
okay but if we take this over here and
we change to connected what happens is
if we make any alterations it will
affect however much we want it to so you
use your middle mouse button while
holding the left click and our left
mouse button and just dragging out so
I'm going to be doing this quite a bit
so you know you don't have to be you
know have to match everything up exactly
as I have it so don't worry about that
all right so I'm just going to pull out
a few of these initially so I'm going to
right click pull out actually maybe I'll
choose one that's a little bit lower and
right click and pull out and you can
always rotate this as well so if you
rotate it because not all of them will
be obviously coming straight out so we
can pull this one up alright maybe come
back here
maybe do one down here you can always
hit the G key as well for move and G got
here maybe come down here and just
select one G alright that looks good so
far
alright so now what we want to do is
basically extrude each one of these out
quite a bit so what we'll do is take
this first one we'll work with this and
what we want to do is hit the e key for
extrude and then just start slightly
modifying these I in terms of shape and
also size so the hit s scale down just
tad bit pity again
yes and just do this a number of times
basically and you want these things to
really kind of shoot out and at this
point also I'm going to come over here
we'll go to our object modifiers and add
the subdivision surface take this up to
three all right and that basically just
smooths everything out all right we'll
take this one do the same thing and you
notice how it makes it live basically it
kind of just turns it into a soft shape
if you hit ctrl R or command R you can
really affect that portion so if we go
back here select this face run edge mode
hit E maybe s scale it down right back
up real quick
all right and basically you just have to
keep on doing this which I know it's a
little bit tedious scale us down
just hitting control are
II several times I'm going to basically
pause this and I want you to continue on
doing the same process for however many
eye portions that you drug out here so
I'm going to pause this and then we'll
see what I would come up with okay so
basically this is what I've come up with
and what I've really done is really take
these and pull them out when it comes to
the last extrusion so basically you know
if you want to do the same and you
probably should take that face and just
zoom out rule 4 and hit E and just
really pull those out alright alright so
now at this stage let's go ahead and
switch back to object mode hitting tab
and then what we want to do is I
duplicate these or replicate them so
just take this hit ctrl or shift D
rather and you can hit Y and then maybe
move it along the x-axis and at this
point it would be a good idea to
probably I go ahead and set up the
camera but also hit R as well because
you don't want this to look too similar
and RZ alright so I'm going to hit shift
D as well another time over here
adjust these positions alright so let's
set up the camera the cameras right here
if we hit zero on your number pad we'll
see what that sees hit the letter n as a
nose and specify lock camera to view hit
and again to hide that and also what I
want to do is let's let let's switch
over here to cycles render and also
let's go over to with the camera
selected so you have to click on camera
right there and click on this tab right
here this will let us basically create a
depth of field so there's a couple steps
that we have to do first in order to
achieve that so first we have to know
the name of this object this is going to
be our focus object so if you right
click on it I will see that the sphere
so it's called sphere and then we have 0
1 0 2 down there and so let's go back to
the camera and down here for the focus
for the depth under depth of field focus
object is going to be sphere and then
over here we have the radius size and we
want to set that at 0.1 and that
basically controls how blurry things
become eye so let's also set up the
ruled portion and we'll select use notes
and I'm going to go ahead and just
left-click drag down this portion and
we're going to switch this top portion
to and the note editor and we're going
to click right here on this world icon
and now if you use your mouse wheel to
scroll up basically over here anything
any changes are reflected here in what's
called the node editor ok and the node
editor gives us kind of just finer
control so what we want to choose for
the world which we can do this either
right here or in here is for the color
select mix and as you can see it adds
that and you could have done the same
thing just by
shift a and then adding that over there
and then we want to give this a texture
so let's go ahead and hit shift a and we
want to select this one right here which
I'm not even going to try to pronounce
so I so what we want to do is take this
and connect it to the mix FAC value
right there all right and if we switch
this to rendered we'll see kind of real
quickly what everything looks like now
these values right here is what we want
to or what we want to change so this
first one we're going to make black so
now you can see kind of what this
texture does and then the one beneath it
we're going to make it kind of a little
blue but pretty dark you're right around
there so the hex for that is 0 0 2 e 3 E
all right I need to get my contacts in
so anyhow I also we're going to make
this scale around 4.2 all right so
that's good for there now what we want
to do is real quick switch to
compositing and real quickly if you just
hit render
and we'll see here you select this
middle one and click use nodes will see
basically I these two nodes and what we
want to do is add in a D focus so if we
hit shift a and I believe it's filter D
focus we'll put that right in between
those and connections are automatically
made and we want to specify use Z buffer
and so if I let me real quickly hit ctrl
and the up arrow key or command in the
up arrow key and hover over this view
that will basically give us it will
maximize the current panel but basically
we can see that the focus is kind of
working here so I that step of enabling
Z buffer is essential so let me pick
ctrl and down to get back all right so a
couple other adjustments are max blur as
we can see this portion is a little bit
blurry so if you change this from 16 to
zero it makes this in focus but
everything else else out there I looks a
little bit better alright so let's
switch back here to the default view and
let's join up these well actually we can
go ahead and select this object right
here by right-clicking it and we'll see
I basically it doesn't currently have a
texture so let's come over here and make
sure we're selecting this sphere we'll
go ahead and hit new alright so
basically if we want to get this working
correctly we have to play around with
these nodes so I'm going to zoom out a
little bit so let's go ahead and hit the
Delete key on this diffuse layer and
let's go ahead and add a mix shader' so
shift a we want to put in mix shader'
right there connect it right here and
then we want to add
shader trance make sure I have this
right yeah transparent and then hit
shift a and then add a glossy which is
right there all right
so we'll connect this to the bottom one
alright so we can see it's kind of
starting to if we hit control up arrow
look kind of interesting alright and we
want to make this color for the glossy
color that's a pretty bright kind of
like a turquoise ish kind of color it's
color code is zero zero
d 4e 7 if you want to be specific
alright and we're going to make the
roughest roughness ad this set before I
did it story out two for two of course
you can play with all these settings and
the FAC value I'm going to change to 0.7
all right and then we want to give it
some texture so we're going to give it a
noise texture and add it to the
displacement so shift a texture noise
add it right there and then the values
if i zoom in here we're going to make
this scale 168 we're going to make the
detail 2.66 and then distortion we're
going to leave that zero all right so
now we can see it's starting to look
pretty interesting let me zoom out here
alright so control and the down arrow
key alright so now I'm going to right
click just right here and hit join area
and join this to the top okay
now let's apply this basically to the
other two objects that we have that
texture and so if we click back here
we'll see it's called we can rename it
real quick and we'll just call this
you're on right-click this choose that
and then right-click this one and choose
that neuron as well alright so I'm going
to move these around just a little bit
more so I'm going to hit G I'm going to
add another one so I'm going to switch
back here to solid hit shift D R and if
you can avoid it you want you don't want
any of them kicked to basically I to end
where it's visible so take this one
again and one more time I think will I
hit s as well you can scale these things
just to create some difference all right
so it's up to you how you know you want
to play with these things so I now what
I want to do is kind of add a light
source so we can add an emission so if
we go to pitch I'm going to hit 0 just
to get out of this view real quick
if we hit shift a oops not shift D sorry
shift a we're going to add a UV sphere
and real quick we're going to give it a
new material and we're going to make it
any mission if I can find it there we go
and for that emission going to make the
color kind of the same color as before
that we just use or specified and I'm
going to move it behind I'm going to hit
0 just to get our camera view basically
behind out of view this portion right
here and I'm also going to move my
camera view around just a tad bit okay
and then the emission strength I'm just
going to try 34 now and I'm going to
real quickly go to render just to see
what things are looking like and I
forgot I have a transfer
so I'm going to move this off-screen I
don't want to be behind so if I just hit
die G move this off-screen here all
right and real quickly I'm going to
switch over here to the render settings
kind of just I do this for every single
tutorial basically so if we go to
sampling change this preview to 100 now
obviously the higher it is the better
it's going to look but the longer it's
going to take so if we change I'm I
think I'm going to use around 1500 for
my actual render the preview is whatever
is showing right here when we make
changes all right and then I let's see
here also I'm going to come down at
performance for our tiles I'm going to
change from 64 to 256 all right and
that's pretty good trying to make sure
also I'm going to change the resolution
here to 1280 720 and 100% otherwise only
it does half of that dimension all right
so real quickly I'm going to actually
that it kind of it looks a little bit
too empty here so let me right click
this one switch back to solid hit G this
one I may move a little bit closer
I'm just going to basically play around
with these and trying to select this one
back there there we go
all right and if I yeah I'm going to go
ahead and yeah first before I'm just
going to hit rendered view just to see
what everything looks like so it's not
going to render anything it's just going
to only going to render this portion
right here inside all right so I'm going
to come up here and hit render and this
is going to take a little time because
I'm at 1500 samples so I'm going to
pause it and then we'll come back
Oh real quickly I forgot one thing
that's very important I forgot to switch
the GPU I this makes it go like a
hundred thousand times faster
practically so I'm just going to hit
escape there and I'm going to render
that again and it's going to go much
faster so the graphics processor is much
faster than going through the CPU so let
me go ahead and pause that again okay so
this is basically what it came up with I
you could probably could have created
probably a few more of these and set
them off back in the background a little
bit further but that's okay I get the
idea so I wanted to make a couple
adjustments to this now you could do
this in the compositor I'm going to just
take it into Photoshop and do it there
so what I want to do is save this so hit
f3 I'm just going to change this to a
JPEG down here 100% quality I'm just
going to call this neuron save as image
okay and then in Photoshop I'm going to
open that up okay and basically I can't
to add some kind of just like little
light pulses they're just I don't know
what the heck they're for and it makes
it look interesting so control-shift-n
for a new layer here and I'm going to
take the brush tool and a size of
initially let's say around 60 all right
and then we're going to make it white
for the foreground and then we'll just
click a few times
times in different areas and also we're
going to change the layer blend mode not
going to leave it like that to overlay
so if we come over here and change that
now we can see it's not so prominent and
you can go over them if you want them to
stand out a little bit more
and you can also change the size of
these if needed for some of the smaller
portions
I don't know about that one turn up the
size just a little bit
alright alright so that looks pretty
good and then I also want to come over
here if you don't see this right here
you can just go to window adjustments
and add AI let's see here
hue and saturation as well as brightness
and we can play with this just a little
bit
and this isn't necessary I but you can
see we can you know this is all stuff
that you can do in the compositor with
exception to the brush thing that I just
added but yeah once you get to something
that you you know a hue that you like I
think this is pretty good right here all
right I think I like that as an result
so yeah just a real quick tutorial on
how to create something that looks
pretty cool so I hope you enjoyed it I'm
going to make this eye blender file also
available for download so if you wanted
for whatever reason to download that you
can download that there from a design
course comm just real quick free
registration is required and so if you
haven't yet check out design course comm
and subscribe here on YouTube alright
I'll see you tomorrow with a new video
all right goodbye
