calm today we're going to begin a
four-part video tutorial that will span
over four days that will be focused
around a photoshop CC photo manipulation
alright so the title of this is going to
be if war is hell and I'm going to show
you a preview right now
and so that's the image so of course
again this is going to be all done
entirely in photoshop CC and the project
files if you want access to the actual
source the source file that I'm working
on their available for free and
description below this video I'm also
going to be linking all of the actual
resource images that we're going to be
using I so yeah I check out design
course com if you haven't yet and
subscribe here on YouTube ok so let's go
ahead and get started by going to file
new and we'll just call this war poster
although it's not really in the
dimensions of a poster I'm just going to
stick with I the width of 1280 by 720
resolution 72 now this you would want to
be a lot higher if you did want to
actually make this something you could
get it printed but just for the purpose
of this tutorial we're going to keep it
at a web resolution of 72 background
contents you can leave whatever you have
default alright so because of my
resolution it's only at sixty six point
seven percent when I'm filled in here so
i'll be switching back and forth between
this and a hundred percent so for the
background color i'm just going to
choose a color that's almost black but
not quite so 14 14 14 for the hex code
and i'm just going to fill this in and
we can rename the layer to background
but there's going to be so many layers
are probably not going to rename all of
them as I probably should but anyhow so
basically the first image that I want to
use is right here and this is linked in
the description along with all the other
assets that we're going to be using here
so basically I'm going to use the large
1600 version so if I right click and
just copy image and come back here and
paste this in here with ctrl V will see
that we have this large sort of army you
know picture photograph so what we want
to do is I'm not going to bother cutting
everybody out individually that would
take forever or going around the heads
and everything so what I want to do is
just quickly take the eraser tool with a
brush we'll see how big this is
roughly right around here I guess 120
and we'll just get rid of the top
portion and it's not going to really
matter if they're the top row the their
heads I guess I are cut off too much so
and that's because they're going to be
really set into the background quite a
bit and they're all so we're going to
adjust the EPS we're going to adjust the
hue and saturation and I the brightness
and darkness as well alright so I'm
going to zoom up here to a hundred
percent and now i'm going to rename this
layer here and call it I army BG as in
background and we'll go ahead and click
this if it's not there just go to window
and adjustments and this comes up so
with that layer selected will select the
brightness and contrast and you want to
click this button if you only want it to
affect that specific layer of army BG so
we'll be doing that most of the time and
I'm going to going to shrink this up a
little bit and basically we also want to
go to image well first we can select
army BG image adjustments and desaturate
and then we'll come back here for
brightness and we're going to take the
brightness right in right around
negative 73 and then contrast around 89
just for now alright so I'm going to
close that and I'm going to zoom out all
right so now what we basically want to
do is take out our second image to work
with and that is right here alright so
we'll take this here at the 1024
resolution and copy that
and then I'll paste this in really want
to work with this one that's like a
double it's like duplicator for some
reason I take the pen tool with the path
selected now I'm going to show you
initially how to do this and then I'm
going to pause as I finish it because it
would just take way too long or actually
not pause but I'm going to speed up so
basically the pen tool with pass elected
and all you're going to do is just go
around by left-clicking and dragging
some of the times depending on you know
the shape that you're working with and
just keep on going until you get all the
way around the group of individuals and
so as you see you can see I'm not being
one hundred percent perfect and that's
okay because ultimately they're going to
be real small in the actual image and
you're not going to be able to really
tell any specific imperfections
especially because we're all I not
working at a high resolution alright so
I'm going to speed this portion of the
video up
you
alright so I'm going to right-click and
basically after you're done I mean you
connect the last the first stop with
last dot or anchor point rather right
click make selection make sure this is
all even or equal and hit OK and mine
inverts the selection it selects
everything outside of if that happens to
you just hit ctrl shift and I and hit
ctrl-c to copy them and then delete them
and I'm going to zoom out by holding all
and using my scroll wheel and then paste
them in all right so I'm going to save a
copy of them i'm also going to rename
them here two soldiers one and I'm also
going to duplicate them just to save a
backup just in case I need to start over
with them which it's always a good idea
to just save a copy so I'm going to hit
ctrl T scale them down all right and
maybe roughly right around here so that
the move tool hit apply and then we
going to go to image adjustments
desaturate alright so basically all of
our images we're going to be
desaturating for the most part i and
then we also want to come in here zoom
up to one hundred percent and we want to
take out our adjustment layers give it a
brightness and contrast and the contrast
mine second we make sure you select this
just so it selects that layer only and
just turn up the contrast a bit
brightness maybe down just a tad bit so
negative 20 and 62 all right close that
out alright so I let's move on
we'll go ahead and select use this image
next so I'm going to use the yeah the
large of the 700 x 4 32 right click copy
image paste that in there and then once
again we gotta take our pen tool with
the path and just start going around
everybody so once again I'm going to
basically speed this up like crazy and
I'll see you in a second
you
alright and basically i left that guy
out you could you know whatever you want
to do and I basically went to that type
of selection so we'll right-click and
make selection okay ctrl shift I and
copy that deselect ctrl D and then
delete that layer zoom out here face
these guys in there and obviously
because of I how old this image is a lot
of not a lot of work but basically we
were like to make quite a bit of
adjustments I'm also going to get rid of
that portion right here right click make
selection and ctrl shift I hit delete
and we're also going to be scaling these
guys down quite a bit as well we kind of
want these over here to be the same on
the same horizontal path so these guys
are going to be all the way over here
okay and just right around here and I'm
also going to use the new tool which is
called perspective warp and basically
these you see how the perspective is
it's not really aligning correctly with
these guys so the way you can kind of
quickly change the perspective is to
select the front people right here and
then left-click and drag and select a
portion around those individuals in the
back and make the adjustments just very
slightly like this and then select warp
and then bring this down just a little
bit hit apply so that slightly kind of
gives you I allows you to change their
perspective basically just very slightly
and if it's a tad bit if it worked it a
little bit that's an internal problem
because we're really going to be
adjusting these guys quite a bit so
we'll do that right now so
let me take I will rename this to
soldiers too and we'll go ahead and get
our adjustment layers out so brightness
contrast we up a lot make sure you
select this as well we also went to
image adjustments desaturate them go
back to our adjustment layer and let me
zoom out here okay so there's still
there's not still not enough contrast
you can add I levels here let me click
that to make sure it's pointing down to
just this layer and let me drop this
down and you can begin to play with
these levels right here
I'm going to zoom up all right and I'm
going to close this and I'm going to get
rid of some of that white stuff in the
middle now you can take the magic wand
tool depending on what your tolerance is
it may just be faster College is 50
contiguous turn it on again we're not
working at high resolution so I it's not
that big of a deal all right so i also
want to yeah go ahead and take a new
layer ctrl shift n make sure it's a
clipping mask right here hit OK and
we'll take the brush tool with a soft
feather to brush so hard 20 sighs we'll
try around 180 with a black color
selected
just up like around there all right so
I'm going to zoom out all right that's
our image so far I mean Abby I will
definitely probably adjust these two
individuals a little bit more to make
them look better but I want to move on
just to some different areas so now what
I want to do is add in some clouds
beneath everything well with exception
to the background so I'm going to hit
ctrl shift end for a new layer will call
this clouds one and we'll take the brush
tool and I've linked I cloud brushes in
the description of this video on youtube
so you can download those and get those
install it's very simple you just load
brushes right here or you could just
double click on them depending on your
version of Photoshop once you extract
them it'll just automatically load in
right here okay so I now what I want to
do is take the foreground color all
right around here I'd say 59 59 59 hit
OK and I'm just going to experiment with
some different clouds just to see you
know what this kind of looks like all
right I'm a scale that down just a tad
bit sat 14 i'm going to try 1,200 all
right the right around there and then
create a new layer ctrl shift to end
clouds too and you don't have to exactly
use you know whatever i'm using in terms
of the cloud brushes anything will work
almost all right see about putting one
up here now new layer ctrl shift n ops 3
that doesn't look good and so really
this is about just experimenting
basically
now
hmm having a hard time here finding
something I like
that's a little bit better and then
we're going to make some adjustments of
course to these so select our first one
I'm going to take the eraser tool oops
get rid of anything that shows beneath
or underneath our back background
soldiers back there alright so I'm going
to take I clouds one and I'm going to
hit ctrl shift n for a new layer and
make it a clipping mask alright so let's
take our large feather brush and maybe
not that big all right right around
there take a red color select overlay
for the blend mode alright and do that
to clouds to as well I'm going a little
bit lighter or smaller oops you don't
want it to be too much in certain places
due to clouds three as well I'll also
change that to overlay and then change
this to overlay as well
okay right around there is pretty decent
and I'm going to take clouds one take
the eraser tool and then just kind of
delete or remove some of this just so
they're not too too prominent same thing
with their all right so I so far so good
I think this is going to be a good place
to just kind of stopped it and I then
tomorrow we'll pick up with continuing
on with this photo manipulation alright
I will see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
