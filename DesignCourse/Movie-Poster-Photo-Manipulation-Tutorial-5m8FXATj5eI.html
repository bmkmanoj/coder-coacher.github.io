today is January 21st with our 21st
consecutive video of the year and we got
an exciting one today we're going to be
doing an awesome photo manipulation in
the form of a fake movie poster and it's
going to be titled status nightmare so
what is the status status is basically a
worshipper of government and this
nickname was basically given to them
from the libertarian slash anarcho slash
voluntary as communities are basically
people who are advocates of stateless
societies and usually when you put forth
the idea of a society without
governments the status will say but what
about the roads who will build the roads
people obviously so this is just a
friendly jabot then we're gonna take an
image of a beautiful road and we're
gonna just destroy it completely it's
gonna look like a status Nightmares a
bomb is going to be zombify it's gonna
be awesome but anyhow we're gonna do
this in Adobe Photoshop CC and of course
the project files are dip available for
free in the description below this video
so if you haven't yet check out design
course comm we have awesome videos daily
videos and I please subscribe here on
youtube if you like this alright let's
get started go to file new and we're
gonna change this to our graphic 806 by
1080 width and height and that's a good
image size basically for Facebook and
how it displays in the in a person's
wall so I background contents gonna
leave a transparent and everything else
is good I'm gonna hit okay I'm gonna hit
control H if you if your greatest
showing up you can just hit ctrl H to
get rid of that or hide it rather and
then we're gonna import our actual Road
image so go into the link I that's an
inscription of this video on YouTube and
click on that and you'll get here this
person has offered this image for free
and they do have kind of Terms of Use in
their journal alright so just click
download over there I'm going to right
click copy that image or you could save
it to your desktop and we'll switch back
to photos
and paste that in it's gonna be very
large all right so control tea I was
gonna hold shift and alt Mouse scaling
down all right got to figure out maybe
exactly where I want this to end up
maybe just a tad bit larger I'm
basically looking at the horizon all
right and then hit select the move tool
to apply and the first thing I want to
do is everything's going to be black and
white I with this layer but I do want to
maintain the yellow eyes stripes here so
that way we can kind of stick out a
little bit all right so I'm gonna take
the pen tool and I'm just going to I
make it path and real quickly it's not
going to be 100% perfect but that
doesn't really matter we just want to
follow the shape of the lines here so
just gotta go all the way up and come
back down
and then we go in the middle and real
quickly just kind of go up right about
there
all right so I'm going to right-click
and make selection hit okay mines
inverting it it may not do it to you I
but select inverse and that way it's
only selecting this the Alliance hit
ctrl C to copy that and then ctrl V to
paste it so now we kind of got two
copies of the yellow stripes here so now
I want to do for this is give it an
adjustment layer so if you click on over
here we go ahead and click on hue and
saturation and also click on this little
icon which will only constrict maintain
it on that layer beneath it and then
take the saturation down and take the
lightness down just a little bit alright
and close that out I also want another
adjustment layer and this is going to be
brightness and contrast click on that
alright that looks pretty good right
around there with these values
oops axe and click on that right on
there okay now what I want to do real
quick I take these three layers I'm
gonna duplicate those so I ctrl shift D
okay or you can just right click and
duplicate layers and I gotta get rid of
the top two here put this back at the
bottom and I'm just gonna save this as a
as a copy basically just for later use
in the tutorial alright so now what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna get rid of these
lines these white stripes here so we can
use this tool which is over here the
clone stamp tool and we want it the
hardness to be zero and the size right
around here will work at 85 pixels and
what we do is with this layer selected
is hold the Alt key and then left click
right here just underneath and then when
we do that it'll just copy what is
beneath it and we can adjust this I'm
gonna start over here real quick and do
the same thing alright so now I want to
make it smaller in diameter as we go
down further so I'm holding all in
readjusting the point where it's copying
or cloning okay
you see you could see when you do that
it lets you know what that little
crosshair where it is copying basically
so it could zoom up here to a hundred
percent all right
all right so zooming out here now what I
want to do is kind of add like a dark or
black gradient over here so I'm gonna
hit ctrl shift and hit okay and take our
gradient tool change the foreground to
black and make sure your preset up here
is I the foreground to transparent now
it's gonna hold shift I think right
around there will work pretty well all
right so now what I want to do is I did
see an area up here that I did not like
that was cut off so I'm gonna fix that
real quickly and I'm going to I'm gonna
hide that layer and then take our pen
tool but the path option selected I
should have sumed up initially when I
did that right click make selection hit
OK shift I to invert copy ctrl C and
then we're gonna come back up here turn
that on and then paste that and then
merge those alright now that's better
okay alright so now I what I want to do
is get a custom brush i well not not one
that i created but one that i downloaded
and that's provided in the end of the
description of this video you can get
that brush and it is right now i have a
lot of presets here so i may have to
find nice and it is sorry about that the
pause real quick DVRs started playing a
video in the background and is this one
right here and it's really big i you
know once you get that loaded it's in
the link below in the description i once
you if you extract that file that you
download from the site all you have to
do to load it is either double click in
but if it doesn't show up you can just
use this area right here to hit load
brushes alright so now we have that I'm
gonna hit file new and I'm gonna choose
just 3000 by 3000
hit okay and then I'm just going to
click once here and make sure it is
black hair and your foreground so now
I'm gonna hit control a and then ctrl C
to copy that selection and then actually
gonna leave this up alright so now what
I want to do is go ahead and paste it
into a new layer so ctrl shift and for a
new layer and then paste it control V
now we see it's really big so we're
gonna adjust it a little bit ctrl T and
I'm also holding alt when I do this so
we can make it look like it's kind of
going along with the road it's like the
Move tool hit apply and then what I want
to do is take the clone stamp tool and
just copy some more of these so that
they flow up the street and hardness I'm
going to take at a hundred maybe right
there
then what I'm going to do is take the
selection right around here
hit ctrl T and drag it down just a
little bit alright and then I'm gonna do
that one more time just like that
take that selection up here select move
tool that control T hold shift and scale
down all right so all right so far so
good
now what I want to do is right click and
then duplicate this layer I'm going to
drop it beneath that and go to image
adjustments and then invert not invert
invert and ooh that was an accident
it didn't do the correct portion that's
because I hit ctrl H I still had that
portion selected let me just delete that
real quick all right now control a or
make sure nothing is selected by ctrl D
duplicate this take it back down to the
bottom image adjustments invert and then
just hit the down arrow key once and
then let's zoom up here to a hundred
percent then we're gonna go ahead and
take this down a lot the opacity right
around I would say 13% would be good and
that way it gives a little bit of depth
alright so far so good all right now
what I want to do is just take those
layers ctrl e to merge them we'll call
this cracks and now what I want to do is
we're going to take all these layers
right here and just duplicate them ctrl
shift D hit ctrl G to group them and I'm
just going to hide them down here just
for future use now what we want to do
I'm going to take all these layers and
merge them all right so now everything
is on its own layer with exception to
this gradient up here now what I'm going
to do is take the pen tool and cut out
certain portions of these blocks that
are well defined and then we're going to
move them a little bit just to make it
look like this isn't you know a smooth
Street and like we have significant
cracking in the actual Street so real
quickly
all right right click make selection and
I'm just hitting ctrl shift I to invert
if that's an issue with you uh and then
I'm gonna to hit ctrl C delete oh one
second
I'm gonna make the another layer real
quick in the background actually let me
hit ctrl V to paste that in control
shift down for a new layer
we'll make this black alright now we'll
take this cracked layer that we have
here hit ctrl T slightly move it just
like that it's like move that pull that
move tool and hit apply
control shift then for a new layer and
we want to make sure that's a clipping
mask hit okay take the one second
somebody is at my door Wow and that was
the police what the hell they open up
the door the door is actually open and
my wife left with the kids and the door
had gin fully latch it and it was
hanging wide open it's like 14 degrees
outside and one of the neighbors called
the police thinking I got broken into
insane okay now that I'm ready to do
that I would take the brush tool
absolutely ridiculous and take the app
make sure hardness is zero sighs yeah
I'll make it a little bit bigger we want
to make it look like there's some depth
so we're just i creating some shading
right there and now we got to do this a
bunch of more times with these cracks I
know it sucks but I'm gonna do a couple
more times just to I you know so you're
comfortable with this and then I will
speed up the video to basically save
some time because this is gonna be
repetitive just go along this crack here
right click make selection hit okay
hitting ctrl shift I to invert copy
delete paste ctrl T will go this way and
then
control-shift-n create clipping mask
okay so let me see go control one
alright that looks good so far okay so
at this point I think you get the idea
of what exactly this is gonna take all
right so I'm gonna speed up this video
and it's gonna show me just you know
knocking these things out one by one
all right and then just one more right
here and we will end that process and
right click make selection hit okay oops
are you kidding me Wow
that was a disaster yeah okay I ctrl C
delete control V yeah I feel like that
Joseph and for a new layer and then
finally just alright cool
alright it looks pretty cool let me I
just zoom out here a little bit just so
we can see that a little bit better okay
so now at this point I want to add some
fire okay like as if there's a fire
coming up I don't know maybe from Hell
or something okay what we want to do I'm
going to focus on this area right here
and go ahead and basically use custom
brush tools to create some fires and
flames so basically first what we need
to do is before we get to that is kind
of create a shape here that will outline
where we see the fire coming up out of
this whole little thing right here so
I'm gonna zoom up alright so the way we
do this is very important i we just want
to go create an area on where the fire
will only be able to basically be
visible so we're gonna go through these
cracks so let's just come up around here
you're not gonna come down here
following all the way around okay so now
at this point we can zoom out and just
go all the way around like this
okay now what we want to do is drag
everything here to the top and let's
organize these layers a little bit right
here these are all different cracked
layers so I'm going to ctrl G to group
those we'll just call this eye cracks
and all right for this we're going to
take the direct selection tool right
here get rid of the fill we're going to
come over here or double click the right
side and we're going to change the
blending options here blend interior
effects as group and then take off blend
clipped layers as group and nothing
really changes but the reason you have
to do this we're have I create a new
layer request control-shift-n
use clipping mask right there hit OK now
would be a good point to download the
brushes I for fire so I've linked those
in the bottom of this video in the
description so download that get those
imported and we'll focus on and see
which one we want to use because they
provide a variety and I've paused it
just real quick just so I could find
which one I want to use it's right here
640 and that's just the size of the
brush and I'm and so now what we want to
do is take the foreground color make it
a color that's almost red but not quite
it's like ff3 c00 is the color code hit
OK and then just right around here go
ahead and click once okay so now that
kind of created it cool like fiery
effect it's it's not quite there we have
a lot more work to do and it did hit our
clipping mask area so I can just take
the pen the eraser tool rather and just
delete that the edges that are visible
alright so now I'm going to create
another layer and a
make sure it's clipping mask as well and
we'll go ahead and experiment more with
these different brushes I think that was
the same one yeah there's all our okay
so the all these brushes you can really
sit here and you know experiment quite a
bit now I'm just hitting ctrl Z to undo
those and so we can also play with the
blend modes I like that so I'm just
going to keep on building this fire
effect up as much as I can maybe right
around there and there's also a brush
that really gives it's a dynamic brush
that gives you good looking flames and
that's right here it's the size is 81 so
I'm going to create a new layer make it
a clipping mask and I want these to be
like yellowish well actually yellow so
every time you click it's changing what
it's doing and you could go like that
but that's crazy so I'm just clicking
once I just to see so as you can see
it's really giving us quite a bit to
work with and it may take a few times
control-t and you can actually rotate
that if you find one that you like
change the blend mode yeah yeah the
color I don't I don't really like I
chose way too yellow of a color so if I
go to image adjustments hue/saturation
there drop that down just a little bit
okay and if you want to add some more
you can definitely do so I take this
down here yeah that's fine right there
alright and then what I want to do is go
ahead and create a new layer this time
it won't be a clipping mask will take a
large feathered circular brush and we're
gonna choose yellow or yeah and then
just click in the middle once control T
scale that down move it over here it's
like the move tool it apply and then
change the blend mode here I like how
that looks alright and it just kind of
makes it more of a red fire type look
and also I do see that issue over here
real quick so I'm gonna go through each
of these layers right there okay
all right and I also want to go ahead
and create another layer up here with a
clipping mask make the color black for a
foreground yeah kind of like that I
think that looks a little bit better and
then also down here create a new layer
not a clipping mask though take the size
down a little bit and go red
actually I'm going to go below here
and then I'm going to take the eraser
tool and get rid of this portion and
then I'm gonna take the blend mode and
change it yeah we're gonna use soft
light right there and a right click and
we're just ctrl shift D real quick all
right I think that looks pretty good and
you can make some adjustments if you
want to that and you know if you did
want to you could probably extend that
out just a little bit all right so I'm
going to zoom out here that looks pretty
cool I like that now what I want to do
I'm going to be adding another one over
here I might as well just keep on doing
the same thing here as long as I need to
I'm gonna add one right over here and so
we're gonna just go ahead and keep on
doing what we did last time
just kind of follow this area wherever
you chose to make your cracks you know
it's pretty much the same thing now I'm
gonna have it probably yeah we'll go all
the way
and then I'm going to come all the way
around there take the direct selection
tool get rid of the fill I'll call this
fire crack - fire crack one click back
on to control shift and for a new layer
make sure there's clipping masks what
I'm doing when that hit ctrl shift and
I'm hitting tab and in space and that
way it'll click it automatically for me
all right let's zoom out all right so
now we got to do the same thing here so
the color that I had chosen was right
around here I should have saved it but
oh well it's right around there
and we want to go back down to find what
I was using I think it was that one
right there so I'm gonna click loops we
have to make sure we change the options
right here okay all right that looks
good
all right so I'm gonna click back over
here we just left this right there and
then we created a new layer with a
clipping mask and this time we used a
different brush I believe although we
don't want it exactly you definitely
don't want to create a situation where
you're creating duplicates of things and
what we can also do if we want this to
end a little bit over here we can take
our eraser tool and select any of these
brushes to kind of even things out here
a little bit and then sometimes you will
notice I would go back up here to a
feather brush you'll notice that I get
edges from the brushes that cut off so
that looks good
and let's see here I think that's fine
for now then we had our flames that we
had over here we can do the same thing
and we had a more orangist type color
for our flames and that brush is down
here 81 so doing that every time control
shift pretty another layer do the same
thing
maybe right there take those two and
merge them and image adjustements real
quick hue/saturation take the saturation
up I'm just playing around with this to
try to get a good color kind of like the
one on the right
hit okay I'm gonna play route the blend
mode here
yeah I mean come back to that I'm just
gonna be cool with that right there for
now
and then I also want to do the same
thing with the lair where we take this
large circular feather brush and the
color was yellow click here in the
center control T hold alt and scale that
down right around here we could also
rotate it a little bit hit apply and
this was overlay so go down here and
choose overlay oops
use your squirrel that'll happen all
right and then what I want to do is also
beneath this layer take the brush if you
yeah right around there looks good make
it red
all right and get this out and I believe
well we'll go ahead and just use a down
arrow for the blend mode yeah I think it
was soft light and then duplicate that
alright so so far so good let me go
ahead and just zoom out and real quickly
I think that's a little bit too much so
if you take the move tool with
auto-select layer and just click on it
we'll get that right layer actually no
it gets the wrong layer this is the one
make sure we select that fire crack -
and we will I believe it's yeah it's
that one it's I for me it's layer 33
just kind of get rid of that a little
bit all right okay so alright now what I
want to do is kind of create an image in
the background or not an image rather
but kind of like a red type of fog as if
you know the woods prompt fire or
something
so I let's go ahead and do that I'm
gonna go all the way to the top just
beneath our fade layer I'll just call
this fade whatever all right so I I'll
call this burning trees or something and
what I want to do is take the brush I'd
say right around that size and then just
go across the top change our blend mode
down here all right take our eraser now
let me zoom up here just a little bit
I'm gonna experiment to you I may not
just want to only use yeah I think I
overlay will be it and then I'm going to
duplicate this alright take those merge
them go back to actually no no no sorry
about that I'm gonna back up a couple
times then we're gonna do is take just
this copy and just kind of get rid of
some of these for right around here
possibly all right so now let me zoom
out oops not zoom in zoom out man
alright that looks pretty cool so now at
this point I I'm going to work with this
fade a little bit more I think I'm just
going to create another layer
put this underneath yeah let me move
this up just a bit
and I do think I kind of want to get rid
of some of this stuff over here it's a
little bit too white so I come over here
I just above the cracks layer create a
new layer it doesn't have to be a layer
mask or anything actually I'll just yeah
I think I'll just delete it from there
and we can change the brush or the
eraser opacity so it's not a hundred
percent in some areas
all right that way things are kind of
faded a little bit more maybe not over
there all right
so now what I want to do is go ahead and
put in some text so this is gonna be
called status nightmare all right so I
I'm just gonna click right around there
with the caps lock on and just type in
status and we're going to put this at
the very top and I'm going to use source
sans Pro that's a free font you can find
on Google and I'm gonna use the black
version of it to make this white and I'm
gonna get my character area out here
negative 50 for the letter spacing
control T scale down and I want it to be
well first basically I wanted to look
like it's kind of behind some of these
cracks so
yeah we really need to work with this to
make sure it's readable but still to
make sure that you know we can actually
see whatever the intended effects are
how the effect is so all right I'm gonna
leave it right around there apply then
I'm going to type nightmare over here
with a new layer ctrl T
ah you know what I think I'm gonna put
it above right here apply all right so
now what we want to do is take both of
these layers holding shifts like both
right click go to convert to shape so I
take some you know you no longer can
edit the text but now we're able to work
with this down here so I'm gonna take
status layer and bring that down a notch
and I'm gonna create just a new layer
above it
control-shift-n and we're gonna leave
this on shape and we're gonna follow
this bottom edge here and we're gonna
keep on going alright so there's no
other rocks that you know or concrete or
whatever that it goes under so we're
just gonna connect this back hit ctrl C
right now and then delete then hit
control V to paste onto the status layer
and we're going to change the right here
from new layer from subtract front shape
and that gets rid of anything that's
viewable right there so if we bring it
back up to 100 you can now see it
all right so now we have this over here
nightmare lair bring that down just so
we can see what's going on down there so
now we take once more
let me zoom up here so I see exactly
what's going on with this rock alright
and that is it so let me zoom out and
then connect it back over here copy
delete and then paste and then subtract
oops over here yeah hitting ctrl H two
times to get rid of everything and there
we go so let me zoom out all right
now what I want to do remember we saved
a copy of the background basically which
is right here I'm gonna drag this to the
very top I want to give that the status
nightmare text a basically a road
texture so I'm gonna desaturate this
image adjustments brightness contrast
bring it down quite a bit right around
there then I'm gonna move it over yeah
let me zoom out real quick I'm going to
simply delete right around there delete
this over here as well all right so now
what I want to do is take our clone
stamp tool and hold all and just click
right around here in the middle of the
road click on status control-shift-n tab
in space for clipping mask and oops come
back over here do that again now we have
the same obviously is we're gonna change
this because you can't read it really
and then do the same thing for nightmare
oops
bring this up here
maybe right here control-shift-n tab
space for clipping mask oops
click on there alt left click and then
we'll go back to nightmare the clipping
mask all right now let's go ahead and
hide that all right so the background
you know without these it's it's white
basically so these are clipping masks we
can experiment by playing around with
the yeah that tool which yeah I think
what I would rather do is simply go to
image adjustments brightness take that
brightness all the way let me do it
again real quick and then I'm gonna do
it again another time just like right
around there and then what I want to do
is create a new layer clipping mask take
our brush a little bit lower yeah around
140 anything just kind of
do that and now let's go ahead and
repeat that process over here so image
adjustments brightness contrast pull
that thing up
all right and then create a new layer
clipping masks create another clipping
mask as well we're going to drop down
the size just a little bit change the
foreground to red take the blend modes
and experiment there I like that one
right there it's overlay and we can't
really read this text because the yellow
behind it it's creating back contrast so
we go down to our cracks okay it's not
the crack because this one wasn't
actually let me find that yeah I didn't
include that a part of that so that's
why that happened it's no big deal
click on the one above it the clipping
mask take our foreground a larger brush
maybe maybe do that and then there's
also one right here on our original
layer
yeah I think that's fine it doesn't look
bad or anything so let me zoom out all
right I like that so far now I I don't
like how this is kind of just ending
abruptly right there so let me find that
layer yeah we could take this layer get
out the eraser tool kind of get rid of
that area all right that's better
all right so we're almost finished here
well kind of sort of already have 48
minutes I now what I want to do is take
out the rectangle tool there create some
like film poster credit things I don't
know what the terminology is correctly
all right and they're just dragged out
make that black and I have like a movie
poster font and then you can download
that that's linked once you get that
installed first I want to come out here
and just drag this area make sure we
have this Center and then I'm going to
start typing quote but who will build
with the roads okay
make our text white type in movie to get
our font and zoom up here just adjust
the font settings a little bit I think I
want to do 25 okay and then quote and
then hit the enter key and then I'm
going to type in epic fantasy based on
the humorous fears of life without
government alright I think people get a
kick out of that and then hit enter
again featuring Ben Bernanke Paul
Krugman Barack Obama
Bill O'Reilly Al Gore Lindsey Graham now
notice I'm not only picking on Democrats
or Republicans I'm including a lot of
these people all right so and are there
I'm gonna make this text up here yellow
let me be the same color the that
portion right there okay all right so I
like this so far all right now what I
want to do is zoom out here now this in
and of itself I'd say it's a pretty
actually no I want to move everything up
all this stuff straight up because we
have a decent amount of just nothingness
up here so what I want to do is we don't
want to touch this or this but we want
to take everything else beneath it and
then just push it up let's see how far
we can get perfect all right now I'm
gonna go ahead and save mine and we are
not done yet I'm gonna go go ahead and
get a image of Barack Obama and we're
gonna like zombify them a little bit so
the image is linked below in the
description of the video on YouTube I'm
gonna right-click and copy this image
I'm going to go to file new just paste
this in yeah honestly I don't know why
I'm having Barack up on it honestly I
just kind of wanted to make somebody a
zombie so yeah don't worry about me NSA
alright so clone stamp tool we're going
to leave it around nope
make a little bit bigger right in there
what am i doing not calling stamp tool
sorry background eraser tool
okay make this a lot bigger
left click right here or not look like
with alt left click and then just try to
stay on the outer side where the that
little crosshair does not actually get
into him I screwed up I got into that
the color right there so off to watch
out for that you get here just alright
and just click right down here and I'm
gonna continue on around here alright
and I'm gonna take the size down alright
I will continue on down there now I'm
gonna take just the lasso tool we're
gonna go all the way around and end it
right there ctrl C to copy that
alright now what I want to do is go I
think click right there and then just
paste this in ctrl T hold shift and
scale down
put them right around there move tool it
apply we have some areas we gotta clean
up with Auto sucked I actually selected
a different layer
oh no that happened are you kidding me
I'm gonna do probably just I'm gonna
redo that except I'm gonna make an
adjustment and then I'm just gonna pause
it so we don't you don't have to watch
me go through this again the the
intensity was a little bit too much I
think the size was too big as well so
I'm just gonna ctrl alt Z a bunch of
times
and then for our background eraser the
tolerance it's gonna be down just a
little bit the size is not gonna be as
big as well alright and then now it's
gonna pause and do the same thing I'm
sorry about that
so you probably have to do the same
thing as well so I'm gonna pause her
okay so I got him lassoed ctrl C to copy
delete him zoom out a few areas I need
to fix that's okay though
zoom out
alright I'm gonna see about fixing this
line right here so I'll take the magic
wand go to select modify and this may
not have been an issue depending on you
know what your results were but if you
have that edge I'm just going to go to
expand by one pixel and then hit delete
control D and that kind of gets rid of
it and we're gonna play around with the
layers a bit here as well we're gonna
just him slightly so I'm gonna create an
adjustment layer above him and
hue/saturation click this right here
take them down right around huh we're on
there's fine all right gonna close that
out and you may still have just a tiny
bit of bit of pixels right around there
so if you have that issue you could take
the pen tool with path selected at the
top make selection oops
make sure you actually on that layer hit
delete and that way we get rid of that
all right so now what I want to do is
really just zombify him okay so I let's
see here we're gonna have fun okay so
let's go ahead and take the clone stamp
tool and take the hardness down the size
down as well alright first of all we're
gonna get rid of the smile a little bit
so I'm gonna hold alt and click right
around there alright and do the same I'm
gonna hold alt right here and then just
kind of click right there we're gonna
give him like a weird
I don't know sad type thing going on
all right and then I want to come over
here all right and then what I want to
do is come up around here alt left click
R get rid of like the eyes I know this
is so messed up
it's fun though alright oops
we don't get the edge of the face right
there maybe take the hardness up a
little bit size down
then I want to take the pen tool we're
gonna go to shape and we're gonna make
it black and kind of just go around the
eye portion just like that
right click rasterize that layer and
then take the eraser tool oops make sure
opacity is hundred-percent now we're
going to take the blend modes and go hit
the down arrow key I think I like that
right around there
that's overlay we're gonna do the same
thing over here
so it's gonna fall like the orbital
Ridge I guess you could call it thank
you like we will rasterize that layer
overlay mmm
take the pasady down just a tad bit
hmm not sure if I like that so much I
think I need to just blur it a little
bit filter Gaussian blur
maybe duplicate it all right and I'm
gonna come back up here to hue and
saturation what you know it's no let me
find that yeah that got messed up
unfortunately all right now I also want
to create a brightness and contrast
all right now these are a little bit too
dark now I think take this one oops
Yeah right around there and yeah we can
also you know let me make this a
clipping mask as well you can experiment
with like moving these up on top
although that doesn't really change
anything that's fine all right so I now
what I want to do is come over here can
I create like holes in the skin all
right so just go smoothly around right
there all right so let's call that hole
and I think we're going to go around
here as well
all right now take those three and kick
ctrl e that way it takes all of those
shapes and put them on and put some on
the same layer so I can just rename that
to whole again
and now we're gonna create a bunch of
clipping mask layers so ctrl shift and
tab space enter alright so I'm going to
create a I'm gonna choose a red color
and I'm just going to create some like
random fibrous looking situations in
here alright I'm gonna go up here
there's wine and that's not a clipping
mask we can make that one though no big
deal right click create clipping mask
and obviously this looks terrible but
that's expected at this point you can
play around with making these lighter or
darker and
double-click it hit ctrl H twice first I
double-click it and let's get this so
you can see it we go to inner shadow I'm
gonna change the blend mode to normal I
will go ahead and take the size down a
little bit the distance down as well and
yeah the opacity just down to a bit
right around there so like to 0-2 and
then all these settings up here right
click copy that layer style and then
take those two layers and hit paste
layer style same thing with this down
here this one I want to be quite a bit
darker all right not done yet so ctrl
shift and at the very top of the last
clipping mask make that a clipping mask
as well I take the brush tool and oops
choose black take the opacity up just
slightly alright and create another
layer make it a clipping mask as well
take the size and get it down quite a
bit and maybe a medium hardness
yeah something like that's fine
all right and we can always play around
with the blend mode of that I think soft
light works well and then I'm going to
go beneath everything or beneath the
whole layer create a new layer and then
use the brush tool get a like a lighter
skin color grit on there hit OK
take that down just a tad bit this from
eight to six all right that I mean that
looks bad I know but one second go ahead
and take the blend mode and just play
around with what you think might look
good or realistic actually I think it's
that at this I sort of yeah at a hundred
percent and then what I want to do is
nothing yet go inside I think yeah
at the last flushy red thing layer go
ahead and choose white and take the
brush tool and to choose like a scatter
type brush
Yeah right around there play with the
blend modes
that's color dodge and we'll see
mm-hmm this was one of those things I'm
experimenting here I think that's fine
or in other words yeah it lightens it up
I don't me like it screw that idea all
right I okay so I want to see if I want
to make any more adjustments to this I
know we're getting late here see here
play with the brightness and contrast
again
you want to do I'm going to create a new
layer just above it control-shift-n take
our brush tool I promise we're just
about done take a black color
yeah that's here
they're like that it gives it a little
bit more so it's not so bright on that
left side so that's soft light basically
let me get rid of that alright so that
is it so I let me see your real quick I
come back up with our I'm gonna get the
original image that we edited and so I
just pasted it real quick up here so we
go from this to that that was fun
