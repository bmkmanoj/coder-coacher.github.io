design a wallpaper along with
introducing a really cool new service
that is exploding in popularity so steam
it is a social media platform that
allows users to submit and curate
content and what really makes it unique
is the fact that you're paid for in
what's called steam steam dollars and
steam power now you can take this
digital currency and ultimately get real
US dollars out of it
so before I continue let's show you the
project that I'm gonna show you how to
design so as you can see pretty cool and
the symbol in the middle is the logo for
steam it and that's what we're going to
base this wallpaper out of and it's
going to be a 4k resolution wallpaper
and basically this steam it is like I
said it's brand-new and what side really
cool is how fast it has grown and it's
also still in its infancy and that's why
I'm introducing you guys to this really
cool service all right so what I want to
do to get started here it's just a
preface that we're gonna use Adobe
Photoshop for this I'm using CC 2015 the
latest and I'm also using a Wacom tablet
you know this is not technically a
tablet it's a monitor that you draw on
called a Cintiq but you can use the into
US and even bamboo just the same so
don't feel like you need this really
expensive monitor I probably shouldn't
have bought anyhow okay so let's go
ahead and get started I'm gonna switch
over here to the Cintiq and I'm going to
get a photo shot alright so first we
have to determine what size we want the
wallpaper
traditionally I I would say with the
advent of the 4k monitors we want to use
a resolution obviously that's pretty
large so the resolution that I'm gonna
use is 3840 by 2160 all right so
everything else resolution 72 is fine
color mode RGB definitely and hit okay
all right
now second we want to open up the logo
which I'll provide in the description so
let's go ahead and go to file open and
where are we at
completely not but blue that the folder
that I wanted to open no big deal there
we go steamy I and when you open this up
you'll get this that'll pop up and you
just hit okay now we only want this top
symbol not the actual letters there so
we'll select that copy it and then paste
it in I'm gonna hit ctrl T with Shift +
Alt and a scale that down right around
here pretty good and hit apply okay so
now what we want to do is we're gonna
take the background and I'm gonna make
it sorry all my windows our dialog boxes
are showing up on other monitor so I'm
like dragging them over here no big deal
alright something that's not quite black
maybe 1/4 1/4 1/4 we'll hit OK and then
use the paint bucket tool to fill in the
background behind that now the next step
is I want to do a color overlay because
I want these all to be the same color so
clicking on layer 1 which we can double
click and rename 2 logo we'll go ahead
and get up the layer styles of course
they're all over the place
 windows alright and then what we
want to do is hit color overlay and
ultimately they will be black eye but
for now just so we could see a little
bit better I'm gonna lighten it up it
right around there which is 4 C 4 C 4 C
if you're following along here okay cool
so we're going to use just one custom
brush which is also linked here in the
YouTube to
description and this brush if we click
on brush tools is right here it's kind
of like a cloud brush you can see the
preview there now what we want to do is
before we continue i'm going to
rasterize this so we don't need the
color overlay anymore so right click and
rasterize layer style all right now it's
all baked in to the pixel data so what
we want to do is create or use the cob
brush to create a kind of like a large
gray background so I'm going to come
just on the background layer click the
new layer icon there at the bottom and
we're going to choose a gray color here
in the middle or maybe a little bit
darker and then I'm gonna get my stylus
out here and currently we want to change
this so that my touch strip toggles the
brush size right there okay there we go
and my right one toggles the zoom okay
all right so now I'd take this and just
very lightly just start brushing with or
brushing with different intensities will
create kind of just a texturized cloudy
sort of area again you don't have to do
exactly what I'm doing either just so
it's kind of roughly filled in kind of
like that
alright cool now we want to create a
layer that's set to a blend mode of
vivid light I to create some just burns
around the outer side edges of the
symbol right here so it's create a new
layer just behind or beneath the logo
layer and a scale is down quite a bit
and we're also going to use an orange
color right around there will work well
and that color code is FF 9500 all right
so we want to change this
again to vivid light alright so you may
have to experiment with this a few times
just to see how dark you want this and
not dark but how big you want the brush
size rather and I'm just kind of a while
I'm doing this I'm changing the brush
size especially at the ends because we
don't want that to be too big yeah
something like that
and then just do the same thing with
this one and also I have set up my
Express keys and I don't use all of them
probably should although I don't I don't
really use the Cintiq of very often I've
said just a few just for undoing ctrl
alt Z I've set that too and I'm always
using that alright
all right not bad you can add kind of
just a bigger ones to thicken it up a
little bit all right cool all right so
I'm just looking over by the way to my
other monitor just for the directions
I've set up I don't want to miss
anything so we're going to create
another layer just above it and this one
is gonna be set to a color burn for the
blend mode so right here and this is
going to be a basically large cloud like
real large as you see how like getting
this up quite a bit and yeah we don't
want to go that big there we go and you
know set this kind of right here for now
and this gives a little bit more color
and what I want to do is take the eraser
tool with the same cloud brush so we
click down here on the settings there we
go and we can also remove some of this I
don't want it to all be filled in there
and also year the pressure sensitivity
is on so you may have to hit a little
bit harder all right now what I want to
do is we're gonna go back to the logo
and give it the color overlay of black
this time now we can not will be able to
see it more because there's more
contrast behind it all right and now
what we're gonna do is create a
selection around everything inside of
this logo so what we do is hit hold ctrl
and then left click right here and that
creates an outline now I'm gonna go to
select modify and contract and we want
to contract it pray around 8 pixels hit
OK and
see it contracts the edges of the
selection and we're going to create here
a new layer and what we want to do is
take the gradient tool here and it's
going to choose kind of a yeah we'll
leave it up white actually what I want
to do now is create a clipping mask out
of that selection so now you can see
there's a clipping mask there we switch
over here to select it we can fill it in
with white sorry I don't know why I
thought I had to use the gradient tool
so now it's all filled in with white now
we're gonna create a another selection
in the same way so ctrl + left click on
the logo alright and then I'm going to
take the just a marquee tool and just
pull this down just a little bit and you
can use your keyboard arrow keys right
around there and what I want to do is
switch back to the layer above it the
clipping mask layer and hit delete and
then ctrl D to deselect so you can see
we have sort of like this very slight
glossy portion and we created that
pretty simply and that's a lot easier
than sitting there with a brush trying
to get it perfect okay so I don't want
to leave it exactly like that i what I
want to do is we're gonna duplicate it
and Hanner and I'm going to double click
on it and we're gonna choose color lock
love that colorize sorry can't talk um a
little bit more orange I think we'll hit
OK hit OK and then what I want to do is
I'm gonna right click
rasterize layer style and then take the
eraser tool yeah we'll choose this a
soft feather default brush
and kind of just get rid of a portion of
it where it's kind of like hotter in the
middle you could choose not to do that
step but you don't want to not really
that big of a deal I'm gonna take both
of these layers and merge them so ctrl e
while selecting both layers and then I
want to know I don't want quite do that
I'm gonna take the opacity down maybe to
47% and just get rid of the ends a
little bit just so they fade all right
so far so good
let me look at my notes here so what we
want to do now is kind of add or begin
to add smoke that's coming on top of
these designs here are the the symbols
so we'll create a new layer it's just at
the very top and what we'll do now is
switch back to the brush tool we don't
need to be that quite that big and we'll
give you size just a gray right around
there and then we'll start pressing just
a little bit
almost looking like there's just a ton
of smoke or steam rather coming up yeah
I think that looks good uh and then what
I want to do is also add a clipping mask
layer so we're create a new layer and
then right click and choose create
clipping mask and we're gonna choose I
the orange color that we had or just any
orange color you'll have to be perfect
and then just just give some of it color
probably more near the bottom so what
this is doing is only adding color
because it's a clipping mask layer on
the previous layer that is pointing to
okay all right so now I want to add I
some finer detail in I would say
brighter glow on the fiery portion so
just above that layer we're gonna create
a new layer I'm ready to get this to me
a little bit smaller up and we're gonna
make this more almost closer to a yellow
and see here yeah that'll work
just like this
and you don't want it to necessarily be
applied to everything or go along the
entire stretch like that or you could if
you want I just think it adds a little
bit more variety
if you don't okay all right so we have
to keep on doing the same thing so this
steam it thing while I'm doing this is a
very repetitive takes a little bit of
time I of course if you find value in
this tutorial definitely check out steam
it and the page that I link in the
description here in YouTube and upvote
and comment on this post also
participate in the rest in the community
you can actually make money by not
necessarily creating content but also by
participating and commenting and
upvoting it has an allegory at an
algorithm that I don't quite fully
understand but it's definitely
interesting so give it a shot all right
just about done here with this step all
right cool
so let me zoom out here just a bit to
see what this is looking like so far all
right so so far so good
I think what I want to do now is we're
gonna add some cracks to make it look
like this is just a cracked concrete of
some sort so what we'll do is just
almost at the very bottom after the
background layer we want to go ahead and
add a new layer and zoom up and I'm
still going to use the cloud brush for
this except it's going to be quite small
and we're gonna use black so
looking sorry I hit the mic there yeah
actually just so I can see a little
better when I drag it up a few layers
it's still too big there we go it's a
little bit better this is also a
repetitive process but it's also really
fun just adding these different cracks
here and try to make them look natural
generally you don't see cracks that look
like that they're kind of just ragged
straight edges everywhere
god I wish I can make this go faster
just about done here just one of those
things that I can a improves the
composition gives it a little bit more
personality I guess you could say like
that's almost done all right
that looks pretty good to me all right
so I'm gonna zoom out here
just to see what we have going also
compare it with the view that I had all
right so I'm also gonna add a layer on
top of everything and we're gonna use a
large just regular brush for this one
feathered a large feather brush we're
gonna make this big so increase the size
of this quite dramatically and she was
like a color like that I'm just gonna
left click once with my mouse and then
I'm gonna experiment with the layer
blend mode so what you do this is you
select line like this so it's
highlighted in blue and use your
keyboard down arrow key and this can
give you some different looks
essentially so let me zoom up here while
I do this so I I actually kind of do
like multiply color burn that's pretty
cool-looking and what's also cool is if
you see for example this screen
obviously this washes everything out
looks like crap I you can use the eraser
tool though it really does make it look
interesting
I like for instance if we took this
beneath that layer and possibly we did
enough with but let me put this up to
100% and also choose our cloud this may
or may not work by the way the way I'm
intending it so I'm just kind of coming
up here in the middle preserving trying
to preserve some of it just around the
edges this is going in a slightly
different direction than what I had
originally that's not a big deal ah you
can also take the opacity down and so
here's what this looks like toggling
this on and off so it does add
brightness but let's keep on messing
around with the the blend mode so see if
there's one that may might be a little
bit better oh I like that
that's overlay yeah and we can always as
well duplicate that layer and that can
add more intensity
let's bring this to the top kind of like
that too
all right so let's also I'm going to add
a layer at the very bottom we're almost
done by the way I and it's gonna be
black with our cloud brush I'm not
seeing anything right now what the
there we go just to add some darker
spots with the clouds I went down too
far there we go
I'm also going to add another layer to
the top or add a little bit more smoke
near the top at least maybe underneath
that portion I just use grey and make
sure I'm go to the very top here oops
I had the eraser selected so why I
wasn't working um a little bit too
bright let's take that down so I'm just
kind of adding like an esteem that's
coming up and by the way I know it kind
of looks like crap but we're gonna fix
that in a second I may not use this
though I'll be honest but a lot of this
is about experimenting anyhow you very
rarely just go into a design like this
or a composition and knock it out of the
park and every idea works alright so now
what I'm going to do is take the eraser
tool and just cut back some of this we
don't want it to be so pronounced in
areas
and then also it's sticking out a little
bit too much so I take the opacity down
yeah maybe like that all right and that
is it so that's how you create one of
these wallpapers I now again if you want
to offer multiple sizes I you can adjust
the canvas size after saving them so you
know just that you probably save it as a
JPEG a high quality JPEG uh and then go
to image canvas size of course that
showed up on another monitor and bring
it over and you can adjust to you know
any of the papi there's a lot of
different monitor sizes and resolutions
that you want to aim for when you're
creating a wallpaper and this is where
you could adjust the canvas size I
and then sometimes you'll want to use
image image size as well especially if
we're going down like so far they're
like 1280 by 720 if you use canvas size
it's gonna cut the canvas off but not
scale down the image itself alright so
that my friends is basically it i
hopefully you enjoy this if you did like
the tutorial like I said please check
out the link in the description here on
YouTube and join up and then upvote and
comment on this post and you know
perhaps even learn more about steam let
me know what you think alright I will
talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
