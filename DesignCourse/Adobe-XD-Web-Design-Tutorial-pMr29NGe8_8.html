Adobe XD windows beta for this and you
can use I the same application for Mac
if you wish however it did just release
for Windows so it's pretty stripped down
in terms of functionality however there
is enough and it is stable enough for us
to use it and to use it to design a full
mock-up of this fictional sort of
personal portfolio website that we're
building as well as create a basic
interaction prototype so later on in the
course we're going to be using angular
to make the entire project a reality in
the browser and we'll do our best here
in XD to match what we hope will be the
final output later on in the course
alright so I'm going to switch over to
the desktop here and I have a new
document open up here in XD and the
first thing we want to do is to create a
custom artboard so down here we have the
artboard tool which you can access by
hitting a and over here on the right it
does give you just some preset options
but I'm just going to draw mine out
manually and I'm going to left click and
drag and you can see over here in the
width and height over here it tells you
what we are in terms of pixels so I'm
just going to match it up to around 1200
and we could always edit these
afterwards and something high like
around 900 for the height so my current
desktop resolution is 1920 by 1080 for
recording this and so this fits nicely
within my current view at 100% view okay
so the first part that we want to focus
on is the header and in the header all
we're going to have is our name because
this is just a personal portfolio site
and then kind of a subtitle kind of your
description of what you do and then also
a very simple navigation over here with
four differently
okay so the first thing we want to do is
take our type tool and I'm going to
left-click right around there and I'm
just going to in all caps lock hit Gary
Simon you can put whatever name you wish
and I'm going to switch over to the move
tool and select it now we can notice
over here we have a fill and your border
may be checked on and off but we don't
want a border obviously for this and I'm
going to make this just completely black
so all six zeros for the hex code now
I'm also going to use a web font called
open sans and if you google open sans
you can download it for free
and then install it once you have it
installed you can select it over here
and we're going to make this one bold
and also will increase this around yeah
we'll try 32 pixels and we want to have
a good amount of white space here
between the left border here at the top
and the top as well you want to try to
make sure these things are even and
that's just basic good design
fundamentals okay so next we're going to
have kind of like a subtitle down over
here and so we can simply take this
select it control C and control V and
then we can move it down or holding
shift now you can notice we have these
little guides that show up and these
will be handy I when we're developing
this layout and you'll see in a little
bit how those come into play so now for
this of course it's going to be a lot
smaller but we're just going to change
this to some other kind of just a title
like for example UI / UX designer from
Cleveland Oh H all right now let's go
ahead and take this and we'll make it
regular and let's try something around
20 maybe even just a little less maybe
around 18 and right around there seems
pretty good to me
okay so additionally we're going to have
a header and that's going to show up
just to the right side over here and on
navigation rather and again we could
take our name right here control-c
control-v to copy and paste and we'll
start right around here and all caps
lock again home and actually normally I
would just put spaces between but we
don't have to do that here makes it a
lot easier than say Photoshop so what
we'll do is first take this down quite a
bit we'll try 18 based on this side I
think that's still a little bit too big
so I'm going to try 14 all right now I'm
going to move it and we'll see kind of
where this aligns up in relation to the
title right here so I think right here
is pretty good so I'm gonna hit ctrl-c
ctrl-v change this one here to my work
control C control V and by the way hit
escape now you can see right here once
that turns pink in the middle we see we
have an even distance between the
elements here about hit escape control C
control V and then contact by the way
when I'm moving these over a holding
shift to keep them on the same path
alright so I'm taking all these and
selecting holding shift and just moving
them over here just to have an even
amount of consistent white space okay
now with these I'm just going to instead
of making them black I'm going to make
them a little bit of a blue because
that's going to be kind of our secondary
color as a part of our color scheme
be great around here so the color code
for that is one four four three five
four okay all right so now the header is
done as you can see very simple and the
next part we want to focus on is down
here which will be kind of like a
thumbnail gallery of our projects and
it's going to pull this from the behance
API which we'll do obviously later on
when we get to the developments portion
so right now I'm going to choose this
this rectangle tool and I'm going to
left-click and drag out all the way kind
of like a container right right around
here for now we'll be good we can adjust
this as needed in the future now we
don't want a border but we do want to
fill and we want it to be a very light
gray just so you can see barely see it
right here okay now what we want to do
is in the project files and I'm going to
link those so you can download them we
want to open up a folder that we have
alright so you can see we have these
thumbnails and I'm just going to drag
this over here we don't want to drag it
on top of here because it will fit it
into this rectangle that we created so
we just want to go out on the outside
and we're going to increase this by
holding shift and the size will be
roughly right around here for now okay
and then what we want to do is select it
and choose to repeat grid and we'll pull
this to the right right around there
should work pretty well and I may just
go out a little bit further to the last
one so I'm going to hold ctrl and use my
mouse Crower to come out there just so
we can see the whole thing to the right
alright that looks good and I'm going to
bring these in by left clicking and
dragging
so I don't want any space between these
so we want to write at zero as we can
see at the top alright that looks pretty
good here and I'm also going to hit ctrl
C and then control V to create a second
row
just like that and then I'm going to
right-click and for now before I do that
I do want to bring up our assets here
and I'm going to choose let's see here
we have one two three four five six the
first six up here and drag them on to
the top and you can see how it very
quickly and automatically changes what
we want to be shown in here all right
and then second we're going to take this
and we'll take the other remaining
thumbnails right here and we'll place
them on this one and now it gives us
just a different look here and then I'm
going to take both of these first select
a top one right click on group and then
ungroup as well so now we can select
each one individually I'm going to just
delete these three and I'm going to take
these three and increase the scale just
slightly because we're going to be using
a responsive flex grid for these and
they're automatically going to adapt so
the bottom row may sometimes be larger
based on the width of the viewport so
let's drag this down here just to the
bottom for this container and I'm going
to take these six up top by holding
shift and selecting all and then hold
shift and bring them down just so all
six fit nicely in this area
alright so real quickly I'm going to
take these three drag them up and then
also move this up alright that looks
pretty good
also I don't like how these two are
repeating right there so let me go ahead
and just quickly take the just one of
these right here I will choose maybe
this shoe over here just put it right
there alright okay so in this clip we're
going
head and finish off the homepage design
by doing a couple things so let's switch
over to the desktop and the first thing
we want to do is right here when we
hover over any of these thumbnails when
we have the final product finished there
in angular we're going to have through
CSS a hover effect so they're going to
grow a little bit so let's simulate that
here in XD now unfortunately at the time
of recording this and this may be
different based on when you're watching
this maybe they integrated this feature
already they don't have the ability for
you to work in any type of hover based
interaction effects so I'm just going to
increase one of them and it's going to
be there all the time based on you when
we play it through the prototype I but
that'll basically be as much as we can
do at this point I so we can just
simulate what it's going to look like if
you hover over one of these so I'm just
going to take this one over here to the
right and I'm going to hold shift and
alt and scale it up just a little bit
because you don't want it to be too
jarring when you're hovering over these
so right around there is pretty good I'm
going to increase my size just a little
bit and I'm also going to make sort of
like a title and it's going to pull the
title from the Behance API and it's
going to show up on the bottom portion
of the thumbnail right here and it's
going to be encased in this white sort
of container we don't need a border
right there and then inside of it we're
going to have text so let's go ahead and
I know as you left click right here on
the very edge and then drag all the way
out to the right and then Center it by
clicking this icon right here and we'll
just name this shoe for now we'll just
assume the project title is shoe and
we'll bring this down here to a pretty
small size perhaps twelve and we'll make
this black
right there in the middle okay looks
pretty good now over here we're going to
have two columns and left one simply
gonna say front-end development with a
title as well is a fake description then
what other one will be a back-end
development with fake description and
each one is going to have its own icon
that we're going to custom design here
in XD mainly with the pen tool and the
shape tools really that's all to give
you to work with at this point so what
I'm going to do is first we're going to
focus on the first icon so we want to
design an icon that's relevant to the
idea of front-end development somehow so
front-end development simply means
aesthetics for the most part so we're
going to design sort of like a
paintbrush very simple stylized
paintbrush over here so the first thing
we want to do is use the rectangle tool
here to do the handle portion so I'm
just going to drag out something pretty
large at this point and then we're going
to scale it down a lot of course but we
want to be able to see what's happening
so as we can see we have these little
icons here if we pull them all the way
in we can make rounded corners here and
we're going to change the border size
from 1 to 2 and we do not need a fill so
we can unjust or deselect that and then
we also want a blue color something
that's pretty vibrant so I'll use one
AAA 3ff if you want to follow along okay
so if we select it and double click it
we have access to the anchor points here
so I'm gonna select the very bottom line
and just hit delete and we can see it
kind of rounds off this bottom portion
so now we'll take the pen tool and we'll
create the actual bristles portion of
the brush now if you're familiar at all
with Adobe Illustrator or Dobie Dobie
photoshop's pen tool this is a little
bit different but for the most part it's
the same in terms of how you
draw out anchor points so we'll come out
right here I'm going to left click and
drag and hold shift and that will
constrain it to a vertical angle and
mind you you may have to do this a
couple times simply because it's a
little bit tricky at first and on the
left click right here and then I'm going
to bring this right here in and you can
hold the Alt key alright and then I'm
going to left click right around here to
finish off this Anchor Point in this
shape right here so I hit escape we're
going to select this and we want to
again change this to two and also use
our color and one thing I forgot to do
is to add this as a preset so we click
this little button right here now we can
access it quickly for other shapes now
if you have some issues for instance
this isn't lining up correctly over here
we can simply double click and just drag
over what we need to drag over so if you
click on other anchor points you have
access to be able to make other
adjustments through the handles and the
position of the anchor points themselves
I'm pretty happy with this so what I'll
do is take these now there's two
different shapes here let's take them
and group them so hit ctrl G or
right-clicking group and then we can
scale this down okay
right around there is pretty good and
now let's go ahead and add a title so
for this we'll simply put front-end
development and once again we want to
use our open sans font
all right let's get a good idea of what
size this should be we want a good
amount of white space between these two
elements so we'll pull that down and
we'll make this black and then we'll
copy and paste it by the way 20 seems to
be pretty good I think I'm going to
change this to 18 coffee and then paste
and actually instead of copy and paste
what we'll do is simply draw out a text
field right here and I'm just going to
put in some gibberish for now and I'm
going to head over to website that
quickly has lorem ipsum text there we go
I'll just copy this first line right
here and paste that in and we want this
to be smaller and
right there looks to be pretty good by
the way we want to make sure this is
lined up right there to the left so it
is that seems good all right now let's
take all this ctrl-c ctrl-v and we'll
change this here to back-end development
and we'll leave the text the same down
here and then finally all we have to do
to wrap this up is create another icon
and something that's relevant to the
idea of back-end so I'm just going to
put code brackets as an icon so we'll
use the pen tool and I'm going to come
over here just so I get a good idea of
the size I'm going to hold shift alright
while Dee's putting me basically in
45-degree angles and go ahead and make
this - we'll take this control C ctrl F
right now I can't right click and just
flip it horizontally or vertically so
we're just going to move this over and
I'm going to double click it to get
access to the anchor points hold shift
while doing so
and we'll eyeball it right around there
alright and then we're going to put a
slash in the middle and so let me have
to move this over yeah we'll try right
around here alright and then make them
consistent
- I'm going to move this over make sure
these are even here bring this down all
right right around there seems pretty
good okay so now we want to make sure we
have an even amount of white space
between the bottom of this element and
the thumbnails as well as the thumbnails
at the bottom of the thumbnails in the
top of these elements and there's a
little bit more as we can see here so
we're going to take these and there we
go we can see we get an even amount of
distance between them okay so now in
this clip we're going to focus on
finishing off the mock up here in XD by
designing a second sub page and that's
one that's going to emulate what exactly
it looks like and what happens when a
user clicks on a project thumbnail
alright so I'm going to switch over here
to the desktop and the first thing we
want to do is take our artboard 1 I'm
gonna double click right here to rename
this to home by the way take off caps
lock and then I'm going to with it
selected hit ctrl C and then ctrl B you
can see it automatically just kind of
pushes that over there to the right
which is what we want and we'll change
this one to details okay so when this
occurs when somebody clicks on one of
these icons right here these thumbnails
we're not going to have a navigation
show up we're going to kind of do
something a little bit crazy and
unconventional which is you know okay
for a personal portfolio site especially
for a designer just do something
different so we're going to get rid of
this right here and I'm also going to
get rid of all these thumbnails perhaps
except for
so I'm going to get rid of these as well
as this I'm going to keep this one right
here as well as this also I'm going to
just keep one of these over here off to
the side and we're going to do is have a
two column layout and on expanded
desktops large desktops or view ports
this is going to be approximately a 60%
width over here and we're going to pull
this here to the top and to the bottom
and then we're going to take this right
here and it's going to match up with
this size now one thing that it did I
just recalled is instead of it being a
hundred percent based on the width of
this column here it's can actually give
me the hundred percent of the browser
width so part of it will be cut off and
the person won't be able to see a full
representation of what looks like and
that's okay because what we'll do we're
going to take this rectangle right here
we're going to range we're going to send
it to or bring to front rather we're
going to put this over here drag it in
we're going to make it white all right
also I'm going to copy this and then
paste it we're going to match it up
right there we're going to right click
arrange and we're going to send it back
by the way it's going to be this color
again so take this add that to the
swatches there we go
now the reason I have this right here is
because based on the size of the project
image perhaps ones that are kind of more
i smaller in height you're not always
going to see the full representation of
whatever it is that's being shown so for
that reason the background of this
container right here is creating just a
basic separation between these two
columns and you'll see what I mean more
specifically if you're kind of confused
as to what I'm talking about once we
start developing the actual project okay
so this is what it will look like
basically when a user clicks this this
is going to slide in to the right this
will slide in to the left this little
panel here and then we'll have
information about the project contained
right here so let's go ahead and focus
on that I'm going to get rid of this
icon right here where I bring this over
here and we want to mount a good amount
of white space between left in the top
and over here to the right as well
so I'm going to bring this down or in
rather now let's focus on this
specifically let's change this here just
to some name of the project
I believe this one was elements actually
that I pulled and find okay control-c
control-v to copy this and paste it and
this is going to have back to projects
now we don't want this to take
precedence over the main title so we're
going to make this smaller actually
we're going to make it maybe twelve and
also change the fill to right around
there which is 6e 6e 6e and for this
we're going to change the fill to black
we're also going to increase the size of
this perhaps to 24 all right that looks
good and also one thing I do want to do
them I'm going to make a change on these
three text elements right here is change
the line height so I'm going to try it
22 and I'll just space them out just a
little bit further all right there we go
and then finally the last element that
we're going to have is going to be a
call-to-action button right here where
it says view project on B hands so let's
take the rectangle tool right around
there get rid of the border we're going
to have a fill 1 3 1 e 3 0 works pretty
well we can have this as swatches as
well if we need it down the road and
then we'll use the type tool left click
from the very left and drag to the very
right center it view on Behance and
we'll change this text to or the fill
rather to white we could also bring down
the size I think just around 18 will
work and then move it to the center ok
great so this is what your artboards
should look like at this point all right
so now what we want to do is connect
them
I threw the prototype tab up here so
let's click on that and you can see
nothing changes except some of our tools
goes away so now what we want to do is
when we connect this right here once
it's clicked over to this page so we're
going to click on the thumbnail and by
the way if we go back to the design tab
we can see these currently are not
grouped together so we have this little
text label here this little background
in this may control G to group those so
now we'll go back to pro
type and we'll select it as a whole and
then simply drag this over here to
details as the target transition will do
slide right and we'll leave these
default values of ease out and point for
seconds for duration all right and then
for back to projects we'll click on that
we'll drag it over here and the targets
home will slide left leave these the
same and there we go so now let's go
ahead and test this out I'll hit play
we'll go ahead and click over here and
there we go very easy to use okay so as
you can see based on the transitions
that's not exactly how it's going to
appear once we start coding in HTML CSS
and angular it's going to be a little
bit more dynamic in that in terms of
animation but for now in the current
state of Adobe XD and its beta stay it's
pretty limited in what you can do all
right so now in the next clip we're
going to get started with just exporting
a couple assets and also setting up the
project in angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
