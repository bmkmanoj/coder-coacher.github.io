yo so I'm doing this mainly to test out
my software streaming capabilities as
well as this live chat feature for it's
gonna show hopefully in the the video
stream your comments so let's see what
happens when I cut to myself right now
what's up and let's see here I'm not
seeing any of the chat showing up where
the hell yeah you can hear me you could
see me now at this point - let me check
my my stuff here my settings just sucks
when it doesn't work right away
repeat no I don't want to repeat the
entries a lot of comments coming through
I'm from Ohio United States it's cold
and it just sucks here yeah I'm not
seeing them show up one second guys I'm
gonna start soon
oh there we go they're showing up now
sweet I thought that would make it
easier for me to see and read your
comments instead of looking at this da
the YouTube gives you like this
dashboard and its small and crappy and
but at the rate you guys are yeah I
don't know if I gotta be able to respond
to everyone oh man
okay cool so yeah like I said mainly
this is just for yeah this is mainly
just for me to test things out so I
won't be doing this to let maybe about
30 to 40 minute sort of demo where I'm
going through yeah where I'm gonna go
through just style mod just some stuff I
wanted to experiment with CSS and
landing pages alright so let's see here
let me get this stuff minimized alright
so what I'll be doing is minimizing that
and get our code up oh yeah we don't
want that one second we're gonna cut to
that and then cut to that and then cut
to that there we go
all right sweet yeah let me know how the
video quality is I'm know it's not going
to be as clear as you know if I were to
upload this like I normally do it not
live but hopefully it's not too bad
alright okay so I'm just gonna create a
real quick index.html file and again I'm
gonna be just experimenting with a
couple things with CSS I am seeing your
comments too by the way and I don't know
what the delay is gonna be like so
hopefully that's not screwed up alright
so far so good
also there is a way for me to get your
your DM user names to show up when you
are commenting on the video but I didn't
set that up correctly obviously alright
so I'm just going to have a CSS file
this is not going to be any type of
crazy dev environment by the way it's
going to be
just something real simple when I'm
dealing with static files so link rel
equals stylesheet I'm gonna tell my one
friend to come in here and I'm sure he's
gonna troll me let's see alright so
let's see here style sheet will have um
let's see source equals CSS main dot CSS
document LP stuff maybe I'll make this
even bigger I want to make sure you guys
can see whatever I'm doing and I'm kind
of going off the cusp here so you know
the normal development process you're
usually screwing up 30,000 different
times make a CSS folder may not CSS I'm
also going to have an images folder
because I want to experiment with the
CSS property of background blend modes
and image a mixed blend mode which are
really cool alright so first things
first let me just died get some initial
HTML going oh and by the way let me see
real quickly I want to get this I I just
installed this visual studio code
plug-in for live like a live server so
you don't have to get up a gulp I live
reload and all that stuff going and
there was a little thing down here of an
icon that was here initially so I'll get
to that in a second let's see here let's
say div class equals container I'm not
that good
div class no actually I think we're
gonna have a nav here this is going to
be real simple but I'm hoping I can show
something cool just for this quick demo
unordered list well but just like a real
simple what you call navigation so we'll
have a link here
could you show us to plug in I mention
yes I will but I'm just gonna get some
real quick HTML I'm not doing much
not even more than just not much more
than this actually so let me see yeah
we'll just do home shift alt and down to
replicate that three times I can to know
from you I can't even pronounce that and
I only have these showing up for five
freaking seconds so don't type a lot
some slow hashtag here here here yeah I
will show you the plug-in but I
installed it already though so I'm gonna
need to figure that out real quick and
then I'm going to have the nav I need to
nab will have another div of class of
I'm just gonna call to here it's a hero
section essentially and so I'm gonna be
experimenting with some CSS properties
with this hero section with some images
and it should be cool if it works out
and then it's gonna have h1 and that's
it inside of it so we'll just say
awesome you know I think I'm gonna have
like a mountain graphic in the
background
alright saving that I'm gonna have to
real quickly let's see here real quickly
sorry I cannot see any yeah I can see
them now actually I'm looking at the
screen off the browser Visual Studio
code live reload actually I don't know
why I can't just show you this
no it's called a live server yeah right
here wait I think this is the one that I
used let me make sure it's the right one
yeah go live that's not showing up but
it did earlier it's like what the hell
maybe has to be toggled on and off let
me hit install anyhow you need to blah
blah blah
please disable chat for focus on the
code well what was just showing up on
top maybe I can adjust that you know
open visual studio code I already
installed the damn thing what are you
talking about man maybe it was a
different one I don't think it was okay
so let's go back to index
that sucks because I don't want to have
to reload I mean if I have to sit there
manually refresh in the browser that's
okay whatever but let me go back to the
browser and see open a project and
directly click go live from the status
bar to turn on and off the server okay I
can right click on the right here open
with live server suite there we go there
we go that's it so now when I make a
change this will reload automatically
all right so maybe I should do a split
screen here just for the stuff on the
right all right so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go to images that Google I'm
going to type in mountain and I'm going
to go to settings no tools usage rights
labeled for reuse with modification that
means we have the right to use this
stuff I downloaded one of these I have
no clue which they all look the same
yeah I will just use this one actually
it's only 1,200 yeah this actually
aggregates pixels along with a bunch of
others I know that pixabay is here for
instance kind of looking for a specific
one I don't want one that's too too
light
all right come on make a decision
already you know what I'll just use this
I'm gonna go ahead and drag that to a
don't show again desktop here all right
so we'll just call this i BG jpg and
I'll drag that into the images folder
Wow really
rename what are we building here I'm
just doing AI you know really this was
for me to test the YouTube live
streaming I haven't done one in a long
time but I'm just doing a quick kind of
a experiment with some CSS properties
and a landing page format specifically
blend modes CSS blend modes I think
they're really cool here so let me do
the initial CSS for this so what did I
have there I have a container a class
and I'm not using sass or anything just
keeping it simple so the container class
yeah let's see here
I'll just make it the width 100% before
I do that I'm gonna go to body
and then the container is going to yeah
it's gonna have a background and then
that's an images BG jpg maybe I should
split this window real quick
oh I'm wondering if this isn't going to
be live reloading that we'll see
hi I'll just make 500 pixels and CSS
main CSS make sure that's working
I'm trying to look over here and make
sure that I'm looking at you're all of
your comments coming through
all right so div class container now it
does look my rule sets are applying the
styles let me just make sure that's the
case because this was working earlier of
course it's gonna Jack all up let's see
here yeah it's not loading
well you know what I can do because I'm
not gonna have much CSS I'm just going
to take this and just do it inline screw
it
there we go alright then let's see here
did I praise screwed that code up on
money thinking correctly Jesus Christ
alright well that way I don't have to
switch back and forth between two files
at least that's all there
Jesus Christ okay so all right let's
make this look like not like absolute
crap so I'm just gonna put font family I
have a font that I always use that's
installed already we're gonna make it
white
all right don't worry this isn't gonna
look like garbage like it is now for now
we'll just do let's see we're also going
to use clip path to create something
background size cover
alright get this crap out of here
alright so one of the things I wanted to
experiment with was these blend mode
properties and so you need two different
images and so to do that I'm gonna hop
into Photoshop a real quick and create
my own I'll just make it like yeah 1920
by 1080 and what I'm going to do again
use images Google let's see here car
tools usage right uh I'll just use maybe
this one yeah it's too blue
wait yeah we use that one copy image
paste it anywhere it doesn't really
matter what size and then I'm going to
take the eraser tool
and do that with it and then go to
filter pixelate mosaic just large cells
that's I think the largest gets to 199
or 200 all right and then I'm gonna save
that as a PNG 24 so it's transparent and
I think that's only yeah it's only 10k
so it's pretty small all right and I'm
gonna save this in the folder that I'm
working on which it's off screen so just
hold on I haven't seen a single comma
comma 3 I guess people got really oh
there we go oh that's why I'm very
intelligent or myself let's see see
users area code sorry this is off screen
right now I don't want you seeing all my
crazy folders
there we go I'll call this overlay send
you a MacBook Pro yeah I don't even have
one all right so now we got to overlay
PNG I just created and know this
background and so you can comma separate
these URL images overlay dot PNG let me
get rid of that sidebar of control B and
nothing happens to this point so we're
gonna add in a nother property and I've
never I've never really used it before
background - blend - mode and you have
all these different blend modes that you
can use so like we can try overlay for
instance hopefully I set this up right
there we go so you can kind of see it
over there doesn't look that impressive
yet let me you can experiment there's
like 15 or 20 of these things so damn
thing just got big one second
so I screen and what's even cool about
this is we can see how that I let me
shrink this and this looks there we go
we can see it better we can copy this
and then it makes the effect even stick
out more so that's kind of cool I also
want to use clip path I've never really
used the clip path property very much
when working with you know changing the
structure of your containers especially
when it comes to like you eyes let's
like layouts and such so I want to do
that as well but first I want to get no
actually we'll do that first yeah yeah
there's just cool site what the hell is
it called it's called CSS clip path
maker
I think there we go alright so what we
can do is choose something like a
hexagon and we can just adjust these and
those generate the clip path code for us
so we can create interesting sorts of
shapes I don't know this may look stupid
we'll see maybe I'll have the the
navigation right here just like those
three links alright so then once you
have it you come down here copy it
actually just so you could see it
alright there's just two lines and then
we take a container save it
yeah that's kinda I don't know it looks
a little bit weird but check that out
that's pretty damn cool all right so
let's work on this side navigation real
quick so the nav is in a nav element and
that will be position:absolute with a
z-index of two and then right we'll say
like 70 pixels all right so we see we
can't see anything just yet actually I
think I may have to restructure and that
probably be outside of container let's
see here I get to that
alright there it is don't worry I'm
gonna make this look better so um let's
see we have our links here yeah let's
let's split the screen here and make
this easier at least two right there
there we go
okay so now with the nav we'll say you
will list style type none all right and
then li display:inline and then a la
float:left maybe no no no no sorry
padding all right and then text
transform uppercase and
text-decoration:none color i always just
use FF CC 0 0 then i change whatever i
want over here kind of like a sky blue
color and will make font-weight:bold
alright let's take that from 70 pixels
to like 40 and then also this little
crap up here is due to this I think it's
due the h1 element so if I control shift
I yeah so if I just take actually what I
could do let's take this I want to see
what will work first the container will
just say padding top I don't know like
200 pixels there we go not quite that
much but that was the fix I was looking
for so padding top
I try 100 that each one needs to be much
bigger so let's say font size 3 EMA be
awesome mountain all right I think I
might yeah where's the h1 at and you
know they're just padding top
anyhow yeah those i blend modes are
really cool and you can also do it with
not just background blend mode but
there's another property called I think
it's called mixed blend mode and so we
let's try adding on this it's probably
going to look like crap but um I'm
experimenting anyhow I think I'm going
to make it a little bit bigger and font
size
all right so I'll take ya let's see if
that works so it's I you take mix ya mix
blend mode and we can apply it on the h1
element and say something like and then
we're probably gonna be able to see it
but this just has demonstrate these
blend modes was just kind of a one of
the main points of this and I'm not
making it this responsive or anything
this is just for a quick demo so I'm not
really interested yeah I could add a
drop shot on not sure if I really want
to overlay screen what else is there
there's like 15 of them I'm not even
thinking of them like there's luminosity
I believe yeah this will be available to
watch later I think I'm not going to
delete it or anything screen you know
what not even going to add that but I
just wanted to demonstrate it anyhow
yeah I think that's all I kind of want
to do now if you get out this large this
looks a little silly that's why a
container might help but I yeah some
type some type of just interesting
experimental UI and like I said the main
reason for doing this was mainly just to
test out the the YouTube chat comments
and make sure that they were they were
working out well and it looks like they
are so yeah let me know what you guys
thought of this let me let me get my um
where's it at my live dashboard actually
let me show you my my equipment that I
use or my software for this oh god
that's scary looking hahaha this is this
is called B mix and it allows me to do
this whole stream it's also what I used
to allow me to toggle back and forth
between these cameras like this this is
just a I'm able to click on my mouse
button and and make it toggle between
the desktop and then myself and that's
usually what I use for pretty much all
my tutorials and then so my YouTube
dashboard hey someone gave me a super
chat suite thanks a lot who is that
veikkaus awesome hopefully I'm not like
showing you any of my important stuff
that I shouldn't be showing but yeah
this is what they usually give you over
here this these this chat area is so
small but now I'm able to show your
comments right in here in this area I
when it comes to the YouTube your live
streaming they automatically upload it
for you based on I you know once I
stopped this live stream it'll be
available on the channel I think like an
hour or so but yeah so I'm just kind of
wondering you know should
I get to the point where I'm doing these
a live stream regularly because a lot of
times they just kind of flop and you
have to have the right type of content
like it wouldn't make sense to do a full
live tutorial step by step
live it probably would make sense to do
something that's a little bit more
random a little bit more spontaneous I
guess and so I don't know if it would
make sense to just focus on design or
code and so that's one of the things
that you know obviously this all comes
down to just uh maybe I should do a
community message thing that's another
thing that they recently introduced for
YouTube channel creators is the ability
let me show you guys I'll switch here in
a second is the ability to one second
yeah right here
hi this community tab and so that's
probably about a month old or so and so
maybe I'll post a poll because he can
they let you post polls here I'll do it
right now I'll screw it what type of
content would you like to see let me
make this bigger
all right so a poll option one all right
so what should one option be all right
UI design let's see actually yes you can
contact me hit me up email contact at
design course comm or hit me up on skype
my user name is dream ACH a dream a kind
of like headache except dream I'll just
say design add another option okay so
question an answer yeah that would be a
good topic before a live stream
how about reviews reviews kind of like
reviewing portfolios ok how about that
so does that sound good so the poll
options would be design like in terms of
the type of content that you would like
to see for live-streaming design code QA
reviewing portfolios maybe you know on
another option with this here
both design and code their options a and
B there we go
there we go
post it go ahead and answer that with
your answers QA okay cool all right guys
I have ten miles to run cuz I'm trying
to run him trying to train to run a
marathon
oh god it's horrible I want on week 5 of
18 and it's like last week I had my long
run you have a long run each week and on
Fridays are my long run so last Friday
it was a nine mile run and I had drank
like four beers tonight before I didn't
think I felt like crap so I'm kind of
dreading this it was on a treadmill nine
miles on a treadmill is horrendous
I'm gonna never do that again it's like
an hour and 20 minutes of running on a
treadmill no way so I'm gonna go I it's
like 40 degrees outside I'm gonna run
out there maybe I'll just sit here and
just not do that all right guys
yeah go ahead and answer that poll let
me know what you think and also does it
allow you to comment no I guess it
doesn't allow you to comment on polls
that's ridiculous oh well yeah if you
want you can comment on the livestream
let me know what you think in terms of
different ideas for content and I will
see you guys very soon all right
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
