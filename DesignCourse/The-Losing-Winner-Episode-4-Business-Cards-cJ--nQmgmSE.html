completed design contests where we try
to figure out something very important
what the hell were they thinking hello
Gary Simon here of design course calm
and welcome to losing winner where will
delve into the solace practice of design
crowdsourcing alright so let's get
started this time around for episode
number 4 we're going to be focusing on
business cards just to change it up a
little bit because it's not just logo
designs when it comes to design
crowdsourcing sites so I looking at this
this is a winning design and this is I
just looking at it it's not terrible
it's not as bad as some of the other
entries we had you know for a logo
design in terms of design but I compared
to one of the other entries is
definitely inferior and just to point
out some issues with this I this
reshaping for your life and this portion
down here this type is kind of just all
over the place there's not a good
alignment with it and it feels really
cluttered plus you have these I
gradients right here which meant to
probably make it look like metal it's a
little bit too much and it just kind of
throws things off all right so here is a
I alternative one now this it's it's not
you know great but it's definitely
better diff we look at its side by side
this guy one and this guy didn't so he
wasted his time putting this card
together unfortunately I just just a lot
better alignment in the type and the
layout as well I so unfortunately that
guy lost let's check out this another
one now this ton of information on it
this guy won let's check out I another
one here this one isn't that much better
but it's definitely i'd say
significantly better I at least to the
point at which i would say this guy
should have one over the other if it was
a little bit difficult to see based on
the perspective a little bit too extreme
but if we look at them side by side in
terms of layout I this one's a lot
better things are spaced out better this
one has a lot of straw
in between the line separating the
content a lot of small fonts all over
the place it's just you know
unfortunately you know even as though
this one isn't you know one hundred
percent better it just goes to show you
are taking a massive gamble when you're
submitting and you're you're wasting
your time essentially i'm submitting to
these design content contests so just
keep that in mind here's another one I
so this is a children's dental care now
this I just way too much information
cluttered here with the type I
everything's kind of just pushed
together it's not a great color scheme
either these two colors kind of clash
here's another one definitely better I
pretty much in every aspect you know the
color theme works a lot better I the
type is laid out a lot better but this
guy completely wasted his time it just
really sucks and in the world's not fair
but you know what you can kind of avoid
the whole not fair scenario when it
comes to design competitions by simply
choosing not to enter them all right so
I'm actually going to be doing a an
experiment here in 2015 coming up I'm
going to submit maybe for a week or so I
a bunch of designs to a bunch of logo
design competitions at a site like 99
designs and I'm going to report back my
findings based on each of the
competitions and I'm pretty certain that
the results you know I'm not going to
win the majority I'm not going to win
anywhere near close to majority there
may be a couple cases where maybe
someone did design a better lower than
that actually won but that's not going
to be the majority I can pretty much
guarantee so look out for that video so
yeah check out these on course com if
you haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube all right goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
