and then alright so one of the most
usable features of angular 4 is the fact
that now aside from just being able to
do if statements we can also specify if
else and also if then and what this
allows you to do is to bind these two
templates in your HTML and it makes life
a lot easier and more organized in your
views alright so we're going to install
angular 4 now at the time recording this
official angular 4 has not been released
so we're gonna do a little bit of like
upgrading with the angular command-line
interface but in the future is gonna be
much simpler and I mention all this and
this entire tutorials outline in written
format and you can access that tutorial
below here in the YouTube description
alright so make sure you check out
corset Rio comp for more angular related
content and courses and tutorials and
also subscribe here on YouTube let's get
started all right so let's start a new
project with the angular CLI or command
line interface if you don't yet have
that installed just go to CLI angular
Daioh it'll show you what you need to
run in your console in order to install
it and of course you need NPM and nodejs
and all that stuff but I'm not gonna
cover that here alright so we're just
gonna run in our projects folder ng new
and we'll just call this if-else - proj
for project so this is gonna take a few
minutes so I'm just gonna go ahead and
pause and come back when it's done all
right stuns go ahead and CD into that
directory so CD if else proj alright
great so now let's go ahead and open up
the code editor alright in here is the
project folder I'm going to click on
package JJ's in right here and real
quickly just check out the version
everything's at 2.3 which is angular 2.3
so what that means is based on the fact
that it's March 12th right now angular 4
hasn't officially released so we have to
stall or upgrade it manually in the
console now if your says 4.0 plus just
skip over this next part if it doesn't
and it's still at two and not four let's
go back to the console and actually not
the console we want to go to the written
tutorial for this I'm this video here
which is which is basically what I'm
following along you can find it here in
the description of YouTube click on the
link scroll down just a bit and you'll
see if you're a Mac user then copy and
paste all this otherwise if you are a
Windows user just copy and paste this
entire line right here all the way to
the end so I'm going to do that because
I'm on Windows right click paste hit
enter and I'm going to pause and it has
finished and also typescript has to be
updated and I'll right click there and
then R alright and once that is finished
we can now run ng serve and if I switch
back real quick to the editor we can see
now this is updated to 4.0 release
candidate 3 I think there's gonna be one
more and I now we can open up the
browser real quick we'll go to localhost
oops not ionic sorry about that 4200 and
we'll see the app works great all right
so back in our editor I'm gonna go to
source app and app component TS so just
I real quickly and make things just a
little bit larger here so you can see
him I can control bead get rid of the
file view over here we'll see that by
default the angular command-line
interface creates this title property
for us bound to app works all right so
that's kind of important because we're
going to use that going forward to
demonstrate the if-else and if-then
statements here so going back here let's
go to the app component HTML and I'm
going to go ahead and delete all this
stuff and let's just write out a simple
div here I could probably make this a
little bit larger now so div and we're
gonna use ng-if equals and right here
this is just going to demonstrate a very
simple if-else statement so you can
always do if statements of course and
angular but now we can do else so in
angular 4 so we'll type in if all right
and then we'll reference the property
which is the name of title else login so
we're going to assume that the title
property is checking a user's logged in
state whether they're logged in or not
so if title is true or if it's defined
then it's gonna show whatever's inside
of this div so let's go ahead and do
that real quick the user is logged in
and then close the div and then well
what is login exactly is that another
property or what well let's type in ng -
template and then we put the number sign
or the hash login and that's what that
is in reference to so this is defining
the name of a template so this will be
if title is not defined then please
login to continue or whatever you want
all right so template and that and now
let's save this and we'll go back and it
shows us that the user is logged in
because title is bound to a string
called app works exclamation point all
right all right so I've split my editor
up here with the browser on the right
and that are on the Left real quickly
you can also say I put an exclamation
point to say if it doesn't exist then
we'll switch things so now it should say
please login to continue if we save it
and there we go and we can also real
quickly use operators so if title equals
app works and we'll save it the user is
logged in we can change that up and we
see it obviously doesn't equal that so
now it's going to say please login to
continue
all right so very simple to do if-else i
works pretty simply so let's go ahead
and work on an if-then statement so we
have I everything looks the same except
we're going to add a then and we'll
create a reference to a template called
logout so what this is saying is if
title exists then logout else login so
we already have login right here define
let's also define a logout real quickly
so we'll name it logout alright and I'm
going to copy just some quick HTML
off-screen based on that written
tutorial alright so let me just move
this all into view so you guys can
easily see it alright so this is a
saying hi Gary and it's gonna show a
button so let's just save this and we'll
see we have this button now hi Gary in
this button ok so if we just switch this
up real quickly
we'll see it'll show well by the way
it's not going to show anything here if
you're using it then so we can get rid
of this and we'll see it works exactly
the same if we change this up too if not
we'll see it works as well so this way
the difference here when you're using it
then is you can also define a template
for the true statement okay so real
quickly let's go ahead and just give it
some interaction we don't necessarily
have to this is pretty much demonstrated
this I this new if-then or else the
capabilities of angular 4 but what's
real quickly just add a click event on
our button and we'll bind it to a
function called log me in we'll save
that real quick hit ctrl B to get up our
component and we'll change this real
quickly it will change title here using
typescript to any equals true
and log me in and we'll change this
title to false so now we can click the
button and it should emulate what we
want and it'll toggle before between
back and forth the different what you
call templates over here that we have
for ng template login and logout if you
wanted to you could also create another
function and then that way you could
truly toggle back and forth between but
you get the idea at this point all right
so hopefully you were able to understand
all that it's pretty easy and it was
really needed feature within angular so
now we have it with angular 4 and going
forward you're I'm sure you're going to
be using it a ton all right so look out
for new angular 4 related content check
out course cetera comm and of course
