hey everyone Gary Simon of course Etro
now just a few days ago I released a
pretty popular angular 5 material
tutorial which I'm gonna link here you
can watch that that's gonna show you
exactly how to get set up and running
and also how to use and integrate
components somebody asked me though how
do we customize the colors and the
themes for angular 5 which is what this
tutorial is all about
now first just yesterday I did release a
brand new UI design course so I have to
give myself a plug check it out that's
also going to be linked here in the
description and it's nine bucks to
access that plus every single one of my
other courses so definitely consider
that my children kind of have to eat ok
so let's go ahead and get started here
the very first thing we're going to do
is use the angular CLI or command line
interface tool to get started with a new
project if you don't know what I'm
talking about go ahead and watch my free
angular 5 from scratch course so just
gonna assume you have that installed
already ng new we're gonna call this
custom theme and we're gonna give a
style flag of s CSS for staffs for sass
rather so it's just gonna take a little
bit to install this alright
and once that's finished we're gonna CD
and hop in to the directory custom theme
alright and then next we're gonna round
ng serve which will compile the project
to start a local dev server at localhost
4200 and then also I'm going to right
click here and make a new console window
by the way I'm using commander CMD ER
which is pre console emulator for
Windows and this is a custom theme I
created myself I think I'm going to
release a video shortly because a lot of
you asked for that
alright so CD code and custom theme okay
so what we want to do now is integrate
angular material so if you follow along
with the previous side tutorial that I
was talking about earlier it's the same
situation NPM install an angular
material angular CD k save it as a dev
dependency in the package.json file
alright and then after that we are also
going to install the animations so npm
install angular animations and save it
and the reason we're doing that we're
not going to be using any components
that use animation but you know it is
you should install this by default if
you know that you're going to be using
them in your app so i'm just including
that just to show you how alright great
so now let's go ahead and open up the
actual project this will launch Visual
Studio code so I'm another monitor okay
now a source app and our app module ts
file we're going to make a couple
imports so first we'll handle installing
animation to do that we're going to
import right here by the way I'm gonna
make my browser or editor bigger here
for everyone to see it's ctrl + + - will
adjust that for you take this at it as
an import
alright next simply because we're
already here in our app module file
we're gonna go ahead and import the
components that we're going to use from
angular material so I'm just gonna copy
and paste and by the way when I
reference or paste any code don't worry
about that you can go to the written
version of the tutorial because in every
tutorial I create I basically create a
written version on my site it's in the
description here in YouTube and you can
just follow along and copy and paste the
same thing I don't expect you to type
out everything that I'm pasting
alright so after this we're going to and
by the way all imported was the Matt
button module toolbar icon and card
those are the components were going to
work with to demonstrate theming here so
also we're gonna have to import those as
well so I'm just gonna copy and paste
that bit alright so that's those four
which align with up there so let's go
ahead and save that and next we're going
to use one of the four predefined themes
so if I come back here we're gonna go to
our source styles
sass and import the indigo pink for the
default angular material pre-built theme
they offer four of them but of course if
you're here you probably don't want to
use one
those you want to customize it next
we're going to import the material icons
because we're to be using those so I'm
going to go to index to HTML and paste
this following line right here okay so
let's go ahead and save that as well all
right so next we want to define the
actual template so if we go to app
component HTML and delete all that stuff
actually that's stuff too yeah I'm going
to go ahead and again I'm going to be
referring back to that written tutorial
so don't don't freak out by the amount
of CSS here it's really simple and all
this is actually coming from the
official material documentation where
they have their examples cuz I'm not
trying to do anything really custom here
in terms of the template so first I'm
just gonna paste this in here we can see
we have a matte toolbar this is gonna
create a toolbar at the top with a color
set to primary and then you'll see what
this looks like momentarily
alright so if I go real quickly to the
let's get it up a new browser window
here go to localhost 4200 you'll see
what it looks like so far
kind of looks like garbage if I hit
control shift I and I click on yeah make
sure this little thing is clicked on
right here we'll see what it looks like
on an iPad for instance so we'll just
refer to that from now on all right and
then after this we're gonna use some
cards
all right so paste this here and the
only thing happening here is you'll need
to adjust some time aid from you know
the the example documentation is that I
put a color of accent so we can see how
custom accent colors work and I also
change this to a raised button so that
we can see a background for the button
so it saved that we'll go back and oops
I minimize that one too and we'll see
what this now looks like so this right
here is the default oops that looks like
one second this right here is the
default colors that we use based on
indigo pink
that we imported so what if you wanted
to change these so now we're finally
getting to the nitty gritty part of this
tutorial before we do that real quickly
there's just some a few CSS rule sets
like this orbit here should be right
aligned let's go over here
again you can refer to the written
tutorial to get this stuff here let's go
to the app component sass I'm just gonna
paste this right here again this is all
in the written tutorial so let's come
back here there we go it fix that stuff
and everything's looking pretty good
alright so what we need to do now in
order to actually customize the themes
to create a new sass file and it'll be
in our source folder so if I just click
on this one for instance and create a
new file we'll call it call it whatever
you want I'm just going to call it
themed SCSS and the first thing I've to
do is import or create two different
lines so we're going to import angular
material theming just make this bigger
so you can really see it and what this
does is it imports all the theming
functionality and the next include Mac
core which is a mix in this import or
includes common style so next before
we're going to continue on without
actually creating this custom theme
section we need to first in order for
this to actually be included into the
project we have to go there angular CLI
JSON file and we have to reference that
theme s CSS right here so we'll save
that all right so now hopefully we can
now just focus solely in this file what
we want to do here is you know at this
point after these two first lines we're
going to create a variable here we'll
call this custom - primary and we're
gonna call the mat - palate mixin and in
the first argument which is the only
required argument we're gonna put in a
palate reference so Matt will say deep
purple
alright we'll save that now nothing's
gonna happen yet but just to show you
and describe what exactly is happening
here because you may be a little bit
confused is if you go to the material IO
of official documentation with the color
palette section you're gonna see all of
these different palettes here and each
one of them has a name like light blue
teal and cyan green light green etc you
can also see the one we're gonna use
deep purple this is where you specify
that name after Matt - right here
alright so hopefully you understand that
so all you're doing is you're specifying
a color palette next in order for this
to work we have to replicate this line
and create an accent color and this is
also required alright so we also use the
same exact thing so whatever you think
will work well in terms of an accent
color we can simply put here so we'll
say pink that's one of the other color
palettes you can also put a warning in
the same method as these two but that's
optional and we're not going to do that
right now so next we have two more lines
we're gonna make a custom theme variable
it's gonna be matte - light - theme and
we pass in our two variables from above
so custom primary and custom accent next
we actually you know at this point we've
only defined three variables and
variables don't do anything in and of
themselves we have to usually pass them
in to some sort of function or mixin so
to do that we put in add include angular
material theme and then we passed in the
custom theme defined in line above
alright so if we save that and we go
back to our project we'll see that now
we have this purple up here when
previously it was blue now if you have a
short memory just to prove to you that
this works I mean I'm not gonna sit here
in lie that'd be kind of ridiculous but
if I take everything right here
save it we'll see it goes back to the
blue all right so let's also go ahead
and let's make I would see if we contain
this to a dark theme because remember I
mentioned that this matte light theme
can also be changed to dark so let's do
that real quick
hit save and voila so now we have a dark
theme that we can work with and it's
that easy simply changing one word all
right so let's talk a little bit on
expanding on this matte palette mixing
right here so as I mentioned before the
first argument is the required argument
which is the actual palette that you
want to use it can also accept three
other optional arguments which is the
default color in the second parameter a
light color and dark color so let's say
for instance looking back at our little
pathetic project we don't like this
particular darkness or lightness or hue
of the purple we want to change that for
whatever reason well to do that let's
revert back over here so by default uses
the 500 and so if we want to go lighter
than that we would just simply specify
for instance 200 or 100 and you will see
that the top bar will change because
we're setting our primary color default
color to 100 all right so let's go ahead
back real quick and do that so we'll
change right here this value and in fact
let's just go lighter than 100 let's try
50 as that was one of the other values
as well so we saved that and now we
could see it's much lighter so that's
how you define default values okay so
let's make another change real quick
just so we can get a little bit more
repetition in here make this one 600 in
our accent color 100
so for save this let's get up our
project here save it and there we go so
we made lighter buttons in this context
and a kind of a darker purple all right
so let's also discuss creating and
specifying multiple themes alright so
let's go ahead and we'll put in an
alternative theme down here so we'll put
in and by the way just to save ourselves
a little bit of work just copy these for
paste them in I'm gonna change this to
alt no not all right just alt for
alternative theme and then right here
let's try a yellow and we'll get rid of
this
let's also for the accent we'll make it
gray and we'll make it a light gray 200
and then yell theme we're passing in
just alt and alt and then the one area
where this is going to change is we have
to specify a class so we'll just call
this alternative and this goes the
include goes inside of that so this has
only ever included if alternative the
alternative class of is attached to a
parent container in the template
somewhere so we'll save this nothing's
going to happen in the project at this
point but what we need to do in order to
actually use this is go to our app
component HTML we could attach it right
here and it would affect the button
where color accent is specified or we
can just wrap everything around it and
we'll do that real quick classy goals
alternative
and put it down here alright so we'll
save that we'll go back and that's right
it didn't work because I passed in
custom theme have to make that change
too and let's go back and there we go
very very easy so in this way you can
mix and match and specify alternative
different themes based on your needs so
one final area that we can talk about is
how do you theme specific components
maybe you don't want to theme you know a
site-wide
angular material theme but maybe you
only want to theme let's say for
instance the button component well to do
that that's real simple all we have to
do is change this section right here and
we'll reference mat - button - theme so
when I save this the only thing that's
gonna change now are the buttons this
reverts back to this default theme up
here all right and so you may be
wondering where did I get this name from
well if I open it up real quickly I have
this linked in the written tutorial
you'll see that I we have all these
options down here so Matt icon theme
menu theme radio theme and that's how
you can specify just custom specific
component based themes for angular
material alright so hopefully you were
able to learn quite a bit and sort of a
crash course and you may have to run you
may end up running in a few other issues
if you get really in-depth into a big
project and we're talking about
customization but in terms of actually
customizing the material theme itself
that's pretty much all there is to it
alright so if you enjoyed this make sure
