calm today we're not going to be doing
any design I just wanted to give a quick
update on his status and situation here
basically I up until yesterday I did a
video tutorial every day of 2014 I think
it's around 100 videos in 100 days at
this point in yesterday I didn't put one
up so basically the last week or so I
I've been feeling like utter crap first
I was just sitting on the computer and
then all of a sudden I see stars and
then I feel like I'm going to faint and
that was about a week ago and then
situations just kind of progress to
start again ringing in my ear a constant
persistent headache so yesterday I went
into the doctor and I wasn't sure what
it was maybe like an inner ear infection
something or so you know they do the
typical I the blood pressure check and
the nurses like wow you know this is
really freaking high so that's the issue
for some reason at age 30 and I thought
it was a pretty healthy guy I like to
lift I like a run a lot I so I have a
high blood pressure so we're trying to
get that blood pressure down I'm
starting to feel a little bit better but
I may take a little while but yeah I'm
going to be starting back up with the
videos I hope hopefully tomorrow so I
just wanted to give a quick update on
that and yeah that is that so if you
haven't yet check out design course calm
subscribe here on YouTube our goodbyes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
