hey everyone Gary Simon of course Etro
what the hell's with the three hour long
video you're probably wondering well I
realized I had this course sitting
around that nobody was using I wasn't
selling it anymore didn't we make it for
free so I decided you know what I might
as well just upload it make it for free
so it's on visual identity design slash
logo design and the course is structured
in such a way and you're going to see
after this introduction myself from
about four years ago and I'm definitely
a lot more chubby I drank way too much
beer I cut that out
anyhow at the beginning I just
introduced basic concepts that are
relevant to visual identity design and
then the rest of the course is focused
on three different projects that kind of
follow the same flow slash outline so
you can get muscle memory designing
effective logos and identity designs so
all of the information and even the tech
I you're still going to be able to
follow along even though it's four years
old I'm not using anything that's
advanced in terms of Adobe Illustrator
or Photoshop so you should be able to
follow along perfectly alright so if you
enjoy this make sure you subscribe here
on YouTube and check out by sight course
cetera com alright go kick some ass
so what is a visual identity a visual
identity are all of the visuals that
make up a company's brand so to
accurately ascertain exactly what a
visual identity is we first have to
understand what a brand is a brand
encompasses everything that can affect
how people perceive a company so
everything from their logo design to
their audio jingles to their
spokespeople their CEO with the crazy
wacky hair and attitude everything that
a company does that can be felt smelled
heard seen or taste even makes the brand
now a visual identity only concerns
itself with the visuals that make up a
brand so this includes everything from
the use of colors to the logo design to
the website design to the print and
stationery design etc now a logo design
is a part of a brand and it falls under
the visual identity and it's the visual
identity represented in
most basic and simple form so when
you're presenting a client with a full
visual identity you're not just
designing a logo you're providing them
with all the visual aesthetics that they
can use as a company and that's what
we're going to focus on in this course
so in the next lesson we're going to
focus on the use of color in the
relation to a visual identity the use of
color in design goes far beyond just
choosing what looks good together aside
from this we must also consider the
objectives of the brand and color
psychology understanding color
psychology is absolutely crucial as an
identity designer each color can elicit
certain emotional responses and certain
colors used together can entirely change
those responses so let's take a look at
the colors in which we're familiar in
what they typically represent for a
brand black is devoid of color therefore
its use in a brand can be powerful it
can be used to represent prestige power
Authority and even fear or uncertainty
white is positive pure and safe and is
regarded as such much more consistently
around the world than any other color
red is the most energetic and passionate
color common emotions that can be
derived from red can vary it can evoke
feelings of passion happiness violence
anger etc blue typically represents
confidence intelligence stability and
calmness when we think of blue we think
of the sky or the ocean both stable
consistent in calming we all of course
generally associate the color yellow
with happiness and vibrance as the Sun
is essential to life and makes us feel
good but different shades of yellow can
be used to represent caution or sickness
even green can represent nature and
energy as it's the most prominent color
we see in nature but it can also
represent wealth or even greed orange is
red in yellow combined red is passion
and energy and yellow is vibrance
warrants draws on both of these colors
to elicit feelings of joy and happiness
and positivity peak is personable
friendly and approachable it can be used
to convey childhood in some instances or
romance in others much like green Brown
generally brings us back to
nature and organics but can also
represent honesty connection and
calmness purple typically represents
prestige power and luxury now with that
quick rundown of colors in their
perceived meanings we will put that
information to use when we design our
future projects in the next lesson we're
going to take a look at typography
understanding typography is very
important when constructing a visual
identity and it's not just important for
the logo design it's also important to
establish a preferred typeface selection
that a company can use throughout their
visual identity first it's worth
defining some of the terminology that's
associated with typography a font allows
you to set the size style and weight of
a typeface in other words a font is
simply the delivery mechanism of a
typeface in a typeface is the physical
appearance and design of the actual
characters a font family is a collection
of typefaces that are intended to be
used together and consist of varying
weights and styles kerning is the
process of adjusting the physical space
between individual characters letter
spacing or tracking is the physical
spacing between blocks of characters not
to be confused with kerning which is the
actual space between individual
characters leading is the amount of
vertical space between lines of actual
text the first consideration when
selecting a typeface for use within a
visual identity is serif or sans serif
serif fonts convey tradition
sophistication establishment luxury etc
while sans-serif fonts are commonly
associated with being modern
minimalistic and simplistic in order to
determine whether serif or sans serif is
most appropriate for a given identity
you need to refer back to the project
brief the target audience industry and
objectives of the company will help you
make the best decision and the typeface
you use to display the business name in
the logo does not have to be the
typeface used elsewhere throughout the
visual identity now that we're familiar
with some of the basic concepts and
terminology surrounding typography we
will put it to use in our future
identity projects
but in the next lesson we're going to
take a look at what a corporate identity
guideline is an identity guideline or a
brand identity guideline is a document
that outlines several different aspects
as it pertains to a company's brand
first it will typically outline the
objectives of the brand in what the
company is about it will outline the use
of colors typically detailed with the
color codes in various color formats the
typeface selections along with a preview
of the typeface and also a presentation
of the logo some identity guidelines
provide specific instructions on how
their identity can and cannot be used
many of the largest companies have
identity guidelines that are nearly a
hundred plus pages of specific
information because they care about how
their brand is presented consistency is
key for example some identity guidelines
will show you what colors you can use
with the logo the margins that must be
respected when displaying their logo and
even the orientation and placement of
their logo in respect to other elements
ultimately an identity guideline seeks
to both display and inform others about
the company's identity in brand in order
to ensure it's understood and used
correctly allowing for a clear and
consistent presentation of the brand and
identity we will create a corporate
identity guideline in one of the
projects that we do in the future but
first we're going to conclude this
chapter by taking a look at the various
forms of logos an identity guideline or
a brand identity guideline it's a
document that outlines several different
aspects as it pertains to a company's
brand first it will typically outline
the objectives of the brand in what the
company is about it will outline the use
of colors typically detailed with the
color codes in various color formats the

ensure it's understood and used
correctly allowing for a clear and
consistent presentation of the brand and
identity we will create a corporate
identity guideline in one of the
projects that we do in the future but
first we're going to conclude this
chapter by taking a look at the various
forms of logos hello and welcome to the
first follow along project the name of
this fictional company is you versus or
in other words you versus someone else
so the name again is you versus and this
company is an online gaming company that
allows you to choose your favorite games
and it will randomly pin you up against
other competitive online gamers all
right so our job as visual identity
designers is to first design a logo for
this business and then as well provide a
full visual identity so in the next
lesson we're going to go ahead and get
started by sketching up a potential
concept that is relevant and unique to
this company all right so this project
of course is you versus and basically
the idea I came up with I when I was
experimenting with this particular
fictional project is coming up with a
letter mark logo so if you recall letter
mark logo is basically either a single
initial or multiple initials of a
business name combined into one unique
and relevant symbol alright so for in
the case of this first project you
versus we have the Y and a V so the
first thing I would do is just real
quickly draw out a basic Y and a V
side-by-side all right so the idea is to
try to merge these into a single symbol
so we can see right away they're very
similar the Y into V and that we can
take the Y and the V and transfer it
right here
this portion just like that so in and of
itself just having a why we can see a V
in it but if you just put in the Y as it
stands right here we'll see anybody will
just kind of look at that as a Y so
another idea I had was to basically take
the same shape and make a V up here and
make it thick roughly like that and then
down here make the extending portion the
bottom portion of the Y right there
except the space in the middle so this
in and of itself we can derive a few
potential different meanings from it so
first we have the whole Y then we have
the V up here but also in terms in the
context of the actual project which is a
gaming company we could see an idea of
vs. right through here we have this
basic shape and if you think about it
when it comes to the idea of competition
or being versus somebody you kind of
have this idea of a clash coming
together so in the idea that we have the
Y here the V here but also this edge
here which I basically emulates the idea
of clashing or competition we have a
letter mark that is effective in that it
represents the Y the V which is the
letter mark and also something that's
relevant to the actual company so what I
want to do is just take this final mark
I'll make a bigger version of it right
here and we'll make the V right here and
of course when it comes to just
brainstorming you don't have to be real
specific I mean you can if you wish get
out a ruler and all that but there's
nothing that says yeah
- you know basically make it takes all
perfect on paper alright so I'm going to
take one of my pens here and fill this
in real quickly
and then beneath it we would have the
actual type and I'm thinking about using
a boulder sort of all capital u and
versus alright so I'm not going to
really sit here and draw that out we'll
go ahead and do that in the next lesson
in Adobe Illustrator but this here is
the basic form that we're going to use
and I may also in encase this in a
circle as well and we'll also experiment
with the use of colors and make
something that is appropriate and
relevant to this business all right so
I'll see you in the next lesson alright
hello and welcome to this lesson where
we're going to take this sketch from the
previous lesson and make it a reality
here in Adobe Illustrator alright so the
first step of course is to go to file
and new and we're gonna call this our u
versus name and the width in the height
now when it comes to a graphics vector
graphics application such as Adobe
Illustrator the width and the height
isn't too important because as long as
you don't raster anything within Adobe
Illustrator and everything is kept
vector you can always scale whatever you
design to any size imaginable alright so
what I'm going to use for my particular
setup is 8:59 by 600 and so basically
I'm recording this at a 1280 by 720
resolution and so at this browser this
this size basically I want to be able to
view the document at a hundred percent
within this viewable canvas area without
any vertical or horizontal scroll bars
affecting the view so for you depending
on what your desktop resolution is I you
can set it whatever you need to you can
experiment and hit OK and you know hit
control 1 or command 1 on your keyboard
just to see if you can view the whole
canvas basically at a hundred percent
alright so for me it just happens to be
this these numbers right here so I have
points specified
and everything else should remain the
same here and then go ahead and hit okay
by default it has me at 96% but to get
to 100 again it is control one or you
can command one on your keyboard all
right just like that all right so what
we need to do first is to get the actual
letter mark that we came up with on the
canvas and so when you're dealing with a
logo like this especially the the form
that we had with that y and the V it's
always helpful to get out the grid so go
to view and show grid and then go to
view and snap to grid all right so
basically I'm not sure if you could see
this but you can see the grid right here
these individual points right here these
squares what I want to do is take the
pen tool right here and at the
foreground I have a white in the
background I have a stroke of one point
in its black so to change the color of
course and I or the other of these you
can double click on them to go ahead and
change you know pick any color right now
the color is not too important just so
we can see what's going on to have a
stroke on there okay so what we need to
do first is left click right on one of
these eye points where you can tell the
squares will intersect on the darker
lines so right here I'm going to left
click and then I'm going to come down
here I'm going to hold shift and shift
will allow you to make a perfectly
diagonal line and then hold shift again
and come up there all right now the
width of this I just want it to be one
of these grid blocks so I'm going to
hold shift and left-click right there
and then also we see this line coming in
the center between them and we want it
to click right around there
holding shift hold shift again click and
basically connect everything all right
so now we have the top of the Y or the V
and now we need to extend this down to
basically complete the actual Y all
right so I'm going to zoom up here
all right so we need to keep this bottom
portion of the why in line with this
line and this line and also end it on
this line so we definitely want enough
space in here
so I'm going to make basically two of
these squares long so if I left click
here and then I hold shift and come up
over here now we see that this one is
right on this line so if I hold shift
oops right there that looks like it
connects on the same path basically and
then come down here we want it to end on
this line right here so if I hold shift
just somehow somewhere down here
and I click we'll see that's not
accurate needs to be right actually here
all right and then just hold shift click
right here and then hold shift once
again and then click there that right
there is our letter mark so if hit ctrl
one we can see now that we have the
actual letter mark these two shapes and
what we can do to combine those because
right now if we look over here in the
layers panel will see that they are on
two individual layers but we don't need
that so what we can do is just go to
window and Pathfinder and then just
select shape modes under here unite and
that takes them and just groups them
into a single basic shape okay
so now what I want to do is just go
ahead real quick and I'm gonna make this
black and get rid of the stroke so come
up here hit zero and then we'll change
the foreground color here to black all
right so now what I want to do is I want
to encase this and an ellipse okay so
what we can do is left-click and drag on
the ellipse tool and just so we can see
the grid back
here first I want to go ahead and take
transparency on this tab and just drop
this to around 50% alright so we'll
select back on the lips well zoom up
once actually before we do this and
click on the ellipse and we'll see that
there is a center point between this
main grid in between here and that is
right here if you left-click and hold it
hold shift and alt together while doing
this will create a perfect circle around
this I'm going to leave it right around
there and then let go I'm going to drag
it beneath I'm going to get rid of if we
click on gradient we'll see that
currently we're selected on the fill
color what we can do is just click this
in the swatches panel and by the way if
none of these if some of these panels
aren't available for you you can go to
window and then click on them and they
will become apparent and then what we
want to do is come here to stroke and
we'll give it a black color and we'll
increase that stroke size just right
around there for now 13 points now I'll
hit control 1 okay so let me go ahead
and bring this transparency back to 100%
all right so this is our basic shape
what I want to do now is go ahead and
take the view get in hide the grid okay
so now what I want to do is take both of
these and I'm gonna scale this down just
a bit holding shift and alt now as you
notice when we scale down a stroke the
stroke width does not scale along with
it so it's still 13 points so we need to
determine an appropriate width for this
actual ellipse here that circles this
letter mark based on will its size well
or a scale well down is a viewable or is
it not as a too thick at certain sizes
so we need to come up with a certain
size of that
work well for whether its large or big
so what we can do is I'm gonna move this
over here taking everything ctrl C and
ctrl F or command C and command F if
you're on Mac and we'll move those over
holding shift so that way we just have
you know what we originally created to
work with and what I'm going to do over
here is with it selected at 13 points
I'm going to go to edit now I'm going to
object rather and I'm going to go to
path and outline stroke
now what outline stroke does is it gets
rid of the actual stroke and it converts
it to an outline so you can no longer
edit that stroke so it's going to stay
this width and it will scale down
proportionally this time so if I take
both of those by left clicking and
dragging
hold shift and alt I'll scale down we
can see now it scales down at that
appropriate proportion and I would say
that 13-point based on the size that we
started working with over here is
actually pretty good because we could
see at a smaller size it works well and
it's also working well at a larger size
okay all right so now let's go ahead and
get rid of the original one and let's go
ahead now what we want to do is
basically scale this up so that the left
right top and bottom match up evenly
within a square portion here so what I'm
going to do is just scale this up
alright so now if we look at this square
right here these are all matching up
with the grid and the reason I'm going
to do it like this actually I mean what
move it over to the right one grid spot
so that now we can add the actual type
all right so the name again is you
versus and we be using a font called lat
oh and so what I want to do is come out
roughly to right around here
and we'll make the distance one full
grid over here
and I'm just going to click right around
here it doesn't really matter for now
because the font size and all that isn't
correct and I'm going to change the font
here tool at OU and I'm gonna try bold
you versus and this is a font that will
be linked and that you can download all
right I'm just going to hold shift and
I'm going to scale this up alright and
I'm going to hit ctrl shift and at the
letter O or command shift and letter O
and Mac and that will convert it to
outlines all right so now what we can do
is make sure this is as much as possible
lined up evenly in terms of you know
having two of these grid blocks over
here and then to the grid blocks over
here alright now when it comes to
scaling on the grid sometimes it's a
little difficult because we want to make
it to this edge so all we have to do is
just go to view and turn off snap to
grid hold shift and scale it up so that
it matches up evenly alright so now what
I want to do I'm going to hide the grid
view and hide grid and I'm going to take
both of these and shift and alt to scale
those down and this right here would be
our black and white concept and this is
what we would provide and we will and
the visual identity guideline and what
we want to do is just take this I'm
gonna hold shift and just put it over
there hit ctrl C and then ctrl F move
this over and now we're going to have a
colorized version alright so if you
remember when it comes to understanding
color and colors
I obviously plays a very important role
and so in for this specific company you
versus the idea behind it is competitive
online gaming so when it comes to
competition a color like red would work
very well given its meaning and so what
I want to do is make this a red color so
in the swatches I'm just going to click
on this CMYK red over here and I also
want to create some differentiation
between you in vs. so if we want to
split these up all you have to do
because right now since they were all on
the same type layer they're all in the
same group all you have to do is right
click ungroup layers and so now we could
select each one individually and now we
can just select the two words
individually versus first hit ctrl G and
then you control G as well so now
they're all they're on the same group
and so I want to make the vs. the same
color red right here alright so we have
a black and white version our color
version and you can take it a step
further if you wish control C and
control F and we can create a version
that's a little bit more dynamic by
having highlights if you wish so that's
what I'll do over here I'm going to zoom
up alright and I'm going to use the pen
tool and I'm going to select white for
the foreground and I'm going to come in
here
left click now sometimes you can hit
control Z to undo if you want to get
these to line up correctly and I'm
holding shift because remember these are
45-degree angles now I'm not going to
hold shift here I'm just going to
connect it like that
and I'm going to do the same thing on
the inside of the right portion of the
top of the Y hold shift
all right and then one more right here
hold shift just like that
take control one we can see now this has
a little bit more finer detail and I'm
going to zoom back up real quick with
the magnifying glass eye lift click and
dragging and I'm going to select this
base red color and then I'm going to
come over here double click on it and
select a darker color for a shadow so
the shadow I'm just going to have on
this portion so I'm going to click right
around here hold shift and come down and
then come up here and then do the same
thing right here
all right and that is basically it so
now we have our three different logo
with logos with their color treatments
that can be specified to be used in
different areas and we'll go over that
when we tackle the visual identity
guideline but before we get to that
point I want to take these all of them
and just drag them up and I'm going to
create a black background so I'm going
to take left click pull out select the
rectangle and create a black rectangle
and we'll make this block right here and
I'm gonna click on layers down here or
you can go to window layers and I'm
gonna drag this to the bottom just by
left clicking and dragging
if you can't quit get quite to the
bottom just take whatever layer is
beneath it and drag it up so now it's
beneath all of these layers right here
and I'm going to click right here to
toggle the lock so we can't select it
now what I want to do is take all of
these by left-clicking dragging hit ctrl
C and then ctrl F to duplicate alright
so now we can see on a black background
obviously these left unchanged we can't
see half of it so what we want to do I'm
just going to select up here I know that
ring is up here we'll make this white
and then the this portion and this can
be white so when we're restricted to
just black or white or just one color on
a black background this is what we would
specify is being used we'll take the U
right here in the U over here by holding
shift and then making those white as
well all right so what you want to do
now is save this by going to file and
save as so that you have this for use in
the future lessons alright so in the
next lesson we're going to go ahead and
construct that identity guideline
alright I'll see you then
alright so you want to make sure you
have the document from the previous
lesson open
we want to save this as a new document
so go ahead to file save as I'm going to
name an identity guideline dot AI and
hit save and then hit OK alright so what
we want to do usually when it comes to
an identity guideline of sorts I you
want to first showcase the actual logo
so what we're gonna do is use the full
version of the logo with hat which has
the highlights and the shadows so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hold all and
just use my scroll wheel to zoom out a
little bit I'm going to take these and
just move them off screen as well as
these as well all right so I'm also
going to expand the layers here and I'm
going to get rid of this black all right
so now we have the logo over here and
I'm going to scale that up and get that
in the center roughly and I want to also
edit this artboard so that it is longer
so if we click on preferences no
document setup sorry hit edit artboards
we can now adjust this so it is longer
and height and if we need to we'll go
ahead and just it as needed once we move
on okay so we have the actual logo here
presented and this is at 100% here and
what we want to do is beneath it now
when it's also important to realize that
when it comes to these identity
guidelines you don't there's no set sort
of standard and how you know what has to
come next or whatever you actually have
some freedom I but when it comes to a
few basic I guess you could say
universality is between all these are
you know they do include you know
presenting the logo in the various forms
in terms of colors a black white version
showcasing the logo maybe on the black
background
I also showcasing the the type faces the
preferences for that and also a few
other things so what I'm going to do
next is just show the other like the
black/white version and then they also
simple to color version and then also
what the logo looks like on a black
background so that's what we're going to
do down here so what I'm going to do I'm
going to zoom out here and basically I'm
gonna take these two right here and I'm
gonna move them right over here and also
scale them down holding shift and we'll
leave them right around there and also
you wanna make sure you have the same
amount of white space as you do from the
top of the logo in the bottom and also
we're going to create a rectangle here a
black rectangle and I'm just gonna come
right around here and left-click and
drag alright right around there and I'm
also going to come up here to the layers
and just drag this down to the bottom
just like that alright so I also want to
take these over here real quickly just
these two and put them right over here
pressure scaled those down at the same
time but that's okay I'm going to go to
100% with control one and a real quick
way of doing that is I if I just put
that circle right there and then scale
it will get pretty much the same size
and then just move this over all right
and also I kind of want to add just a
very faint grey line that will separate
these sections so I'm just going to take
the rectangle tool drag it out and then
make the color just a light gray or c9
c99 and now we can actually see that you
can select it and use your keyboard
arrow keys
get that in position I'm also going to
duplicate that ctrl C and ctrl F hold
shift and move it down right there
alright so very simple I so now what I
want to do I wanted to kind of do an
explanation of you know what this letter
mark is supposed to represent so what
I'll do is take the black version I
adjust the actual letter mark not this
circle around it and I'll hit ctrl C and
ctrl F come down here hold shift and
scale it up a little bit and um position
this first one right around here so of
course this letter market represents
three different things mainly it
represents the actual Y for you the V
for versus and then the actual The Clash
that's where I'm gonna call the
competition mark so we'll cover each of
those three and show a way of just kind
of how we can convey what these mean
exactly so if I take the type tool above
this and I just put in a caps all caps
y-o-u and will change to lat oh and I
don't want to do hang on we'll try light
all right and what we can do is take
just the oh and you and we'll make the
color of those like a light gray so that
it stands out the y ou in you so the Y
stands out the o you doesn't but it lets
people know this full Y is actually the
Y alright so what we'll do now let's
take that control C and control F and
we'll change this here we'll just select
the gray portion ers us and change the Y
to a V and we'll take this bottom one
right here this shape and also make that
the same color as the text above so it
shows just the V portion up here make
that a little bit lighter
alright so then what I want to do is
take this over here control C and
control F and move it over here and I'm
going to change this text
a competition mark alright so how do we
show what we're trying to convey with
this whole clash slash you know sideways
V well what we can do is zoom up real
quick and real quickly I want to just
make a quick adjustment on this so that
we can get rid of the space in here and
make this portion just a gray so what I
can do is take the pen tool right here
I'm going to come up right around here
it doesn't have to be too specific even
if there's a little bit of edge right
there come over around here and then it
ctrl shift and D that will divide the
object below it like that and I will
make it this color right here and what
we can do real quickly by i zoom up here
is select this with your Gillette direct
selection tool delete it and then just
move this down slightly and then we
could take the this right here those two
points hold shift and move them right
against it all right almost done and
then what we can do is take this these
two points and just simply move them up
perfect all right so we're naming this
the competition mark and this is just
the first part of demonstrating you know
where this comes from within this basic
form so I'm going to take this control C
ctrl F just move it over here some
around there somewhere and I want to
delete this and then take both of those
ctrl C and ctrl F we'll right click
transform reflect make sure it's
vertical and hit OK then hold shift and
just move it over right there so this is
the actual competition mark and if I
move this over here and real quickly
create kind of like an arrow
just with that rectangle and then we'll
take the pen tool shift shift left click
and then shift once again we'll have an
basically telling me okay we're getting
this competition this versus you know
one entity against another entity from
this shape right here that comes from
the letter mark alright so now I what we
can do is sometimes it's not necessary
for every identity project I but you can
come up with a pattern that can be used
on various media whether it be business
cards or anything like that so my idea
is to come up is take take both of these
at ctrl G and hit ctrl C and ctrl F to
duplicate those and we can create a sort
of pattern from this competition mark
alright so if we take that ctrl C and
ctrl F do this a few more times real
quickly and move this over just wanting
shift ctrl c ctrl F all those and then
we have an interesting sort of pattern
that we can use and also deem I'll go
ahead and group those an actual pattern
that is associated with this identity
alright so it's important to kind of
define everything give them these labels
that way when you refer to it in the
identity guideline people understand
exactly what you're talking about all
right so all right so I want to go ahead
and take these over here and just Center
them in between these two right here
just so everything kind of lines up
correctly take the dividing line ctrl C
and ctrl F and we'll come right around
here and move it holding shift alright
so this is what we have so far and now
what I want to do is
go ahead and tackle the actual color
scheme that's associated with this
identity
all right so because white is part of
the identity I want to make the
background of this portion light gray so
what we can do to take the rectangle
tool and just go ahead and left-click
and drag out roughly to size right
around there just for now and you know I
may go ahead and delete that divide
online we don't need it since we have
this here and I want to make this quite
a bit lighter right around there all
right so now what we want to do is go
ahead and just take the rectangle tool
and specify blocks that will serve as
our color palette basically and we will
adjust this as needed based on the color
so we have black here that we're
definitely going to is associated with
this brand so I control C and control F
and just hold shift and left-click and
drag and move it over and the next color
would of course be our red right there
control C control F and another color
would be our actual darker portion when
it comes to the shadow let me zoom out
there all right and then control C and
control F and then finally we have white
all right
so control one and let's go ahead and
select all those and just scale it up as
needed all right
so now what's typical is to specify the
actual color codes that are represented
that are that associated with each color
basically and you could do that for RGB
CMYK and even Pantone we're just going
to cover the RGB and CMYK for this so
when it comes to black let's go ahead
and select our type tool and we can just
go ahead and put in RGB and then enter
and we can put in the color code of zero
zero zero zero zero zero six zeros and
we can make this one a little bit bigger
the actual value see it right around
there okay and then we can also come
down here and put in CMYK oops one
second let me take this top portion just
copy both of those lines of text and
then CMYK and if you want to know the
CMYK color value for anything just click
on it so we have the color here in the
fill double-click and you'll see see my
and K and these are percentage values
and you can put just zero zero zero and
100 so what we can do is zero zero zero
just like that control C control F will
move this over and we'll go ahead and
get the RGB value of this color it's 237
28 by 36 oops I'm sorry we're not doing
it that way right color codes right
there I was gonna do our G and B but I'm
not okay so we'll just take that and
copy it and then also oops come back
down here and this is 0 1 1 and 100 100
0 very simple
control C and control f and I'll click
on this get the color code there see if
I can also remember this 2,100 112 okay
so go ahead and take that 12 I think
that's right and then ctrl c ctrl F a
final time this I just know off hand is
1 2 3 4 5 6 FS and this is all 0 so 0 0
0 0 ok so now let's go ahead and I'm
going to select everything it's and then
hit hold shift and select the background
because we don't want that
and we just use your arrow keys if you
want to get this aligned correctly
vertically alright so let me go ahead
and zoom out so far so good and the
other thing that we have to worry about
is the actual I type the typeface
information and when it comes to I the
typefaces usually you have a primary
typeface and you can also have secondary
typefaces although it's not required or
anything i this is open to obviously
interpretation in terms of how you want
to construct it so for our primary
typeface is going to be the lotto or
Latos and so what we'll do is just put
in here is I a a oops and then B BC C 0
1 2 3 4 and this will give us a good
idea of what this typeface looks like
and you can also specify varying weights
if you wish I'm gonna leave this at I'm
gonna go ahead and leave this a hairline
for now and I'm gonna come down here I'm
gonna control C and ctrl F that and I'm
gonna put it in primary typeface
and we'll name it lotto
make this eye light make this one bold
here alright and we can also go ahead
and put in the varying weights and also
some lorem ipsum text just to show what
it kind of looks like in the context of
a paragraph alright so what we can do is
how if we click on this well if I let's
see here
there we go we have different things we
have a hairline light regular bold and
black we need to stick with light
regular bull and black and showing those
so if I come down here and I put in
light although that's not light that's
the bold one right there and then if you
go to a site lip simcom you can just I
go ahead and scroll down a little bit
you can grab some text right here and
we'll take the type tool and I come out
right around here left click and drag
and just paste that in and we'll make
this smaller here let's try actually
let's try you know we'll try 14 alright
and you know what we don't need that
full amount of text I'd say maybe right
here I can get rid of that and I'll
drink that a little bit
so that's light and then this will be I
think they have regular next yeah
and we'll change that the regular change
this to regular we have to moaner do so
I'll just take both of those you can go
back to documents set up edit artboards
drag this down oops nope drag that down
quite a bit more and we'll change this
here to bold oops
control a gold and make that actually
bold do the same thing here and then
this one finally will be black change
that to black and change that to black
black there we go alright very simple
all right
and I'm gonna go ahead and just delete
this one alright so that is basically it
just for the time being for this
identity guideline so in the next lesson
what we're gonna do is go ahead and
design a business card and also tackle a
Facebook page that applies all this
information as it needs to be for that
design and then we'll come back and
we'll add both of those kind of just as
graphics and previews inside of this
identity guideline at the end of this
chapter in this project alright so I
will see you then alright so in this
lettuce in we're gonna go ahead and
design a front and back business card
and for the first time apply the visual
identity the logo and everything else
here that we set forth in this identity
guideline to an actual project so a
business card of course is one of the
most basic forms of applying official
identity for a company so go ahead and
open up from the project files the card
I file alright so if it control one will
get to 100% i I'm gonna zoom a little
more just so we can see a little bit
better so if I go real quick over here
to view and guides show guides and you
can see the shortcut key right here
which I'm going to use from now on which
is control and a semicolon
we'll have the actual guides here so
there's a few things that you need to
understand when it comes basically to
print design I so out here this red line
that's what you called the bleed so
every the space between this black line
and this red line is what's called the
bleed
now the bleed is basically any type of
background elements that need to be
included on the very you know all the
way to the edge of the card need to be
included out to this area and then you
have the trim this black line is a trim
and the trim is basically where the
printer is whoever's printing them will
attempt to cut the card all right so
obviously when it comes to background
elements as well that's why they need to
extend beyond this trim line just so
nothing gets cut off and then inside of
these guides that we have here this is
the safe zone so if it comes to like
real important elements such as text to
the logo you want to make sure they're
well inside so that they don't run the
risk of getting cut off all right very
simple so I'm going to switch over here
and I'm going to grab this logo right
here and I'm gonna hit ctrl C I'm gonna
switch back and then hit control V to
paste this in now hit shift and
left-click drag down to scale now when
it comes to business card design I
obviously it's one of those things where
there's no right or wrong way to design
so I'm just gonna take a approach to
this and just get on the necessary
pieces of content that would be required
for a business card so as you can see
here we're just going to I do a more not
so traditional sort of card layout I'm
going to feature the logo over here on
this sect this side and I'm going to
scale it down just a little bit more and
underneath it will be the web address
and then to the right of it I'm going to
have a black section where the three
pieces of information will go which is
this the the company's CEO name John Doe
a phone number and then an email address
all right so what I want to do is go
ahead and take the rectangle tool
and I'm just going to start up here left
click and drag right to those edges and
I'm gonna make it black alright very
simple and now I'm going to expand the
layers and lock it so we don't we can't
select it okay so now what I want to do
is on top of this is add the pattern
that's associated with this identity so
if we recall we can scroll down here and
this is a pattern that we have so ctrl C
and then we'll go ahead and control V to
paste that in and now I'm going to
right-click and ungroup that temporarily
I'm gonna move these down and just
select these bottom portions right there
and hit up oops
along with this one as well on the arrow
key to make sure they're flush up
against each other so now I'm going to
select all of them again and hit ctrl G
to group them okay so I'm also going to
change the color because there it's
going to be black on black so I want it
to be slightly lighter so that we can
see it say around two on two on two one
on the hex color code alright so I'm
gonna hold shift to scale that down and
we want to make sure these go all the
way to the bottom because this is a
background element so it'll go past this
trim zone and if it goes beyond this
area that doesn't matter either that's
okay so it around there okay so now what
I want to do is take those ctrl C and
ctrl F I'm going to zoom up real quick
and I'm just gonna move them and try to
tile them real quickly on top of each
other so I'm going to take both of those
hold shift and then hit control G to
group those ctrl C and ctrl F again and
we'll do this
ctrl-g one more time and then ctrl C and
ctrl F and move that down one right
around there okay so now I want to go
ahead and add some text on top of this
and this will be white text using the
primary type face of lacto and so I'm
going to take the type tool and I'm
going to lock both of those layers right
here and I'm going to type in John Doe
and the text is black right now we'll
change that and then CEO beneath it by
hitting Enter
so now I want to make that white and
also change tool at O and make it light
we're gonna make this bold the actual
CEO part and make it smaller as well so
if it's like the move tool scale these
down right around there take just the
CEO portion and we'll try making this
around 6 no that works now I'm gonna do
control C ctrl F hold shift and left
click and drag right around here this is
where the phone number is going to go so
I'll put 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 and this is
going to be cell and then we'll take
this one control C control F again hold
shift left click drag down right around
here and we'll make this me at you
versus comm and this will be changed to
email and then finally I'll take this
control C control F will move it over
here near the center will make it black
we'll get rid of the email portion and
then we'll Nate make this WWE versus
calm and I might make it a little bit
smaller yeah that's good all right all
right so now let me go ahead and zoom
out just a little bit just so we can see
it if you want to hide the guides the
shortcut is ctrl or command if you're on
Mac ctrl and semicolon okay
and real quickly I do want to get rid of
that top portion just right around there
and ctrl shift in the letter Oh oops
those have to be unlocked first actually
or you can go to object is path divided
objects below I had the wrong shortcut
by accident sorry about that
it's ctrl shift and emn and delete those
just right around there because I don't
want to go too high all right so that
would be the front of the business card
and you want to go ahead and save this
as front no outlines and I say no
outlines because we're maintaining this
text I always like to do that when it
comes to business card just in case if
in the future you need to create more or
you need to edit the text but whenever
you do send these off to get printed
they have to be converted to outlines so
let's save this again I'll call this
front dash outlines hit OK and it will
take all of our bits of text or just
everything ctrl shift in oh and that
will convert it to outline it's the same
thing as going to object path and I mean
I go into object and expand appearance
all right so now what we want to do is I
create a back version so we'll save this
and we'll file save as we'll just call
us back in the back is not going to have
any text so we'd have to worry about the
outline issue so delete that oops
we'll delete that
and all this and then wall unlock that
black portion will extend this all the
way and then we'll take this these two
pieces and group them control G control
C control f move them over adjust as
needed and also take these and with the
direct selection tool and delete those
and then I want to come over here we'll
come back and just grab the white Y
letter mark control C and then we'll
control V and we'll scale this up a bit
I'd say right around there and then you
can use the align to horizontal and also
vertical right here alright and that is
it so save that alright and then and
another lesson we'll come back and to
these visit to these business cards in
wool we'll work with them in a photoshop
a little bit to create a cool 3d preview
perspective of the cards and then bring
them over here into this identity
guideline alright so in the next lesson
we're going to do the second project
when it comes to not the project rather
but applying this identity guideline to
an actual project and this would be
designing a Facebook page using this
identity guideline for you versus
alright so I'll see you then alright so
go ahead and make sure you have Facebook
template dot PSD opened up this is
something I created that is reflective
of the current specifications from
Facebook pages and so if you're watching
this and down the line somehow you know
they've changed it I which they likely
will just go ahead and do a quick Google
search on I and do something like for
Facebook page specifications and they'll
tell you whatever specifics they need to
beef like a cover photo or whatever else
they decide to change or add or
all right so as it stands currently
there's this a cover photo it's 851 by
315 and then a profile photo which is
displayed at 160 by 60 160 but you can
upload this 180 by 180 alright so what
we want to do is switch back to Adobe
Illustrator and make sure you have the
back AI open from the previous lesson
business card and we want to just export
or yeah just basically export this
pattern right here so this is a couple
different ways we can do this I'm gonna
try just taking both of these I'm going
to group them and then I'm gonna hit
ctrl C to copy them alright so I'm gonna
come back to Facebook I mean on Facebook
sorry Photoshop and 4i
the cover photo which is this layer
right here I'm gonna double click and
make that black and then hide the do
mine the that dimensions group and so if
I hit control V paste I'm gonna use a
smart object that way we could shift we
can scale this up holding shift I'd say
right around there select the move tool
and hit place right click and click on
create clipping mask so that makes it
stay inside of this black portion and
then I also want to duplicate that
control shift in D or right click and
duplicate the layer move it over holding
shift alright right around there hit
ctrl e and select both of those and
merge them alright so that looks pretty
good
and now what I want to do is take a
profile picture and I'm going to double
click on that to change it from that
grade to white and I'm gonna go to file
new choose 180 by 180 we're gonna fill
it in with white and I'm going to come
back to Adobe Illustrator and we're
going to take our logo right here and
ctrl C to copy that go back to photoshop
control V and smart object hit OK shift
and alt to scale that down a little bit
with ctrl T and then select move tool
into place alright so very simple as you
see I'm gonna take this right click and
rasterize that and control EA then ctrl
C just the smart object layer and then
I'm going to hit control V and just move
it over here
scale it down ctrl T shift + alt + left
click and drag down just a little bit
that way it gives us somewhat of a
preview of what that will look like
because it does scale it down from 180
by 1 80 to 160 160 right so now I want
to add a file final element over here is
just kind of bland sometimes you can add
text although you should kind of try to
stay away from adding text as much as
possible because at different basically
uh cell phones or whatever it'll cut off
a lot of it and it won't look good on
different devices so just keeping a
general InDesign it's usually the best
bet so I I'm gonna come back over here
and we're gonna open up the u vs. AI
file from the logo design lesson and I'm
going to select this one right here
actually I'm just gonna take only the
letter mark in the circle control a I'm
in control C rather to copy it and well
click just on top of the cover photo
layer and control V make sure there's a
smart object and hit OK and we're going
to increase this quite a bit and say
right around there select the move tool
hit place and we'll drag it above that
take both of those right click and click
create clipping mask right there and
then you can move this however you want
oops move tool I think right there looks
pretty good and that is it so now what
we would do is come back over here we're
gonna save this for the web so files
save for web or alt ctrl shift + S which
is what I usually do and you can see
it's 180 by 180 we'll save it and name
this profile jpg I've already did it
once before just before recording this
and then we'll take cover photo I will
hide the profile picture layer hold ctrl
and left click
go to edit and copy merged now what's
different between edit copy or control C
between copy merge means whatever is
within this area it doesn't matter what
layer it's on or what layer you have
selected it will get copied it's kind of
like screen shotting whatever's inside
that area that's selected so we'll go to
file new ctrl V to paste and we'll go
ahead and save that for the web and
we'll name this cover and hit replace
all right so I went ahead and already
uploaded this from the first time we
record it before doing this video and
this is basically what it looks like I
yeah works out well so that is it so now
what we're gonna do in the next lesson
we're gonna go ahead and take the
business card front and back along with
the facebook page that we just designed
and incorporate it into our identity
guide line amongst these different
things that we have going on here all
right so I'll see you then all right so
what I want to do here in Photoshop let
me go ahead to file new and we're going
to specify 8:59 by 600 pixels 72
resolution hit enter we're gonna fill in
the background with a light gray so EA
EA EA is the color code and fill it in
and before import the business cards I
want to make a quick adjustment so I'm
going to open those up so we have front
outlines and also back and these are a
little bit too dark the actual pattern
so I change it just to this color and
that CMYK at zero zero zero 90 and I'm
gonna go ahead and save that and I've
already did the same thing with these
colors before I record it so yeah just
make sure you make that change and then
once you have that ready to go you can
go ahead back to photoshop we're going
to go to file open and oops not too
sorry about that
we're gonna go to open and we're going
to specify from our outlines and back
hit open and leave it out
300 for each one all right and this is
including I the the bleed so what we
need to do is specify with the
rectangular marquee tool fixed size and
choose 1050 pixels by 600 and what that
is is the 3.5 by 2 inches at a 300
resolution and that's the amount of
pixels that that specific size is so if
you left click once it gives you the
actual cut size of the business card all
right so you don't have to be perfect in
the alignment just so it's somewhere
around you know where it would be which
is good so ctrl C come back to the
original document that we filled in with
a light gray and ctrl V and then we will
also come back here do the same thing
and ctrl C and then ctrl V now these
little lines in here that was an issue
that when I was duplicating or
replicating those I not a big deal it's
not a real project but that's something
to keep in mind make sure that you push
those down enough but we're gonna be
scaling these down so they shouldn't be
noticeable anyways alright so take both
of those layers I'm going to rename this
one to front and this one here to back
and take both of those holding shift and
before we do that right click on the
front convert to smart object right
click on the back convert to smart
object as well take both of those we're
gonna scale this down ctrl T hold shift
somewhere right around there it's like
move tool hit apply and we'll take the
back layer move it over here we'll take
the front I'm going to zoom up a little
bit and in the front
I want to duplicate that so right click
and duplicate the layer over here or set
up the hotkey and that's ctrl shift and
D and hit OK and I'm gonna hit ctrl T
and then just skew this a little bit or
rotate it rather select move tool hit a
place and I also want to make it a
little bit darker the background one so
we could double click on that and we can
choose
color overlay and I'm gonna make this
black but I'm gonna take that pasady
down right around there hit okay just so
we can see it's a little bit darker and
if you wish you can do a third time it's
like the one at the bottom just like
that
and go back to color color overlay on
this one and make it a little bit darker
all right and then we can also do the
same thing here with the back version
oops sorry
if you hit ctrl if you hold ctrl or
command on your computer you can or your
keyboard you can left-click and just
automatically select that layer and you
can do the same thing that we did up
here I'm gonna try experiment with this
a little bit and trying to make it look
like it's kind of laying on top of the
front of the business cards so you have
all these tools if you go to edit
transform you can skew it you can put a
perspective on it I but it's best to you
you know kind of leave these things you
know try not to skew it too much or
distort them too much or it won't look
really real so if I hit skew maybe move
this up it place ctrl T hit place
alright and then what we can do is add
some shadows here to make this look a
little bit more realistic so we take all
of our layers movies to the center hit
ctrl T will scale them up maybe right on
that size holding shift and alt hit
apply and because these are smart object
layers we can scale up without quality
loss so just the tip there and okay
beneath all of this stuff I'm going to
hit ctrl shift + n hit OK for a new
layer and I'm going to go ahead and use
the pen tool and we're going to use a
darker color and make sure shape is
specified I don't want a stroke and
starting not right around here
going to click once and up there once
come down over here just like that I
know you're thinking okay what is that
that doesn't look like I but where I
click and we'll rasterize that and we
can go to filter blur and Gaussian blur
and maybe right around there is okay and
then we can take down the opacity quite
a bit or a little bit and that way it
looks like there's a shadow briefly on
there and then also our top layer we can
hit control shift and end and make it a
clipping mask hit okay we'll take the
brush tool and we'll make it black and
get that on that feather brush a little
bit more the size and come down there
like that
and maybe take that path you down just a
little bit that way we have a little bit
of shadow right there all right all
right yeah and that's a pretty decent
presentation of the the business cards
so what we want to do is we'll save this
I so ctrl s and we'll go ahead and move
that to the correct project and I paused
and went to the correct folder and I'm
just going to name this present business
cards we'll save that and then I what I
want to do is close out all this and I
also want to go to my face book up here
with the face book design for the page
and so I'm just gonna screenshot this a
specific page so I'm just going to hit
alt and print screen and of course you
know if you wanted to you could have
created your own page as well on
Facebook it's very easy just use Google
and just type in facebook create a page
and I'll take you right to the page to
create that way you can experiment with
this and so we'll go back to photoshop
and control and hit enter ctrl V to
paste and we'll get just the portion
oops make sure that's normal just the
portion where I actually know what we
could include Facebook this bar at the
top if we wish and right around there
should be okay all right control it in
for a new document paste that in alright
so now if we switch back to Adobe
Illustrator and we open up the identity
guide line now this is where we can put
in our previews here for the actual
business card presentation that we did
so I'm going to open that back up real
quick and it's right there
control a edit copy merged and then
paste this in here alright and also
we'll go ahead to document setup and
edit the artboards and pull this down
right around there alright let's look
and see what this looks like so far
alright and then I'll come back here
alright and I want to take this and go
to file new real quickly and we're going
to use 859 by will try 600 again and I'm
going to take this copy that control a
control C paste it in and I'm going to
ctrl T to scale that down
hit apply and then also I'm going to
create a new layer ctrl shift n enter
take the gradient tool make it white
make sure it is this one right here
that's foreground to transparent start
right here at the bottom hold shift and
go up right around there alright and
edit copy merged and go back to Adobe
Illustrator paste that in right around
there alright okay so what you would do
basically for a real actual official
identity project is go ahead and keep on
applying this identity to other mediums
using the same techniques that we did
obviously we just tackled a business
card design and then also a social media
design as well but there's obviously a
lot of other ones letterheads you know
just a lot of other things that you can
do and then ultimately integrate into
the visual identity and yeah that is it
for this project alright so in the next
project we're going to go ahead and get
started with a second visual identity
design alright I'll see you then hello
and welcome to the second follow-along
project in the name of this fictional
company is cut cake so not cup cake as a
P take that P and change it to a T and
we have cut cake so what is it basically
it is a Fitness nutritional company that
takes food items that are commonly
associated as being unhealthy like a
cupcake
except I making them much more
nutritional and healthier alright so our
job is visual identity designers is to
first come up with a logo that is
relevant and unique to this business and
then provide a full visual identity
alright so in the next lesson we're
going to go ahead and start
brainstorming and sketching an idea for
this company alright welcome to this
lesson where we're going to focus on
sketching out a concept for the
fictional company cut cake so just to
reiterate cut cake is a Fitness
nutritional company and the idea is is
to provide typically foods that are
unhealthy I in a healthy manner so such
as it is we have cut cake and the idea
is taking that tea changing it to a
piece and taking cupcake and making it
cut cake as in you can have your cupcake
you know of course and also be able to
maintain a healthy lifestyle
alright so instead of taking the route
of a letter mark this time we're gonna
do an actual unique symbol and so the
idea that I came up with I was sketching
out basically just I you know a general
form of a cupcake so if you think of a
cupcake typically it looks something
like this and I'll just make this real
quick if I can
and this would be for instance the icing
on the top and then the cup portion
below
all right so how can we take something
like that and turn it into a actual
relevant symbol that has some type of
nutritional meaning to it
so the idea I had is to I take this
basic form at the top so we're gonna
forget about the bottom portion and so
basically we have three different
dimensions here and you know whenever
you have a cupcake you usually have the
icing and if some people can really pack
it on their eye but this is the general
idea so we have three portions right
here so one thing that is generally
associated with losing weight is fitness
equipment or steps so I thought of the
idea of taking these and trying to
represent them in the idea of steps or
step aerobics for example and we'll also
it will also have the meaning of cutting
in a way that I portray these steps so
we want it to look kind of like a
cupcake and we also want to look like
steps and we also want them to look as
though they're cutting so the idea that
I had was to basically come up with the
following shape right here so we have
the top portion which we'd emulate the
smaller over here and come down here
and come up a little bit just like right
there and then the last portion right
around here alright so if you can see in
a way there is similarity between the
top portion of this cupcake and these
steps
sort of so let me real quickly just so
we can see it better go ahead and fill
that in with the pen
and there you have it basically as I
mentioned before it has the same idea as
kind of iterating steps I and also
representing slightly if you would look
at it from a general perspective the
actual cupcake and so my idea for the
type is to have the cut cape that cut to
cake underneath it and for the colors
we're going to experiment as well in
Adobe Illustrator in the next lesson
alright so I will see you then
alright welcome to this lesson we're
going to go ahead and make the cut cake
logo design a reality here in Adobe
Illustrator so I'm going to go to file
new I'm going to make the name cut cake
and go ahead and make sure width and
height are a fifty nine by six hundred
points and hit OK control one will get
us out one hundred percent and we'll go
ahead over here to view show grid view
and snap to grid and make sure we have
the pen tool out and I'm going to
left-click once over here not make it
about three grid blocks I'll clock
across holding shift and then coming up
one grid block and then connecting it
alright so now I'm going to zoom up here
a little bit and I want to control C and
then ctrl F of that I'm gonna move it up
just right around here and I'm going to
right-click it transform scale and I'm
gonna try around 66% which is one-third
I mean hit OK alright control C control
F and we'll do the same thing up here
right click transform scale and leave
that there
alright so now what I want to do is I
want to drag us down so that this point
touches this slant
and roughly the same area right here and
I'm going to go ahead and go to view and
turn off snap to point that way I can
get up closer here and I'm able to
adjust this with my up and down arrow
keys so that's more aligned with this
alright and now what I want to do is
real quickly I'm just going to give them
their colors this first one for the
color I'm going to make it more on the
feminine side since the target
demographic is going to be females for
this and I'm gonna make this here pink
I'm going to get rid of the stroke as
well coming over here gradient stroke
and getting rid of that all right and
real quickly I'm going to take both of
those by holding shift and left clicking
them take the eyedropper tool and make
those the same color that way I can get
rid of the stroke real quick each of
these are also going to be different
colors though so I'm gonna make this
color right here oops
make sure we switch to the fill mode and
I'm gonna make it this blue right here
and then this green right there alright
and what I want to do now is I want to
take this initial triangle and I'm gonna
go to layers here just so we can get
this viewable hit ctrl C and then ctrl F
now I'm gonna take the bottom one and
I'm gonna make it white and I'm going to
use my arrow keys my up arrow key on my
keyboard one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen fourteen and I'm gonna take the
blue one and drag it beneath now I want
to come out here just to see what that
looks like and I'm gonna temporarily
scale this down so I moved that up 14
times basically now I want to remember
that and that looks like it's pretty
good I think I might want to go a little
bit higher so 14 maybe 15 16 17 18
18 and 20 well let's make it an even 20
and then what we want to do is the same
thing for this one so control C control
f and I'll make the bottom one white
again we're going to take the top one
over here and drag that to the very
bottom and then move this up 20 times
basically so and I'm gonna make it white
it got that little gray color there for
the grid from the grid alright so we're
at a hundred percent here view and I'm
gonna go ahead to view and hide grid and
I want to see what this looks like when
I scale this down all right still pretty
viewable I may want to take this one and
scale in just a little bit more so what
I can do is hold alt and left-click and
drag that way it kind of comes in a
little bit more and same thing with this
all right that's a little bit better in
my opinion alright so now what I want to
do is go ahead and use the Pathfinder so
go window and Pathfinder and basically
you can't leave this as a white shape
and then just export it and save it
because otherwise if you do that this
won't be transparent so if you use it on
a different color background anything
other than pure white then you're gonna
see these shapes in here
so the way you combat that problem is by
taking this white portion that you don't
see hold shift and select the green one
right there and then you click click on
this minus front so now you can't select
that front shape anymore
do the same thing right here alright and
then finally we want to rough in this up
a little bit so that it doesn't seem so
I guess you could say straight edged
so what we can do I want to take all
these
I'm going to group them control G or
command G and just so I have a reference
real quick I'm going to move this over
here and control C and then control F
and move that one over to the right by
holding shift and what I can do is take
a tool over here and this is going to be
called the wrinkle tool alright so
here's what happens when you have that
if we select our group right here and we
select back on a wrinkle tool you can
see that and if you hit control H you
can get rid of the outline you see that
it really just does some sort of random
wrinkle effect now we don't want ours to
be quite that dramatic so if you double
click on it it will bring up options
over here all right so the intensity is
one of the ways that you can basically
really decrease or increase that ruff
and effect so I'm gonna change this to
ten and I'm gonna hit OK and then see
what happens when I do this all right so
that basically is it's a little bit
better you can tell it's rough but it's
not so much to the point which you can
can't you know discern what the shape is
in and of itself okay so I'm going to
save this I'm just gonna hide it though
so it's out of you all right so this is
going to be our basic icon for the cut
to cake logo so now what we need to do
is to get the actual type in here as
well so if I go to view and show grid I
want to scale this up or move this
rather so that it is in the basically it
is three grids blocks long from here to
here just so we have a general point of
reference for our type and I'm gonna
take the type tool and it's gonna click
down here randomly somewhere and I'm
going to type in our name cut cake all
right I'm gonna scale this up by holding
shift
and I'm going to change the font here to
something called prosto one or Pross
don't want I'm not really sure how it's
pronounced
all right right around there I'm gonna
hit ctrl shift and oh the letter O and
I'm going to make an adjustment here to
the K now if i zoom up here I don't
necessarily like how the K is extending
in here and I can also do something a
little bit different in something unique
to the logo by kind of cutting this
portion out and getting rid of that and
then also a little bit of a treatment
which we'll get into after we cut this
out all right so what I want to do is
I'm gonna go MUP here quite a bit and I
also want to right-click and I want to
ungroup so that we can just select our
text layer here hit ctrl or command H so
we can view the actual points here and
what I'm gonna do is take the pen tool
and I'm gonna come just right where this
line would begin to start and I'm gonna
click right around you may have to take
control Z a few times yeah here's what
I'll do is go right around there take
the direct selection tool up here select
on this middle portion you basically you
want to get this lined up so that and we
can change it to a different color and
then change the transparency just to
make things a little bit easier to 50%
just so we can get this kind of lined up
correctly right around there and
right around there is pretty good if
they're not perfect it's okay for now
left click on this top point and then
connect it to this bottom actually I'm
going to undo that ctrl Z I'm going to
come out here and then come right down
there and connect it that way it goes
around this entire portion and then I'm
going to go to object path divided
objects below what that does is cut out
the shape right there so what I can do
if I select with a direct selection tool
just these three points holding shift
and left clicking I can hit delete and
then you can see we have an issue right
here which we can also fix by getting
rid of that point we'll go ahead and
take the pen tool and connect those take
the direct selection tool again and get
rid of that point clicking on these and
connecting those up all right so I hit
control 1 so now if I take this and I
move it over roughly I would say right
around here I hit control C and then
ctrl F to duplicate that select the
bottom one take the eyedropper tool and
select white and then move it over with
your left arrow key a couple times hit
control one we can basically take this
idea with this arrow that's cutting into
the K and that's just a unique treatment
on the type that is relevant to the idea
of you know cutting or losing weight
okay
so now if we take all these I oh yeah
real quick we definitely want to come
over here select this and that layer go
to window Pathfinder and then minus the
front okay alright so now I let's go
ahead and scale this up so that this is
of
a more even proportion or centered up in
relation to the actual symbol and I
think that right there I may want to
move it up just a little bit and then
take the cake portion and we'll make it
to this same color right here which is
the dominant feminine color all right so
now let's go ahead hit control G and now
all those are on their own layer I'm
going to hold shift and alt touch the
scale is down a little bit control C
control F and move these over take both
of them and get them into the line a
little bit this one right here can be
black and we have a colored version here
and then we can also go ahead real
quickly I'm going to go to window and
hide our view rather hide the grid and
we'll get the black out here and I'll
drop this to the bottom we'll lock it
take these two control C control F and
we'll make this all white and this right
oops
and we'll take the direct selection tool
select around where the cut would be and
just make that white and there we go all
right so that includes this lesson in
the next lesson we're going to go ahead
and construct a visual identity
guideline for this fictional company
make sure you save your file though here
as an AI alright I'll see you in the
next lesson alright so what we want to
do is open up the identity guide line
from the previous project and we're
going to use this as a basic outline or
a template for this project and also the
third project as well so what we want to
do now is open up the logo that we
created in the previous lesson and I've
paused an open mind up here and what we
want to do is take this version the
color version and I'm going to remove
this and paste this up here
ship the knowledge is to scale this up a
bit alright and I'm also going to group
it control G and then I'm going to get
rid of these over here oops let me
select that and lock that layer and get
rid of those also make sure you save
this in a new folder you don't overwrite
the other one if you wish to keep that
and let's go back here and we want to
get this paste that over here oops sorry
about that and also come over here and
take these two and I'm gonna scale both
of these down equally so hold shift the
move tool right around there and then
select this one we can position it over
here
it's still on we could scale down as
well yeah right around the same size
alright so now we have a preview of the
different colors.i in the different
variations of the logo and now we can do
an explanation down here about the
actual cupcake so what I want to do is
take all these and just remove them all
right and so yeah we could take the this
version the black-and-white version just
want to sticks out the most and copy
that by ctrl c ctrl F hold shift and
bring it down and we can also get rid of
the the type so if we select it right
click and ungroup get rid of the type
right here and we can basically begin to
describe what's happening here in the
symbol alright so what I can do is
you can zoom up here just a little bit
and I'm gonna take the pen tool and I'm
going to real quickly just design sort
of a cupcake kind of like how I did in
the sketching process
and I'm just holding alt when I do that
and left clicking to get rid of the
Anchor Point and I mean it let me back
up here a little bit
alt left click come out there around
there and I'm going to be adjusting
these a little bit moving these over
here just with the direct selection tool
and I'm going to just make this an
outline so I'm gonna get rid of that for
the fill and then switch to the stroke
give it a one-point stroke and also make
it gray all right okay so if I hit
control one all right we can see a very
quick you might want to refine that more
if this were a real project but I this
is the idea behind it is a cupcake and
you could illustrate it but I'm not
going to what I'm gonna do is just put
in I stairs ascending cutting alright
alright so let's get this into position
here move this over there
alright alright so now we can also
specify a color scheme and so what we'll
do I'm going to take all these ctrl C
paste that right there and scale this
down just temporarily will remove it
once we're done and we'll go ahead and
put in the actual color scheme so I'm
going to take that layer right there and
lock that so we can't select it and I'm
going to leave the black here this is
going to change to this color this will
change to the blue this will change to a
green just like that alright so now we
have to update these values to reflect
these actual color codes so just like
this color code right is right there
just ctrl C to copy it
and then if we select it again come back
we have 0 100 0 0 so we'll just take out
this make it that a zero the blue get
that color code
and click on again 70 1500 all right
just like that and then finally the
green will select that copy the color
code paste that in and that is 50 0 100
0
all right now that I've tackles that
issue and now we'll make the primary
typeface and we'll go ahead and specify
for these one all right and also all
right so when it comes to this font we
just have a regular version so all we
have to do is just delete this and take
both of these and for this it would be
worth having the secondary typeface when
you're not able to use these but that's
okay so yeah I now what we'll do I'm
going to get rid of these at the bottom
here just by deleting them and now we
want to go ahead and save this and so
that completes the identity guideline
for our second project so now in the
next lesson we're going to go ahead and
do a business card design applying this
identity for cut cake all right I'll see
you then okay so in this lesson we're
gonna go ahead and do the business card
for cut cake so make sure you have the
identity guideline open for cut cake as
well as the card die file which is a
blank card all right so first thing
we're gonna take the main logo here and
copy that with ctrl C and then ctrl V to
paste that in and then I'm gonna zoom up
here a couple times and also select our
logo here and scale that down and again
if you want to view the guides all you
have to do is hit ctrl or command on Mac
and the semicolon key just like that all
right so for this design we're gonna do
something a little bit different than
the first project because remember there
is no you know
salÃ¹te right or wrong way when it comes
to business card design so you can just
experiment with it and see how it looks
so if you ever want to Center something
in the center of a document we have
these little controls up here you can do
it horizontally and vertically so we
don't want to do it vertically because
it'll be too much in the center and you
won't be able to put any content around
it but we can't do it too horizontally
right there all right so when it comes
to the design of this I you know I just
came up with a way to really reinforce
the identity colors and that is just to
do this real quick so I'm going to take
this ctrl C and then ctrl F and I'm
gonna get rid of the type I'm gonna
right-click and ungroup it and that way
I can take the type and just hit delete
and I'm gonna scale this up a little bit
and what I wanted to do is create some
straight lines because these we applied
that roughen tool to it so I don't want
that necessarily and I want to make
these lines kind of come in from the
side like this and I want them to be in
the same angle as these three slashes so
what I could do is real quickly I'm
going to right click and ungroup those
and we'll get our green color first and
I'm going to use the pen tool and I'm
just gonna start off at the side over
here and then come down roughly the same
angle as this portion and then what I'll
do is go ahead hit shift and connect
that together alright so now I can go
ahead and get rid of the logo beneath it
and so if I just move this out of the
way real quick I can get rid of those
and then just move this up roughly right
around here I may increase the scale
just a tad bit ctrl C and ctrl F and
move it down this one will be the blue
and then this one right here we'll move
that down as well and that can be the
pink color alright so now what I want to
do is go I'm gonna get rid of the guide
so ctrl and semicolon and so I'm gonna
take the rectangle tool and come out
just to the bottom of the document
roughly right there control shift and D
will divide those objects below and I
can remove those with the direct
selection tool just doing that hitting
delete twice and then do the same thing
over here to the right coming just right
there
control shift in D take the direct
selection tool select just the right
portion hit delete all right so
basically this just gives us some color
some design and form to the actual card
so you know again a lot of this is just
all about experimenting and if we bring
back our guides will see that this will
be the actual cut portion so we'll have
enough of each color to make an impact
here so now what I want to do is add the
actual information so I'll go ahead with
the type tool and if you recall we'll
switch back to this identity guide line
and the primary typeface is prosto 1 and
so I'll come over here and I will put a
name and I'll switch here to the font
and what I might do is make them all
caps
I'll scale this down right around there
and I will put
the next piece of information which we
can put a email so we'll put John at Kut
kake.com and also a phone number like
that and then finally we can also put a
web address all right so we have our
four bits of text here and I'm gonna
line them just like that it will seem
pretty good and to give this a little
bit of color I'm going to take that and
make that name right there the actual
primary pink color and that is it so
that will take care of the front card of
the cupcake business card and I'm going
to go ahead and make sure you save that
and I've called that front and we can
also take everything control shift and
Oh to convert it to outlines and then
save this again and call this front no
outlines and hit OK alright so let's go
ahead and save this as back and then
what we'll do now is I'm going to take
it a different direction and what I'll
do is I get rid of the type and also get
rid of these over there and I'm gonna
hit ctrl + semicolon to get rid of those
we don't need them and I'm going to
ungroup those get rid of the type and
I mean I'll group those actually I'll
leave those the same right real quick
I'm going to get the color the primary
color here in the foreground and I'm
going to get the rectangle tool and put
it right there and then drag this here
to the bottom click on our icon and this
time we could Center it vertically and
horizontally roughly just like that
alright and that will serve the actual
back of the card all right so now save
that and that is the front in the back
of the business card for cut cake
alright so in the next lesson we're
going to go ahead and do the face book
design for this company and applying
everything we need to based on the
identity guideline all right I'll see
you then alright so make sure you have
open the face book template dot PSD and
what we want to do is also switch over
to Adobe Illustrator and make sure you
have the identity guideline to opened up
and what we're gonna do is take the logo
as stance eye and also to contrast in
the first project you know we include
the full logo with the icon or the
symbol and the actual type this time
we're just going to use the three slices
up here so what I'll do is just go ahead
and ungroup this real quick take these
ctrl C come back to Photoshop and I'll
go to file new we'll make a new document
of 180 by 180 for the profile picture
and make sure resolution is 72 and set
this to RGB if it's not already and the
background contents you can leave the
transparent and hit OK I'll fill that
real quickly with white and then paste
this in as a smart object
oops don't place yet and we'll scale it
down just so it fits here correctly
pretty decently
and I think that works out pretty well
hit the move tool and select place
alright so what we'll do is go ahead and
I'm going to ctrl a to select all and
then just edit copy merged because we
have two different layers here okay so
now what I'll do is just I create a new
layer ctrl shift n make it a clipping
mask right here paste this in oops I did
that on cover photo sorry about that let
me back up real quick and I'll go to
profile picture there we go and this
will be the clipping mask on that pair
and we'll paste that in and it won't
immediately show up cuz it pasted over
here I'm just gonna drag it right over
there
get rid of the dimensions and we'll
scale this down just a little bit just
so we can have it accurately match up to
the correct size just so we can just get
a good idea of what this thing will look
like alright so now that is done and
also something that I didn't mention in
the first project you know this of
course also gets scaled down to a much
smaller size whenever a person whenever
you post a status update or whatever so
that's why it's always kind of important
to keep it simple as possible and if you
are gonna have type make sure it's
easily identifiable at that smaller size
all right so now we'll go ahead and
worry about the actual cover photo and
just for this fictional project I'm
going to use a free resource image from
a user on deviantART comm and they have
a resources section where you can just
search for random things I if you need
stock photos and as long as you check
out their their their requirements you
should be able to be free to use them as
long as you respect those and so I'm
going to use this and we're gonna modify
it quite a bit so I'm just going to hit
download and of course the URL is right
here and once you click download it will
download a larger size in another window
I'm going to right click and copy image
which you should be able to do in
Firefox or Chrome all right so I'm gonna
go back to
this area and the cover photo I want to
make it this color so it's really gonna
stand out all right so I'm going to
control shift end for a new layer and we
can name it cupcake and make it a
clipping mask so if we paste this in
we'll see that it has a black background
so if we want to fix that real quick we
can go to file new and we can paste that
in and then real quickly just select
continuous up here as well and the
tolerance whenever you have that set to
a higher number like this and may go
inside or effect that area you know we
may also want to experiment with
background eraser tool so if you select
this you can quickly get rid it depends
on what the tolerance is set at so let's
take the size real quick to something
kind of large so it'll do a pretty
decent job right now the tolerance is
only a 14% so you could try something
like 50 to see how well that works so I
can back up a few times just so we can
get to that area and that seems to do so
you want to get down there that becomes
an issue though so you can go up around
here and if you got to get that
crosshair right there all right and take
the size down just a little bit
all right so what would be real quick
just to get a nice cut out is just to
use the pen tool with shape or path
selected and just go real quickly around
here you can hold alt and left-click to
get rid of the direction angle and we'll
come down real quick here you can also
all left click and drag to affect where
the next point will go and we this
doesn't have to be perfect I don't even
think I'm gonna be showing the bottom
portion anyway but we'll see come up
around and then what we can do just come
up around here the cutout area right
click make selection hit make sure it's
anti aliased and hit OK
and for me it's inverting it so ctrl
shift I will fix that and then ctrl C to
copy alright so now we can paste that in
and we're not going to have it a large
size where you can really notice the
block the very faint black outline we
may have to fix that though I but what
I'm gonna do is just scale this down a
bit maybe roughly right around there and
apply and I'm gonna move in here real
quick to fix this area up with the path
tool just come up around right click
make selection hit OK ctrl shift I and
delete BAM
alright so now I we can play around with
a layer blend mode just to see what this
might look like because I don't want it
to just be like a photograph sitting
there so if you select twice on the
blend mode up here for that layer and
hit your down arrow key you can begin to
experiment with different views of this
I kind of like that no not really
and again this is all about
experimenting you know I think what I
want to do this is luminosity whooping
goes to do is image adjustments and then
desaturate and when you go to normal now
it's black and white and you can filter
through these to see if there's
something that you additionally like or
so you can also drop down this and you
know what I kind of do want to get rid
of
and I'm going to do a really quick job
on that that outline because it's kind
of noticeable and it's going to go up
and around and come out here oops right
click make selection ctrl shift I and
delete
oops gotta make sure you on the actual
layer before you do that alright and
then the same thing over here and I'm
gonna go quick because you know if this
was an actual project you want to make
sure everything's really solid there
alright and ctrl shift I delete all
right so that that looks much much
better so let's switch back here to the
identity guideline and I want to take
this one right here the white 2 version
so I'm going to copy that
and I'm gonna create a new clipping mask
layer although if I I'm sorry if you
select smart object just creates a new
layer anyway and what I want to do is I
think I may want to yeah alright what
I'm gonna do is leave it just like this
hit place and I'm going to right-click
and rasterize it and I'm gonna copy
there take the ER the marquee tool and
just copy the word mark portion delete
it and then paste it that way weren't
there under two separate layers and then
we could take this one and situate it
right over here just like that alright
so I like that appearance and so that
wraps up the Facebook template design
and for this project in the next I'm not
going to bother with the section where I
imposed the the graphics for the
business card and also the this Facebook
page
simply because we already done it in the
process is the same for that so if you
wanted to do that on your own you're
completely fine you can just refer back
to the first projects you versus section
where I went I believe it's yeah it's
referred to as tying it all together so
right now we're just going to consider
this one complete and we're gonna move
on to the third project and I will see
you then
alright hello and welcome to the third
follow along project and the name of
this fictional company is photo graphics
so the first part of that would be
photograph and then the next part would
be fixed fi x so photograph GRA and then
fi X so basically the idea behind this
business is you can take photos that are
old or damaged in some way shape or form
submit them to this team and they will
use their Photoshop magic to repair the
photo so it's a photo restoration
business basically using Photoshop so
our job adds visual identity desires
again is to design a logo and then
provide a full visual identity that this
company can use in any of their future
visual media communication alright so in
the next lesson we're going to go ahead
and brainstorm and sketch out a
potential concept for this business all
right welcome to this lesson where we're
going to focus on sketching out a
concept for the fictional company cut
cake so just to reiterate cut cake is a
fitness nutritional company and the idea
is is to provide typically foods that
are unhealthy I in a healthy manner so
such as it is we have cut cake and the
idea is taking that tea changing it to a
pea and taking cupcake and making it cut
cake as in you can have your cupcake you
know of course and also I be able to
maintain a healthy lifestyle
alright so instead of taking the route
of a letter mark this time we're gonna
do an actual unique symbol and so the
idea that I came up with I was sketching
out basically just I
a general form of a cupcake so if you
think of a cupcake typically it looks
something like this and I'll just just
make this real quick if I can and this
would be for instance the icing on the
top and then the cup portion below
alright so how can we take something
like that and turn it into an actual
relevant symbol that has some type of
nutritional meaning to it so the idea I
had is to I take this basic form at the
top so we're gonna forget about the
bottom portion and so basically we have
three different dimensions here and you
know whenever you have a cupcake you
usually have the icing and if some
people can really pack it on there but
this is the general idea so we have
three portions right here so one thing
that is generally associated with losing
weight is fitness equipment or steps so
I thought of the idea of taking these
and trying to represent them in the idea
of steps or step aerobics for example
and we'll also it will also have the
meaning of cutting in a way that I
portray these steps so we want it to
look kind of like a cupcake and we also
want to look like steps and we also want
them to look as though they're cutting
so the idea that I had was to basically
come up with the following shape right
here so we have the top portion which
we'd emulate the smaller over here and
come down here
and come up a little bit just like right
there and then the last portion right
around here all right so if you can see
in a way there is similarity between the
top portion of this cupcake and these
steps
sort of so let me real quickly just so
we can see it better go ahead and fill
that in with the pen
and there you have it it basically as I
mentioned before it has the same idea as
kind of iterating steps I and also
representing slightly if you would look
at it from a general perspective the
actual cupcake and so my idea for the
type is to have the cut cape that cut to
cake underneath it and for the colors
we're going to experiment as well an
adobe illustrator in the next lesson all
right so all right so in this lesson
we're going to go ahead and take the
sketch that we did in the previous
lesson and make it a reality in here in
Adobe Illustrator so I'm going to go to
file new and I'm gonna name this
photograph fix and I'm gonna stick with
a 59 by 600 points and hit OK and it
control one to get to a hundred percent
and get then go to view show grid and
view snap to grid alright so this time
I'm going to left-click and drag out and
select the rounded rectangle now if you
go to edit preferences general you'll
see the corner radius set right here I'm
just going to leave mine at 80 points
and you could set yours to that as well
alright so if I just left click over
here and drag I'm going to basically
make this three grid blocks long and
this is going to serve as the actual
band-aid and then inside we're going to
create a another rounded rectangle now
this time I want to make the border
radius smaller so if we go to edit
preferences and general we can just
change this here to around 8 points
hit OK alright so I'm going to zoom up a
few times I'm also going to select this
and change the opacity to 50% just so we
can see actually I may do it a little
bit more than that maybe by 20% just so
we can see inside here so
take the rounded rectangle tool again
I'm going to come in just one grid block
right here and make it basically right
here that way everything is even and
lined up in the center all right so now
what we need to also do is add some
circles which will serve as the the sort
of eye they're kind of like holes inside
the band-aid we don't want to add too
many of them because otherwise that
smaller sizes will become blurred
looking but before I do that I'm going
to basically change the colors that
we're going to use so the opacity I take
back up to 100% and I'm going to select
both of these by holding shift and come
over here to gradient and you could do
the same thing over here as well I'm
going to change I'm going to get rid of
the stroke and I'm gonna change the
color to a brown a light brown color
right around there and then double click
on it and then just make it a little bit
lighter right around there and the color
code for that is d 6 B 3 9 0 if you want
to use the same colors now we have a
good general band-aid color right here
and at this one I'm gonna make a little
bit lighter just so we can see it and
that is EB D 1 B F alright so now what I
want to do I want to take this again
temporarily and take the opacity down to
around 20% and that way we could see
these grid areas right here the grid
points so I want to take this and make
it a ellipse and these will be white
basically so what I want to do is I'm
going to put one right around here and
hold shift make that white
and just so I can get in a little bit
closer I want to scale in or zoom up
rather and I'm gonna put one right there
I'm going to hit ctrl C and then ctrl F
and drag it up to this one up here and
I'm going to take both of these control
C control F move this right there I'm
going to move this one to the to this
portion do this one down as well
and take both of these control C control
F and put that right there now let's see
what that looks like if we hit control
one and we go ahead make that a hundred
percent all right so these are a little
bit too big for my liking so what we can
do real quickly we'll go to view and
we'll turn off snap to grid make sure
you only select the white ellipses and
hit shift and alt to scale it down
control one
and let's go ahead back to view and turn
on snap to grid we'll make that pass it
again on this 20% and we can move these
back into place and they will snap into
the correct position
right around there alright so if a
control one we can now bring this back
to 100% all right so what we can do now
is take both of those I'll take all
those and hit shift to deselect the
actual band-aid and let's zoom up again
real quick control C control F right
click on it and go to transform reflect
leave it on vertical and hit OK now we
can drag this over holding shift and
that should line up basically in the
same spot alright so now that we have
that done what we want to do is go ahead
and take everything right here I'm going
to hit ctrl G to group that and so we
can see now on the layers we have one
layer group and I'm going to if you come
down here with it all selected you'll
see you can rotate it by taking your
mouse right around here hold shift and
just go up once so now it is at a
perfect 45 degree angle and now what we
want to do is duplicate that so ctrl c
ctrl F and then we can right click that
transform reflect and make sure it's on
vertical and hit OK
all right so I want this one to be
beneath so this one is now on top and
now what we can do is go ahead and make
this one right here this band-aid a
little bit darker and so when you click
when you use the regular select tool and
you're clicking on a group it will
select the whole group but we just want
the actual band-aid shape so you could
use the direct selection tool right here
to click on it and that way it will only
select that so let's go back to our
foreground color right here and we'll
just make it slightly darker
and I'm using BF nine eight seven nine
okay all right and I also want to kind
of add a very brief shadow right here so
what I'm going to do is zoom up and I'm
going to take the pen tool and I'm going
to click just right around well first I
want to go to view and turn off snap to
grid so I'm gonna click right around
there you can hold shift and then just
up here randomly and then what I can do
is if we take this right here with the
Gillette's direct selection tool and
then this right here and temporarily
just move this over
I can go to object with that selected
path divide objects below and I'll go
ahead and take those three layers now
and we can move this back here with
those three selected and just move it
over a few times to make sure it's lined
up or as needed
actually let me go back right there
and then I'm going to take this one
right here that we divided below and
change the color to be slightly darker
right around there basically we want to
ungroup these right now and so right
click ungroup right click and on group
and then we want to take the outside
bandage layer so we have this hold
shifts like that one just like that one
and then this darker one in the middle
there we go once you have them all
selected hit ctrl C and then ctrl F and
take those and drag them to the very
bottom and if there is a layer that
won't it won't go beneath all you have
to do is just drag that up all right and
then hit ctrl G and once you have that
go ahead real quick over to window
Pathfinder and click unite then and ctrl
H let's change our foreground color to a
darker color right there and then go to
well we could actually do this two ways
you can go to object path offset path or
give it a stroke and we could just give
it a stroke and around 10 points works
well all right so now what we want to do
is add the actual frame pieces the
corners so to do that let's go ahead and
zoom up here on the upper right portion
or upper left rather and I'm going to
use the pen tool with view and snap to
grid and we'll make these two grid
blocks long these individual parts hold
shift select up there and then select
right here and if we go to gradient get
rid of the fill all right we may want
we might want to make it bigger but
first the it is definitely too large
oops make sure you select it and then
bring down the stroke size and control
one and I think right around there three
points is pretty good so then we could
take this control C and then ctrl F
transform reflect hit okay we'll drag
this over here morning shift take both
of them control C control F right click
transform reflect and this time
horizontal and then drag and down using
shift and then control one now with both
of them are with all of them selected
holding shift and left clicking and
dragging we can change the color to a
black for the stroke all right so now at
this point nothing is converted to
outlines as far as our strokes are
concerned so if I move that over to the
left control C control F move it over
here to the right and go to object path
outline stroke now we can scale this
down to see what it looks like at
smaller sizes and it looks pretty good
alright so now we can go ahead and get
rid of this one delete and now we'll
move this over we're gonna scale it down
say we're right around here and move
this over now let's go ahead and get
some type photo graph and then fi X I'm
going to scale this up
and I'm going to change the font here to
source sans pro-lite and I'm going to
right-click it or rather hit shift
control shift and the letter O that
converts them to outlines right click
ungroup select only actually going to
back up real quick sorry about that we
need to first make this if we control H
we can see that the FI X bold all right
and then what we can do is control shift
the letter O right click on group just
group these up control g + ctrl G all
right so in relation to the size of this
I want to make this a little bit bigger
so if I hold shift and scale it up and
place it right around here I want to
scale this down just slightly holding
shift and alt all right so if we take
everything scale it down and see what it
looks like at smaller sizes
everything's readable and that looks
good
alright so now what we can do is come
over here control C control F and we'll
go ahead and make a black and white
version of this alright so I'm going to
come over here and this will be a black
and white version and I'm going to make
this portion the outer portion and this
and this holding shift we're going to
take that little shadow and then this as
well and we'll make these black I don't
think that got selected
that black this wood can be white just
like that and control one alright there
we go alright so now what we can do I'm
gonna hide the grid real quick view and
hide grid and I'm going to select our
black color just like the rectangle tool
and go ahead and drag this to the very
bottom and lock it take all these
control C control F move that right
there and here's a cool tip if you
select all these hit ctrl G and control
H is to get rid of those points and you
go to edit edit colors invert colors it
will invert a selection automatically so
we don't have to change all those by
hand alright
and we also have over here the type
which can be white and then we have our
brackets that we have to worry about
will make that white them I as well
alright and that is it I when we go to
open this up and this is disapprove you
swine's when we got to open this up we
don't want the black background as a
part of this so just temporarily I'm
just gonna hide that this black layer
right there that way it's transparent
alright so go ahead and make sure you
save this as an AI file for use in the
next lesson where we're gonna go ahead
and get started on the visual identity
guideline alright see you then
alright so make sure you have the
identity guideline from the previous
project cut cake open up and what we
want to do I already saved this as for
the third one so save yours as well so
you don't overwrite it if you want to
save it and also make sure the
photographic s-- by AI files is open up
here so we're gonna take this and ctrl C
to copy it and then remove this delete
and paste this one inch shift
nolÃ© and scale it up to a pretty good
size right around there alright so then
what we want to do is get rid of these
three and I'm going to show this one so
we'll copy that put it over here and
then these two as well now this time if
we take all the layers real quick on
this portion with exception to that
dividing line scale them down maybe a
little bit more actually because these
are horizontal logos and not vertical
kind of like they were before this one
down here it'd be worth making this
bigger alright just like that and we can
move these more into line vertically all
right so that's good so far and this one
it's not really worth kind of describing
the icons simply because it's pretty
evident you know what this is about
photograph right here and then the fix
is the band-aid so I the previous two
was worth describing or doing you know
some sort of explanation but this one
not really worth it at all so I'm going
to delete that and I'm gonna come down
here and take all this actually this
right here is locked so let me find that
layer and unlock it in a layers area and
select everything and we'll put this
right here all right
and we can specify our actual I'm gonna
group that real quick and ctrl C and
ctrl F and we'll move it right around
here temporarily
alright so our main color scheme we're
not gonna use black this time we're
going to specify I'm going to use the
direct selection tool because this is a
group we're going to use this color
actually we'll start with the the darker
one the the darkest which is right here
so we'll go ahead and yeah we can select
this and then select that stroke and
then also specify the darker the
slightly darker lighter version and then
this version which is slightly lighter
and then this in here as well alright so
let's go ahead and delete that and now
what I want to do is go through this
process of lining these up so since
we've already done this you don't want
to see me sitting here doing this so
what I'll do is just pause this and then
when I have the correct values I will
Reba restart the video alright and there
are the values that are associated with
these four colors and the typeface of
source sans Pro I believe so what I want
to do is I'm going to open up the
identity guideline for the first project
that we did which is right here and I'm
going to zoom up in this portion and
then just copy everything that I see
here because source sans Pro does have
different weights so what we'll do is I
close that out
take these delete those and then paste
these in right around there and I'll go
ahead and select everything
so we're sans pro-change this up to
source sans pro all right and this I
thought it has a lot it has light
regular or extra light light regular you
know you see them all so we'll just
stick with this light regular bold and
black and so this by default is extra
light so what I want to do is change
that to light wait one second where did
this go must not have I copied that you
get back here dang it
sorry about that actually you know what
instead of doing that all again I'll
bring that back we'll go to uh we'll
redo paste yeah cuz that's not a big
deal fix sorry about that they're much
easier than what I was about to do
alright so change these all again source
sans pro will start everything off at
light oops yeah light and then change
this again and this will become a
regular bold and black alright and then
what we'll do is I yeah this looks
pretty good in and of itself alright
alright great so that completes the
identity guideline for our third project
for a photo graphics and the next lesson
we'll go ahead and do another business
card all right I'll see you then alright
so we're going to go ahead and apply
this identity to an actual project so
we're going to do a business card again
and so make sure you have of the
identity guideline for photographic s--
and also the card
AI blank template so what are we want to
do is again take over this
control-c and then paste it in here and
we'll scale this sucker down quite a bit
let me shift and alt and this time we're
going to again center align this
horizontally all right so I'm going to
click on align and then make sure these
groups know so we have to make sure
there's a group first before we align
and then we'll go ahead and hit
horizontal align Center and just drag it
down the tad bit holding shift all right
so this time I want to create a
horizontal block portion and just going
to use one of these colors I think the
lighter one so what I'll do is just out
here left click and drag right around
there and then use the eyedropper tool
to give it that center color and I'm
going to also drag this down just a
little bit and Center this up vertically
between this white part you can use your
arrow keys up and down alright that
looks pretty good
and I want to go ahead and lock that
layer so I can't select it and then what
I want to do is take this control C and
then ctrl F we're gonna drag it to the
top of that layer I'm going to
right-click and ungroup it and just get
rid of the type and then just to create
an extra element of the design I'm going
to create a watermark out of this
specific band-aid going that way so I'm
going to zoom up real quick and I'm
going to start getting rid of using the
direct selection tool up here some of
these layers so if I just select that
portion and you hit ctrl or command H
you can see exactly what you're
selecting it would also be worth it to
right-click and ungroup these layers
that way you could just kind of get rid
of most of it this is also a stroke so
we can get rid of that get rid of these
this and
all of these alright and I also want to
make these areas right here I'm just
going to actually a quicker way to
select everything hold shift and
deselect these portions just so we have
the white circles covered and then make
it that color right there all right and
so now what I want to do is take these
I'm going to group them ctrl G hit guy
control one zoom up a couple two more
times there I'm gonna scale this up and
move this over roughly right around here
for the size for the scale and move it
up slightly alright and then what I'm
going to do is go ahead and unlock this
layer and them to duplicate it so ctrl C
and ctrl F and then move this to the top
now take both of these layers and I'm
going to just real quickly go ahead and
put select this layer ctrl shift and D
to D I divided objects below and that
way I can ungroup this now and then just
select top portions to get rid of
whatever was cut off and that looks good
right there and now I will come down
here and deselect this will group that
again all right and then we could take
this again and lock it all right so just
a very you know kind of faint watermark
and just accent adds an extra design
element so if we hit ctrl + semicolon
we'll see the very right of it will I
will have just enough space to see it
fully at least to this portion okay so
now what we want to do is go ahead and
add the actual type so we'll leave these
guides up just to give us a point of
reference and we are using source stands
Pro for the font so I'll go ahead and
put in the name
and you can always just switch it up in
terms of you know how you're
representing the people I and all the
other bits of information so I'll change
here to source sans Pro and we'll use
lights for this I'm going to use bold
for the name alright
and then we'll go ahead and copy that
and down here I will put an email again
alright and I want to go ahead and take
both of these and scale them down just a
little bit all right and put this right
around here and then beneath this go
ahead and put a number and then copy the
actual C ctrl F and actually at this
point I think I could put the website
address online Dover here so
photographic comm you got a little bit
smaller all right just like that and I
think we can take all three of these and
just scale them just a tad bit yeah
right around there and if we want we can
also increase this just to fill out more
of this right portion and that is good
right there
okay so that takes care of the front so
go ahead and save this as the front card
you know I've done so so you can also
take everything here convert it to
outlines control shift letter Oh
and save this as well oops I'm gonna
back up I over wrote my initial one save
that take everything control shift
letter O and then also file save as and
front outlines all right so then real
quickly we'll save this again as back
alright and we'll go ahead and get rid
of the type here and we'll get rid of
this and it will also get rid of the
type oops
one second right-click and Ungar if that
alright and then we'll take this move it
to the bottom real quick and we'll go
ahead and increase this size just to
match the top I'm gonna hit ctrl
semicolon to get rid of those oops
and this time stead of centering it up
we'll just do something slightly
different and put it right around there
okay and then I will take out the
rectangle tool and we'll divide
everything beneath it so ctrl shift and
D take the direct selection tool and
it's like just underneath everything hit
delete twice and do this one more time
ctrl shift D take the direct selection
tool and delete just the edge of that
circle alright and that is it so yeah
obviously when it comes to a business
card design there's no right or wrong
for the most part when it comes to
designing just interesting things like
for the back of the card so yeah so that
is it for the business card design so in
the next lesson we'll go ahead and
tackle again the face book design by
applying the specs in the identity guide
line
alright I'll see you then alright so
make sure you have the face book
template
PSD open and also in Adobe Illustrator
make sure you have the identity
guideline three open and this time for
the profile picture we're going to
feature just this symbol over here so
I'm going to take this ctrl C we're
going to go to file new real quick 180
by 180 and we'll make sure this is RGB
because we're not working with print
fill that in with a white color and
paste it in as a smart object
oops did that last time there we go and
make this roughly right around that size
holding shift an all and hit place okay
so now what we can do is to go ahead and
edit copy merged that and I will select
the profile picture layer
control-shift-n for a new layer make it
a clipping mask and hide the dimensions
area paste that in control V and move it
over here and scale it down just a
little bit hit apply and you can use
your keyboard arrow keys to adjust that
okay and now for the cover photo I want
to use this color right here hit OK and
I'm also going to use deviantART again
for the resources images and and I'm
just gonna I found just a random vintage
image to use here so I'm going to hit
download and right click and copy the
image and come back here we'll create a
new layer ctrl shift n make it a
clipping mask at okay and then ctrl V to
paste that in and I'm gonna make it
pretty large and I'm going to take the
blend mode with my down key on my keep
Donaire on my keyboard and just filter
through these and try to find one that I
think will work pretty well you can
always adjust the opacity as needed
and I think something right around here
might be decent all right and we're
going to switch back to illustrator and
I'm going to take the white version down
here ctrl C to copy that go back to
photoshop and we'll go ahead and make a
new clipping mask control-shift-n
and oh you know what I think I did the
wrong one we want the black version
there we go we'll select all that there
we go sorry about that we're working
with a light background so we'd want the
dark one alright so go back here and
we'll paste this in smart object and you
know I'm not going to include because
that would be a little bit redundant
let me rasterize that real quick
right-click rasterize and and delete
that just something like this and if you
wanted to kind of I make it look appear
as though it's a little bit more of an
older aged film type of photograph what
we could do is create a new layer and oh
this is already an empty layer so we'll
just use that take the paintbrush tool
and you know somewhere right around that
size I think around 180 and I'll get the
eyedropper and choose a pretty dark
color like a dark brown and go around
the edges kind of like this and then you
can either adjust the opacity down quite
a bit yeah I think that'll work well and
as you can see very simple you could
also include like a website address you
know I think I'm going to do that I know
this is source sans pro so we could just
put photo graphic oops
fi X let me change that font real quick
source sans Pro and change this to bold
this one too light
and then put calm control-t put it right
around there
what's up move tool and hit apply make
sure that's all lined up all right just
like that
all right so that concludes the Facebook
template designed for this project and
that is it so go ahead and check out the
closing video where we will do a quick
overview of what we learned and also I
will introduce you to the design course
comm mentor program all right so I'll
see you then all right good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
