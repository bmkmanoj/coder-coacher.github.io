development crash course by traversing
media in this course we're going to be
looking at the foundation front-end
framework also called ZURB foundation
now keep in mind this is a course for
people just learning foundation so I'm
going to keep it simple and we're going
to do things the easy way not
necessarily the best and most convenient
way for advanced developers so this
tutorial will be very similar to my
bootstrap beginner crash course the
slides are going to be similar and we'll
be building a cheat sheet just like we
did in that video the goal is to get you
familiar with the syntax of foundation
and to give you something that you can
use as a reference for your future
projects alright so what exactly is
foundation or ZURB foundation it's an
advanced responsive front-end framework
so front-end meaning it works with HTML
CSS and JavaScript on the client side
ok that's nothing to do with the server
part of a website or application it's
responsive and it can be used for all
devices and screen sizes it's used for
building website front ends as well as
user interfaces for web and mobile
applications so things like menus
buttons lists and so on foundation uses
a mobile first design which means it was
created with smaller screen sizes in
mind first and then tweaked for larger
screen sizes and Twitter bootstrap has
the same design pattern all right
speaking of bootstrap foundation is very
similar they essentially do the same
thing in different ways and foundation
is the second most popular front-end
framework for websites and new eyes
alright so let's take a look at why
someone would want to use foundation and
this is extremely similar to the list
that we had in the bootstrap video
because they're essentially they
essentially have the same advantages all
right so it gives you faster user
interface and user experience
development you don't need to create all
of your HTML and CSS classes and styling
from scratch if you want a style button
just pop in the class name and obviously
you may want to customize it but it
gives you a really good starting point
work with it gives you smarter and
cleaner code so the markup is very
semantic and it uses all the appropriate
naming conventions and so forth things
are laid out very nicely so foundation
is mobile first and responsive so you
can use it for mobile websites as well
as mobile applications as well as
desktop screens laptops it's optimized
for all of these screen sizes so
consistency and convenience your code is
consistent because it follows a set of
semantic guidelines
it's obviously convenient for reasons I
just went over it's also a huge
advantage for when you're working with
multiple developers if they know
foundation they'll already understand
your class names etc and if they don't
they can just refer to the documentation
all right it's also very customizable
you can overwrite any of the default
styling I think it was built to be a bit
more customizable than bootstrap was so
speaking of bootstrap let's take a look
at some of the differences now I'm not
going to go into detail that many of you
probably want me to on this I'm thinking
about making a video that will really
compare the two looking at the syntax
side-by-side I'm not going to go deep
into it now all right so first thing I'm
going to say is that in my opinion
neither one is better it's all about
preference and I know from my experience
with my 2017 web development guide that
many of you have very strong opinions
and can take certain things to heart
even with that said I personally don't
see one as better than the other
overall maybe in certain areas but not
overall all right so bootstrap is
definitely more popular so naturally it
has more support and reference available
more people know it and you can get help
a little easier in my opinion bootstrap
has an easier syntax in some areas class
names and so forth now that may be a
good thing but on the other hand I think
foundation has more for advanced
programmers so the grid system is a
more in-depth and robust it's a bit more
modular it's consistent with SAS while
bootstrap focuses more and less although
that's not true with bootstrap for for
me personally I think that bootstrap is
easier to work with and is fantastic to
get something up and running really
quickly the reason I use it all the time
in my videos is because we're focusing
on a technology like angular or react or
PHP and I want it I don't want it to
look horrible
so bootstrap is great for doing that
setting up a UI really quickly
however foundation is more customizable
if you want to focus on the design as a
much flatter look by default so the
second someone sees it they don't know
it's a foundation website unlike with
bootstrap most designers and developers
can spot a default bootstrap style from
a mile away so that's my personal
opinion on the two frameworks and of
course you feel free to disagree so
installing boots off sorry foundation
there's a million ways to set it up just
like with bootstrap we're going to go
with a simple method of downloading and
including the CSS file it's not the most
advanced and efficient way of doing
things but again this is a beginner
course you could also use a CDN or
content delivery network which is just
pointing to a remote file I would only
suggest this for prototyping and
development and never in production
foundation also has a cool little
command-line tool or command-line
interface called the foundation CLI that
you can use to set up a boilerplate and
do other things and you can install this
with NPM or gem let's see
package managers create of course you
can use NPM Bower which is a client-side
package manager composer Nugent nugget
I've actually never used that but of
course you can use those as well so what
we'll cover in this mini-course
foundation for sites okay so they have
foundation for sites they also have
foundation for apps
which focuses more on advanced stuff
form command-line interface so we're
going to slowly focus on the HTML and
CSS syntax so class names etc there's
also foundation for email which focuses
on HTML email templates which is pretty
cool so installation and setup we're
going to get foundation set up and
installed obviously get set up to create
our cheat sheet so HTML CSS components
we're going to look at things like
typography UI elements like buttons and
alerts helper classes and so on all
right and also the grid system we'll
look at the classes that we need for our
12 column grid system and we're going to
create any foundation cheat sheet that
you can use as a reference for future
projects alright and really quickly guys
I do have a 10 project course by onyx on
foundation if you like this technology I
would suggest it we build things like a
simple business website photography site
project management UI ecommerce theme
and more so we do use foundation five
not six but 98% of the info is still
relevant all right so enough with these
slides let's go ahead and jump into some
code all right guys we're going to go
ahead and get started on our foundation
cheat sheet now I have foundations err
comm open that's the official site for
Foundation and if we go to Docs and then
sites Doc's that's pretty much going to
give us a rundown of all of the
components all of the styles and classes
and everything that's available for
foundation for websites all right this
is a really good resource just does get
bootstrap is for Twitter bootstrap
you can see we have resources for the
grid for forms for the JavaScript
widgets everything alright so we may
reference this from time to time now
what I have is I have a folder on my
desktop called foundation underscore
sandbox with an index.htm
I'll file so go ahead and create that
and all I have in it is this right now
now I'm using Adam as my editor and I'm
using the live server if you're using
Adam you can go to see packages live
server I can't remember if I installed I
think I did install this as a separate
plug-in so you'll have to do that and
then I started it on port 4000 so if I
go ahead and I edit this and say world
and we'll save go over to the browser
you'll see that that automatically
reloads all right now try and bear with
my typing I'm using a new keyboard it's
actually supposed to be a silent
keyboard some of you guys complained
about the keystrokes so let me know if
that if that's a positive change I
actually had a comment saying that they
liked hearing the keystrokes so let me
know what what you guys feel about that
if I should keep using this silent
keyboard or not all right so first thing
we want to do is download foundation so
I'm going to go back to the website here
and let's go to getting started and see
actually they change this around a
little bit I think we actually have to
go to sites Docs and then install
Foundation for sites and this gives you
all the different options it shows you
how to install the CLI tool if you want
but we're not going to get we're not
going to do that we're going to stick to
the easy stuff and we're going to go
down to CSS download click that button
and then you have a few different
options you have the complete complete
foundation the essential you can also
customize if we went to that you can see
we could pick and choose different
classes and so on but we're not going to
do that we're just going to do the
download everything and that will give
us a zip file ok we'll go ahead and open
that up and see we have a CSS J s and an
index.html file alright so I'm going to
bring all of that over all right and I'm
even going to overwrite the index.html
that I have all right so now you'll see
that that will update to this now this
is kind of a boilerplate that they give
us
I want to start from scratch so what I'm
going to do is in that index.html file
I'm going to get rid of everything
that's in the body okay everything
that's in the body aside from those
script tags at the bottom so we'll
delete all that and we'll start from
here and I'll go through this now
all right let's save that okay so now we
have an empty page so we have our
doctype we have our HTML tag with the
lang direction left to right head our
meta tags of the character set the
http-equiv meta tag the name the
viewport which we're setting to the
device with at an initial scale of 1.0
all right so just standard HTML head
stuff for the title here let's go ahead
and change that we'll change it to
foundation sandbox you know what's weird
about this keyboard is that all the keys
are silent except for space and enter
which is kind of weird this is the keys
this is space it's weird okay so anyway
you can see work including CSS /
foundation CSS and apps CSS all right
now let's take a look in the CSS folder
so foundation CSS is what we're
including so we don't actually need the
minified version unless you want to
change and use that but I'm going to
delete that all right and then app CSS
is just a blank CSS file for your custom
styles all right so that's what that is
now in the jas folder we have apt js'
which is just basically a blank I has
this initializer but this is basically a
blank J's file all right then we have
our foundation j/s file which is all the
JavaScript stuff that's being included
right here we also have the minified
version which we don't need so I'm going
to delete that and jQuery so jQuery is a
dependency for a fun day
Jaso it includes that as well and then
there's what input here this is for you
certain events and we don't really need
to we don't need this we're not even
going to really deal with JavaScript at
all this is purely HTML and CSS all
right so let's jump in and get started I
don't want this video to be too long all
right now I'm going to kind of follow
the same guideline that I did with the
bootstrap video we're going to start
with typography with headings paragraphs
very simple things will move onto
buttons and certain CSS widgets and then
the top bar which is kind of like the
nav bar so let's get started now with
typography make sure you make this caps
so I'm going to kind of try to keep this
clean and comment it out for you guys
because I want you guys to be able to
use this as a reference for when you're
building foundation you eyes and website
so you can go back and look at it all
right now with boots I'm going to do a
lot of comparison with bootstrap because
I'm sure a lot of you already know
bootstrap and I think it'll make things
easier now in bootstrap we have a
container class to push everything into
the middle you know set it the margin to
Auto and so on in foundation we use the
row class okay there is no container
class so let's go ahead and do that and
let's just say test okay you'll go over
and you can see that now that's pushed
over and let me just make this so that
we can actually see it at the same time
I want to keep all the coding view I
guess that that'll be good for now okay
so we have our row class now let's go
ahead and put in a heading
okay so let's put an h1 and we'll save
that and it gives us a heading okay it
has some styling to it we can put a
small tag in here and let's say this
would be the secondary text okay so
looks like that now we can obviously do
this for any size heading put an h2
we'll see what those look like okay
we're not putting any special classes in
here this is just how it looks naturally
without any extra classes we can also
use a sub header class so for this h2
let's give it a class of sub header and
you can see it just kind of makes it a
little lighter
alright so paragraphs so throw in a
paragraph here and see I'm just going to
put some sample text in here just some
lorem ipsum lips kind of it's kind of a
lot I want that much text
let's go ahead and get rid of that all
right so I just want to make sure
everything's in view for you guys so
let's save that okay so that's what a
power graph looks like naturally if we
put some strong tags in here okay see
just makes it bold no big surprise there
what else we could put em tags okay so
you can see that that makes that italic
there now for links let's go ahead and
put a link in wrap this save that you
can see that the link gives it a kind of
a light blue color matches the rest of
the theme the default theme all right
now there's there's not as many options
with paragraph styling as there is with
bootstrap there is a lead class we can
use so copy this paragraph and let's go
ahead and give this a class of lead okay
now you can see that that is bigger okay
it kind of just emphasizes it makes it
bigger there's also a stat class so if
we go down here and put in a paragraph
and let's say server uptime this would
be for like a hosting company and we can
put in a div with a class of stat
save 230 save that you can see that that
makes that really big all right so I
know this stuff is kind of boring but I
do want to get it in here
so I'm going to put in just a horizontal
rule just to kind of separate this and
we're going to take a look at alignment
that's what I wrote that so let's say
comment alignment classes okay now for
this I'm actually going to just paste
this in I'm going to do some copying and
pasting throughout this video just to
save some time but put that below the
comment all right so we have a couple
paragraphs here this one has a class of
text left which is going to align to the
last text center text right and text
justified and these are actually the
same classes that bootstrap uses so you
can see here you can see the align text
all right so really simple we also have
some float classes right so this I'm
actually going to put this in a call-out
and I'll go over call-outs in a little
bit so you'll say call out clear fix and
just going to put in two buttons or
linked formatted as buttons and I'll get
to this don't worry about that and we're
going to put in the class float:left for
this one
right and then copy that keep pressing
the wrong key here I'm not used to this
keyboard and this will be float right
okay I'll save that
whoops up in work because I didn't spell
it right ready okay so you can see that
we can now just put in float left and
float right and that will float whatever
element doesn't have to be a link or
button it can be anything all right so
now let's move on to code okay so if we
want to put in for instance we want to
display some HTML on the page we can do
that so I'm going to just paste this
part in here all right so we have our
code tags and then we need to use for
our angle brackets this ampersand LT for
the the left side and then GT for the
right side so we have a div with a class
of my class inside the div hello world
and then we have our closing div and
then down here we have our QR keyboard
commands here so we're saying press
command + R or ctrl + R on windows so
let's see what that looks like okay so
you can see here it's basically
highlight has a background of gray gives
it some padding looks pretty nice and
very readable alright so for block
quotes I would say so I'll put in a
block quote
and let's say this is a block quote from
foundation and then we want to put in
our site okay put a name in here and
save that and that's what a block quote
looks like and boot in sorry foundation
all right so really simple stuff let's
move on to lists all right so let's see
what a comment in here will say list let
me just comment this stuff too I know it
takes a little extra time but I want you
guys to be able to understand what's
going on okay so for a list I'm going to
just paste this in so basically we have
an unordered list here with a couple
list items and then we have another
unordered list so this is a nested list
and I'm down here area the same thing
we're just using oh L which is ordered
list which will give it the number all
right so let's save that and that's what
it looks like okay just a standard list
now if we want to remove the bullets we
can use the no bullet class so let's say
class no - bully okay now you can see it
removes that if you want to do the
nested list you'll have to add that as
well
okay that removes that it also removes
the padding this is equivalent to list
unstyled in bootstrap so next thing
let's take a look at visibility classes
okay I want to actually want to stay
within the row all right so let's put
some paragraphs in here okay notice they
have they have text inside of them and
I'm going to add classes to make these
true okay so save it now right here
we're going to add a class to hide this
whatever is in this element so have a
class of hide all right so if we save
that it basically just completely
removes it from the page okay there's no
space where it where it used to be it's
just completely removed so that's what
high does and then we also have class
invisible so if we will go ahead and
save that you'll see that the text is
gone but the space where it where it was
contained is still there all right so
that's the difference between hide and
invisible now another cool thing we can
do is we can actually add classes to
either hide or display that the content
depending on what size of screen is this
paragraph here I'm going to leave just
regular paragraph it says you are on a
small screen or larger so that's pretty
much anything with this one here it says
you are on a medium screen or larger so
what we can do is we can add a class of
show or medium okay if we save that I
remember it says you are on a medium
screen or larger so it's showing right
here now if I go larger
you'll see it's still there if I go down
small it's gone
okay there's no more you are on a medium
screen or larger so it'll it'll show
based on if it's a large score medium
screen or larger now this one he
you're on a large screen or larger so
this would be a class of show for large
okay this one you are not on a small
screen this would be actually yeah let's
do this
so this would be hide for small only
which is kind of long but it makes sense
okay this one here says you are not on a
medium screen so this would be hide for
medium only okay this one is you are not
on a large screen so this would have the
class of hide for large only and we can
also go by if it's a landscape or
portrait so this would be show for
landscape and this would obviously be
show for portrait
okay so let's save that and now you'll
see as I make this as I make this bigger
and smaller different things show okay
if you look at the bottom you are in the
landscape forget to portrait put your
portrait all right so it's kind of just
changing as we move along so I think
that's pretty cool that way that they
give us those classes all right so now
let's get out of the the helper classes
and typography and let's move on to
elements okay so let's let's do buttons
okay so I'm going to just put an HR here
and then we're going to say we're going
to open up a new row or a new container
okay let's say buttons all right so as
with bootstrap we can format links
buttons and inputs so let's say button
and it has a class of buttons okay not
BTN button so let's see what that looks
like so that's a standard button has
that blue color all right we can also do
a link so say a href give it a class of
button and say link okay we can also do
input put the type of button or submit
give it a value
I'll give it a class all right so if we
save that you see that they're all
formatted the same way all right so
those are buttons let's look at
contextual buttons or colored buttons so
let's see we'll just grab this all right
so this first one here let's just add a
class of success okay same as bootstrap
that will give us a green button now
instead of danger
we have alert which will give us the red
button warning will be yellow and then
we also have secondary which will make
it grey which is similar to default in
bootstrap so let's save that and now you
can see we have different colored
buttons I'm just going to put a line
break right here okay now we can also
have a disabled button by adding the
class disabled and you see when I hover
over it it turns into that cross note
circle thing all right now as far as
sizes we can change those as well okay
so let's say we want a really small
button we can use tiny check that out
look out small that is and put a line
break here as well
all right so we have tiny we have small
which is a little bigger
we have default which is we'll just
leave with just button
they have lodge let's take a look at
those okay so tiny small default large
we can also have expanded okay now
expand it it is like button block and
bootstrap it just basically goes across
the whole element and we can also have
expanded but also add large or small and
so on alright so you'll see that's an
expanded large button so quite a few
choices as far as sizes and colors now
what else is pretty cool is they have
these holo buttons so kind of reverse
now I'm just going to copy these and
just put a comment here and then I'm
just going to add the class holo to
these
okay check that out and you can see that
it gives us these white buttons with a
border and changes the color of the text
so kind of reverses this version which
is pretty cool alright so I want to keep
moving along that's it for buttons now
we're going to take a look at forms I'm
going to open up a new row all right now
with forms we actually don't have to add
many classes at all to make our forms
look good with bootstrap we have to add
form group we have to add form control
for our inputs or it looks like crap
with foundation we can just kind of
build a form okay so let's just put a
div all right and let's do label say
name and looks just two input type
equals text and let's give it a
placeholder
okay if we take a look at that and see
down here it looks pretty good all right
I don't want you guys to have to keep
looking at the bottom of the screen so
what I'm going to do is just stick a div
down here give it a class of spacer and
then I'm just going to go up in the head
area put style tag let's say spacer hike
500 pixels okay that way you guys don't
have to just look way down at the bottom
of the screen all right so back to where
we were let's add another into another
field here so I'm going to copy this div
and this will be the email you can
change the type to email we're using
html5 okay then we have another text
input we also have number inputs which
is part of html5 so it's a number
get rid of the placeholder okay if you
look at that you'll see that it's
formatted just like the text and we have
this little arrow here we can change the
number so what else
text areas a message it will change this
to text area which needs a closing tag
as well okay so that's what a text area
looks like we should probably take that
email out change it to message all right
now select let's do a select list paste
that in and let's say gender again we
don't need any class to make this look
good
say option
and to be politically correct for you
liberals out there let's say other
nothing wrong with that save it and
there we go we have a select list now if
we want to make this multiple let's copy
that div and let's say select and then
we'll add in multiple which matrice an
alien or something you can choose more
than one alright so next thing we look
at is check field sets and check boxes
I'm going to put a set of check boxes in
a field set all right so a field set I
very rarely use field sets actually and
it's going to have a legend so today a
field set look just don't want that and
let's put some check boxes will say
input type checkbox' actually let's put
that in a label
all right so if we look at that you'll
see that's what it looks like naturally
but we can add a class of fieldset save
it and then it looks like that okay
which looks much nicer so we can also do
upload buttons now it's usually very
hard to style an upload button it
doesn't work in most browsers but what
we can do is let's say label and we're
going to give it a four attribute of
example example upload or let's say file
upload okay and we're also going to give
it a class of button and let's say
upload file and then we'll put in our
input and let's give it a type of file
give it an ID file upload we're also
going to give it this class of show 4sr
okay and that's the same code that's in
the documentation so now you can see we
have a style upload file and if I click
it it goes ahead opens this window to
upload a file but obviously we don't
have any back-end programming so it's
not going to actually do anything all
right but this is for the UI so next I
want to look at help text for an input
field so let's say let's go under here
just separate these inputs
okay so let's say we have a password
field so we'll put a label and what's
the input type password and we want some
help text so we're going to put a
paragraph and let's say your password
must be eight characters or more okay so
if we save that okay so that's just
standard that's what it looks like
without any special class but with this
paragraph if we put the class of help
text you can see that it gets smaller it
it's italic and it loses the padding so
that looks much better
okay and also gives us this little icon
here I think to that class do that okay
um oh no it didn't
oh that's too much stupid LastPass thing
nevermind you guys don't have that all
right so let's move on let's see we have
a couple more things I want to do with
input so let's take a look at input
groups now this is used for if you want
an inline button so a search form
something like that where you want the
button and the input to be inlined
so what we'll do is say give class input
group all right and then inside here
we're going to have a span and let's
give it a class actually we'll do that
after that's just to add a special
symbol but let's put an input with the
class
of input group input group field okay
and we can give it a type let's say
email now we want the button to be in
line with it so we're going to actually
put this in a div and we're going to
give this a class of input group buttons
okay and then here we'll put let's say
input we'll give it a type of submit and
give it a class of button and then a
value of say search
well not search because it's an email
will say stab it alright so now you can
see that we have the input and then the
button is right next to it and in line
with it now if we want to put a little
symbol over here we can do that as well
it's part of the input group so we'll
say span class input group label
and let's just put a little @ symbol
okay actually why is that on that side
oh I put the spin below the input should
actually go above it all right so now
it's on this side over here so you can
do that so that's an input group now
there's two more things that I want to
show you as far as inputs and that's a
switch and a slider alright and these
are actually they look really good on
mobile devices so let's do a switch
so we'll say give class switch okay
we're going to put an input with the
type of switch input will give it an ID
of my switch and it's actually going to
have a type of check box okay and then
we'll give it a name of example switch
okay I think a much I think all these
attributes are needed so then what we're
going to do is have a label and inside
actually the label we're going to give
it a class of switch paddle
okay switch paddle and we're going to
say for my switch
okay we're using my switch because
that's what we gave the ID up here
alright and then in that label we're
going to have a span and that's going to
have a class of show four si alright and
this is in here I'm just going to say
enabled ok let's save that and look what
is that input alright so I think I did
something wrong here oh I put type
switch input that should be class there
we go
so now if I click that you'll see it has
a nice little slide animation all right
I think that looks pretty cool so next
we have a slider now this I want to say
sometime so I'm going to actually paint
this in I don't like pasting copying
pasting but because I want to save some
time here alright so we have a div with
the class of slider we have data slider
as an attribute data initial start now
this is where we want to slide it a
start I put 0 and then it's going to end
at 20
all right so as you slide it's going to
go 0 through 20 we have a span with a
class of slider handle data slider
handle we have a role attribute of
slider tab index 1 we want it to go to
change 1 each each tick basically we
have a span of with the class of slider
fill data slider fill and then we have
an input a hidden input so let's save
that and there we go so each tick here
is going to be one and it goes 0 through
20 all right so that's a slider and they
remind me of mobile app UI Dom
components iOS or Android
okay so that's going to do it for forms
I'm going to open up another row here
and we're going to look at tables okay
so I'm going to paste in a table okay so
we just have a simple table of users
let's go ahead and save that and notice
that right away it looks good we have no
classes we didn't have to add Striped in
fact there is a strike class but it's
it's there by default if we don't want
it striped we could say class unstriped
and now it removes it okay but I'm going
to keep striped on okay now if we want
to hover over these and have an effect
we can add the class of hover okay so
now you'll see that we get that lights
up when we hover over we can also put in
the class a stack which exactly sure oh
there we go that's what it does so when
it's a big screen it looks normal but
when you get to a smaller screen it
looks like that which is really cool
actually because it's really hard to get
responsive tables so that I like that
alright let's see why are you doing that
we can also put in a table scroll class
and I believe that if you have enough
fields you'll be able to scroll
horizontally all right but I'm not going
to change that up just know that that
that's a thing all right so let's move
on from tables there's actually not that
much we can do as far as I know we can't
use contextual classes here so for
instance we can't say class success like
we couldn't bootstrap and that would
make that particular row green I don't
see that happening all right and I
didn't see that in the documentation
either
so that's tables let's create a new row
and we're going to look at menus and
I'll get to the top bar in a minute but
let's just do some simple stuff so we
have a ul and inside here let's put link
will say link 1 copy that
okay let's take a look at that just a
standard list now if we go when we add
class equals menu you'll see that it
changes it goes in line those horizontal
gives us some padding and looks pretty
nice if we want an active link then we
want to put on the li class active and
you'll see that gives it a background
padding and all that we can also add it
add some text that's not a link so you
may want to have for instance a title so
right here we could say site title and
then give this a class of menu text okay
and I give this little site title well
let's see what else I think that's it so
if we want to make this vertical we
could do that let's copy it and we could
just add menu and then vertical and
let's see that gives us vertical menu
okay I'm going to take that site title
note though although you can do that
alright now we also have simple class
simple we can put with it
see what that does not even sure also
just kind of removes all the padding and
all that I guess alright now we can also
use icons now which you want to use
icons you actually have to include a
separate file separate CSS file and some
other files looks a foundation icons
alright so this link here you up
download the font so it's a bit zip file
of foundation icons let's open that up
the hell is it alright so in here we
have a bunch of stuff we have the
foundation icons dot CSS file and then
the icons is the fonts themselves we
have an SVG folder what I'm going to do
is let's open up our project folder and
inside CSS I'm going to create a folder
called icons and we're going to bring
over let's go bring over everything
except that HTML file ok and then we'll
go to our file here and we need to
include that up here so we're going to
say include CSS flash icons slash
foundation - icons dot CSS and now we
should be able to use icon classes so
let's go back down here what I'm
actually going to just paste this in
okay so we have classes menu icon top is
optional by default there on the left
but we can move them to the top and then
we're just using eye tags with the class
of FI - and then whatever that icon and
you can see a full list here all right
so these are all the icons that you can
use I prefer font awesome but if you
don't want to include that extra library
you can use this so let's go ahead and
check that out and you can see it gives
us the little icons on top all right if
we remove that icon tot class puts it on
puts them on the side all right so
that's menu and icon now let's take a
look at the top bar that the nav bar and
we're going to put that up at the top so
let's go up here all we've done a lot
and we're going to go right under the
body tag and let's say top bar and I
hate to do the copy and pasting but we
are kind of running out of time here so
take a look we have a div with the class
of top bar and then we have top bar left
and top bar right okay just like in
bootstrap we have navbar left and right
so on this in the left we have a ul I
gave you the class of drop-down menu
because it does have a drop-down and
then we have data drop-down menu we
going to throw in there and we have a
simple site title again we're using menu
text for our class and then we have this
li which is a link and then we have the
UL which is the drop-down for it alright
so that's how we do dropdowns in
foundation and on this side I put a
formul UL with the class of menu and
then in this li I put search input a
text input and then a button so let's
see what that looks like we save that
all right you'll see we have our drop
down here and our search form over here
okay so pretty simple
I think it's it's easier than the
bootstrap navbar all right so let's move
on to some of the other UI components
that are available so we're going to go
back down to the bottom and I know I
probably missed some comments and stuff
up I'll probably shape this up a little
bit before I give it to you guys to
download let's see oh did I not end that
all this should actually be inside the
bib here all right so let's create a new
row and now what I want to look out now
what I want to look at now is call out
and these are similar to alerts in
bootstrap so we have it give the class
it call out and let's say we'll do just
put a paragraph we'll say this is
example of a call out and take a look at
that okay so there's a call out let me
just put an HR here that's a standard
call out now we can also add our
contextual classes to these so I'm going
to copy this okay so the sec this one
kay let's do secondary to success
warning and alert okay and you can see
we have all different colors here that
we can use so you'd use this for an
error this for a success message and so
on okay next thing I want to look at is
progress bars HR here
okay so we'll say give class let's see
let's say success we'll make it green
and progress and we're going to give it
a roll attribute of progress bar okay
and here we'll say give class and this
is going to be progress meter and then
what we do is give it a style and give
it a width so we'll say with 25% okay
and then inside here we'll put a
paragraph and this is going to have a
class this is optional text it's going
to have a class of progress meter text
all right and I'll just say 25% take a
look at that and we have a progress bar
so we can also use contextual classes
here so change that to alert and you'll
stay alert getting to 98% the whole
facility is going to blow up so this one
will say warning and I will say 75% okay
take a look at that and there we go
all right I'm really getting pressed for
time here let's go let's add some labels
actually what I'm going to do is put an
HR and I'm going to paste this in okay
so our labels we have spans here with
the class of label and we can add our
contextual classes here as well okay so
those are what the labels look like we
also have badges so let's put an HR okay
pay season again just spans with the
classes badge and we can also add these
classes to that as well
okay so that's what the badges look like
so we also have a bread crumb which
actually look really nice so to put a
comment here and what we'll do what we
need to do is we'll use a nav tag here
give it a roll of navigation oops
I want to do that tour that alright so
in here we're going to do a ul and we're
going to give it a class of breadcrumbs
okay and then we'll put some Li let's
make this a link okay so say home
and let's do another link let's say post
and then the current one won't be a link
so we'll just say my post just take a
look at that and there's what a
breadcrumb looks like so I think it
looks pretty nice you can also do
disabled links so let's say or disabled
text just give it a class disabled
maybe it's a member page or something
hopefully to put some text in here okay
so it's what it looks like all right
next thing we're going to look at is
pagination okay so for pagination we're
going to add a ul give it a class of
pagination and let's also give it a role
of navigation okay to put an li here and
let's give this a class of current say
one
all right and then if we're on the
current page then we probably want the
the previous link to be disabled so it's
a link class or Li class
disabled say previous okay then we'll
put our second link so this one actually
won't have a class say - and it'll taste
in a couple more three four and let's
put our next so Li so this will be next
now let's take a look at that alright so
there's our pagination now if you want
to have any lipsticks ellipses I think
that's how it's pronounced we can do
that as well if you want to kind of skip
pages so say Li class Lipsey's that's
really Lipsey's and let's just copy a
couple of these and we'll say 13 and 14
so let's look at that alright so it
gives us a little ellipses and then just
these would probably be the end pages so
they know exactly how many pages there
are now obviously there's no
functionality to this this is just the
UI but it looks pretty nice alright so
now what I want to look at is probably
the most important part of any front-end
framework and that's the grid system all
right so we're going to open up a new
row
same grid okay so let's start out with
just actually each grid is going to have
its own row so I'm going to put the
comment here so let's say we just want
to main a main column and a sidebar so
say div class you know all columns will
have the class of columns alright and
then we're going to say large eight now
in bootstrap it would be call lg8 okay
so the same thing alright and in here
let's put an h3 will say main column and
then I'll just put a paragraph with some
sample text and I did that by typing in
lorem tab alright someone actually just
showed me how to do that I didn't even
know you could do that next couple of
videos ago they left it in a comment
alright so that gives us an eight column
gives now it's a twelve column layout
just like Twitter bootstrap so the next
one we want to do is four so we'll say
give class columns large for
okay we'll put an h3 will say sidebar
and let's just copy some of this
all right so let's take a look at that
okay so we have our main column and our
sidebar the padding is taken care of for
us so that's it that's how you can
create a grid now you have large medium
and small so let's say that naturally
when when this is small they're going to
stack okay but the floats disappear and
that's probably what you want but if you
actually did want it to still float here
we could put in small eighth and small
for save it and now you'll see that they
float all right you can also do it for
medium so let's say medium say we want
it to be six and six for medium all
right so now if we're at medium you'll
see now there's six column did so we get
two large it goes back to eight four
okay so let's say we want four three
column divs go ahead and paste this in
so we have a row with div class columns
large three and medium three and we just
have four of these save that and now we
have four three column dips
all right and if we even wanted to do
twelve one columns we could do that as
well so to paste that in so we have
twelve large one medium one okay so
there we go
now if we want to offset let's say we
want to have a twelve column but we want
the content to start in the middle here
then we could do that
okay so whilst a div class columns so
you'll say columns large 12 okay we'll
just grab this
okay so that gives us a 12 column and
that's that's normal now let's say we
want this to start over here then what
we could do is we could say large offset
six we want to offset it by six and now
you can see it starts over here at six
okay so that's how we can do offsets
alright guys so we have reached the end
of this crash course and we have quite a
bit here that you can use as a reference
now I didn't touch on everything
Foundation offers especially when it
comes to JavaScript widgets and so on so
if you go to the site Docs a couple
things that you may want to check out is
let's see cards so if we look at
containers with cards which is basically
a header and image and a body and you
can see it gives us the code here
actually you know what I could take an
extra five minutes and and add this
stuff so let's create another row here
and the file that I have for you guys to
download will probably be you know I'll
fix it up a little bit just paste that
in
card okay we'll save that and let's grab
that image link
okay let's check that out
alright so there we go there's a car so
it looks pretty nice you probably have
like three or four of these in a row
look cool let's see what else we have we
have media objects which are really nice
kind of like blog post let's see let's
grab this so this would be a media
object paste that in take a look and up
let's grab that image link
okay so that's a media object so we also
have see I didn't plan for this
accordions yep accordions which
basically JavaScript widgets so if we
grab this here paste that in okay now
this let's see what this looks like okay
so it gives us one according let's add
another list item here we'll copy this
one we'll add two more
and there we go so now we have a cool
little accordion widget and let's see
this they all start open though I don't
like that so let's remove is active from
the second two and then only the first
one should be open yep okay and then
let's finally I just want to throw in
tabs as well see tabs so tabs is this
thing here I had two parts one is going
to be the UL which is the actual tab
links
okay so that's the first part and look
let's grab this this is the content okay
so you just want to make sure that see
so these have to match href panel one is
going to match ID panel one panel two is
going to match panel - all right let's
take a look at that and now we have tabs
all right so we're going to go ahead and
start here so it's a nice little
reference hopefully you guys enjoyed
this if you did if you not subscribed
