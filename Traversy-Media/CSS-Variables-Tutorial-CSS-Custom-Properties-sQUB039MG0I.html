a look at CSS variables or the official
name for them which are CSS custom
properties so in the past we've used CSS
preprocessors like sass and less to
handle dynamic values or variables in
our CSS but now we can do it natively
now one question that probably comes to
mind is is there still a need for
pre-processors like sass and that's
something that's going to be very
opinionated and something that comes
down to preference as you'll see the
native custom properties syntax is
pretty weird and it takes a little time
to get used to but then again it's
native it doesn't have to be compiled
you can access them from JavaScript but
then again even though it's supported on
all modern browsers except ie what about
the people with outdated browsers or the
people that are using IE you'll probably
want to provide fallbacks for them with
sass variables are just compiled down to
regular CSS and you don't have to worry
about that so it's up to you to weigh
the pros and cons and of course
pre-processors like sass do other things
as well not just variables if you ask my
opinion I think that within time there's
not going to be much need for pre
processors but that won't be for at
least a couple years in my opinion I
think CSS is advancing there's a lot of
things that are coming coming out that
are really cool so that's just my
opinion but in this video we're going to
look at how to use variables and CSS and
we'll even jump into some JavaScript and
I'll show you how we can access the
values from there we're gonna create
this little mini layout nothing special
now I could show you how to use a CSS
variable in three minutes but you know I
want to go in and I want to create a
little layout we're gonna use a little
bit of the grid system so it's not just
hey this is how you use a variable we're
gonna do some other stuff as well and
talk about the scoping of the variables
and so on alright so let's go ahead and
get started coding dojo is a programming
school that turns beginners into
developers and only 14 weeks over 90% of
their grads land jobs within
three months of graduating often making
over seventy K per year to learn more
visit coding dojo comm or click the link
in the description below alright guys so
what I've done here is I have an
index.html file and a blank style dot
CSS file
okay so I've removed all the styling
from the markup and the mark-up is very
simple it's just basically a header okay
with an ID it has an h1 and then we have
a container class inside the container
we have a grid class and then we have
two boxes with an h1 and a paragraph so
I didn't want to take the time to type
this out because it's so basic you guys
can type it out quickly or you can just
get it from the code pen in the
description alright so let's go over to
style dot CSS and let's start to work
with variables so when we define a
variable we can define them on different
elements or different scopes so what I
want to do first is define variables for
we'll say for the root element so to do
that we use colon root okay so anything
that we put in here any variables we
define in here we'll be able to use
throughout throughout all of the
elements throughout all the scope of the
CSS so let's go ahead and define just a
main background color now to define a
variable you want to use - - and I know
that that that's a weird looking syntax
for variables if you're used to sass
then you're used to like a money sign or
less I believe as a number sign - - is
kind of weird and it takes a little bit
of getting used to but we're going to go
ahead and create main BG color and then
we're going to define that as f43 x
which is a light gray okay so that
defines the variable it obviously it
doesn't do anything yet because we
haven't used it for anything but it
defines it so let's go down to the body
and to use that variable what we want to
do is let's say we want to use it for
our background I will say background
color and to use it this is also kind of
weird we actually have to save our
opens some parentheses and then put the
variable inside there now if you're
using vias code you'll have this nice
intellisense where you get this
drop-down and you can just select your
variables so let's save that and now
you'll see we have a gray background so
this is this is essentially how to use
variables okay I could end the tutorial
here but I want to go a little more
in-depth all right so let's create a
couple other variables in the route so
let's also do a main text color and set
that to three three three which is a
dark really dark gray and we could go
down here and say color var main text
color and save makes the color a little
lighter and for the body I also want to
add the font family now it's up to you
on what you want to put inside of your
variables if you wanted to create a font
family or a main font variable you could
do that so that stuff is all preference
I'm also going to Mars ero out the
margin and padding here so zero that out
so now you can see the fonts changed all
that
will also set a line height which is
again something that you could put in a
variable if you wanted to okay so now
let's let's add the container class here
and the container is going to have a
width and I want that as a variable as
well so up here we're gonna say - -
container width and we'll set that to
let's say 90% okay and then for the
width will save var and we'll put in
container with 90% we also want the
margin for the container I'm gonna say
20 pixels top and bottom and then auto
left and right which will push
everything to the middle okay everything
in the container the header isn't
doesn't have its own container which we
could do if we wanted to but that's fine
alright so let's deal with the header
now so we'll go down here we'll say
was it header with an ID of main header
okay and then I'm gonna add a background
a background color and let's let's
actually create a variable up here for
that
so we'll say header - BG color it's also
what we'll set that to 333 so it'll have
a dark background let's also create a
text color and make sure that that's
light so we'll do white for that okay
and then down here we can just say var
and we'll do header BG color and then
let's change the color of the text to
var header text color and save and now
we have our black background now the
space right here is from the h1 so what
I'll do is I'll say header whoops
header main - header and let's set the
we'll just zero out the padding and the
margin what I do
look we need to put h1 here all right so
that gets rid of that space so you can
see we're doing more than just variables
here we're just creating a little layout
okay so now what I want to do is show
you basically what I call scoped
variables I don't know if that's the
correct term but you can create
variables on certain elements or certain
scopes so let's say we'll put a comment
here we'll say define box VARs okay so
it's a dot box so this is this is the
element we want to define the variables
for and it not only applies to the box
class but anything within it okay so
let's add a box BG color
and we'll set that to let's say ddd and
then let's set a box main color and
we're gonna set that to a blue
hexadecimal which is 0
6c okay so now we have these two
variables now these will not work
anywhere else except for the box classes
okay if we define the box main color for
the header that's not going to work so
we could continue to do our box styling
in here but what I like to do is just
keep this for the variables and then
we'll go ahead and create another box
class for the actual styles so let's say
background color and we'll set that to
bar - - box BG color and save and now
you'll see we have that gray background
let's add another variable for padding
so for padding I'm gonna do five top and
bottom ten left and right and down here
we'll go ahead and we'll say padding set
that - box padding and there we go now I
want these to be side to side so we're
gonna use a little bit of the grid
system here so we'll go up here and
we'll say class grid and let's go ahead
and make sure we display a grid okay and
then we want to define our grid template
columns now I do have a crash course on
the grid CSS which explains all this
stuff basically template columns were
just defining our layout we could do
pixels here we could do like 100 pixels
100 pixels that would give us two
columns 100 pixels each what I want to
use is is fractional units so fr-s so
we'll say 1fr for the first box and 1fr
for the second which will give us to
even boxes here alright and if we want
space in the middle we can go ahead and
we can say grid
app and set that to let's say 20 pixels
gives us some space and let's just align
items to the center all right so we'll
leave that for now let's go back down to
the box and I want to use this main
color variable for a few things actually
so first thing is going to be the border
so we're gonna say one pixel solid and
we're gonna use our main color variables
so we can go ahead and save our - - box
main color and save and now we have that
blue border so the h1 I also want that
to have that color so we'll say box h1
down here and set the color to bar box
main color save and now it's blue now
even if I were to get rid of this dot
box and just have h1 and save that's
also gonna be blue and if I were to add
an h1 somewhere else I'll just say h1
test you'll see that's not blue because
this this is only going to work this
variable here inside of the box class
even though we just use h1 here and we
didn't even define dot box h1 okay
hopefully that makes sense I'm just
gonna get rid of that so I'm just gonna
put that dot box back there but you
don't actually need it to use the
variable alright so the next thing I
want to do is add some box shadow okay
so for box shadow we have a few
different values that we need one is the
horizontal offset which will be 10
pixels the vertical offset will say 5
pixels the blur which will say 5 pixels
and then the color which will we'll use
the main the main vert the main color
here so this so we can go like that and
save and now I see we have that blue box
shadow now with
box-shadow we can't we can't set
individual properties for these values
like we can for instance with a border
we could say like border color and set
that to red but with the box shadow it
all has to be in here so having a
variable for each one of these is kind
of nice so that's what we're gonna do
we're gonna set box shadow - H - offset
and we'll set that to what ten pixels
and then let's see we'll just bring this
down and this one will be five pixels
and this will be the the V offset and
then let's do what else the blur so
we'll say shadow blur and we'll set that
to five pixels so then down here we can
just put in our variables so I'll just
grab that this is the blur so we'll say
box
what is it shadow blur blur and this one
here will be the what the V offset so
we'll say shadow V offset and then this
one will be the H offset so H offset and
I'll just put these on separate lines
because that's kind of hard to read so
I'll just go like that and save and now
we can simply change for instance the H
offset if we want to change that to two
pixels and save you can see that that
this side has been it's thinner if we
want to change the blur to let's say 25
and save you see now we have a higher
blur rate blur rate I don't know if
that's the right word but you can see we
can easily change the stuff from the
shadow all right and I think that's a
good use of CSS variables now a lot
we're using this main color in quite a
few places so this is this is the the
benefit of using variables if we were to
change this to red and save all that
stuff will change to red so you can have
an entire template we
you have maybe a main main or primary
color secondary color maybe button
colors and you can easily just change
those variable values and it'll update
the whole look of your template which is
really nice and that's that's one of the
main reasons that sass and less were
created okay and now we can do that
natively now one thing that I want to
show you real quick is let's go up to
the grid where we have the gap now with
sass we could put like a variable like
20 inside of a variable and then use
that and then put px and kind of
concatenate it we can't do that with
with custom properties so if I were to
set a variable here of gap to just 20
not 20 pixels but just the number 20 and
then go in here and say var - - Gap and
save you'll see that there's there's no
more gap it doesn't work so a fix for
this is to use calc ok we can use the
calc function and CSS so we'll say calc
we'll wrap this and then what we can do
is we can take that this variable which
is actually 20 and we can say times 1
pixel and save and then that'll give us
20 pixels okay so that's a solution for
that okay we can also overwrite
variables so let's say for the paragraph
in the box let's say we wanted say color
bar and set that to box main color save
and now you can see the paragraphs are
blue now we could overwrite this value
right here this box main color for just
the paragraph if we wanted to by setting
it here to let's say 5 5 5 which is a
light gray so if I save this you'll see
that the paragraph text updates the
color but none of the other box main
colors update okay because we overrode
it inside of the paragraph now another
thing we have is a fallback option so if
we say color
and we set that to a variable called
let's say box - P - color which doesn't
exist if I save that it's just gonna be
black which is the default but we can
say we can put a comma here and add a
parameter which will be the fallback
color so for that let's say 555 which is
a lighter a light grey and save and now
you can see that that's lighter and if
you can't really see the difference let
me just put in something even lighter
and you can see that that is now the
fallback alright so we can do that I
think that's pretty much it as far as
the basics go so what I want to do now
is jump into the HTML file and show you
how you can access the variables in
JavaScript okay so we're just going to
put some script tags in here and what I
want to do is I want to get the value
for a box main color okay which is this
blue hexadecimal value 0-6 C so to do
that we're gonna create a variable
called box I'm gonna set it to document
dot query selector and it has a class of
box by the way query selector is only
going to select the first one if you
want to select all then you would do
query selector all but that works in a
little different way but we don't need
that for what I'm gonna do here now I'm
gonna set another variable called box
styles and then set that to a function
called get compute style or get computed
style and then pass in the box variable
okay and if we go ahead and we look at
that with console.log so box styles and
save and open up our console with f12
you'll see it gives us all these
different styles now what we want to do
is we want to take this box styles and
we want to we want to call a method
called get property value and then we
can pass in the variable that we want to
get so let's let's actually get rid of
this
and let's create a variable here so
create a variable called box main color
and we'll set this to the box styles and
then we're gonna say get property value
and then we can simply pass in the
variable so - - box - main - color and
then let's go ahead and console.log that
and save and there it is 0 6 C so we can
get those variables in our JavaScript
which opens up a whole range of
possibilities in terms of things we can
do in the UI and with our templates now
if we want to change a value what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna take the header
and change the header BG color to the
value that we got from the Box main
color so I'll make it blue through the
through JavaScript so first of all we
want to grab the header
we'll use document dot query selector
and by the way if you don't know about
this this kind of so these selectors and
the Dom and all that check out my modern
JavaScript course on udemy I'll I'll put
a link in the description we go over all
this stuff so from here we want to
select the main header so it had an idea
of main header and then I'm simply going
to take the header and just change the
style and say dot set property so header
dot style dot set property and then in
here pass in the variable we want to
change or set which is header
- BG - color which we defined as black
are not black which or is it right here
almost black dark gray and what we'll do
is put in a second parameter of what we
want to change it to which will be box
main color which is what we got up here
so if I save that now you can see
the header is blue okay so we can get
and we can set variables CSS variables
from JavaScript
alright guys so I hope you enjoyed this
I know I you know I could have just did
a three minute video showing you how to
define a variable but I like to go you
know somewhat in debt in depth so that
you can get a wrap your head around it
and get a better understanding of it so
hopefully you can appreciate that and
not just say wow this guy takes friggin
forever just to explain something but
yeah so that's it I hope everyone had a
happy holiday and has a Happy New Year
