gonna start to get into the database now
like I said we're using MySQL and I'm
using something called xampp which gives
us an Apache server MySQL and PHP on a
local machine ok so if you're on Windows
Linux or Mac you can use xampp you can
see it's cross-platform
I'm not going to go through the
installation it's really easy just
download it install it if you don't want
to use xampp you could use just you know
a standalone MySQL server you could use
if you're on Linux and you have a lamp
stack you could use that you could use
MAMP or lamp or any of the other amps
that are out there as long as you have
MySQL now xampp our exam however you
want to pronounce it also comes with PHP
myadmin
so you can just go to localhost / p2p my
admin and you can see all your databases
you can create a database so all we need
to do here is create a database so I'm
gonna create one called
Adonis let's say add honest 4-0 blog ok
so now we have an empty database and
that's all I'm gonna do for now we're
not going to create our tables through
here because we're using database
migrations through the framework alright
now before we can do anything else we
need to install the MySQL driver for
nodejs so we're gonna say npm install
mysql
all right so now that that's installed
we're going to go to our dot env file
which is in the root and we're going to
change the DB connection from SQL Lite
to MySQL okay and then we want to go
down to the user now my user actually is
root so I don't need to change this but
make sure yours matches whatever your
database user is I'm gonna put in my
password and then the name of the
database which I called adonis 4-0 blog
okay so i'll save that and now we should
be all hooked up with mysql so now we
need to do is create a migration okay so
to do that we can use the CLI we can say
adonis make colon migration and we're
gonna call this posts now it's gonna ask
us if we want to create a table or
select the table we're gonna choose
create and now it created this file this
long number here underscore post schema
j s and this is in our database folder
migrations and you can though it's not
there don't have to reload okay I just
had to reload so if we enter that file
you can see that there's an up-and-down
function the up is going to create the
post table for us it's going to create
the ID field which is auto increment and
it's going to create a couple timestamp
fields which would be created at and
updated at now in addition to this we
want a title and a body for the posts so
we're gonna go ahead and add in here
table dot string title okay we also want
table dot string body and that's it
that'll add those two fields so let's
save this now just creating the file
doesn't do anything we need to actually
run the migration and we do that by
saying adonis migration colon run now
what this did is it ran all three of the
migrations inside of that full
okay you can see down here and it should
have created all those tables so let's
go back let's go to PHP myadmin just to
check things out and we'll reload and go
to our adonis floral blog and you can
see that now we have all these tables
okay we also have a schema table which
shows us that all the migrations so we
want to go into posts and go to
structure and you can see that we have
our title and body fields that we added
here along with the ID and the
timestamps so what I want to do now is I
want to add some initial data to work
with so I'm just gonna go to insert and
you can use your SQL shell if you want
or any other program you use and we're
just going to add a title of post one
let's say this is post one excuse me
we'll say post two this is post to
alright so we'll click go and now we
just have some sample data to work with
so we have our database table we have
our fields now what we need is a model
because we still don't have a model so
we're gonna go down to our command line
down here and say add honest make model
post okay now look a common convention
is to make your model singular and your
controllers plural so let's go ahead and
run that and now you can see if we go in
our app folder we have models and then a
post j/s file now excuse me we're not
gonna have to do anything in here
because we're extending the the core
model class and that's where all the
methods that we need are that's where
the save method is you know the remove
find everything we need is inside of
this class okay so let's close that up
let's close our schema up and then let's
go back to our controller now before we
can use the model we have to bring it in
so let's go up top here and say bring in
model and we'll say Const post and we're
gonna set this to use and then here
we're gonna put in a p-- slash models
slash post now notice this syntax use
basically what we're doing here is we're
using a namespace cake just like laravel
now the reason we're able to do this is
because the app folder is auto loaded so
we don't have to do require dot dot
slash dot dot slash models and all that
stuff like we would with most frameworks
we can use this nice clean syntax to
bring things in alright so now that we
brought that in let's comment out all
this hard coded data and let's create a
variable called posts and then we want
to set this equal to a weight ok we're
using async await and then post which is
the name of the model and then we want
to call not find all so this will get
all of our posts alright now we want to
pass it in just like we were now there's
one thing we need to add here we need to
just add a method on to this post object
or this post array which is to Jason all
right otherwise we're just going to get
undefined for everything so let's go
ahead and save that and then we'll go to
our application and reload and now you
can see we're getting post one in post
two and these are coming from our
database alright one thing I wanted to
do I forgot to do is to add some styling
to our list so let's go to posts index
and just add a class to the UL of list
group and then let's add a class to the
Li of list group item this is just
bootstrap classes reload and that looks
a little better alright so now we're
pulling data from the database
so let's create a details page so we can
click on one of these and it takes us to
another page that has the title and the
body all right and then of course you
could add more fields if you want but
this is just gonna be a basic
application now I'm gonna wrap this post
title inside the index in a link alright
and it's gonna go to slash posts slash
and then we want to put our double curly
braces in here oops and say post dot ID
alright and then we just want to end
that a tag after the title and save now
if we go to this now we're gonna get an
error because we didn't create the route
we didn't create anything yet so I just
wanted to add that in there so we can
close that up
and now what we'll do is create a
details method inside of our post
controller so let's go under the index
and let's say async details alright now
for details
we need to pass in two things here okay
we need our view because we're gonna
load a view but we also need params
because we're gonna be passing in a
parameter all right now actually you
know what I'm not going to continue with
this just yet I want to create the
actual route first so let's save this as
it is and go to our route so let's see I
want to go to start routes J s and let's
say route dot get we want to get slash
posts / : ID and we want to map that to
post controller dot details all right so
let's save that and then we'll go back
to our details method so in this method
we need to just fetch a single post so
we're gonna say Const post set it to a
wait and then post and instead of all
we're gonna use dot find no semicolons
and then I'm gonna pass in params dot ID
alright so this is how we can get the
actual ID from that from the URL should
we stop that all right and then down
here what we want to do is return view
and we want the post dot details view
which we haven't created yet and then we
want to pass in that single post
all right so we'll save that and now
let's create that view so we'll say add
honest make view and we're gonna call it
details posts slash details all right so
now we'll go to our details dot edge
we're gonna extend the main layout put
in our section content and then in here
I'm gonna first just put a link in here
that's gonna go to slash posts and this
is going to be a go back link alright
just to go back to the main page then
we'll put a HR and then an h1 with the
post title all right and then under that
we'll have a paragraph with the post
body all right so let's save that let's
reload and click on post one missing
view cannot render post details dot edge
pose post details
oh this should be post with an S alright
let's try that here we go post one so if
we go back post two good so now we have
a details page now what I want to do
before we end this video is just create
the add post page okay in the next video
we'll do the the functionality where we
can actually create the post but let's
add the form so we're gonna create
another method under details called add
and then this is just gonna load a view
so we need to pass in our curly braces
here and view and then just return few
dot render and we're gonna pass in here
post dot add all right so let's create
that view
we'll say add honest make view at posts
slash add okay and then we need the
route so we'll go to our routes J's file
now one thing I want to mention that's
very important is if we're adding post
slash something like post slash add make
sure you put it above this or else it's
gonna look at that slash add as an ID
it's gonna look at add as an ID so make
sure you put it above that okay are you
going to get something you're gonna get
issues it's going to load the details
view so let's say route get slash post
slash ad and we want that to map to post
controller dot ad
okay so now let's see you know what I
want to do is add a link to the main nav
to create a post so we'll go to our nav
bar edge file copy this list item let's
say add post and it's gonna go to post
slash ad all right so let's reload now
we should have a add post click that it
goes to the view but there's nothing in
the view so let's go to views posts and
then add dot edge so let's create a
quick form here we'll say at layout main
section content alright and then here
let's put a back button oops
so to go to slash posts
and put an h1 and we'll say add post and
then under that we'll put a form action
is going to be slash posts alright we
want to make sure that it's a method of
post show put that in caps okay and then
inside here now we with a Dantas we have
Otto cross-site forgery protection by
simply putting in CS r CS RF field like
that and that will protect us from
cross-site forgeries so let's continue
with our form now in bootstrap we're
going to have all of our fields wrapped
in a form group okay so we'll have form
group and let's do a label don't need a
four just like title they'll have an
input with a type of text and let's give
it a name of title class form control
which is just a bootstrap class and then
a placeholder spell that right now
placeholder it will be title okay and
then let's copy that form group paste it
in now this is going to be the body it's
also going to be a text area so I'm
gonna come I'm going to replace input
type with text area and that of course
needs an ending tag and then that's
gonna be the body name is also going to
be body all right then we just need C we
need a submit button so that's gonna go
right here will say button let's give it
a class let's see for the class will do
BTN and then BTN primary
okay we also want to make sure we give
this a type of submit all right so let's
save that see what that looks like good
alright so in the next video we're going
to add function to this form so that we
can actually add a post through the
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
