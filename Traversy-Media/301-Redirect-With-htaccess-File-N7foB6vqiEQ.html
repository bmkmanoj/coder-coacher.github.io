going to show you how to do with a 301
redirect
using your dot htaccess file and there's
a few reasons that you might want to do
this one is if you switch domains you
want to redirect your old domain to your
new domain another reason would be if
you change the file name and let's say
the one the the page is indexed in
Google has one URL you want to redirect
that to the new URL and it's very easy
to do and for an example I have these
two files open a notepad so I have one
second
so we have in about dot HTML page and
then we have in about us HTML and I have
those uploaded to my staging server so
two about HTML okay
that's we want to get rid of that s
alright so that's the about page so
let's open another tab and we'll go to
about us alright so I'll go out in The
Boathouse now let's say that we changed
URL or our page title to about from
about us so let's say about us is the
page that's indexed in Google so you
don't want to just change the name of
the page because Google will go to this
page and it'll be it'll be missing and
not only Google but your website
visitors wherever they may come from you
don't want to have just nothing here but
you also don't want to have duplicate
content on each plate on both pages so
the perfect solution is to just do a
quick 301 redirect so we do that with a
dot htaccess file alright if you don't
have a dot htaccess file then just
create one and the best way to create it
because it has a dot in the front you
may have some issues creating it on
certain operating systems so just name
it
htaccess dot txt and then upload it and
then change it take off the text take
off the dot text and put the dot on the
front ok so let me just grab this
I think this is a blank file
open it with any text editor all right
so this is blank so let's see the first
thing we want to do is we want to put
the rewrite engine horns so rewrite
rewrite engine on now we can do the
redirect and it's very simple to do all
you need to do is type redirect and then
we want to put the the page name or the
the URL to the page you want to change
which is about us and we want to grab
everything after the domain so you
including this the slash so I'm going to
copy that paste that in and then one
space and then we want the the location
of where we want to redirect it to and
we want to in this one we actually want
to grab the whole domain and everything
the HTTP everything okay so just make
sure you have a space after redirect any
of a space after the URL or the page
name that you want to change alright so
I'm going to save this and let's
re-upload this
overwrite it
all right so now if we go to about us
and refresh
we now are redirected to the about page
so now no one can access the about Us
page they'll just come right here and
Google recognizes the Google and other
search engines recognized video one
redirect so you shouldn't have any
problems if you want to change your
domain or page or anything like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
