make a quick video with some tips and
some things to think about in regards to
health and well-being of a web developer
or a computer program or basically
anybody that sits at a desk all day and
looks at the computer screen alright a
lot of people including programmers
themselves don't realize that this line
of work actually does take a toll on you
both physically and mentally I've been
programming for years and I just
recently found out about many of those
tools from experience so I'm going to go
over what I've learned throughout the
years and hopefully help some of you
guys that are new to programming not
just programming but like I said anyone
that sits in front of a computer screen
all day designers administrators even
secretaries anyone that has in a
profession like that so one important
thing to do is to take care of your body
yes we have a profession where sometimes
we may barely move all day but that
actually can take more of a toll than a
lot of physical jobs and one of the
reasons for that is lack of exercise a
lot of people in programming are
overweight and that's a given because we
sit a 10 sometimes 12 plus hours per day
so make sure that you get some exercise
I'm not saying you have to workout twice
a day be and be all hardcore but a few
times per week is very least just take a
walk or go for a jog get your blood
flowing I would suggest right joining a
gym as well ok in addition to exercise
you want to eat healthy and stay
hydrated this is not generally for
anybody no matter what your profession
but I noticed that when I'm in a zone
and I'm programming I either forget to
eat because time just flies by without
me realizing it or I just don't want to
get up because I'm on a roll and I feel
like if I get up it's going to break
that focus alright so and then it's
people that just constantly eat while
they work and unfortunately it's usually
junk food that you eat at a computer
stuff like chips and cookies and crap
like that because it's much harder to
eat a plate with vegetables on it then
you know a bag of chips so plan your
meals and make
you stopped working to eat them all
right also make sure too that you
remember to drink water I always try to
have a bottle of water next to me even
if I'm drinking something else like
coffee which I should cut down on as
well but a lot of programmers drink lots
of coffee because it helps them
basically stay awake and then stay
focused alright so this next one is
incredibly important you want to make
sure that you take breaks to stand up
and stretch your legs a lot of people
are saying that sitting is the new
smoking
you know 3040 years ago people didn't
know how bad cigarettes were and it's
the same with sitting now more people
have jobs where they're sitting at a
computer all day and we're finding out
that it can do really nasty things to
your body it can give you back pain
spinal issues heart issues in fact when
you sit down your blood flow is slower
and your muscles burn less fat which
makes it easier for those fatty acids to
get to your heart all right and there's
a ton of problems that can be caused
from sitting all day if you can afford
it I would suggest getting either a
standing desk or even better get a desk
that can do both I just recently bought
an uplift desk about a month ago and it
was one of the best purchases that I've
ever made my back hurts less and I just
feel better in general ok so you want to
make sure that you take pretty recent
breaks at least one an hour just to
stretch your legs even if it's for a
couple minutes alright so this next one
is important for anybody you want to
make sure that you get plenty of sleep
so programmers use their mind at full
speed for hours every day if you get
tired you can't think straight okay if
you try writing code on two hours of
sleep which I've done it's incredibly
difficult and annoying because you can't
figure out the stupidest little things
then you get you know you sleep well the
next night and go back to it and you
solve it in a few minutes alright so we
can make a huge difference it's
recommended that you get at least six
hours of sleep eight is is is better of
course this is one issue that I struggle
with sometimes I won't fall asleep till
after min
right and then I'll wake up at 5:00 a.m.
I do YouTube stuff in the morning and
then my courses for my job during the
day so I need to fit a lot of work in
one day so I need all the hours I can
get but if I don't get enough sleep I
lag behind anyway so it can be tough to
balance alright and then this last one
is to take care of your eyes okay
there's actually something called
computer vision syndrome that can do
some bad crap to your eyes so one thing
that suggested is every 20 minutes to
look at something else for around 60
seconds or so and give your eyes a
little break from the screen also make
sure that you you know you go to the eye
doctor often you know every couple years
at least and if you wear glasses or
contacts to always have those in you
don't want to be straining your eyes
alright so those are tips to your body
now let's talk about your mind so first
of all you want to declutter your mind
if you're thinking of other things while
programming you're not going to be able
to solve tough problems things will keep
distracting you in your mind so you want
to take some time and just think about
the issues that you're having in your
life and of course everyone's different
and and people people solve their issues
in different ways but but generally just
try to figure out ways to stop them or
to make them better so that you can have
complete focus on your code alright I
know it's easier said than done just
like a lot of this stuff just really try
to make an effort to resolve any issues
you have that's bothering you
one good way to do that is through
meditation or even yoga when you
meditate it clears your mind from
stressful things you can feel completely
rejuvenated after you meditate I've
never done yoga but I hear it does help
both physically and mentally and then if
you don't know how to meditate you can
just do a few youTube searches there's
plenty of resources out there that will
show you different techniques and
different ways to meditate alright so
you also want to try to stay calm I
myself have issues with anxiety and it's
something stressing me out I can't focus
on anything so
I tried stay calm try to stay relaxed
and in a you know decent mood all day
and you don't want to let little things
get to you
and again meditation can also help with
this alright this next one is another
one that I personally struggle with a
lot of us sit by ourselves for hours per
day programming and that can take a toll
on your mind as well not socializing can
really put you into kind of an
introverted state where sometimes you
don't even feel like you're part of the
rest of the world especially for people
like me because I work at home in my
basement which sometimes starts to feel
like a dungeon or prison I'm grateful
that I have a wife and kids that I can
go upstairs and hang out with because if
I lived alone and probably be a hermit
so try and keep in contact with your
family and your friends and talk to them
even if it's just small talk don't
become a hermit and if you suffer from
depression or anxiety make sure you get
some help for that whether it's a
counselor or therapist medication
whatever it is that you need to you know
make sure that you're you're okay
alright so you also want to create the
right environment to work in to do your
cold or your design or whatever it is
that you do for hours on end you want to
keep your work area neat and neat and
clutter free clutter can cause stress
and distraction at least for me I need
my area spotless the rest of the house
will be a mess and my office is always
immaculate all right you also want
somewhere to work that's quiet and
peaceful and away from any distractions
if you're if you work from home and you
have kids like I do make your work area
away from where they play because kids
yelling and screaming makes it almost
impossible to focus on on coding all
right so you also want to keep a lot of
natural light in your office if that's
possible it's actually not for me
because like I said my office is in my
finished basement all I have is a
sliding glass door and even out there
it's under a porch so that's another
reason I that it's like a dungeon but
natural I can keep you in a better mood
and just give you an overall
five in your office all right so this
next one works for some people and for
some people such as myself it's more of
a distraction but some some do find that
listening to background music helps
helps them focus I like it silent but I
would guess that either you know calming
soft music can help relax people to get
in the zone you probably don't want to
listen to heavy metal or hardcore rap or
anything like that I can't imagine that
helping anyone focus alright and then
you also want to be comfortable while
you're working and this kind of ties
into your environment you want to stay
comfortable while you work having good
posture is important and this could have
just as well been in the how to take
care of your body section you can do
some bad to your back if you slouch
all day and you have bad posture so you
want to stay sitting up straight keep
your feet on the floor
and try to keep your head straight all
right one good thing that helps with
posture is getting a really nice chair
cheers can get quite expensive but think
about how long you're in that chair
every day all right it's probably where
you spend most of your life if you're
like me so a good share is worth the
money I like gaming style chairs the
dxracer raise your chairs are both
comfortable and they look pretty nice
but they are kind of expensive and then
you have even more expensive chairs like
Herman Miller's which are incredibly
good for your posture and for your back
but they do run you know over $1,000 but
do some research and get a nice chair
it's it's well worth it all right in
addition to your chair make sure that
you have the right desk and your
monitors are positioned well like I said
earlier if you can afford a sit sit and
stand desk I definitely suggest that up
let's make some awesome custom desks
they are kind of expensive the one that
I got I think was around 750 I actually
plan on doing a video on it as well if
you have multiple monitors like I do
make sure that they're in the right spot
where you don't have to keep well you do
have to turn your head but try to limit
that
and if you only have two monitors don't
make it so that you have to turn your
head left or right put one directly in
front of you and then one off to the
side I personally have never understood
position positioning them so that you
stay right at the bezels where they can
act if you if you face front
all right and then you might want to
look into an ergonomic keyboard okay
using the wrong keyboard day after day
can give you carpal tunnel muscle strain
and some other issues
all right there's all type of all types
of ergonomic keyboards out there there's
split keyboards contoured angled
keyboards so you may want to look into
those as well all right now my last
piece of advice is to do other things
aside from programming all right time
flies when writing code and sometimes it
just seems like the day just disappears
all right you don't want to grow old and
realize that you spent 80 percent of
your time 80% of your life staring at a
computer screen
all right most of us who who code love
it if you don't you probably should be
doing something else but when you love
something it's easy to do too much of it
okay so for me the most important thing
is my family so make sure that you take
the time to spend with your family and
friend even if you're just sitting and
talking you don't have to spend money
and go out and do things just sit and
talk play with your kids create some
memories and then if you do have the
money to go out and do do things go on a
vacation even if it's just to the hotel
down the street go somewhere where you
know go somewhere with the people or the
person that you love and don't take your
laptop and don't do work or a write code
while you're there leave the electronics
at home and enjoy just being out and not
having to use your your mind is full
speed like you do every day when you're
writing code all right you should also
find another passion preferably non tech
related whether it's you know collecting
something or playing a sport working on
cars whatever it may be something that
that helps you escape and do something
aside from you know writing code or
building websites or whatever it is okay
you should also try and read and
I'd suggest reading non tech related
books just to get your mind in another
space and I'd also suggest not reading
it on an iPad or a tablet but an actual
physical book all right and again
preferably not tech related give your
mind a break from that stuff for a
little while alright guys so I'm going
to wrap this up I hope this video helps
somebody even if it's just a very small
change a small life change to better
themselves and their health then that
would be great
and don't worry more tech reviews are on
the way until then thanks for watching
and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
