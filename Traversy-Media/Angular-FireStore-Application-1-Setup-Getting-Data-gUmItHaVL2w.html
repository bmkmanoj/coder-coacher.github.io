project series for you we're gonna be
building an angular application from
scratch using the new fire store cloud
platform from firebase now fire store
allows you to store sync and query data
for web applications or mobile
applications and it's supposed to be
really scalable as well as really fast
and I've had quite a few requests for
this especially from people that went
through my angular 4 udemy course where
we used firebase to build a pretty
decent sized application and if you want
to get into things like firebase
authentication and stuff like that I'd
suggest checking that course out I'll
put a promo link in the description
alright so this is the application here
it's basically just an item manager now
you guys can use posts or users or
whatever resource you want I just chose
items just to have something very
general that you guys can build off of
all right so we're also using
materialized CSS for the CSS framework
and if we want to add an item we can go
up here and we'll say item say item five
for the title and then we have a
description we'll just say this is item
five and submit and you can see it gets
added down here now if I go when I look
in my firestore back-end you'll see that
it's added in real time I didn't even
have to reload let's see where is it
right here item five alright so each
each item will have a unique ID
generated by firebase and it also have a
title and a description which you just
saw me enter okay so in addition to
adding them obviously we can read them
and list them and then if I click on one
of these icons over here these edit
icons it'll pull down a little form and
we'll be able to update the item so
let's change this to item five and this
this changes as I type right here
because we have our two-way data-binding
with angular and by the way we're using
angular for but you know when angular 5
is released with the CLI you can use
that as well
there's nothing particular to angular
for that you can't do with angular 5
here so we'll change this to I don't
know we'll just say updated item just to
show you that we can change it and then
we'll click update and you can see that
that's been updated all right and if you
want to delete it you can click on the
Edit icon again and you can click on
delete item you can also double-click
the item itself to delete it all right
and you can see that that's been updated
and firestore as well all right so
that's what we'll be building guys so
the very first step is to create our
fire store so that's what we're gonna do
next
hey guys if you've been watching my
videos for a while and you really like
what I do when I've helped you out a lot
consider becoming a patron even for one
dollar per month it pushes me to keep
bringing you guys the best content I
possibly can there's reward tiers for
discounts for you to me courses personal
support and more so check out the
patreon link in the description below
for more info so to create a fire store
you're gonna have to log in to firebase
Google comm and log into your console ok
so from the home page you'll see a
console link up on the right here and
then you should see a screen like this
so I already have this fs1 dev database
that's what I created to create you know
the initial app but I'm gonna start from
scratch so we're gonna click add new
project and we're gonna call this let's
call it FS 1 prod for production and
then create project alright and that's
gonna generate everything for us and
just because used fire store doesn't
mean that you can't use you know
firebase authentication or storage or
all that stuff alright it's just using
the fire store instead of the real time
database all right so what's that set up
you'll get your standard firebase
back-end but what we want to do is go
over to database and then instead of
choosing the real time database we want
to choose the cloud fire store so we're
gonna click try fire store beta and at
the time you're watching this it may not
be in beta anymore
all right now this right here is asking
us if we want to start in locked mode
that means that we have to authenticate
through firebase to actually read or
writes to to our data now I'm not going
to get into authentication in this
tutorial in this series if you really
want to get into firebase authentication
again I would suggest watching the
angular front-to-back
udemy course alright so we're going to
choose test mode so that we can publicly
read and write to our database and we'll
click enable alright an authentication
doesn't change whether you're using real
time database or a fire store it doesn't
matter all right so once that's set up
you'll see a screen like this now what's
really nice about fire stores the
interface it gives us to actually add
data when we use the regular real time
database we actually have to just add
custom JSON which is kind of annoying so
we can just click Add collection here
and we'll say items next and then for
the document ID we're gonna leave it to
auto ID to auto generate and for the
first field we want title we can choose
the type okay so you have all these
different types we're going to choose a
string though and then the value I'm
just gonna say item one alright so we
want one more field I'm gonna click add
field this is gonna be the description
it's gonna be a string and it's going to
say this is item one all right then
we'll click Save and that will create
our document for us okay you can see it
has its own unique ID a title and a
description so let's click well add
document again will create one more will
say title item to click another field
this will be description and we'll say
this is item two and save okay and
that's it our firestore is now set up
and we're ready to create our angular
application alright guys so now we need
to do is generate our angular
application with the angular CLI okay
now the main module we're using to
interact with firebase or Phi
store is this angularfire - so there's a
lot of good documentation here we're not
following it to a tee
for example they show you how to bring
it into a component here we're actually
going to create a service which is a
better thing to do because then your
service is expandable across all of your
components rather than just you know
bringing in the inkwell you know what
you need from angularfire in every
single component so you don't repeat
yourself
so we'll do things a little more
difficult but much more efficient so
let's generate our application now
you're gonna need the angular CLI to get
that you want to do NPM install - g4
global and then the @ symbol angular
slash CLI and I'm sure it'll most of you
guys know this if you've ever worked
with angular before but yeah this will
this will Ghent this will make it so
that we can generate any angular
application from any directory alright
so I'm gonna create my foot my project
folder here in my Dropbox code prod
folder and to create a new application
we just need to do ng new and then the
name of the application in this case I'm
going to call it angular FS or angular
firestore okay and that'll generate the
folder and all of the all the main
angular files it'll create the source
folder with the app folder inside of it
it'll have the core app component and
then we'll create components to nest
into that component all right and then
we'll create our service and there's a
bunch of things we need to do hopefully
it's not too confusing like I said if
you've used angular before you shouldn't
have any issues if you haven't I'll try
to explain things as well as I can but
if you are absolutely new to angular and
you've never used it I would suggest
watching at least the angular 4 in 60
minutes video before watching this
alright so now that that's done we're
gonna just CD into the folder we created
which is angular FS and I'll just clear
that out so from here we should be able
to generate or not generate but run our
application with the dev server and we
can do that with ng
serve and then if we want that to open
automatically we can do - - open and
that should open it on port 4200 by
default okay so there's our default
angular application now what I want to
do is now that we know that it's working
we're gonna stop it with ctrl C and
we're going to install some dependencies
all right so we're gonna have a couple
front-end dependencies like materialized
CSS we're going to use for our framework
our CSS framework we're going to need
jQuery because it's a it's a dependency
of materialized and then I'm also gonna
use font awesome which is an icon
library so let's install those with NPM
so we'll say npm install now if you're
using NPM version 5 or later you don't
have to do - - save in order to save
your dependencies to your package JSON
file but I usually use it just in case
especially where I do videos and you
know a lot of you guys may not have NPM
5 or later so I'm just going to include
it but let's do materialized
- CSS jQuery and font - awesome okay so
we'll install those three things alright
and then I'm just clear this out there's
two other things we need to install and
that is firebase ok the firebase module
itself and then angularfire - which is
you know the connector between angular
and firebase so we need both of those
installed and angularfire - is very very
powerful
it included we can do authentication we
can do you know real-time databases
firestorm basically anything to do with
with firebase storage file storage all
that alright so that should do it for
dependencies now what I'm going to do is
open this folder in my text editor I'm
using vs code so I'm able to do just to
code dot and that should open it up in
vs code
all right so from here what I want to do
is take the scripts and stylesheets that
we just set up like materialize in
jQuery and font awesome and we're gonna
put them into the angular CLI dot JSON
file okay there's a place for styles and
for scripts and as you can see there's a
default stylesheet included with angular
that's actually the source assets no
where is it right here styles dot CSS so
it includes that in addition to that
we're going to put a comma and we're
going to include font awesome which is
going to be dot dot slash in the node
modules folder and font awesome
let's see font awesome slash let me just
check this the exact location let's see
all right so it's gonna be fun awesome
slash CSS slash font awesome dot CSS so
we want that file loaded or included
then we want the materialized CSS which
is dot dot slash node module slash
materialized - CSS slash dist slash CSS
slash materialised dot CSS alright so
those are the styles now in the scripts
we first want to include jQuery so
against in the node modules slash jquery
slash dist
slash jquery dot j s and then finally we
want the materialized javascript file
which is in materialized
- CSS slash dist and then j s and then
materialized j s sorry so those are all
the scripts we need let's save this and
then we're going to run the server again
so let's go back to get bash or whatever
terminal you're using and we're just
going to run ng so
and now all those scripts should be
included and we should see this change a
little bit because of the materialized
framework alright so now you can see
that the fonts are much bigger so things
have changed a little bit and then just
to check you want to do an f12 to look
at your console make sure there's no you
know missing jQuery or anything like
that any errors like that so we should
be all set we can close this file up now
like I said I mean I'm not going to go
through the very basics of angular you
know if you don't know anything about
angular 4 or 2 or 5 anything but
angularjs I'd suggest watching the
angular 4 in 60 minutes but basically
we're going to go into the source folder
and then app and then app dot module dot
TS so this is basically like a meeting
place for everything any component you
create any service any module you bring
in has to go into this file alright and
then it has to be imported and put in to
where it's supposed to go an NG module
for example components go into
declarations when we create a service
that goes into providers and then
modules go into imports all right so
angular fire has some stuff we need to
bring in if we look at the documentation
here let's see it's actually a lot to
this getting started with authentication
we don't want that installation set up
let's take a look at that so we've
already installed it we've already done
that all right so right here now in
order to basically link our fire store
with our application we need to include
this object here with the API key the
auth domain all this stuff and they
recommend putting it in your environment
TS file so what we're going to do is go
into environments and then environment
TS and we're going to inside of this
constant let's put a comma right here
and we'll say firebase and that's going
to be an object
okay and then we can get this stuff from
our fire store if we go back to our fire
base here you know what I'm gonna just
make this bigger just so we can see
things better and if we go to let's see
overview make sure you're in your proper
gear at the right project mines fs1 prod
and then click on this icon right here
and this will give you all of your
information your API key everything you
need to put in that object so let's copy
that and we're just gonna paste that
right in here alright so make sure it
looks like that and make sure you use
your own information not mine so we'll
save that okay so that puts everything
in that file now we have to import that
file if we go down here you'll see we're
importing environment from that
environment file so I'm actually just
going to copy that
and let's put that right there
we'll make this bigger too all right so
we're importing environment and then
there's some other things we need to
import we need angularfire module which
comes from angular fire too
so let's grab that as well and you can
either go you can copy it from here or
you can just type it in now this is just
angular fire itself we're also using a
fire store and there's a separate module
we need to import which is angular fire
store module so let's say let's do that
as well so import angular fire store
module and that's gonna be from
angularfire to slash fire store okay and
then if you wanted authentication then
you would bring that in separately as
well but we're not going to get into
authentication in this particular
project at least up to this at least to
the point that I have it alright so
let's see we'll go back here and you can
see that they're adding angular fire
module dot initialize app to the imports
and then they're passing in that fire
bass object from the environment file
that we put in so let's go ahead and do
that so when the imports will put a
comma here and it'll say angularfire
module and then we want to call
initialize app and we want to pass in
environment dot firebase all right and
then a second parameter of the app name
which is in this case angular FS okay so
that'll import firebase and you know
everything that's needed so we also want
to bring the angular firestorm module
into the imports so we'll put a comma
here and we'll say angular firestorm
module okay
just that we don't have to add any extra
method or anything like that so that's
that's pretty much it as far as bringing
in angular fire into our app dot module
file so let's save this make sure we
have no errors in our application okay
it's still running good all right now if
we go into app you can see we have our
app component ts file this is our main
app component and then we have our HTML
app component HTML file which is what
you're looking at right here so I'm
gonna clear all this stuff out we don't
need any of this so we'll get rid of it
and save and you can see that it'll just
auto upload or auto load okay now we're
gonna need a component to display our
items from firebase or from fire store
so let's let's generate a component so
what I'm gonna do is open up my
integrated terminal okay you can do this
through your command line or your
regular terminal I'm using vs codes
integrated terminal and you can you can
open that with control tilde or view
integrated terminal and from here we're
going to say ng g4 generate component
and we want to go into the components
folder and then call this items so we'll
run that
okay and then what that did is it
created a components folder in our app
folder and then we have an items folder
with items component TS that's our main
component class and then also the HTML
file which is the view those are the two
files you need to worry about with your
components we're not dealing with the
CSS or the spec test file just those two
all right now I want this items
component to display in the the main app
component so notice that it has a
selector of app items that means that we
can display it with this selector so
let's go back into the app component
HTML file and just put in app - items as
in as a custom HTML tag or as a
directive and we'll save it go back and
now we get items works ok now I just
want to wrap this in a container
okay we're using materialized CSS and it
has a class of container which will just
kind of push everything into the middle
so we want to wrap that like that okay
and that'll push it over to the middle
alright so we have our item component or
items component now we need a service to
actually fetch stuff from you know using
angular fire to fetch it from fire store
so let's generate a service so we're
gonna go back to our terminal down here
and say ngg service we wanted to go on a
folder called services and we're gonna
call this let's call it iight 'm service
so just item and then that generates a
folder called services with a file
called item service TS and it gives us a
class of item service all right so this
is where we're gonna basically do all of
our interaction with firebase using
angular fire now when you create a
service or anything as I said before it
has to go into the app dot module dot TS
file now the component the items
component that we generated with CLI
automatically put in here it's imported
and it's automatically put in the
declarations services however are not so
we're gonna have to just bring that in
ourselves so we're going to say import
items service from dot slash services
slash item dot service
okay now services don't get added to
declarations again I get added to
providers so we're gonna add in here
item service like that and save and now
we're gonna go back to our service and
we're going to fetch our items from
angularfire I'm sorry angular fire store
Jesus is so many different things I
could get them confused sometimes so
there's a couple things we need to
import from angular fire alright so one
is the basic angular fire store
alright the next is gonna be the angular
fire store collection okay which
represents collections in our case we
only have one collection which is item
and then also something called angular
fire store document so it's the angular
fire store document which is going to
represent single documents so when we do
like an update to a single document or
delete things like that then we use that
and these are all gonna be from whoops
these are all going to be from
angularfire 2 slash fire store ok and
this stuff is in the documentation there
it should be it's fires fire store
module we already did that
yeah so this gives us kind of bits and
pieces of what we're doing let's check
this out
documents yeah see angularfire stored
document we're not dealing with that yet
we're dealing with collections so right
here angularfire collection all right so
anyway now that we even we've brought
this stuff in the angularfire store we
have to inject that as a dependency into
the constructor so that we can use it
within our service so we're going to say
public and then we can call it whatever
we want right here I'm gonna call it a
FS and then just set it to angularfire
store okay and then let's see we're
gonna have a property up here and we're
gonna add a property of items collection
and we're gonna set that to angular fire
store collection and I'm gonna give that
a type whoops I'm gonna give that a type
of item all right so right now doesn't
know what item is so we're gonna
basically just create an interface so
we're gonna say interface item and we're
gonna say that this should be an ID and
I'm gonna put a question mark which
basically means optional so ID which
should be a string a title also optional
string and description string okay so
now we that red squiggly line is gone
because it knows what this item type is
now instead of putting it right in the
file I don't want to do that because I'm
going to be using this interface in
multiple places and other components and
stuff so what I'm going to do is in the
app folder we're gonna create a folder
called models and inside models we'll
create a file called item dot TS okay
and then we're just gonna grab that
interface cut it
put it in there and then just put a
sport in front of it so that it can be
used outside of this file so then we can
just import it into our service so we
can say import item from it's gonna be
dot dot slash models slash item okay so
now it knows what this item is and we
can now use it in other files as well
okay so items collection we have set to
the angularfire store collection with
the type of item then we're also going
to have a property called items and this
is going to be an observable so we need
to actually bring in the observable
package from reactive extensions so
let's say import observable from
reactive extensions which is rxjs
slash observable okay and then what this
items is going to have a type of
observable and it's going to be an item
as well so we can put in here item but
it's going to be an array so we want to
say item and then some brackets okay and
then down here in the constructor we
want to set this dot items okay so we're
talking about this right here let's set
this dot items to this dot af-s which is
the angularfire store okay we injected
that right here so it's available for us
to use and we're going to call dot
collection and we're gonna set this to
items and then we're gonna say dot value
changes like that and that's what this
value changes does is it returns our
collection has an observable so if we
look over here let's see value changes
so there's multiple ways of streaming
collection data from your fires to
our value changes as one of them
observable data synchronized array of
JSON objects but the thing is with this
with value changes it doesn't give you
the ID and we're gonna need the ID so
later on we're actually going to change
it to snapshot changes which does
include the ID and this there's
somewhere in here that shows you when to
use which one but I'm not sure where it
is but anyways I just want to show you
an easy way to get your data so we're
just going to do this now there's one
more method I want to create and that's
to get items so this is what we're
actually gonna call from our component
and all this is gonna do is return this
dot items okay so items is being set or
being initialized as an observable here
with the type of item then we're taking
it and we're setting it to a collection
the items collection dot value changes
which will send it as an observable
which is like a data stream and then get
items is just returning that okay so
weird this is all we're gonna do for now
we'll save it and then we're gonna go
into our items component so it's going
to component items component TS in order
to use any of those service functions or
service methods we need to import the
service alright so we're going to say
import items service from dot dot slash
dot dot slash services slash
item dot service okay and we need to
inject that as a dependency into the
constructor okay so for that will just
say public let's say public item we can
call this part whatever we want I'm just
gonna say item service with a lowercase
I and then we need to set it to item
service with an uppercase I because
that's what we brought in right here
okay actually we're gonna set this to
private alright so now we want to do is
we want to fetch our items through the
service okay using this get items right
here so ng on an it is a life cycle
method that runs automatically when your
component is generated so just to show
you that I'm going to just console dot
log and let's just say ng on an it ran
and we'll save that go back and let's
open up our console with f12 or our dev
tools and you can see ng on and it ran
so it runs automatically just like the
constructor okay although the
constructor is really only supposed to
be used for injecting things like
services ng on an it is where you want
to do your initializations okay things
like fetching stuff so that's what we're
gonna do here we're gonna we're gonna
call that get items from the service and
remember that's that's going to be an
observable using value changes sends it
as an observable which we need to
subscribe to so let's go back and let's
say this dot item service dot get items
and then we need to subscribe
and inside this subscribe we can put
whatever we want here I'm going to call
it items because that's that's what it's
gonna give us set it to a set of curly
braces and let's just console dot log
the items okay and we'll go back here
and if we look down here what's logged
you'll see we're actually we're actually
fetching the data from the fire store we
have item one and item two alright so
hopefully I mean I know that's kind of
difficult to follow along with those of
you that have taken my angular 4 course
I know you know exactly what's going on
but those of you that have and we're
just fetching data through the service
using angular fire we're returning the
items as an observable and then we're
catching it we're subscribing to them in
our component and just logging them all
right now obviously we don't want to
just log them we want to show them in
our template here so what we need to do
is set these items as a property so in
the class right above the constructor
we're going to say items we're gonna set
it to the type of item and it's going to
be an array now it doesn't know what
item is but remember we created the
model right here what we can do is we
can import that so we can say item from
and let's see that's gonna be what dot
dot slash yeah dot dot slash twice
models slash oops item alright so now
that that's a property what we want to
do is when we get the items from the
observable through the SUBSCRIBE right
here we want to set them to this
property so we'll save this dot items
which is accessing this right here and
we're going to set it equal to the items
that are coming in from this
subscription right here alright we'll
just go just comment that out so now
that we have that those items placed in
this property this is accessible through
our template through our HTML
now since it's an array what we want to
do is we want to loop through it okay
and we can do that using the angular ng4
directive so let's go to our HTML items
dot component HTML okay we're gonna get
rid of this and then we're gonna put a
div here and then I just want to check
to see if they're actually our are any
items because if there are not then I
want to do something different I want to
say basically there's no items so we're
gonna do an NG if so asterisk and gif
and we're gonna set that to items
question mark dot length and we're going
to say if the length is greater than
zero okay and then we're going to we're
actually going to use something called
NG template which was new in angular 4
it wasn't available and angular 2 was
one of the one of the few you know on
the surface changes so we can say
semicolon else no items okay and no
items is going to be the name of our
template so we're gonna go down below
the div and say NG template and we're
gonna say hash no items like that
alright so if there's no items than
whatever we put in here is going to show
and I'm just gonna put in an HR and then
I'm just gonna put an H five and I'm
gonna say there are no items to list
okay and then up here if there are items
then what do we want to do we basically
just want to loop through them so we're
going to use a UL all right and we're
gonna use an ng for to do the loop so
we'll say asterisk ng for we want to say
let item of items
okay now this items right here what this
is talking about is this items property
which we set to the items coming in from
the service okay hopefully that makes
sense so we're gonna loop through those
now we're using materialized CSS and for
this ul I'm just gonna add a class of
collection because it'll make it'll make
it look better
um yeah collection and then inside here
for the lis
these are gonna have a class let's say
collection - item all right and then
here we should be able to get the item
filled so remember we have an ID title
and a description so let's try to get
the title okay we're going to use string
interpolation with our double curly
braces so we'll say item dot title
alright we'll save that let's go to our
application and there we go item two and
item one so we can get the title so if
we want the description what I'll do is
put a colon here actually let's put
strong tags around the title yeah so
we'll put strong tags around it and then
we'll put a space and then item dot
description like that
okay so now we have our item - this is
item 2 same thing with item 1 alright
and then these colors you're seeing the
purple and the yellow that's because
they have an extension installed called
or as a bracket pair colorizer it helps
you not get confused well you know what
ending brackets go with what starting
brackets things like that
so don't worry about the colors if
you're not seeing that whoops I didn't
want to close that up alright so now
we're actually fetching this data from
firebase or from our fire store if I
were to go to
let's get if I were to go here and add
another document say title we'll call
this item 3 description this is item 3
and save let's go back to our
application and you can see it's already
there I didn't even have to reload
alright so I think this is a good place
to stop now that we have basically the
hard part is done input you know
bringing in angularfire creating our
service and all that stuff now one issue
we do have is we can't get we don't have
the ID if I were to change item title to
item dot ID and save you'll see it's not
going to give it to us we got in order
to get the ID we have to use instead of
value changes we have to use snapshot
changes and then we also have to add
some other stuff we have to add a map
and then we have to do this stuff here
to get the ID which is a little
confusing but I'll show you how to do
that so let's put that back to title and
save it and yeah we'll continue this in
