you how to get started with Django which
is a Python framework and yes and I'm
finally doing a tutorial on Python a lot
of you guys have been asking for it I do
plan on doing a very basic Python for
beginners looking into the core language
and syntax and so on but I wanted to do
a project based tutorial on Django first
I know it's kind of backwards but this
is going to be more of a demo than a
structured tutorial just to let you know
I'll explain what I can but I'm not
going to go in-depth excuse me on every
piece of code that I write we're going
to build a to-do list with the Django
administration panel so that we can log
into the admin add to do's now you can
follow along with this tutorial and
build pretty much any kind of crud
application I just chose to do a to-do
list because it's simple and every
something that everyone understands so
before we get into it let's talk a
little bit about what Django is it's a
high-level Python framework that
encourages rapid development and
pragmatic design all right so it's
supposed to take all the hassle out of
web development and it relies heavily on
the command line to help us do things
really quickly Django is a little
different than let's say Ruby on Rails
or other MVC frameworks it actually
follows the MVT design pattern which is
Model View template alright so basically
we create our models we link to a
database and we put our logic inside of
a view file and then display the UI with
templates so the view file essentially
works like the controller does in MVC
it's a little weird at first but it
makes a lot of sense when you actually
start to work with it all right now I'm
relatively new to Django so if you're a
seasoned Django developer and you see me
do something wrong or something where
there could be a better way just go
ahead and let me know in the comments
but don't be an asshole
alright so let's get started I'm going
to go ahead and open up my terminal I'm
using Terminator but you can use any
terminal program and first thing we want
to do just make this a little bigger we
want to install pip which is the Python
package manager so to do that we're
going to do
pseudo let's do app to get update let
that update and by the way if you're on
Windows you want to go - I think it's
Python org and just go ahead and
download Python and you can install it
as an exe if you're using a bun - it's
already installed if you say python -
capital v whoops I spelled it wrong you
can see I'm using version 2.7 but you
can also use version but I think three
point six is too late latest version but
a lot of people prefer 2.7 but on what
I'm doing in this tutorial is the same
no matter what version you're using
alright so now that we updated our
package manager let's do sudo sudo
apt-get install and then we want to do
Python - pip yes
alright and once that's done we can
install Django using pip alright so now
let's do sudo pip install Django
okay now it's telling us we're using pip
version 8.1 version version 9.0 point 1
is available all right now we want to
check check the installation by saying
Django - admin and then we're going to
do - - excuse me - - version and you can
see we're using Django one point 10.5
which is the latest at this time yours
may be different depending on when
you're watching this now there is
something called a virtual environment
that you could install so that you can
manage multiple Django applications
I'm sorry Python applications or not
applications with different environments
so that that's something you may want to
look into if you plan on doing a lot of
Python development but I'm not going to
do that in this video
all right so now what we want to do is
let's going to create a folder or
directory sorry we're in Linux a
directory called apt okay this is pretty
much a brand new one to install I did
install Adam and Terminator and Chrome
but aside from that it's pretty much a
default installation alright so let's go
into apps and we're going to create a
django application okay so we can do
that with that Django admin and then
we'll say start project and let's call
this to-do list all right so now if we
go CD into to-do list and we can see
that there's a managed PI file and then
there's a to-do list folder now I'm
going to do is open up my text editor
which I'm using atom and I'm going to
open that to-do list folder as a project
alright so let's go ahead and say add
project to folder see it's an app's
to-do list alright let me just close
this stuff up
okay so we have managed pi which we
don't really we don't need to look at
this file this is just this is a tool
that we use in the command line to do
stuff with alright then we have our
to-do list which has settings URLs and
this WSGI which I'm not even sure what
that is but settings we can change we
can edit our settings here we can change
the template directories things like
that if we use middleware that goes here
installed apps so by default Django
comes with an admin and off and
authentication app obsessions messages
static files this is where we put our
database information now we're going to
be using MySQL so we're going to need to
install that as well
and then we have our static URL folder
this is basically where we want to put
our CSS files things like that alright
so it's just the main settings for for
Python it doesn't use XML files or
anything like that everything is in the
Python file and then this URLs is kind
of like our routes ok you can see here
the admin route is set up it uses
regular expressions but we'll get into
that later alright so next thing we want
to do now what we want to do is we need
to create an app ok Python has these
things called
apps and I think that's kind of a stupid
word for it because I look at the whole
thing as an app but I would I would
personally rather call them modules so
basically of different modules so if we
have a blog we're going to have a blog
module if we have a store we'll have a
store module so what we're going to do
is create a - duze module or app
whatever you want to call it alright now
to do that we use that manage PI file so
what we can do is we can say Python and
we can say manage dot PI and then start
app and then let's call it - duze all
right now if we look in our folder
structure here you can see it created a
two dudes folder with a bunch of stuff
in it ok we have our admin PI apps
models that's where we put all of our
models tests and then views we also have
migrations ok because we can
perform database actions through
migrations just like we can with Ruby on
Rails if you've ever used that so the
next thing I want to do is I want to try
and run the server so I cleared out my
console here and what we can do is we
can say python managed dot pi and then
run server alright you're going to get
this 13 unapplied migration so you can
ignore that for now but you can see it's
on localhost port 8000 so let's go to
that and you should see a page like this
this is just the Welcome page letting
you know that everything is OK and up
and running alright so now we're going
to start to work on our to-do app so we
want to be able to go to slash to do's
and that's going to be our index page
for our to-do so what we can do is go to
our to-do list
URLs PI file and this is basically the
route okay and it uses regular
expressions so this right here is for
the admin side which we'll get to in a
little bit but basically this caret
symbol here means that this is where it
starts ok so we're saying any route that
starts with this word admin all right
now we want to take - dues so I'm just
going to copy this right oops
and then what we want to do is just take
that and say to dues and then anything
that goes to to do is we want to send to
the to dues URL file which we're going
to create a second so right here we can
say include we say include and we want
to use the to dues dot URLs file okay so
if we go to to do slash add then all we
have to put in our to do is URL file is
add now this include right here we
actually have to bring in so right here
we're going to just say include column
all right
so we'll save that now let's go into our
to-do folder and create the URLs file so
say URLs dot PI and then here we want to
bring in the URLs package so we'll say
from Django conf dot URLs and we want to
import URL we also want to import the
views so we're going to say from dot
which is the current folder and port the
views file and then just like we have in
this URLs file this URL patterns we're
going to just grab that okay and then
let's get rid of that one and then the
wrote we want to match here so we'll say
carrot and then money sign so this means
start with and end with so whatever we
put in the middle here is what it's
going to match now this is going to be
just the root of two dues
so just slash to do so we're not going
to put anything in there and then we
want it to go to views and then the
index function alright and we're also
going to give this a name of index so
it's going to look for a function in the
views file called index all right so
let's save that and it's not going to
work yet because there's no index I
would see to do is is not defined
I think I messed up something here yeah
this should actually be in quotes it's
looking at it as a variable module
object has no attribute index see oh
actually that's right because we have no
index function and it's looking for it
so now what's going to our view spy and
we're going to go right here we're going
to say def define index this is how you
create a function in Python and it's
going to take a parameter of a request
because every request is going to have a
bunch of stuff with it it's going to
have any form submission data it's going
to have the user's IP address and a
whole bunch of stuff and that all goes
in that in that request by our request
object so we need to decide what we want
to happen when the index use loaded so
what I'm going to do is just return HTTP
response HTTP response and then we'll
just send some text so we'll just say
hello world's a world
alright now in order to use this HTTP
response we need to bring it in so we're
going to say from Django HTTP and import
we want to import HTTP response so let's
save that and see invalid syntax def
index requests oh we need to start the
colon okay so now we get hello world at
slash to dues now I also want the home
page to go to the to do so what we can
do is in our to-do list and then URLs
pie I'm just going to copy this
and paste that in there and then just
get rid of the two dues what we'll do is
just put a money sign so that matches
the route and that will go to two dues
as well so if we go and just go to
localhost 8080 well world alright so so
far so good now what I want to do is I'm
going to close these out I want to
connect our database so if we go to
settings dot pi and go down to databases
you'll see that by default it uses SQL
Lite SQL Lite is it's a file based
database it's very simple it's really
good for prototyping and development but
it's not something you would want to use
in production unless it's a really
really small site with with you know not
that much data but what I would suggest
is that you see the postgrads or MySQL
so for this tutorial we're going to use
MySQL and we have to install it so if
you already have my SQL installed
whether you're in Linux or you're on
Windows using xampp or something you
won't have to take these steps but what
we're going to do is just install MySQL
real quick alright so I'm going to just
split this and let me make this bigger
so to install MySQL let's first do a
sudo apt-get update oops it's wrong
and then we want to go do sudo apt-get
install and we want to install MySQL -
server yes
okay so we're going to set a password
for our root user
okay let's say service mysql status okay
so it's running now what we're going to
do is we need to install the Python
MySQL module so let's go ahead and do
that we're going to say sudo so does it
sudo apt-get install and I think it's
Python Python
- MySQL T or not or is it DP let me try
that yeah Phoebe okay so now that we've
done that we need to create a database
so we're going to log into MySQL by
saying sudo MySQL and we want - you
we're logging in as the root user root
and then we want to enter a password
okay I'm going to enter the password I
just chose earlier and now we're in
MySQL so let's say create database to do
list look step two semicolon all right
so now if I stay show databases I always
see it that damn semicolon and there it
is to do list okay so we have MySQL
setup and if you're using Windows and
you can go into something like PHP
myadmin
and just create a database called to do
list so now what we want to do is go
back into our settings and we want to
change up this database field here so
instead of SQL Lite we're going to say
dot MySQL and for name let's get rid of
this we're going to put in our database
name which is to do list
okay let's see we're going to put in the
user which is root and we want to put in
the password want to put in whatever you
used and let's see we'll say host host
we're going to leave blank because the
default is your local host and then port
will also leave that blank for the
default port alright so now that we have
that let's save it and now we want to
run out on migration now this next
command is going to create all the
tables we need for our admin for off and
all that kind of stuff alright so let's
go back up here and I'm just going to
quit the server and we're going to do
Python manage dot PI and then migrate
all right so it's applying all those
migrations and it's applied it's created
those tables or it should have so let's
go back down here and let's say look
down here in MySQL and we'll say use
to-do list and let's say show tables and
you can see that it's created all those
tables for us so next thing we want to
do is you want to create our model for
our dues so we want to go into our -
dues folder and then models dot PI and
we create a class for our models so
we're going to say class to do and then
we're just going to pass them in our
models
doc model and we show you put that Cole
in there and we're going to create our
field so we just want to have a title so
we'll set that to models dot this is
going to be a char field
all right so anything that is going to
be text or anything really any kind of
characters and you want you need to set
a max
for chartfield so let's say max length
and we'll set that equal to 200 all
right then we also want a text say
models and then this is going to be a
text field because it's going to be
longer you want this for like blog post
bodies things like that and then we'll
also do a created at and we'll set that
to models dot and let's say date time
field that and I want this to be
automatically inserted so basically I
want to just be the current date and
time so I'm going to use a package up
here I'm going to import a package from
date/time which is a Python package and
we just want to import date/time and
then let's see and here we just want to
say default I'm going to set a default
to date/time dot now okay we're also
going to set blank to true
all right so that'll do it for now let's
go ahead and save this file and it
hasn't done anything in the database yet
we need to run a migration we'll clear
that out and then we're going to say not
sudo let's say Python managed dot PI and
then let's do make migrations to do this
oh I'm getting some errors here so
aptitudes come because it in installed
apps so we have to go to our settings
file settings dot PI and we need to add
it to our installed apps right here so
let's see we're going to put in - dues
to do is dot apps got to do config save
that and then for this URL message I
think that pertains to our URLs file or
this right here so I'm just going to
comment that out for now and let's run
that again
ok so it creates a migration with this 0
0 0 1 so now we want to do is we want to
say python manage dot pi and we're going
to say SQL migrate to dues and 0 0 0 1
okay so that created it now we need to
run just migrate so python my not
migrate manage pi migrate alright so now
let's go down here to SQL and let's say
show tables and now we have this - dues
underscore to do table so now we're
going to do is create a user so that we
can use the admin panel so up here let's
clear that out and we're going to save
Python
manage dot pi and then we're going to do
create a super user and we'll do - -
username username equals let's say add
an EXO sick Brad and then we want email
so - - email equals and I'm just going
to put a fake email in hand and then
we're going to do actually that's it so
we'll click enter it's going to ask us
to create a password
take it s to be eight characters so I'm
doing one through eight oh it's too
common alright so let's do I'll do
uppercase P password one and then
exclamation oh they didn't match
password one
okay so super user created successfully
so now we should be able to log in to
the backend so if we set slash admin
don't we need to run the server so
Python managed dot pi run server reload
so what's the username was Brad password
and there we go so now we're logged into
the backend and from here we can add
more users if we want okay we can add a
username and password we can add groups
and put users inside of these groups
okay and we can choose permissions so
things different things they can do can
they add a group can they add logs can
they change permissions so this is some
really cool functionality right off the
bat which is really nice now notice we
can't we have no to dues anywhere so so
to add that we're going to go just close
these out we're going to go to to dues
and then admin dot pi and from here
we're going to bring in our model so
let's say from dot models we're going to
import to do okay and then we're going
to say admin dot site dot register and
then just pass in to do so let's save
that and we're going to reload our admin
panel and then if you look here we have
a two section so those couple lines of
code allowed us to give us all this
functionality so we can now add them so
let's say my to do one this is my first
to do in this awesome application okay
and then notice that the date is
prefilled with right now and the time
and we're going to click Save all right
now notice that right here just says to
do object okay now what I want to have
is the title here so what we need to do
is go into our models file and we just
need to say right here we'll say def
double underscore STR double underscore
and pass in here self and then we just
want to return self dot title all right
so that'll actually use the title as
kind of the the main field here so if we
reload and see now we have the title if
we want to add another to do we'll say Y
to do two and save now we have two of
them alright so now we want to work on
our front end we want just go to flash
to do is we want to list our two dues
here so right now we're just sending out
text if we go to our views file we're
just doing this HTTP response and we
don't want to do that we want to render
a template so instead of this we're
going to say return render pass in the
request and then the template we want to
use it will say index dot HTML all right
now let's save that and then in our two
dues folder we're going to create a
folder called template okay and then sit
in there we're going to say new file
index dot HTML and let's just say hello
from index and we'll save okay and now
you can see that it's actually loading
that file now if we want to pass in
variables that's really simple what we
can do is just add in an object as a
third parameter now what I usually do is
create a variable called like context
and if we were to say like name actually
that has to have quotes so name
Brad and then down here we'll just pass
in context so now if we save that and we
go to our index and let's say hello from
and we'll use our double curly braces
and we'll say name save that and we get
hello from Brad okay so we can pass in
values just like that which is very
similar to Express and Ruby on Rails now
instead of just sending a name I want to
send our to do so let's make a query to
get those two dues so first thing we
need to do is bring in the model so from
dot models from got models we want to
import to do and then inside of our
index function let's say to dues so
we'll give double T lowercase to do
equals to do dot objects dot all alright
and then we can define how many we want
right here by putting some brackets and
we'll say 10 okay now we want to pass
that into our template as to dues dues
okay so now we should have access in our
template so let's go to our template and
what we want to do is loop through our
two dues so let's put let's do a ul and
by the way I'm not going to work on the
front end
intercom UI I'm not going to use
bootstrap or anything I just want to
focus on Python the design isn't
important all right you guys can do that
afterwards so what we'll do is put in
the curly braces with percent signs oops
and we can say for to do and to do
and then down here we're going to say
and for okay and then here what we want
to do with them is display an li tag and
let's put to do dot title and it will
just put a colon and then we'll do to do
dot text so let's save that reload and
there we go we're pulling out our two
dudes now I just want to put some kind
of header here so let's go up here and
just say header actually know what we
need to put in all our HTML tags and
everything so let's see I'm going to
just take this put it in here and then
inside the body let's say header I'm
just going to put an h1 and then we'll
just put an HR alright so there's our
header what we want to do next is we
want to have a details or a show page
for each to do so let's wrap the title
and a link and we want this to go to
slash to do slash details slash and then
we want to put the ID right here so to
do ID wrap that around the title and
let's reload and if I click on that it
goes to details one for that one this
one will go to details too so now we
need to make it so that that actually
works so we're going to go back to our -
duze urls dot pi file and we're going to
create a new route here so it's a URL
and then we're going to do our
let's say start with with the cat the
carrot symbol and then details slash and
then what we want to do is we want to
stay want parenthesis and then question
mark P and this parameter is going to be
an ID and then we're going to say slash
W and it's a zero comma 50 all right and
then after the parenthesis we'll do
slash money sign which means that's
where it ends and then for that route we
want that to go to view dot details
which we don't need to create alright so
this here is what's needed if you want
to go if you wanted to accept an ID
parameter alright alright yeah an ID
parameter so let's save that and then
we're going to go to views and we're
going to create a new function here
called details now for this it's going
to take an hour quest but it's also
going to take in a to do ID okay because
that's how we set up the route let's see
now we want to just grab a single to do
so let's say to do equals and remember
we have our model so we can say to do
got objects dot get and then we want to
pass in dot get and we want to say ID
equals to do on the score ID okay or
whatever you put right here
so now we need a context and we're going
to return a template
okay so context is going to be just a
single to do so we're going to set it to
this and we want to render a template
called details dot HTML so we'll save
that and we'll create details dot HTML
and let's put in an h1 and we should
have access to to do dot title so let's
save that and try it out okay it looks
like we have an issue view is not
defined all right see it's go to URLs
and should be views not view okay so if
I click on one of these details about an
unexpected keyword argument Heidi oh you
know what since we use ID here we want
to use that here as well not to do ID
okay and then we also have to change it
here so let's try that and there we go
so now we have a details page if we
click on my to do two that's what we get
good so that's exactly what we want now
let's go back to details HTML and let's
put a paragraph tag and that's what
we'll put the text to do text and see
we'll do a line break and then we'll say
created created on to do dot created at
okay save it and there we go now notice
if we look at the source code this
doesn't have the HTML tags and all that
and we could put it in here but that's
that's uh that's not going to work out
especially if we have a lot of templates
we want to basically we can create a
partial and we can include those in our
templates so in the templates folder
let's create a file called partials and
I'm going to create a file called header
dot pi I'm sorry not pi that should be
hetero GML and then also a file called
footer dot HTML and then let's grab from
the index the doctype down to where the
header ends so I'll cut that put that in
our header file save that close it up
and then we'll grab the body in HTML at
the bottom cut that put that in footer
save it close it and go back to index
and then what we'll do is just throw in
our tags here and we'll say include from
the partials folder we want header dot
HTML and then we'll do the same with the
footer like that and let's go back to
the index say template does not exist
partials that should be a dot
okay and let's see let's look at the
source good
let's give it a title in the header file
just say to-do list okay so now in the
details you want to do the same thing we
want to just grab the includes and put
those in the details this will be footer
all right and now you can see that it
has the header in it let's put a go back
in the details as well
okay so we'll say a href and let's set
that to go to slash to dues say go back
and you guys can style this however
you'd like so we have a complete crud
application now with a back end with an
admin admin login so if you want to
create resources from the front end you
can do that as well
so what we'll do is in our header file
let's create a link let's see we'll put
it actually out before we do that I want
to show you how to load CSS files and
then static resources so you need to
create a file I'm sorry a folder inside
to do is called static and let's say new
file actually so now I want to do new
folder CSS and new file style dot CSS
and let's just take the length and we'll
say color green and save now we're going
to go to our header file where we have
our head tags
and let's see we're going to go right
here and we're going to do put in some
tags so if you guys can hear that
banging upstairs and we're going to say
load static okay and then right under it
let's put a link will say rel stylesheet
and that's going to go to you go like
that and say static static style you
know CSS slash style dot CSS alright so
let's see if that works reload and now
we have green links so you know that
that style sheets connected okay so now
let's put our add to do link I'm just
going to go right into the header and
that's going to go to flash to goos
splash add save that okay now that's
obviously not going to work yet
we're going to just close all this stuff
out and let's go to our to do's URLs
file and I'm just going to copy this
make sure there's a comma there oh
okay and then we're going to change
details to add and we want this to load
the add view so right here we'll just
change this to add as well alright so
let's create inside templates will
create a file called add dot HTML and
let's put our includes here so that we
get the header and footer and I think
there is a way to use layouts as well
you can do that instead of partials if
you want now in here I'm going to paste
this in okay so basically we've a form
the action we're setting to URL add
we're going to call the add function
we're making a post request and this
right here at CSRF is going to prevent
cross-site forgeries so you want to have
that then we have an input with the name
of title and the ID of title and then a
text area with the name of text and ID
of text and then I just put a submit
button and a go back so let's save that
and now see module object has no
attribute add use dot add oh we didn't
create the function in the view so let's
go to view spy okay we'll say def add
quest alright now since we're we're
going to use the add function to load
our view to load the form and we're also
submitting to it as a post request so
what we can do is let's test to see if
it's a poster course that's not right to
see if it's a post request or a get
request so we're going to say if request
dot method is equal to host
then we're going to do something else
then we're going to do something else so
if it's not if it's a get are not a post
request we're going to just return
render requests and we want to load the
ad dot HTML template okay so let's save
that and see expected an indented block
probably talking about this let's just
do a turn page not found to do slash ad
oh I have to have the parameter here
stupid this should just be ad like that
Oh see that's still wrong yeah we don't
want to slash so just add oh it's not
working either
oh we need a name maybe there we go okay
so now we have our form and since it's a
get request we're just going to the URL
it's loading up our view now when we
submit it it's going to make the post
request so let's go back to our add
function here and see what we need to do
so we want to grab the form field so the
values and put those in variables so we
can get that from the request object and
we're going to say dot post and here
title and then we want to get text post
text and then what we can do is say to
do equals and then our model and then
we're going to pass in title equals
title and text equals text and then
finally we'll say to do dot save all
right and then after that lets just
redirect by saying return redirect and
let's just go - flash - duze all right
so let's save that and reload and then
let's say test to do this is a test to
do submit global main redirect is oh you
know what we need to bring in redirect
so up here at the top that comes from
the shortcuts so just want to put that
in there all right now it probably still
worked it just didn't redirect so let's
go back to to do's and there it is try
it again
and submit and there we go another test
okay so we can now submit to dues from
the front-end and if we were to go to
our admin area and go to to dues you'll
see that those are all listed here okay
so that's about it guys
oh one more thing if you want to
customize your admin panel if you want
to create basically create your own
template you can go in templates and
create a new folder called admin and
let's create a new file here called what
do we call it based on the source site
dot HTML all right so now if we go back
and reload it's completely blank and
basically we're overwriting it with this
now you can change certain parts of it
so let's put here block branding and
this is all in the documentation down
there and then we'll say and block so
that's all one word and then this is
this is basically on the h1 at the top
it says site administration so we're
going to give this an ID give this an ID
of site name and let's put in here to do
list administration
and let's save that and reload okay so
there's our title now you could build
this whole thing out with these blocks
and if you look in a documentation it
will show you how to do all that but if
you just want to kind of just change one
thing like I am here you can extend the
core template so up here we can say
extend admin slash base dot HTML and
save and then reload and you'll see it's
back and we've changed the title okay I
mean there's all different types of
blocks that you can use to change all
different kinds of elements on the in
this template all right so that's going
to do it guys I hope you enjoyed this I
know that there were some mishaps but
again I'm pretty new to Django but as I
learned more I see that it is a really
nice system to work with and it's great
for getting things up and running really
quickly alright so that's it hopefully
