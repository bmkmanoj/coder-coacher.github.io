going to be building a really simple
application using nodejs Express for and
Apache Cassandra which we'll use for our
database solution alright
I'm making this video because I haven't
found too many tutorials on nodejs
in general and I and I found even less
that have to do with Express for most of
the expressed projects that I found were
expressed 3 and there's some big changes
that you need to know about if you're
gonna use Express 4 alright so don't pay
much attention to the application itself
because it's gonna be really simple but
pay attention to the code and the
structure things like that the
application itself will just be
basically a form maybe a newsletter form
that a user would fill out with their
name and email address and that's going
to get sent to the Cassandra database
and we'll create kind of a really simple
interface where you can edit the user
info you can update and delete it so
just basic crud create read update and
delete all right so we're gonna download
a few things of course we need to
download nodejs from node.js org we're
also gonna have to download Apache
Cassandra which is a column based
database now I'm using Windows 7 so I'm
gonna be downloading obviously the
versions for Windows if you're only
using Linux or Mac you can find
you can find how to install those as
well I believe that it's pretty
straightforward and then lastly we're
going to install git now I'm not
installing it for the version control
although if you're building applications
you should be using it
but I basically want with this windows
get version is the command line
interface that it gives you because I'm
gonna use that for our node development
and it gives you a bunch of UNIX tools
that you can use in Windows alright so
let's start with nodejs
okay we just want to click on the big
install button that's gonna give us a
Windows installer
okay so open that up
in this video we'll just be gathering
the software will be downloading and
installing all the software we need okay
so next very straightforward it's going
to go on the Program Files by default
yes
okay so that's all set click finish you
should see nodejs
menu item here alright and basically it
just offers you this command line
interface to deal with node and all your
projects but I'm not gonna use this I'm
gonna use the git command line that
we're going to download okay so after
you download and install them so I have
to install node you want to install
Cassandra so we'll go to Apache
I'm sorry Cassandra dot Apache org click
on download and you have a few options
here you can download the tarball
probably the preferred method if you're
using Linux or the Debian package we're
using Windows you can use the tarball in
Windows but it's kind of difficult
right here this data stacks community
this offers a really simplified
installation you can see it comes with a
Windows installer and it installs the
Petacci Cassandra installs all the
command line tools and it also installs
something called ops center which is a
browser-based graphical database
management program
which is really cool so we're gonna go
ahead and click on that alright and I am
on Windows 7 64 bit so I'm gonna grab
this right here
okay so we'll download that it's 129
megabytes so it might take a couple
minutes while that's downloading I'm
gonna go ahead and download the get
software okay so this is that get slash
or - SCM calm and we want to click on
downloads for Windows assuming you're
using Windows
alright so both of those will are
downloading so what I'm going to do is
just pause the video and come back when
they're done
alright so the get software is finished
downloading so I'm just gonna go ahead
and run that and same thing just a
really simple installer just go through
its gonna put it in the Program Files by
default it's gonna be the x86 directory
32-bit and here we can leave everything
I do want it on the desktop
now for this option I'm going to choose
the last option here because I want to
be able to have these UNIX tools that
are offered through the Windows command
prompt okay so choose that and for this
I'm just going to leave the default
all right so that's finished
and see we have the little icon on the
desktop if we open it up we get a nice
bash in our face well we can run UNIX
tools we can let's see if node is
installed which it is also you want to
check if NPM is installed which should
come with node and that's a node package
manager okay basically it works much
like rubygems if you've used Ruby on
Rails it offers these modules little
bits of code well not always little but
usually the smaller programs and you can
use them in your node application for
instance Express for is is available to
us through NPM and that's what we'll be
using it's one of the more popular
larger modules
it's basically an MVC framework okay it
gives you all the file structure and
everything to work with so we'll be
using that alright so now that this is
installed we'll just close that and open
up the data stacks installer which will
install Cassandra
all right it's agree
I'm gonna leave these checked because I
want it to start as a Windows service
now Cassandra is it's considered a no
SQL database but it's it's it's a little
different than something like MongoDB or
CouchDB it uses columns okay and each
column has a key and a column is
basically like a table if you've used
relational databases like MySQL a column
is like a table it has fields that we
can set it works a little different than
a table because it's it you don't really
need a set schema and you can interact
with the database using something called
CQ l which is Cassandra query language
and it's it's very very similar almost
identical to SQL as far as that's the
queries go how it works in the backend
is is much different but if you've used
SQL then you'd have no problem
understanding cql and that's ultimately
what we'll be using we're going to use
the data stacks node I'm sorry Cassandra
driver for node so we'll be doing it
through node but the the statements will
be CQL
okay so let's see it says the server is
starting
I also have a video which I'm pretty
much doing the same thing but I go a
little a little bit more in depth
I think it's called installing Cassandra
on Windows or something like that
okay so like I said it offers this OP
Center program actually let me just show
you that real quick
we're not going to be doing anything
with this so just figured I'd show you
so the service is running so we can go
to local hit local host eight eight
eight eight and that will bring us to
the ops center that's the port that it's
on
it's a really sleek interface and gives
you a lot of good analytic tools graphs
things like that so this is the
dashboard you can see it gives us some
information here the storage capacity
the number of nodes will show here
obviously we only have a single node
this is really business enterprise level
stuff it's really used for big data if
you just have a ton of data coming in
from your application you can see it
shows us the right request the right
request latency okay analytics the
operating system load things like that
we're not going to really go into this I
actually haven't used web Center too
much I usually just deal with the cql
command line so I don't really know much
about this I just know it looks really
cool this will show you your nodes okay
and you can set up multiple nodes across
multiple data centers which is really
cool and it's really easy to scale so if
you need a really good storage solution
for your business then this may be the
way to go but it really doesn't have
anything to do with what we're gonna be
doing today so I just figured I'd show
you that what I will be using a little
bit is the cql shell okay so under this
data stacks community edition you should
have Cassandra cql shell and that'll
give you a little interface you can
create key spaces which is like
basically like a schema or even like a
database itself and then in the key
space you can add columns which are like
tables and you can add your fields and
we'll be doing that in then I think the
next video okay because I just want to
get something set up before we actually
build our node application all right so
everything should be good you should be
installed and ready to go all right so I
will see you in part 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
