you how to fetch data from a JSON file
and parse it with PHP it's not going to
be too hard this very small amount of
code but I was actually requested to do
this video alright so what we're going
to do is create a JSON file with an
array of movies which will have a title
year genre in director and we're going
to take that and like I said parse it
with PHP and put it into an 8n HTML
unordered list alright so as for a
server I'm using xampp if you don't have
any type of server to use i'd recommend
downloading xampp at Apache friends org
there's also WAMP and MAMP if you're on
a Mac or you could just use your regular
web hosting provider or if you have a
server you just need to have PHP
installed alright and I'm sure you know
that so I'm gonna go to my htdocs folder
if you have xampp and you you have the
default setup then you go to your c
drive xampp and then htdocs which is
right here now I have my htdocs in my
Dropbox so I'm going to go to Dropbox
htdocs alright we're going to create a
new folder
call it movies and we're going to create
two files first we want to create our
JSON file which will be called movies
dot JSON and then I'm going to create an
index.php file
all right so let's open up the movies
JSON and we'll take care of that I'm
using I want to use sublime text why
it's not showing up
all right so there's my JSON file and
also going to open
my index.php so we'll start with the
json and json is pretty easy if you
don't if you don't know what it is it's
basically just a method of storing data
kind of like XML it's a data interchange
format and it's in my opinion superior
to XML but I'm not going to get into
that but it's just my opinion is it's
faster and it's more readable so yeah so
let's start out we just need to have a
JSON object which is inside of double
I'm sorry is inside of curly braces and
then we want the array name which in our
case is going to be movies all right and
for movies we're going to have the array
so arrays and JSON going between
brackets all right so we're going to
have an array of objects so ultimately
we have a one object for movies and then
inside the movies array we're going to
have a bunch of objects which are will
represent a bunch of different movies so
again objects objects go in curly braces
and we're going to have a couple things
like I said we're going to have a title
alright so let's see actually I want to
do double quotes
so title which should be in between
quotes and then we're going to have a
value I'm just going to say the bridge
all right so just may just picked a
bunch of movies and then we want a comma
all right so that's that the title is
set now we're going to do the year which
is going to be 2004 and you want the
genre which of course is horror
that should be in double quotes
and then we'll have the director
which is cool that's a tough one takashi
shimizu all right now that's the last
key value pair so we don't need a comma
at the end all right so that gives us
one movie all right I'm just going to
actually just grab a bunch of other ones
and just copy and paste so we want to
have a comma here if we're going to add
more more movie objects all right so I
just added a bunch more you can see
they're just separated by a comma
all right so that that does it for our
JSON all right so we can actually open
that up in the browser if we want to see
um
Google Chrome
all right so we have this in the browser
um it's formatted kind of weird this
first one but that's fine all right and
there's there's really no reason why you
would view a JSON file in the browser
but just to show you that you can
alright so now we need the index.php
file and this isn't going to be a lot of
code at all i think it's about ten lines
if that so we want to open our PHP tags
and close them and we're going to create
a variable and I'm going to call it JSON
data and what we want to do is extract
all the content from the JSON file and
we can do that with a function called
file get contents and then in here we
just need the name of the file which is
movies dot JSON alright so now we want
another variable that's going to hold a
decoded version of the file alright so
I'm going to create another variable and
I'm just going to call this JSON and
we're going to use a function called
JSON to code all right and in here we
want our JSON data variable
and we also want a true as a second
argument okay so now we should have now
we should have the the this is going to
hold an array of our objects so if we
can actually echo out a single value
take that variable JSON and we want to
grab the movies array and let's say we
want the first value which will be 0
because arrays the values start at 0 and
then we want the title alright so that
should give us something so let's go
ahead and I'm going to go to localhost /
movies
okay undefined constant title assumed
title line four
oh we need quotes around this
all right so it gives us the grudge and
we can change this to whatever we want
the Godfather
all right so that's how you can you can
call out a single a single value but we
don't want to do that we want to print
everything that's in that file so what
we want to do is create a for each loop
actually before that we want to
initialize our variable so what we're
going to do is create a variable called
output and we're going to build on to
that variable our output including the
HTML and the values and then we're just
going to echo that output into the
browser all right so we're going to
start out setting this to a beginning ul
tag because we want these in a list all
right and then we can create our for
each loop because we don't want the UL
tag inside of the loop we only want the
Li tags all right so we're going to say
for each JSON movies as movie okay so
then we can access those values with
that movie variable so the first thing I
want to put the the actual title in an
h4 tag so we'll say output goes h4 and
then we want to concatenate on the
dynamic value so the title
okay so then we want to concatenate the
ending h4 tag alright so that will give
us our title up one very important thing
here that I missed is we need to have
this b dot equals if we just leave it as
equals it's just going to replace the
output variable we want to append it
onto the variable so we need to use that
dot equals Li and do we want the movie
here
all right then we can just copy what
just copy this here we need two more of
these so this one's going to be genre
and then this one is going to be
directed alright so that's it for the
for each loop now we want to append on
to the output variable the ending UL tag
alright and then we can finally just
echo out output okay so if we go ahead
and reload you can see we now have a
list with our title which is an h4 tag
and then actually know what I want to
add the the titles here so let's just
we'll just say title
I'm sorry we don't want that for the
title just the year we want the year we
want the genre
and the director
alright there we go alright so pretty
easy we get 13 lines of code including
the PHP tags so you can use this you can
reuse this for a different JSON arrays
and objects so I might make another
tutorial where we actually can style
this and maybe add a filter or something
like that but just for this tutorial
that's how you can extract JSON with PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
