want to do a few things first of all
what I want to do is make these icons
bigger all right before we get into
styling these blocks so we're going to
create a couple classes that will allow
us to have the icons vary in size all
right so I'm gonna go to my typography s
CSS file and we're going to create some
classes
all right so FA - and now for these
icons you want to use font size all
right so FA - we'll say - actually we'll
do it by pixels we'll do 18 pixels for
FA - and then I'm just going to copy
this
okay so we'll have FA 3 which will be 24
if a four will do twenty-seven
fa5 let's say 35 and then fa 6 I'll do
40 alright now if we go back to the the
index page and we want the four column
layout which is right here we already
put this the class of FA 4 all right so
let's check that out
alright there's still too small
let's try fa5 we'll just check one of
them out first
are still too small
let's try FA six
all right so that's good because we're
actually going to add some more styling
we want to have a border we're going to
change the color and stuff so I'm just
going to change all these to FA six
oops
all right and they also have a class of
FA primary so we want to create that
all right so for this we're going to
have the color is gonna be the primary
color okay we're going to have a border
with the primary color actually we'll
just use our mixin say include pad
border and that will be one pixel and
the color will be primary and then we
want it to be all we want it on all
sides and let's set the border radius we
can use our mixin for that as well
so include border-radius and we just
want to punch in five pixels
all right and then finally we want some
padding I will do 1350 all right so
let's check that out see what that looks
like
alright something is not right here
color
include only another D here
okay so that looks better I want to
decrease the padding a little bit so you
know what let's set a width start with
50 pixels
okay let's try 80 pixels
because I want them all to be the same
with that's a little too much let's try
70
all right that's good
so I also actually going to do a little
margin bottom to it to margin bottom 10
pixels
and I want the the headings here to be
the primary color as well those it's so
those are H threes
so h3 let's go ahead we're going to
create a class called heading primary
alright so I'm going to copy that class
I want to put that here
here and here alright now it's not gonna
do anything yet we're gonna create that
class so what we want to do is go to
typography and let me just add some
comments here so headings and icons
and lists all right
so headings we want heading primary and
we want to change the back I'm sorry
just the color about the background so
color is going to be primary and we
might as well create our other versions
as well secondary light and dark
okay this will be lights
all right
all right so that looks good
so now we can move on to this area we
want to do the list the list we need to
change the color and size of the icon
alright so for the size I'm gonna just
use one of the FA classes that we
created all right so we have FA check
and we'll change it to FA 6 let me just
see what that looks like
alright so that's good so we want to add
that class to all of these
all right we also want to change the
color
to
all right you know what eff a primary I
don't want that class to take care of
the border because I want to be able to
use it without the border so what I'm
gonna do is create another class called
FA border all right and then I'm going
to take this this
the width and Marge basically everything
except for the color and put that in
there that way we can use F a primary
anywhere since we did that we're going
to lose our styling that we just did so
for these we want to go and just add
that border class to them okay so a PA
will say F a border
because you wanted you want to make it
so that you can reuse your classes all
right so there we go that's all set and
then for these we can now add F a
primary
oops
all right good
so now let's do the text here which is
wrapped in a span you can see right here
we have a span tag around there so
that's what we'll use to do the CSS for
those for the words okay so let's go up
to list okay we have a list off feature
let's go in there and just say span and
what we're going to do is vertical align
look vertical align to the top and
padding top we're going to do nine
pixels and then font size
we are going to use a percentage so
we're going to say home 20%
okay
I do want to push the text
actually you know what
we're gonna grab the icon for the list
feature so inside of still nested inside
the list feature we want to just put in
hi and I'm going to set a margin top to
negative nine pixels and then a margin
right to five pixels
hmm
let's try and change the slide height I
see what that does
let's try changing to much larger
all right that looks good
okay so that's good for the list for the
list feature now we want the button if
we look at the original the button looks
like this okay so this is going to be a
primary button I don't think that we
created any buttons yet we didn't so
let's go ahead and do that just say
button actually put some comment here
okay we want a button primary so we're
going to set that color to primary color
and let's add a white border to it so we
can use our mix in we want you to
include add border and we'll say two
pixels and the color is going to be
white and we want it all around all
right now we'll go back into index and
go to that button oh we already have
button primary so reload and it didn't
change let's try it try adding an
important tag
oh whoa we need to do the background not
the actual text color so backgrounds
actually let's just use our mix in so
we'll say and include include add
background primary color
there we go so the hover state I want to
change that
primary
once you primary hover now I'm going to
show you another great feature of sass
and that is that we can we can lighten
or darken the current color or any color
all right so we can actually say
background and then you can do lighten
and then we just want to surround the
color we want to lighten which will be
primary color and we have to put in a
percentage as well so we'll say 10% so
if we reload you can see when we hover
the color gets brighter let's actually
change that border as well we'll just
keep the same white border
all right so that's all it's a really
nice feature to be able to do that and
you can also darken
all right
so that that that can be really really
helpful let's put it let's actually give
you know what let's just put a line
break in there under the list
okay now I want to add the padding class
to this because I want this to be I want
a little more padding on the top and
bottom we have 30 pixels as the default
for a section if we go to sections or is
it you can see a section has 30 pixels
on the top and bottom so I want to just
go to normalize
all right and
I want a class called extra pad all
right and what that's gonna do is just
add just do forty pixels instead of 30
so padding bottom forty pixels all right
and then if we go into index and just
add that to the section
all right so that looks a little better
okay now for this this section here
we need to make this image smaller what
we want to do is set the width to a
hundred percent so it only takes up its
container alright so see what do we want
to do this alright let's do it here
image dot device with 100% it actually
should already be done
imageclass device
I phone
huh
with a hundred percent
all right
I'm actually going to set this image
less than 100 percent so let's give it a
unique class so we'll still have device
and then we'll have let's just say
device small
all right and then we'll go to base
image dot device small and I'm going to
set the width to 70%
all right and now I want to have a
negative margin at the bottom so that I
can bring this down and make it look
like it's coming out of where this the
section ends all right so
I'm going to do margin-bottom negative
let me see
34 pixels
ah let's to actually know what I want to
add the extra padding on this section as
well so in the index file we have this
it's right here
we're going to add extra hat
all right so I need to actually go down
a little more here so let's try negative
where are we
let's try negative 36
No 38
nope 40
all right good perfect and this actually
looks good over here we don't really
need to do anything to this the text all
right so that looks good our home page
is just about done we just need to do
the footer so let's do that and what I'm
gonna close some of these I know I'm
probably confusing you with all these
open files I apologize I'll just gonna
close them all and then open up what we
need
all right so we want our index
HTML and our s CSS we want to go to
layouts and then footer alright so this
is where I'm gonna put all the footer
code one second all right so our footer
our footer has a class a footer main
alright so what I want to do here is set
the background
to our dark color and let me just open
the variables up variables as CSS and
for our dot color I'm going to change it
to a kind of dark greenish color okay so
for our footer will be dark color and
text color will be white actually we
don't we don't need to do that if we use
our mixin so let's do that
all right so add background you need to
say include add background and next
let's do a border I want to add a border
to the top with the secondary color so
we'll say include add border and we want
this to be what do I want this to be
five pixels color will be secondary
color and then we want this on the top
all right I'm going to set a minimum
height on the footer to 200 pixels
padding 30 pixels on the top and bottom
and let's say I want to set the z-index
which isn't really necessary because we
have the the phone image cut off right
here but just in case it went down
further we want the footer to have a
higher Z index than this image all right
so I'm just going to set the Z index to
100
and that should be good let's check that
out
all right
I want to change the links the color too
I want to change it to white actually we
want to do we can nest right here so a
color is going to be white
all right I'm going to take away the
margin and padding of the list so it's
kind of so it's flush with the header so
you will
there we go
and I'm going to change the line height
of the list items make it a little
bigger so line Heights I will say 1.8
and just to make sure we have
list-style:none
all right so it looks pretty good
our home page is now done so in the next
video
we will move on to the other pages and
after that we want to make sure that the
template is totally responsive right now
it should look pretty good if we shrink
this all right so our menu okay a
responsive menu is good that looks good
showcase this will probably Center these
boxes look good
probably Center this too and you can see
the image is just placed under all this
we'll have to deal with as well
probably Center it and move it up and
footer I don't know maybe add some
spacing between these lists all right
and then we should be done so I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
