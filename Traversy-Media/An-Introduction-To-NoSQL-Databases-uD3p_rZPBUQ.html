looking at no SQL databases so a lot of
you guys have been following me know
that I like to take complex topics and
try to break them down so that anyone
can understand them alright so we're
going to start from scratch so if you
know absolutely nothing about no SQL
then you're in the right place we're not
going to stick with any specific
database MongoDB is probably the most
popular but I mean we'll talk about
Mongo but there's other there's many
other database systems and even other
types of no SQL databases available all
right so one common misconception with
with no SQL is people some people think
that it actually stands for no SQL like
it's not possible when really it stands
for not only SQL because it is quite
possible to use SQL on some of these
these databases it's not you know it's
not extremely common but it is possible
so in my opinion I think a better word
to describe it is a non relational
database alright because you know we
have Oracle we have MySQL Postgres
relational databases they have tables
and columns and so on well no SQL
databases do not ok they don't use
tables or columns or the traditional
aspects of a relational database ok
no Askew all databases are known for
working well with big data which I'll
talk about in a second as well as real
time web applications ok so these these
are some places where you're going to
find no SQL databases there's also
multiple types okay we have document
databases like MongoDB we have column
databases key value stores and so on and
I'm going to get into the specific types
in a little bit all right so big data is
a term that's thrown around pretty often
you've probably heard it what this is it
describes data sets that are they become
so large that traditional methods of
storage and processing are starting to
become inadequate alright there's been a
massive increase in data volume within
the last decade or so
and this is mostly due to you know huge
social networks like Facebook with our
search engines like Google and other
websites and applications that store a
ton of data if you think of you know
every Facebook profile every post in
everyone's feed that's all stored
somewhere and that's just a huge amount
of data and some of the challenges with
this with this data is storing it
capturing and analyzing it and
transferring it all right so this is
where no SQL comes in now please don't
think that anything that I say in this
video is you know please don't think I'm
saying relational databases are dead no
SQL is going to take over the entire
industry anyone that says that has
absolutely no clue what they're talking
about or they're just trying to sell you
something some kind of no SQL service
there's a lot of situations and a lot of
applications where a relational database
is the obvious tool no SQL and
relational database is kind of like a
hammer and an axe they're both going to
be useful they're always going to be
useful they just have you know certain
purposes you're not going to use an axe
to bang in a nail you're not going to
use a hammer to chop down a tree but
they're both necessary all right and
we're also going to talk about the
advantages of relational databases so
we've already discussed big data in how
you know that's a huge benefit of
knowest well that it handles a lot of
data and it does it very quickly another
huge advantage is datum it's data model
which is extremely flexible all right so
if we look at relational databases like
let's say MySQL our postgrads we have to
go in and structure the data in a
predefined schema you guys that have
worked with SQL know that you have to go
in and create the database you have to
model everything that you need the
tables the the fields the constraints
even the datatype of each field alright
so is it a varchar' as a text and
integer and so on and this is all stuff
that you have to do when you're working
with relational databases yes you can
find tools that can make it a little
easier but at its core at its core level
has to be done in the data layer this
brings us to the next advantage which is
the data structure not only do you not
have to define your tables and columns
well there is no tables and columns but
you don't have to define anything like
that you don't even have to know your
data structure now unless it's going to
be a completely dynamic data model you
should at least plan out and have an
idea of how your data is going to look
and then handle that on the application
layer okay there's a lot of different
tools there's object relational mapper
z-- that we can use to actually create a
schema on the application layer all
right so hopefully that makes sense
no oscuro databases are in many cases
much cheaper than to manage then
relational databases there is you know
there's less of a need for multiple
system admins because there's not
there's not as much to do okay there's
not as much to manage so it's going to
be cheaper also scaling scaling is a
huge advantage of no SQL it uses
something called horizontal scaling or
scaling out versus a relational database
which uses vertical scaling or scaling
up and I'm going to go over what this
means in a second but scaling ISM is
extremely important in this industry
because it's always growing successful
websites and applications are always
going to gain more users and more data
Facebook is never going to really lessen
their their data load unless they get
rid of critical parts of their interface
and their functionality so scaling is
definitely key when you're working with
lots of data all right so let's take a
look at an image here that kind of shows
you scaling up ver scaling out all right
now this image on the right here scaling
out is also known as horizontal scaling
and this is what no SQL databases do and
then over here is an example of scaling
up or vertical scaling and I know it's a
scale in but this image is close enough
to explain what I'm talking about
so let's start with scaling up okay
which is relational databases so this
means that in order to scale and you
know build up our system we need
to add components so we need to add
storage you know drives memory CPU power
network ports and other resources that
are very very expensive so it's easy to
see that that there are some hard limits
just by looking at this because
obviously you can only put so much into
this one box you can replace it with a
bigger box in a bigger system but you're
talking about huge amounts of money and
huge amounts of time so the huge
downside to this method is limitation
and cost now scaling out or scaling
horizontally which is what most no SQL
systems do this means that you can use
much cheaper commodity hardware and you
can simply add additional nodes
expanding your disk size your memory
your memory and so on
alright and a group of nodes like this
is called a cluster which you may have
heard before once you reach the
limitations of your cluster of your
nodes you can simply add another one and
for a fraction of the cost of you know
if you were scaling up and you were
adding these expensive components or
even worse if you were to the max and
you needed to still scale up you'd have
to you know you need a whole new
infrastructure which can be a huge pain
in the ass
so no SQL you know scaling is definitely
one of the advantages all right so now
let's talk about relational databases
and what they have over no SQL databases
so you don't have to know much about any
of this - guess that relational
databases are great for relational data
you have a schema where you always know
what columns exist for a certain row you
know that a user can have a blog post
you know exactly how these two tables
are related even though being schema
lists is looked at as a plus in many
cases having assets keymod also allows
you to better understand the structure
and the relation of the data stored all
right it takes more maintenance and so
on but it is safer many cases where data
is closely related this type of database
is actually
the better choice okay relational
databases also use something called
normalization which organizes data in a
way that eliminates redundancy so all
the data is stored in one place
normalization is really important
because it allows a database to take up
as little space as possible which also
results in better performance now
there's all types of normalization
there's one N F 2 n F and it gets really
complicated I'm not going to get into
that though that's a whole other video
on its own relational databases also use
SQL or structured query language which
is an old technology but very solid and
then in my opinion very easy to learn
most SQL or relational databases also
allow you to enforce data integrity
rules using foreign constraints so to
give you an example let's say that we
had an authors table and a blog post
table and we had an author that created
a post well we can create a constraint
so that we wouldn't be able to delete a
user that had written a post because if
we did that we would have a post with no
author ok or no user we don't really
have these constraints available at the
data level in no SQL so the last
advantage here is that a lot of
relational databases are acid compliant
so this is a it's an acronym it stands
for our atomicity consistency isolation
and durability and this is a kind of a
complex topic so I'm not going to go
into depth but the gist of it is that
it's an all-or-nothing rule so when we
make database transactions for example a
bank account transfer let's say from one
account to the other we have a series of
actions for that so we have to do
multiple queries we have to take money
out of one account and then we have to
put it into another we have to do some
math and tallying and so on well most
relational databases can use acid
compliance to say we're either going to
do all of all of the actions or none of
them because could you imagine
transferring money to
you know from one account to another and
only the money gets taken out from the
first account and then something goes
wrong and crashes and it never goes into
the other account so that would cause
mass havoc so this is something that's
very important now this isn't to say
that we can't do that with no SQL
because we can it's just not built into
the course system at the level that
relational it is with relational
databases all right so hopefully that
makes sense now now that we looked at
the advantages and disadvantages of both
relational and no SQL let's talk about
the different types of no SQL databases
all right now there's actually more than
this but these are by far the most
common so first we have document
databases and the most popular document
database or no SQL database in general
is MongoDB I have a crash course on
MongoDB which I would strongly recommend
watching after this video if you haven't
already documented databases store data
similar to Jason or JavaScript object
notation where we have curly braces
inside that we have key value pairs they
can hold strings numbers arrays embedded
objects and so on now on the database
level they are completely schema lists
so your application can be very dynamic
if you wanted to have let's say users be
able to add custom fields to their
profile a document database is
definitely the way to go one profile may
have an address one may not some may
have BIOS or contact info some not so
with relational databases we would have
to we'd have to strictly define
everything from the table to the fields
and so on so this would not be ideal for
something like that with dynamic data so
we also have column databases which is
optimized for reading and writing data
in columns instead of rows an example of
this would be Apache Cassandra this is a
great this is great for things like
analytics and it reduces the overall
disk i/o requirements and the amount of
data that needs to be loaded for
disk okay so it can be quite optimized
then we have key value stores which is
the simplest type of no SQL database you
have a key in a value this is optimal
for huge data sets with very simple data
it's extremely fast but not very
intricate and customizable and it's
similar to an associative array or a
hash all right now we also have cache
systems like Redis which is also a key
value store but can also be used as a
cache system for temporary values Redis
can be used as a database and actually
write data to the disk or can just store
data in cache
all right I have a crash course on Redis
on my channel if you want to learn more
about that so next we have graph
databases which aren't that common but I
think they're very interesting I
actually did a course on neo4j which is
the most popular type of or the most
popular graph database everything
integral databases looked at as a node
and they can have relationships with
other nodes through what's called an
edge all right so if you have some extra
time I would definitely suggest checking
it out looking at neo4j because it's
really interesting and yeah these are
these are used for huge data sets like
social networks where everything is
related all right so before we go I just
want to give you a visualization of a
relational relational database on the
left with columns and rows and then on
the right we have a document database
which has a very similar structure to
Jason all right now the relational
database these all have to be set you
have to know what tables you have what
columns and so on with a document
database you have data stored in kind of
like JSON objects and these don't have
to be defined okay you can just define
these as you go in your application and
that's what makes it very flexible all
right and very dynamic so that's going
to be it guys hopefully you were able to
soak up some of the information and I
explained it
explained it well enough and if you like
