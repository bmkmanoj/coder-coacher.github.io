hey guys I have a request from one of my
patrons to do a video on note
authentication with JSON web tokens or
JWT and these tokens are used to protect
routes in an API that way you can add
authentication to fetch a token and then
you can make requests with that token to
access protected routes so if you have a
full stack application where you have
like no no to API on the backend and
then react on the front-end you can make
your request to login you know do all
the login stuff and then get the token
back save that in local storage or
cookies or wherever you want to save it
locally and then you can use that token
to make requests to protected routes
like let's say to create a blog post or
something like that alright now we're
not going to build a complete API here
we're not going to implement passport or
authentication or anything like that
we're just gonna have like a mock user
my goal is to just show you how to
protect routes and then how to get the
token and use that token to access the
route
alright so it's kind of an off-the-cuff
video we're using postman to make our
requests this is a now a standalone best
standalone program it was a Chrome
extension
I believe it's deprecated as a Chrome
extension now so that's what we'll be
using to make our requests we're using
vs code for a text editor and i'm using
my vs code terminal here so I have an
empty folder called node off API so if
you want to follow along just create a
folder and then we're gonna do an NPM
and knit to create a package dot Jason
I'll just go through this description
I'll just say
JWT example and I'm gonna use a pas for
the entry point and then just enter
through the rest all right so now it
will do is install our dependencies so
npm install we're just gonna have
Express and jason web token all one word
okay i'm also going to install node lawn
because that will just continuously
watch our applications so we don't have
to restart it - you know if we make
changes or whatever and we're going to
install that globally so we're going to
do npm install - G and then node Mon
alright and then once we do that let's
clear that up we're going to create our
app dot JS file and let's open that file
up I'm just being fancy with the
terminal of course you can create it up
here so in our app j/s let's go ahead
and bring in Express okay and let's see
we also want to bring in Jason web token
so that's going to come in as well name
a JWT
and that's going to come in as jason web
token then we want to initialize our app
variable with express okay and I'm just
going to create a just like a welcome
route for the index actually we'll do
slash API and we'll put a arrow function
here and of course we need our request
response all right and then in here all
I'm gonna do is do a res dot jason and
we're gonna send along a message and
we're just gonna say welcome to the api
okay so there's a simple route and we're
going to now listen I'm gonna have our
server listen on port 5,000 oops and
then we'll just do our console log
server started on 5,000 all right so
let's save that and let's run node Mon
down here in the terminal so our server
started now we should be able to make a
request to this slash API and we should
get that message back so let's say HTTP
do I have it here
HTTP localhost 5,000 slash API make sure
it's a get request and send and we get
welcome to the API so so far so good now
I want to create a route that I want to
protect so let's do an app dot post to
slash API slash posts and say request
Raz and obviously we're not really gonna
create a post or anything we're not
using a database I'm just gonna do a res
dot JSON and we'll just do the end
result which will be a message that says
post created okay so we should be able
to to make that we haven't protected
anything yet so we should be able to
make a post request to API slash posts
and we get post created alright so now
we're going to start to implement our
JSON web token we need a way to get the
token and we're gonna create a route for
that so that's gonna be a login route so
let's say post slash API slash login
alright let's put our request/response
and inside here what we want to do is we
want to call JWT dot sign now I'm
actually going to open up the
documentation here and you can do this
either synchronously or asynchronously
if you're doing it synchronously you can
set a variable to JWT sign pass in your
payload and then a secret key which can
be whatever and then you can go ahead
and use that or you can do what we're
going to do and we're going to use we're
just going to use a callback function
we're going to do it asynchronously so
let's do JWT sign I forgot to create a
user so we're just going to create a
mock user now usually you would make a
request to this login and you'd be
sending your username and password you'd
go through all your your authentication
stuff here with your database and then
you get your user back so we're gonna
skip right to getting the user back so
I'll say Aidid one user name Brad and
let's do email Brad at Gmail alright so
we have our user and then what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to send this along as
the payload so this will be say user
user so payload next parameter will be
the secret key and you can see over here
JWT sign they sent the payload here and
then there's the secret key so that can
be whatever alright and then since we're
using the asynchronous version we're
gonna go ahead and put a callback or an
arrow function in this case and this
will take in an error if there is one
and then it'll take the token it'll give
us the token all right so then what we
want to do is just send the response so
res dot Jason
and we're going to send along token and
we're gonna send the token all right we
can even do this via six style and get
rid of that same thing here since these
are both the same we can just do like
that all right and yeah let's save so
now we'll try and log in so we'll go to
a post request to API slash login and
send and there it is so we get our token
back okay so this token contains all the
information we need to make a request to
a protected route which we don't have
yet all right so let's go ahead and go
to our route we want to protect which is
this right here this posts and we're
just going to add in right here a
middleware function called verify token
like that okay and then we need to
create that function so we'll go down
here and let's just say verify token and
function verify token all right so this
is going to take in this is actually a
middleware function it's going to take
in a request response and next so
basically it's gonna run we want to do
what we want and then call Next to
proceed okay so first thing we want to
do is we want to get the auth header
value so when we send our token we want
to send it in the header okay and we
want to send it as the authorization
value so I'm going to create a variable
here we're gonna call it bearer bearer
header and we're gonna set it to request
dot headers and then we want the
authorization part of it so
authorization
like that and that should give us the
bear header I'm sorry that the the
actual token now the way that this token
is going to be formatted let's say
format of token so it's a it's what's
called a bearer token so it's gonna look
like this authorization it's gonna have
the word bearer like that and then it's
gonna be the token so we'll say access
token all right so it's gonna look like
that and then we need to pull the token
out of it so we need to do a couple
things down here so first thing we're
going to do is check to see if it's not
undefined so say check if bear I can
never spell this while I'm talking B
error is undefined so we'll say if and
we're gonna use type of so if typeof
bearer header is not equal to undefined
then we want to continue else then it's
gonna be forbidden all right and we can
actually just send a 403 status so if we
say res dot send status I mean you can
do a dot jason if you want R as decent
and put your own message here but I'm
just gonna send the 403 all right now
let's just try that out so we'll save
that and we're gonna go and try to make
a request to API post which has the
verify token middleware and if we don't
send the token we should get the 403
status so I'm gonna open a new tab and
go to http let's go to localhost 5,000
API posts make sure it's a post request
and send and it gives us back forbidden
okay so that's exactly what we want we
can't access it without that
- without a token so let's go back into
the verify token function and we need to
basically take the token out of the
bearer space token so what we'll do is
we're gonna split out the space because
it's gonna be bearer the word bearer
space and then the token so I'm going to
say Const there are equals and then we
want the bearer header and we're going
to do dot split what dot split does is
it turns a string into an array and you
can put here what you want to split it
by and it's going to be a space so it's
going to look at this bearer space token
and it's going to separate the two by a
space and turn it into an array so in
that case this will be that the second
part of the other second value in the
array which has a 1 index because arrays
are zero base so this would be 0 this
would be 1 so let's go on the next line
and let's say get token from array so
we'll say Const bearer token and set
that to there with the index of 1 all
right then we want to actually set the
token by simply saying request dot token
and setting that to the bearer token
okay and then we simply want to call the
next middleware by saying next and
that's it that's our verify token
function so let's go ahead and save that
we just double check this that should be
good so now what we need to do is when
we enter this protected route here API
post we need to verify the token okay
and let me actually just pull up the
documentation for that so let's see so
we already did the sign let's see right
here JWT verify token right here verify
token and then we also want to pass in
that secret key as a parameter but we're
gonna do it the asynchronous way like
this and we should be able to get the
data the payload that we passed in so
when we logged in right here we passed
in the user we should be able to get
that data as well so let's go to our
post route here and let's go right here
and we'll say JWT dot verify and inside
here we're gonna pass in the token now
that token is now in that request object
so we can say request token and then we
want our secret key and then we want a
callback or an arrow function in this
case and this is going to take in two
things it's going to take an error and
then the data I'm going to call this off
data because it's basically going to be
our authentication data our user the ID
username and email and then inside this
verify will first check for an error so
we'll say if there is an error then
let's go ahead and send that 403 status
so res dot send status and we're gonna
send whoops I'm gonna send 403 and let's
do else
then we're gonna take this res dot Jason
right here and we're going to just move
this up into the else and we'll send the
message post created let's also send the
auth data okay
so we'll get the message post created
we'll get the auth data we should also
get the timestamp that this was created
I believe yeah let's just try that so
we'll save we'll go back to post man now
if we try to make a request here again
we get forbidden that's expected we need
to include our token so the token we got
when we logged in now if you had a
front-end app a front-end client with
like let's say react or something or or
whatever vanilla JavaScript you would
save this token in local storage you
could also use cookies but that's not
really recommended anymore you want to
use local storage and then when you want
to make a request to a protected route
you want to send in a header value for
authorization so we'll show you this
will say authorization and we're gonna
say in here there are space and then the
token okay so let's try this we'll go
ahead and click send and there we go
post created we get our message we get
our auth data which includes the payload
that we sent here okay so when we did
JWT sign we sent the user that's what
we're getting here and then we get this
I 80 which is issue issue that I think
does this stand for pretty sure it's
issued at
yeah issue that so you can include a
timestamp but if you don't it'll do
it'll give you this issue that time
stamp so now you can continue to make
this request as long as you have that
header that token ok present in your
header this here if I go ahead and I
uncheck this and I don't send this
header value along with it we get
forbidden ok if I were to change this in
any way like let's just put a 1 here and
send we get forbidden ok so it has to be
this exact token now another thing we
can do is we can set an expiration if we
want this token to not last forever we
can do that so let's go to see I can
make this smaller here we want to go to
the login where we do the sign and we
just want to put in some options right
here so we'll put in an object like that
and then in here we're gonna say expires
in and then we can say we can do like
30s for 30 seconds we can do minutes and
this is all in the documentation so
these are all the options you can use
and expires in is one of those so you
can do like two days you can do 10 hours
you can use all those different formats
so let's do 30 seconds all right now
we're gonna have to make another request
to login to get a new token so what
we'll do is let's get rid of that and
then we'll go back to our login and
let's send so now we get a new token
notice it's a little bigger because it
now includes that expiration so we'll
copy you will go back to posts put in
our authorization and we'll say there
are space and then
paste in our token and send it works
okay I'm gonna keep trying and it should
expire within 30 seconds so it should
not work pretty soon and you can see
it's actually one of the values exp so
this is issued at an expiration send
again and now it's forbidden okay
because it expired so you can do that as
well
alright so I know this isn't like the
most put together thing but hopefully
this gives you an idea of how to protect
your routes how to get a token and then
how to use that token to access
protected routes and obviously we're
using postman as our client but you
could just as well have a react
application or an angular application
and use the HTTP client there and just
send along your authorization in the
header with the token alright first
login and so on but of course you're
gonna want to have a form submitted to
login and do your magic here to add to
authenticate the user get that user and
then include that user here not just
create one like this this is just a mock
up alright so hopefully you guys enjoyed
this and hopefully it was kind of it was
somewhat clear and that's it thanks for
