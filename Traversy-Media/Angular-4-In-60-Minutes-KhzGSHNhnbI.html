minutes now I'm going to be cramming as
much as I can about angular into the
next hour and many of you may have seen
my angular 2 and 60 minutes video this
is going to be pretty similar to that
only updated for angular 4 ok we're
going to start off with some slides talk
about what angular is some of the
fundamentals and then we'll jump in will
create our development environment and
then we're going to get started with
some coding so sit back relax and let's
get started alright guys so if you've
never used angular 4 before or even
angular 2 that's absolutely fine we're
going to be starting from absolute
scratch you should you should know some
HTML CSS isn't that important for what
we're doing here but if you're building
web applications you should at least
know you know the fundamentals of CSS
you do need to know some basic
JavaScript and programming concepts like
variables arrays if statements and so on
if you don't know any of that you will
still be able to kind of follow along
but you may not understand every single
thing we're doing alright so before I
get started I just want to mention that
everything here is based off of a new
udemy course they just released called
angular for front-to-back which goes
into much much more detail it's about
eight and a half hours of training
you'll learn all the fundamentals and
we'll build two projects one basic one
advanced and the course is is 50 bucks
but I left a link in the description for
half-off so you'll get it for 25 okay so
I just wanted to mention that before we
get started so let's talk about a little
bit about what angular is angular is a
front end or client-side JavaScript
framework and what that means is that it
runs on the user's browser as opposed to
running on a web server now there are
things like angular universal that can
allow angular to run on the server but
first and foremost the client-side
framework okay it was created and it's
still maintained by Google it's used to
build incredibly powerful single page
applications or spas it's part of the
very popular mean stack which is MongoDB
which is a no SQL database Express
which is a back-end web framework
angular and nodejs which is a JavaScript
runtime okay the all these technologies
combined together are make one of the
most powerful web stacks to build
applications on so angular has often
been described as what HTML would have
been if it were created for dynamic web
applications instead of just static
websites all right so what is angular
not it's not a server-side framework or
technology it's not something like
express or happy j/s or anything like
that like I said it can be used on the
server but first and foremost it's
client-side it's not a JavaScript
library it's not something like jQuery
or lodash which is like a kind of like
utility libraries even react is often
comparable to angular and I actually
think of react more as a framework but
it's it's technically a library so it's
also not something like a design pattern
like MVC or Model View controller it's
not a platform like dotnet or a language
like Java or C sharp and it's not any
kind of plugin or browser extension or
anything like that so the angular
version history is a little confusing
there's been some issues around it to
say the least so I just want to kind of
clear that up real quick angular 1 or
angularjs was released back in like I
think it was like 2009 or something like
that don't quote me on that but it was a
while ago and it was created as a
competitor to frameworks like ember j/s
and then a few a few years later angular
2 was released and it was a complete
rewrite of angularjs basically a
completely different framework angularjs
was based on controllers in scope and in
version 2 in angular 2 they completely
got rid of those things and added
components and I think they did that to
compete with react and some of the other
new frameworks alright nothing was
backward compatible and this caused
havoc among developers that had you know
built angularjs apps for their clients
and now angular 2 is just something
totally different and you know they kind
of got a lot of back a lot of backlash
for that so then angular 2 became really
popular and
had been you know it's been used for a
while until recently when angular 4 was
released
now angular 3 was skipped and one of the
main reasons for that is because of the
router ok angular is made up of a bunch
of different packages and the router
package was out of sync with the rest of
the angular packages and if they were to
keep that it would have caused a lot of
issues internally that would you know
caused a lot of problems and confusion
so they just decided to bring everything
to angular 4 ok so now all of the
angular packages are on the same level
now angular floor is completely backward
compatible with angular 2 in fact very
little on the surface has changed most
of the changes are under the hood they
cleaned it up a bit they made it more
compact they added a couple things but
basically if you know angular 2 at this
point then you do know angular 4 all
right so why use angular over just you
know just plain JavaScript so angular
gives you rapid development you can do
things like routing event handling
validation and many other things in a
fraction of the time and the amount of
code that it would take using just you
know straight JavaScript or something
like jQuery the angular CLI also has
some really nice code generation
commands that can help you build build
out your application faster angular also
organizes your code and your user
interface into encapsulated components
which is not only helpful for just you
but anyone who want anyone else who
works on your code angular lets us have
dynamic content right in the HTML
templates so we can have things like
variables if statements loops we can use
that stuff right in the HTML using
something called directives so angular
is also completely cross-platform
doesn't matter if your app is being
viewed or built on Windows or Mac Linux
or being viewed on Chrome or Firefox
edge any browser it angular takes care
of all that stuff for you all right it
also comes with testing capabilities now
we're not going to get into that into
testing but it just know that angular
especially the angular CLI does come
with some really nice testing tools so
here are some of the core features that
angular offers as well as some
as well as some of the terms that you'll
hear in angular development I'm not
going to go over them all now but things
like component services which I'll talk
about in a second templates and data
binding there's an HTTP module to make
requests to the cert 2 servers
directives which are kind of like
dynamic HTML tags and attributes you're
going to hear these terms quite a bit
now angular 2 uses something called
typescript which is a Microsoft
technology and typescript is basically a
superset of JavaScript meaning that it
includes everything javascript has and
then it also adds some additional
features okay so it offers static typing
hence the name typescript and what that
means is that we can add types to our
variables and functions we can define if
it should be a string or a number or a
boolean or whatever else and I'm going
to go over the different types in a bit
typescript also lets us create
class-based objects something that
standard es 5 doesn't offer we can
create classes like we would in
languages like Java c-sharp PHP and so
on angular components are essentially
classes themselves so here's an example
of typescript versus regular es5
javascript we have typescript on the
left now you'll see that with typescript
we can create a class classes can have
properties and methods which are
basically functions so this greeter
class has a property called greeting
which is you know has the type of a
string we can use types in typescript
and we can add functions or methods
basically when I say method it just
means a function within a class and we
have something called a constructor and
if you're familiar at all with
object-oriented programming then you
know what a constructor is it's
basically a function or method that runs
when you instantiate an object using the
class okay it runs automatically and
that can take in properties such as the
message here and then we can access our
properties using something called this
okay so we have a greeting property and
if we want to access that we can save
this dot greeting and we can use this
from any method at all within the class
then we can create our own methods and
functions so for instance we have a
Greek
in here and that's just going to return
the word hello and then whatever the
greeting is now if we want to create an
object from this class we can just
create a variable for instance greeter
and set it to new and then the class
name which in this case is greeter and
then we're passing in a text here of
world and that's going to be passed into
the constructor
all right then it goes on down here to
create a button and just alert some tech
from that class and then over here for
the es5 you see we can't use the class
we can't we can't use typing we have to
use prototypes for objects and it can
just get you know kind of a pain in the
ass so you've heard me mention
components a few times and components
are sections of the user interface okay
so we could have a navbar component a
blog post component anything that's in
the UI and there the basic building
block of an angular application so let's
take a look at a very simple component
this is actually the core app component
every angular application has an app
component and then we'll nest all the
components that we create inside of that
alright so first thing we do is import
the component package from the angular
core library and then we create
something called a decorator okay this
is part of typescript we have the at
symbol component and this allows us to
attach metadata to our component okay
one of the things is going to be the
selector and that's going to be the the
custom HTML tag that we use to insert
our components and then we also have the
template okay the template can be HTML
along with dynamic properties like
variables and we can do if statements
using directives things like that you
can also use a separate HTML file for
your template and then we have the
component class okay in this case it's
called app component and then we're
defining a property of name and we're
assigning it to angular and then we're
putting that dynamic value up here using
something called string interpolation
which I'll get into in a little bit and
then when we want to insert this
component we use whatever is the
selector in this case my app and you can
see down here in the HTML where if we
have the my app tag
now in addition to components we have
something called services and angular
and there's going to be times when you
want to share data and functionality
across multiple components you don't
want to have to repeat yourself by
making for instance the same Ajax call
in five different components so services
allow us to do it once and then we can
inject the service into the component
and we can use it you know in each one
so here's an example of a very simple
service all services have this
injectable package we're going to import
this allows us to inject it as a
dependency into a component and don't
worry you're going to see all the stuff
in action later on we're also bringing
in the user model here so this would be
like a class or an interface defining
what a user actually is what fields it
has and then we're bringing in a user's
bringing in the data from a mock user's
file which would most likely just be a
JSON file now in a production app you're
probably going to be working with some
kind of API and you're going to bring it
in from somewhere else but in this case
it's just a simple file then we have our
injectable decorator and then the class
itself
okay now service classes can have
properties and methods just like
components can have in this case we have
one method called get users and all
that's doing is returning the users that
are coming in from the mock file so we
can simply inject this service into any
components we want as many as we want
and we can grab the users all right so
as far as installing angular 4 there's
there's a couple ways the two main ways
or by using the angular CLI which is the
command-line interface this is the
recommended way this is what we'll be
using we can install it using NPM and
then there's also the QuickStart seed
which is kind of like a boilerplate or
like a starting application that you can
grab from github and go from there but
the angular CLI offers a bunch of
different commands to help your
development and then the only
dependencies we're going to need is no
js' which is a JavaScript runtime really
really easy to install and that also
comes with NPM which is node package
manager and that's used to install
angular and it's dependencies all right
so enough with the slides let's go ahead
and jump in set up our dev environment
and start working with angular 4 alright
guys so as far as our development
environment I'm going to show you
exactly what I did but I'm not going to
go through all the installations because
I have to keep this quick
I do go through this in depth in the
course if you want to check that out in
the description but we're going to need
nodejs ok which i already have installed
nodejs is a JavaScript runtime and it
runs JavaScript on the server does some
amazing things but the only thing we
really need it for is NPM it comes with
NPM or node package manager and that's
what we use to install angular CLI and
all the dependencies and all that so
just go ahead and get that set up
just a simple Installer it's
cross-platform now for my text editor
I'm using Visual Studio code
I love Visual Studio code for angular
development mostly because of the
integrated terminal because we use the
terminal quite a bit when you know using
the CLI also it has a really nice
angular 4 typescript extension so if you
want that just go ahead and download it
and install it I'm also using git bash
for Windows which gives us a much better
command line than the standard Windows
command line or powershell it also gives
you the git version control system so I
have that installed and then I'm going
to also integrate it with Visual Studio
code ok so visual studio code uses an
integrated terminal by default uses
PowerShell but you can easily add a
setting shows you right here to use git
bash instead of PowerShell from within
the editor alright so let's go ahead and
open up visual studio code I'm going to
open up a new window and I'll just show
you real quick if I go to preferences
and then settings basically the settings
is a giant JSON file and you can search
through it and stuff and then anything
custom you want you can add over here
you'll see I have terminal dot
integrated shell dot Windows and I set
that to the location of the git bash
program ok and this is what it shows you
on that documentation page I showed you
and then I also set the font size for
the editor and the terminal I made it a
little bigger and set the activity bar
to true ok so those are the settings I'm
using
so let's close that up now what I'm
going to do is open up get bash okay so
I'll just bring that down and of course
you can use you know if you're on Mac or
Linux user terminal you can use the
windows CMD or PowerShell
I just prefer get bash so we're going to
install the CLI angular CLI so to do
that we do NPM install - G and what - G
does is it makes it global so that
you're installing this globally so that
you can access it from anywhere and then
we just want to do at angular slash CLI
okay and that will install it globally
on your system alright so once that's
done what we can do is we can generate
an application now I'm going to CD into
a folder I have called projects and from
here let me just clear that out from
here I'm going to say ng new and then
the name of the application which I'm
going to call a for app okay and it's as
simple as that to create an angular for
application and that could take maybe 30
30 seconds or so maybe a little longer
on while that's going on I just want to
show you you probably want to install an
angular plugin for your editor whether
it's Visual Studio code or atom or
anything else just you have the correct
syntax highlighting
so for Visual Studio code we can go to
view command palette and then just
search for install and then go to
extensions install extensions and I see
I have it right here angular version for
typescript snippets you can just search
for it right here and just install it
okay alright and I just close that up
yeah all right so let's go back over
here ok so that's all set now we just
want to CD into what do they call it a
for app and then we should be able to
run our application on a development
server and we just have to do ng serve
for that and by default that you'd open
on port 4200
guys you can see webpack compiled
successfully angular CLI uses webpack
behind the scenes so now I'm going to
open up a browser and let's go to
localhost port
4200 and there's our default angular
application alright so let's go ahead
and actually I'm just going to put these
side-by-side but we can make this one
much smaller alright now to open up the
terminal over here in Visual Studio code
you can go to view integrated terminal
and you'll see that'll open it or you
can do control and then a tilde which is
to the left of the number one key and
that will open it up and it's using git
bash because I use that setting alright
so before we get into that though let's
go ahead and click open folder and we're
going to grab the new application we
just created and I'm just going to kind
of briefly go over the file structure of
an angular application just the
important parts really so if we look at
package Jason if you've ever worked with
node before then you know this is kind
of like a manifest app it has the name
of the app the version and then it has
all of its dependencies okay it also has
NPM scripts so one of these commands and
the scripts is ng serve which is used to
do just what we just did start up the
application it compiles all the
typescript and all of that
ng build will actually build out the
application into static assets that we
can just upload to a server somewhere
which is really cool and then we have
some linting and testing stuff which
we're not going to get into now as far
as dependencies this showed you chose
you what angular is made up of it's made
up of a bunch of different packages the
core is where a lot of the stuff comes
from but we also have the compiler
common animations the forms an HTTP
module platform browser which takes care
of bootstrapping it in the browser and
then the router and this was one of the
reasons that there's no angular 3 is
because this router mismatched the rest
of these and that caused some issues
they wanted to make it all angular 4 ok
it also includes reactive extension
which has observables and things like
that and then for dev dependencies we
have the angular CLI itself and it's
compiler we have a bunch of testing
stuff with jasmine and karma we have
typescript you know because angular uses
typescript and it uses TS files which
just get compiled into regular
JavaScript when we run our server or
when we you know build out our app so
that's the package.json file now you
also have an angular CLI jason file
which is specific to angular CLI if you
use the QuickStart for example you won't
have this file but this has to do with
like output directories or when you
build out your app things like that if
you want to load style sheets if you
want to load scripts you can do it from
here as well alright so the only other
important folder here is the source
folder e to e is for end to end to end
testing node modules is just your
dependencies but inside source
we have an app folder and that's
basically our application so the first
one we're first file we're going to look
at here is App Dajjal dot T s and you
can kind of think of this as like a
meeting place for everything in your app
your components your services your
modules everything needs to be imported
into this file and then added to the ng
module directive ok and each thing goes
in a different array so components will
go in declarations modules like the
forms module HTTP module those will go
into imports so services will go into
providers and then for bootstrap we're
just adding the main app component
because that's kind of like the root
component all right that's what gets
bootstrapped
so just remember that when you create
anything you need to bring it into this
file so let's close that up and then the
rest of the files in here all have to do
with them the root app component the TS
file is the typescript file this is the
main you know where the class is the
decorator all that spec TS has to do
with testing we're not going to pay any
attention to that the HTML file is the
actual template that's what you're
seeing over here and then it has also
the CSS file alright and if we look at
the TS file you'll see that
we have a selector of app root we have a
template URL which points to that HTML
file and then a styles URL points to
that style sheet and then we have our
class with a property called title
that's equal to app okay so we're
setting a dynamic variable here and if
we look in our HTML we're outputting it
right here so over here you'll see
welcome to app which is coming from this
right here welcome to title so if I were
to change this property change it to
hello and save you'll see that over here
that will update to hello okay we don't
even have to reload so what I want to do
now is just kind of clear out the app
component HTML just going to get rid of
everything here and save and then we'll
get rid of the title property because
we're not using that and then I want to
generate our own component so I want to
create a component called user now you
could just create the file manually but
angular CLI gives us some commands to
generate components easily so what I'll
do is in the app folder I'm going to
create a folder called components and
then I'm going to open up the terminal
from within vs code I'm going to do ng
g4 generate component and then I want to
say it's going to be in the components
folder and I want to call it user ok now
if we look in components is now a folder
called user with all the different files
the TS the HTML the CSS and then another
important thing to note is that if we go
to app dot module it actually adds it
for us ok and imports it and then adds
it to declarations if you manually
created these files you'd have to just
do this yourself import it put it in
declarations ok so just something to
note alright now if we look at user dot
component TS this is what it gives us
pretty much the same thing as an app
component it also adds to adds this ng
on an it so this is actually a life
cycle hook and this will run when the
component is initialized so a lot of the
stuff that you can do in the constructor
which also runs you can do in here it's
actually recommended in most cases
alright but I'll get to that if we look
at the HTML it just says user works in a
paragraph now we don't see that over
here because
we haven't inserted the user component
into the main app component so if we
want to do that let's look at the
selector for the user component which is
app user so all we have to do is go into
our main app component HTML and we can
say app - user app user save and now we
see user works okay and if I go when I
edit the user component HTML let's just
put up put an h1 and I'll just say hello
world save and there we go so let's go
back to our user component - yes so I'm
just going to close out the regular the
app component and let's add a property
ok so right here let's say name and
let's set that to John Doe okay now we
can take with save it and we can take
this property into our template and we
can output it somewhere so let's go
right here put in our double curly brace
oops and say name save we get hello John
Doe alright now this double curly brace
this is called string interpolation so
we can take properties and output
strings using these using these curly
braces now the constructor and ng on a
net like I said these will both run
automatically so if I do a console log
and we'll say constructor ran and then
down here we'll say console dot log ng
up type ng on an it brand
save and then we'll go over here and
open up the console with f12 and you'll
see both constructor ran and ng on and
it ran so usually what you would see is
these these properties will have a type
associated with them so John Doe is a
string so we would want to type this to
a string okay and you don't actually
have to set the value up here we could
just get rid of this
and just to clear the property and then
down in one of these we can edit it so
let's go an ng on a net and we'll save
this dot name equals John Doe save that
and we still get John Doe now if I did
set it up here like let's say we set it
to Steve Smith and save it's still going
to say John Doe because this gets
initialized but then this over writes it
alright if I were to comment this one
out then it will say Steve Smith okay so
just so we're clear this gets ran and
then these two will run and you can
overwrite your properties all right so
let's set some other properties here
let's say we want an age and we'll set
that to a number oops yeah number and
then down here let's say this got age
I'm just going to close this for now so
this dot age equals 30 now since we set
this to a number if I were to set this
to a string down here we're going to get
an error even in the editor and it says
type hello is not assignable to number
if I save this and it runs it's not
going to compile correctly because it's
not the right type all right so let's
put that back to 30 and it should be
okay so let's set some other properties
we'll set an email which will be a
string now I'm going to set an address
and I want this to be an object okay
which holds a bunch of different
variables so if we want this to be an
object we need to set the type to an
object and then we need to set the ID at
the individual values so let's say we
want to street that we'll say is a
string will say city string and state
okay and then if we go down here and we
set that will say this starts address
and let's say Street set 250 Main Street
will set the city to Boston and state to
mass all right so that's fine we have no
errors but if I were to change state to
zip we're going to get an error because
it's looking at this as a model okay so
you have to have this Street city state
same thing if I go when I change a type
let's say state 1 we're going to get an
error because state is supposed to be a
string not a number now if this was a
huge object with a bunch of embedded
objects and you don't want to stick it
up here like this there's a better way
to do this and that's to create either a
class or an interface that kind of maps
out the model of this of the address so
let's go down here outside of everything
else can say interface address and then
we'll just grab these fields here and
put them right in ok and then we'll go
up here instead of setting all that
we're just going to set it to address
oops forgot the D and that works ok that
look makes it look much neater and you
can put this inside of another file
maybe inside a models folder and then
import it like that and then you can
also import it into other files if you
wanted to use the address interface and
other files as well ok another thing you
can do is we can set arrays so up here
let's say hobbies hobbies and we'll set
that whoops not equal we're going to set
the type to string and then some
brackets and what this is saying is that
this is going to be an array of strings
so let's go down to our ng on an it will
say this dot hobbies and set that to an
array and we'll say write code
watch movies listen to music okay and
that works now if I were to put a one in
here that's not going to work because
it's supposed to be an array of strings
we could also do number here or we could
do any which then we could put numbers
or boolean's whatever we want into the
array okay but I'm going to leave it at
string you can also use any for a single
value like that okay so down here we
could say this dot hello
equals one we could say equals hello it
could be true or false it could be
anything because that's what we said it
could be any all right so now let's
start to bring some of these properties
into our template so I'm going to go to
user component HTML initially I was
going to pretty this up with bootstrap
but that took way too long and we need
to keep this within an hour like I said
the course you know will bring in
bootstrap for and make it look nice but
this is just to get you familiar with
angular not not you know bootstrap
markup or anything so we already have
the name let's actually get rid of the
hello and just have the name here and
then we'll do let's do a ul and let's
put in the age so here we can say age
whoops and let's do email
see if that works okay so we're bringing
in the age and email we also had an
address so for that let's say address
remember addresses and objects so we can
say address Street and let's do address
dot city and address dot state and there
we go let me make this a little bigger
actually
so now let's list out the hobbies
remember hobbies is actually an array
now we could just do if I were to just
say hobbies like that and save it'll
actually give us a comma-separated list
of the hobbies but you may not want that
you may want to for example put these
into an end to a list so for that we
would use a directive called ng4 which
allows us to loop through things loop
through arrays so let's put a ul or
should I put an h1 right above it let's
say h1 and we'll say hobbies all right
and then I'm going to put an li but I'm
going to use an ng for now with this
directive we put an asterisk and then ng
for equals and then we do let okay so
what is a way of defining a variable
we'll say let hobby of hobbies okay so
hobbies right here is pertaining to this
the array hobbies and then inside this
Li let's just put in our string
interpolation brackets here and we'll
say hobby okay because that's what we
called it right here we're saying each
one of these hobbies let it be known as
this hobby so save and now we're
outputting a list of the hobbies now if
you wanted to pass in an index so you
could access the index you could go
right after right here and put a
semicolon and say let's and then
whatever I'll just say I equals index
and then here we'll just put I like that
and then we put a colon and then we get
zero starts at zero one two and you can
actually put arithmetic in here say you
wanted this to start at one you could do
I plus one and it will start at one okay
one two three
alright so that takes care of string
interpolation data-binding
ng for loops now let's look at events
okay so let's say we have a button I'm
just going to put this just put this
right here and we'll click button and to
do events in angular what we can do is
put in a set of parentheses and then the
type of event which I want to be a click
event and then we'll set it to a
function like let's say on click OK like
that and here we'll just say click me so
we have this button if I click it we get
an error down here because there is no
on click event so we can go to our on
click function so you can go back to our
TS file and we can actually create this
let's go under ng on a neck and then we
can do let's say console.log hello save
now if I click that down here you'll see
we get hello now you can manipulate your
properties through your event so let's
say we wanted to change the name when we
click the button for some reason we'll
say this dot name I'll say this dot name
keep that single quotes and we'll just
put my name so now if I click this it
changes to Brad traverse see when I
click it so our events week and we
cannot manipulate properties if we
wanted to let's say hard-code another
hobby onto that array we could say X
let's just go under this this dot
hobbies
and then there's a JavaScript function
called push which just pushes on to an
array and let's say new hobby okay so
now if I click that changes to Brad and
it also gets we get new hobby down here
and that will keep happening if I keep
clicking it alright so now let's tell
let's work with forms I want to create a
little form we can add a hobby to our
array so I basically want to be able to
push on to the hobbies but have it be
whatever we type in the form so let's go
right below this h1 and we'll just put a
form tag doesn't need an action we're
not actually submitting to a page and
let's put we'll just put a div doesn't
need a class so we'll put a div let's
put a label and say hobby and then we'll
put an input type of text okay we'll
save that now we have this little form
here and we want to add a submit event
okay so on the form tag we're going to
put parentheses that's how we define an
event we're going to say submit and
we'll set that to add hobby all right
now to be able to take this value from
this input we're going to give it an ID
okay not an ID attribute but we're going
to say number sign hobby and then up
here we want to pass that along as a
value so we can say hobby dot value okay
hobby coming from this right here so
let's save that and we'll go to our TS
file and we'll say add hobby okay
remember that's going to take in hobby
value and let's console.log it
and if I type something in and click
enter actually know what we have to put
so let's return false ok so now you'll
see that it's coming down here now all
we have to do to add it to the list is
push it on to it alright so let's say
this dot hobbies dot push actually I'm
going to do unshifted shift is just like
push except it'll push it on to the
beginning instead of the end and then
just pass in whatever comes into the
function so we'll say hello enter and it
gets added as the first hobby okay if we
did push it would get added to the end
and we can keep adding it alright now
let's say we wanted to delete a hobby so
what we'll do is go into where we have
the li here let's actually put this on
another line and then I'm just going to
add a button here it's not going to look
too pretty but that's fine and this will
be a click so say click and we'll set
that equal to delete hobby and we'll
just put an X here okay and then we want
to pass in the actual hobby ok whatever
iteration that is so it saved that and
then let's go and create delete hobby
okay and that gets passed in hobby I
just want to see what that gives us
so console dot log hobby and click it we
get watch movies you get listen to music
alright good so now what we'll do is
let's just do a for loop so we'll say
for and then let I equal 0 and then as
long as I is less than this dot hobbies
dot length and we want to just I plus
plus
and then what we want to do is match to
make sure the the one that we want to
delete is the current iteration so if
this dot hobbies I is equal to the hobby
that's being passed in then we want to
splice it out so we'll say this dot
hobbies dot splice which takes something
out of an array and it'll take an I is
the index and then we just wanted to eat
one from the index so save watch movies
will click X and it goes away okay so we
can now delete now this data isn't
persisting anywhere angular is just in
the UI if we wanted to you know have
this persist we would have to have some
kind of service that communicates with a
database or even if we use local storage
or something like that alright so now I
want to take a look at two a data
binding so what we'll do is let's see
I'm going to go into our HTML user
component and go under that's how do I
want to do this now let's create a form
right here I'm going to put an h1 here
I'm kind of mimicking the angular two
and sixty minutes but I'm not even
looking at that code I'm just going on
what I know of it so let's say edits
user and then we'll create a form no
action and then let's do a div
and we're going to have a label so this
will be for name let's put a br here and
then an input which will be text I'm
just going to copy this and put another
one this will be the email let's say I
think we had an h2 let's put the age
here let's make this a number so name
age email and we also have the address
fields so we have what Street city state
alright save that now what I want to do
is bind these inputs to these properties
okay go two-way data-binding from
template to component and vice versa so
to do that we need to use something
called ng model now in order to use ng
model you need to import the forms
module to app module TS so let's go over
here and we'll say import forms module
and that's going to be from angular
slash forms and then modules need to go
into this imports like that save and
then let's go back here and for the for
the name input here I'm going to put
some brackets and curly and parentheses
and this indicates two-way data-binding
and then we'll say ng model and I'm
going to bind this to the name property
ok now in addition to ng model you need
to have a name attribute which equals
the same thing in this case name so if I
save that you'll see John Doe is
automatically put inside of that name
and if I edit it it's also going to be
binded to this h1 because that has the
same property alright hopefully that
makes sense and we can just copy this
and this one will be age this one will
be email
a street now this one here remember it's
address dot Street but for the name we
just want to put street ok same thing
with the ones down here so this would be
address dot city and then this would
just be city address dot state and then
this would be state alright and you can
see it's the email isn't working we'll
have an email oh I didn't set email I
mean you don't have to set it here but
alright so now whatever we change he'll
see changes up here alright and you
would what you do is submit that and
then persist it to a database somewhere
but it's you'll see it's very cool how
its reactive like that alright guys so
what I want to do now is I want to show
you the how to create a service and also
how to use the HTTP module alright now
for the backend server that we're going
to be working with it's actually what is
a Jason Jason placeholder type a code
comm and it basically gives us some
endpoints that we can use and we can we
can make get requests to post requests
put delete if we make it get requests to
posts it'll give us a bunch of posts and
I want to show you how we can do that so
first thing we'll do is create a service
so let's open up our terminal here and
we'll clear this out and let's see I'm
actually going to create a folder called
services inside the app folder and then
we'll do ng G service it's going to go
in services and we're going to call this
data alright and if we look in services
we have data service TS it adds the
class it adds the injectable but one
thing it doesn't do is add it to a
project actually bring it in
in court data service and that's going
to be from dot slash services slash data
no is it dated there's a data dot
service right yeah and then we just need
to import it as a provider okay remember
services are providers and that's it so
we'll save it and now we need to do is
we need to bring in the service to the
component that we want to use it in so
up here this is the user component I'll
say import data service from and as far
as the path we want to go outside of the
user folder outside of the component
folder into the services folder into
data dot service ok now remember we
talked about dependency injection
whenever you want to use a service you
have to inject it as a dependency and
that goes into the constructor
parameters right here so we're going to
set this as a private data service and
you can use whatever you want right here
I'm using data service but you want to
set it to uppercase data service because
that's what we brought in ok we're
setting it to that and then we can use
any functions that are in the data
service so let's go over there to the
data service and let's actually just go
into the constructor and we'll do a
console log and we'll say data service
connected and save and now when this
loads down here you'll see data service
connected all right now what I want to
do is I want to fetch I want to use the
HTTP module to fetch posts from that
Jason place hold our site that I showed
you now to use the HTTP module we have
to go into AB dot module and import it
just like we did the forms module
and that's what's great about angular's
it has all these different tools and you
don't have to install any third-party
stuff it is I mean it is bigger and more
bloated than something like react but it
does offer a lot more so we need to
bring that into the imports as well all
right so now we can go back to our
service and we can go in courts
HTTP from angular slash HTTP and that
needs to be injected because it is a
service so let's say public HTTP and set
it to a capital HTTP okay and then we'll
create a function here called get let's
do posts ok because remember that that
API that I showed you or is it
these are posts but you can also get
users comments albums all kinds of
resources but we're using posts and I'm
just going to grab I just want the title
on the body really now to use the HTTP
module what we'll do is save this dot
HTTP okay so this should be whatever we
called it right here we could have just
called this H and said this dot H and
then the type of requests we want to
make which is a get request okay then we
need the URL which is going to be this
okay we'll put that in there and then
this actually is going to return an
observable so we need to use something
called map okay now we have to bring in
map from reactive extensions so let's
say import from rxjs slash add slash
operator slash map and then we're able
to just say dot map and we basically
want to take the response and we want to
map it to Jason so we're going to say
we're gonna use an arrow function here
and say res dot Jason and that's going
to return all of our posts from that URL
as Jason so now we can go back to our
user component
and we can go into the ng on a net and
we can save this dot data service
okay whatever we used right here when we
brought in and we injected it and then
we can call get posts now get post
returns and observable so we need to
subscribe to it and in here it's going
to give us back something so it's going
to give us posts and I'm going to use an
arrow function here actually why is that
get post on subscribe oh you know what
we didn't return it from the service I
closed that so this should actually be
returned all right so now if we go back
that error is gone now let's just do a
console log for this for the posts that
are returned from the service so now if
we go back to our application and we
look down here we get a hundred
different posts that are returned from
the API all right with an ID title body
user ID so what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to create a property called
posts so up here let's save posts and
then we'll also create an interface
called post okay but we're getting an
array of posts so we're getting this
error right here because it doesn't know
what this is so let's go create that
just like we did with the address and
it's going to have a title actually it's
going to have put an ID which will say
number title string body strength
user ID number all right and then what
we want to do is when the posts come in
from the service from the API we want to
assign it to we want to assign it to
that property so let me just comment
that out and we'll save this dot posts
equals posts ok let's save that and now
we should have access to the post and we
can use them in our template so what
I'll do is go to our user component HTML
let's go under the hobbies and put
another h1 and we'll say posts alright
and then what we'll do is we'll loop
through them so let's put a say 'give
let's see how do I want to do this yeah
we'll do div and then we're going to use
ng 4 just like we did before so ng 4
let's say let's toast of posts ok and
then we should have access to the data
so let's put an H do an H 4 and we'll
say post title and then we'll put a
paragraph and we'll say post dot body
Save and there we go so we're pulling in
all these posts from that API all right
so we're running out of time here or
this is the title of this whole thing
isn't going to make sense if we got like
5 or 6 minutes so we didn't do any ng
ifs which is basically just an if
statement so what I'm going to do here
is put a button actually you know what
I'll do is I will just put a button
right under the on click and I just want
to basically toggle the edit state ok
toggle this form right here so let's say
edit user and then the click is going to
call something called edit
I would say toggle edit okay and then
we'll go back to our component and let's
create a property up here called is edit
okay and we're going to set that to a
boolean and initially is going to be set
to false okay and then we're going to
create that toggle edit function I know
I'm going fast guys but I have to this
is have to be within an hour like I said
I go much more into depth in the course
so toggle edit and we're just going to
say let's say we're going to do here
we'll say this dot is edit equals not
this dot is edit so what this will do is
if it's true it'll set it to false if
it's false it'll set it to true okay now
let's take this is edit property and add
it as an ng if around this form so that
it only shows if is edit is true
hopefully that makes sense but let's put
a div around this okay and the form ends
right here
just tab that'll excuse me tab that over
and then we'll do asterisk ng if equals
is edit so if it's in the Edit state
which is false
remember false at first click Edit user
and now we can toggle the form alright
alright so the last thing I'm going to
try to squeeze in here really quick is
the router okay so we can use the router
to use different URLs for different
components now all we have is our user
components so let's generate another one
real quick
so we'll say ngg components in the
components folder and we'll just call
this a boat all right and then inside
the about HTML we'll just say we'll put
an H form we'll say a for app version
1.0 okay that's our about component save
it and then to use the router we just
close everything out we're going to go
into our
module file which members like the
meeting place for everything and we're
just going to import the router module
we want router module as well as routes
and that's going to be from angular
slash router and then we want to create
our routes in a variable that I'm going
to call a Prout's and that's going to
have the type of routes and then we're
going to set that to an array okay and
then each route will have an object so
path so the path for this is going to be
the home page which I want to be our
user component so we leave this blank to
be the home page specify component which
will be user components all right and
then we'll set another row just a path
will have that be a boat and then we'll
set the component to the about component
okay and then the last thing we want to
do in here is go down to imports just
like with every other module and we say
router module only we do dot for route
and then we pass in our app routes and
that's it save it and then the router
needs an outlet okay because right now
if we go to app component HTML which is
our core component it's just showing
user instead of that what we want to do
is we want to say router
- outlet and save and it's still going
to show the user because that's the
route that's the route for the home page
but if we go to slash about not about us
slash about we get our boat page or our
about component and we can put links so
let's say in the main app component we
want to put let's put a ul and we'll say
a now in order to use the router we want
to say router
Lync equals slash okay so that'll be the
home of the user component and then
let's try to say about and that will go
to the about component save and now we
can switch back and forth this could be
our navigation all right so we are going
to stop it here I think that I got
pretty much all the core fundamentals
that you need to know but you know
there's a lot more going into it going
in-depth and I would definitely suggest
the course for that links in the
