Zend framework 2 mini series in this
video we're going to set up routing and
controllers in our application alright
so what we want here is we want two
different pages okay we want a home page
which will display the list of albums
and provide links to edit and delete
them alright we also want an area to add
new albums edit albums and delete albums
alright so if we go down here the this
is going to be the different actions
inside of our album controller so we
want index add edit and delete now in
order to do that we're going to have to
define our routes inside of our module
dot config.php file alright so let's go
ahead and copy this and let's go to
module album config module dot config
okay now we can actually just overwrite
what we have here alright so what we did
is we added this ok the router array and
that's just going to point to the
different routes that we want basically
well not the routes it's it's more of
the structure ok so we'll have slash
album slash and then whatever the action
is so that'll be either index add edit
or delete and then of course the ID of
that album ok we have some constraints
basically we're just saying it has to be
alphanumeric or a hyphen or an
underscore alright
the default ok we can set up the default
controller which is album and then the
default action which will be index
alright so if we go to just you know my
album slash album it's going to load
index okay we don't have to specify the
actual index action so make sure you
have that saved and then if we go and we
continue on here now we want to create
the controller
right so let's create our album
controller that's gonna go in our source
okay so we want to go to module album
source album controller create a new
file and we're gonna call this album
controller dot php' all right so let's
grab what we have here oops
PHP tag okay so what we're doing here I
just like to put these up here just
preference so we have our different
actions or methods or functions whatever
you want to call them of this controller
index add edit and delete now the way
that the convention works is you need to
have action after each wherever you want
to call that action okay and if we go
back to our documentation it's it's
going to show us two different URLs that
are going to call the different methods
all right so slash album will call index
we have album add album edit album
delete and just to test this out let's
go to our index and let's just say died
and then we'll pass in index alright if
we save that and go back and we go to
slash album we get index okay if we want
to go to let's say add say add
all right so you can see that our routes
are now mapped to our controller action
now obviously we're not going to want to
do this what we're going to want to do
for each of these is load of view all
right so all we need to do in each one
is just return new view model all right
we want to put this in each of these
okay so now what we want to do is we
want to create our view files all right
so let's open up we want album module
album view all right and then in here
we're gonna create so we already have
our album folder and then we have
another album folder inside of that so
we want to go inside there and we're
going to create a couple things here a
couple files so this one is gonna be add
dot P HTML whoops it's not doing
anything
P HTML
all right so P HTML it's what I do it's
the extension for for Zend views okay
actually let's take a look at the
documentation all right let's see yeah
so it's we get to create all of these so
we need index edit and delete as well
and we want delete okay so there's our
view files now if we go home we look
inside of our application module which
is basically the the base module and we
go to view and then we have a folder
called layout okay that has a folder
called layout P HTML that is basically
the wrapper for the application this is
where we put our HTML tags our head tags
and there's a lot of dynamic stuff in
here that we don't want to touch but you
can see we also have our navbar we have
the container that has the main this is
where whatever viewer we're seeing this
is how it comes through okay you can see
we also have a footer and some other
stuff this is going to call all the Java
scripts we need and so forth so what we
want to do is the skeleton application
this is basically what we're seeing
inside of our title bar here so if we go
back and we don't want that so let's
change that okay we'll change that to my
albums it'll just say welcome alright
and then in the footer we can change
that as well if we change I'll replace
this with my albums okay if we save that
reload that's still showing this is this
is good oh oh it changed this up here I
changed the wrong thing this is actually
the link so let's change that too
my albums cuz it's a link but it's also
that the logo what we want to change is
the title which is up here where is it
head meta what
all right here we'll change that to my
albums welcome okay there we go
actually we want let's see the CF - to
get that out of there okay so my albums
welcome and then we have this little
logo area of my albums
okay now what we want to do is go back
into our album module and then into the
views and let's go to index and let's
see what the documentation has for us
okay so they actually the documentation
doesn't have any code for us so let's
just put in h2 here and we'll give it a
class of page header and let's say
albums all right and I'm going to copy
that and then for each view we're just
going to put the h2 in so this will be
ad album this will be delete edit
and index okay so let's cross our
fingers and hope that this works so
let's go to album okay albums and then
if we go to slash add we get add album
if we go to slash edit and we should
also have delete alright so what we've
done is we created our controller we
created the actions and then we linked
to the actions two of you
alright so that's going to be it for now
in the next video we're going to get
into our database and models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
