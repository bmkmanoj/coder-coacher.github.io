had an installed Symphony and we set up
our controller our actions and our views
and we linked the views to the actions
so now we want to do is want it some
kind of layout alright so we're going to
use bootstrap so if we go to get
bootstrap calm and then go to getting
started and we go down and there should
be some sample templates we can use here
so I'm just going to grab this starter
template basically just the navbar and
the basic structure so if we click on
that and then to control you you can
look at the source code and what I'm
going to do is let's see let's just copy
all of it okay so we're going to grab
that and then as I said in the last
video we have our layout file which is
in the resources views and then base dot
html' dot twig okay so what I'm going to
do is paste this in underneath what we
what's already there
alright and then what we can do is just
grab what we need so the title which is
going to be it allows us to have a
dynamic title so we're going to paste
that in right here
and then let's see we have our style
sheets block and the favicon we can grab
those and let's put that
let's put that
right under this bootstrap CSS file
alright and then we can actually get rid
of everything below that that's in the
head all right
and then
let's see that's pretty much it this is
going to go actually we'll grab that in
a minute so let's scroll down the navbar
we obviously want that on every page so
we're going to keep that in the base
layout and then down here we have our
container what I'm going to do is get
rid of this whole starter template div
get rid of that and I'm going to get rid
of all this as well all right and then
we can go up and grab the body block and
I'm going to put that right in the
container actually I'm going to create a
row class okay so we can use the
bootstrap grid system and we'll create a
class called call em d12 and I'm going
to put that right in there all right and
the JavaScript block we'll put that down
at the bottom
all right now we can get rid of this
stuff here
okay now there's a few things I want to
do in the navbar I'm going to get rid of
the navbar fix top class and let's see
for the project name let's change that
to to-do list and let's see we'll have a
home link that's going to go to slash
now we could do / - dues which is going
to be this use index but I'm going to
also make that the home page so we can
keep that at slash and then this one
here will say add to do and now it's
going to go to slash to do slash create
and then we can get rid of the contact
all right so that looks good let's go
ahead and save it and we can go and see
what that looks like
let's go to slash to dues okay so that
didn't show up
did I save it oh we need to include it
in our view as well so let's go to the
index view right here and just to look
at an example let's go to views default
index and you can see that it has this
extends right here so we do want that
okay that's just telling it that we want
we actually want the layout to wrap
around it and let's go back we want to
put this block body at the beginning and
then down at the bottom we want that end
block as well all right so let's go like
that
and
we'll grab that as well
all right so now it should display
okay so that that's working it's just
that we didn't include the bootstrap CSS
now just to make this simple I'm going
to grab the bootstrap CDN
all right so let's grab this link right
here and then we'll go to our base and
let's put it let's replace this
with that
okay so there we go so now we have our
basic layout not the best-looking but
it's something so what we're going to
want to do is we're going to want to
include this stuff on all of our views
all right so let's paste that in edit
in details
okay so now if we go to add to do you
can see that it's it's wrapped in the
layout which is what we want let's get
rid of that active class though in the
base so let's see this right here and
get rid of that all right
so let's start to add some content to
the to the views alright so we're going
to want a table on the on the index page
alright so let's go back to the
bootstrap website and we'll go to
CSS least I think it's CSS
and tables and actually they don't have
a good example here
huh all right so let's just open up the
console here or the HTML view or
whatever it's called and I want this
striped table right here so let's go
ahead and copy this we'll say copy
element and then we'll go to our index
page here and replace this that doesn't
look too good
let's just clean this up a little bit
by one minute better just to type it in
manually
and let's see TD
table row
and it's not it didn't format because
this is an actual HTML file so my text
editor editor doesn't recognize it as
HTML
all right so let's see if that shows up
oops you know let's take care of that
now because right now slash goes to this
let's go to actually you know what we
can do is in our controller to do
controller let's change this instead of
to dues let's just go to slash alright
and then we can go up to the default
controller where is it and just get rid
of this so now
it's going to load up our to do table or
index so the tables showing up now let's
just edit that a little bit so we're
going to want the to do name itself and
that's probably it I mean I guess we'll
probably want a due date so let's do
that as well
all right get rid of that
and let's just keep one of these
okay so this will be the to do name this
right here will be the due date all
right and then we're going to have some
buttons all right so let's put an empty
th tag right here and then here let's
say a and this is going to be let's make
this the view link so this will go to
slash to do slash details slash and then
it will be the ID for now I'm just going
to put a 1 all right and then let's give
this a class of BTN BTN primary which
let's say success make it green
and this will say view
all right so it looks good
next we'll have the edit button so let's
copy this actually we don't want the t
DS you just want because they're all
going to be in the same column so just
copy the link and this one will be the
edit button
so we'll say edit and change this
success to default and we'll change the
text to edit and then we'll have the
delete so this will go to do delete and
we'll change this to button danger which
will make it red and then change view to
delete
all right so that looks good now let's
put a header in here so we'll go right
above the table to h2 and we'll give it
a class of page header which is a
bootstrap class and let's say latest -
dues
all right now the form for the ad to do
the way that Symphony works is we create
the form fields and all that in the
controller and then there's just a
couple lines that we put in the view so
most of the the form building is within
the controller so we're going to get to
that in a little bit what I want to do
now is start to think about our model in
our database so what we want to do is we
want to create a new database so let's
go to localhost and PHP myadmin and all
we're going to do is create a database
here we're not going to do the fields
because we can use something called
doctrine that's included with Symphony
that allow us to generate our our models
and then we can actually generate the
table from that so let's go to databases
and let's create to do list and that's
it that's all we're going to do for
right now now we're going to go over and
add our database config
config and then parameters dot yml all
right so you want to put the database
name your user name in my case it's root
so I'm going to leave it and then the
password
all right and that's it so we can save
that close it up so I just want to look
something up real quick actually we'll
go right here and let's go documentation
in search
you want doctrine
I don't know if it's the configuration
page
yeah that's not what I want
we do a Google search
door trim model
yeah I think this is what I want
all right so let's go down now this is
configuring the database we just did
that the params file let's see
okay oh you can actually have it create
the database we don't even have to do
that through through page P my admin and
what we want is right here we want to
create an entity class all right so
there's actually right here console
command we can do to generate the entity
so I'm going to actually copy this and
we'll open up our command line make sure
you're in the project folder
okay so paste that in let me just look
it over
okay so generate entity you don't have
to specify it yet it'll take us through
a list of questions all right so the
entity shortcut name that's going to be
to do oh it's not valid oh we need to
include the bundle name as well all
right so we're using app bundle so we
should be able to say app bundle and
and then we can say to do okay so the
format for our configuration the default
sanitation we're going to keep that and
now we can start to add fields so we
should need to specify an ID that'll
automatic what we do want is a name for
our to do and the field type the default
is string and that's what we want so I'm
going to just do enter 255 that's fine
is nullable we'll keep that false unique
false and that's it so now we need to
create our next field so let's do
category and if this was a production
app you probably want your own category
model and table but for this simple
application it's just going to be a text
field so we'll just keep it like that
okay that's all fine next thing let's do
description and let's make that it
actually string is good for that that's
all good
alright so what else do we need let's do
priority that'll also be a string and
let's do due date and for that we're
going to say date time alright and what
else I think that's I think that's good
let's do let's do a create date as well
okay that's also going to be date time
okay so it says press return to stop
adding fields
okay so we'll click return and it says
everything is okay now get to work and
you'll see here I created an entity
folder in our bundle with a to do PHP
file and it also created a repository so
let's go look at that if we go to app
bundle so you have entity if we open
that up and actually generate this file
for us so you can see every property we
have and it also created getters and
setters for each property
okay so set name get name set category
get category so every field has a getter
and a setter alright that's how it works
now to create the actual tables we
should have a command for that
generating getters and setters we
already have that Radia creating a
database table schema so we want to grab
this right here okay we'll go ahead and
run that
did I copy it
all right so let's run that
okay database schema updated
successfully let's go check it out okay
so now you see we have a to do table and
if we go to our structure we have all
our fields alright so we didn't even
need to touch any kind of SQL or PHP
myadmin or anything like that we can do
it all from the application which is
really nice alright so we're going to
stop here for this this part and in the
next part we'll continue and we'll work
on trying to fetch the the the
information from the database actually
know what before we go let's go ahead
and just insert a couple - duze alright
so for name let's say pick up kids
category we'll say family description
and priority hi due dates
tomorrow
and then create date will be right now
and create one more this will be meeting
with team and this category will say
work scription meet with the team and
then priority let's say normal due date
and create date
all right
okay so now we have a couple to dues all
right so yeah in the next video we'll
work on trying to fetch these and
display them in the front end or in our
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
