to back in this video we're going to get
into loop
okay so loops are part of virtually
every programming language and what they
do is they execute a block of code a set
number of times okay based on some kind
of condition so let's go ahead and in
our PHP sandbox folder we'll create a
new file and let's call this loop dot
PHP and throw in our PHP tags okay so
this is going to be on root and like I
said we'll say execute code set number
of times okay and sometimes you know
what that number is sometimes you don't
now there's four different types of
loops so we have a for loop we have a
while loop a do while loop and a for
each loop so we're going to start off
with a for loop now for loop is usually
used if you know the number of times
it's going to be executed and it has a
couple programs so let's say at Ram and
it takes in an initializer and then the
second program is a condition which
could be anything really and then
increment okay so let's do four and so
the initializer which we're just going
to pretty much just create a variable
usually called I that's the calling
practice annual step that's a zero
initially and then each parameter is
separated by a semicolon alright so next
is the condition
so we'll say as long as I is less than
10 okay that's our condition and then
the increment we're going to do I plus
plus which is going to increment it by 1
okay so after every time it goes around
zero is going to increment by one
up to ten and then it will stop because
this will be true okay
it'll-it'll process whatever we put in
here anything at all until this is true
so what we'll do is just just echo out I
so if we save that and we go to
localhost / PHP sandbox / - oops
PHP okay and it gives us zero through
nine if we want to we can add a line
break here and put each number on its
own line now notice that it only goes up
to nine that's because once this is true
it stops and we're saying if it's less
than ten if it went ten if we went to
ten that's not going to work because
this is less than ten if we wanted to
know we could say less than or equal to
ten and then if we reload it'll it'll
include the ten okay and we can do
whatever we want here let's say we
wanted to add the text number space and
then we'll concatenate it like that and
reload and we get number zero - number
ten and we can also start this wherever
we want and say if we started at five
then it's going to do five through ten
okay so that's a basic for loop the next
kind of loop we have is a while loop
okay and then as far as params
parameters it just takes a condition
that's it
okay setting the variable and all that
happens outside of the loop so let's do
I equals zero notice that we're doing it
outside of the loop and then we're going
to have wild and then that takes a
condition so we'll say as long as I is
less than 10 okay so same condition I'm
actually going to comment this out up
here because I don't want that to run
all right so while I is less than 10
let's go ahead and just echo out I and
then
echo a line break loose okay and then we
want to increment it while we're in here
so I plus plus and then if we save that
and reload you can see it does the same
thing okay so a while loop is is usually
used over a for loop if you don't know
the set number the set condition all
right now there's also a do-while loop
which isn't used as much I really never
use do I loops but just to show you
let's let's just say do-while and Czar's
quran the while in the do-while takes a
position
okay so what we'll do is we'll set we'll
set the I variable and then we're going
to say Q which doesn't take which
doesn't take parenthesis and here is
what we want it to do now the main
difference between this is that with a
do-while loop it's always going to run
at least once okay no matter what so
let's say X echo I and it's also actual
a line break okay and then we're going
to do our increment inside of the do so
I plus plus and then down here we'll
have the while with the condition
so we'll say while I is less than 10
okay so notice the wild doesn't have the
curly braces all the action happens we
then do okay we just put the condition
and wild down here so let me comment
this stuff out and we'll go ahead and
run this and again we get 0 39 okay so
that's a do-while loop now the last type
of loop we're going to look at is a for
each and for each is different because
it's meant to work with arrays okay so
let's create an array called people just
like we did in the last video and we'll
set it to array let's say Brad Jose and
William so we want to be able to just
loop through this array and then access
the values so for that we'll say for
each actually put my little comments up
here okay so for each
for a raise okay so we want to say for
each and then we're going to pass in the
name of the array which in this case is
people and then we want to do as and
then a variable that we want to use for
each one so usually you would do
whatever the singular form of this
okay so plural singular for each people
each one is a person go down here let's
just echo person and then we'll also
ethical a library so let's try that and
you can see it just prints out each name
you can do whatever you want with this
variable through each iteration so
that's a simple indexed array let's try
it with a an associative array so I'm
going to copy that
and then comment it out and then let's
say we have a name as the key and then
an email addresses the value so we'll do
that and then Jose and William
okay so now we have an associative array
now what we want to do is say for each
people as person and then we want to put
this equal sign greater than so this is
basically going to be the key and then
this will be the value so we'll say
email and you can use whatever variables
you want but this is the format when
you're looping through an associative
array so let's say we want to echo out
person and then we'll just concatenate
and put a colon in there and then
concatenate on the email save that
reload and we get the name which is the
key and then the email which is the
value all right so that's going to do it
for loops in the next video we're going
to take a look at conditionals and look
at some of the operators in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
