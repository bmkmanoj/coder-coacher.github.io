building a simple application using
vanilla JavaScript that will take in a
zip code and then give us that location
info all right so for example if I put
in here o to 1 to 0 you'll see that
it'll give us back the city to state the
longitude and the latitude and we're
using the Balma CSS framework which is a
nice change from the usual bootstrap or
materialise that I usually use and we
can close this out if we want and you'll
see that the zip code will clear out and
we also made it so that if we put
something that's not a valid zip code
you'll see that we'll get this little X
over here and we'll get an invalid
message all right now this is pure
JavaScript we're not using any
frameworks or libraries and the reason
that I've been doing a lot of these
types of applications is because I think
we're over using frameworks and
libraries for things that that they're
not needed for very small applications
like this for larger applications
they're great you know react angular
full stack applications that they're
really great but there's there's a lot
of things that they're not needed for
JavaScript alone has has really gotten a
lot better to work with I mean we can
select things from the Dom and work with
the Dom very easily now with the fetch
API which is what we'll be using we
don't have to use jQuery or you know
external HTTP libraries we also don't
have to make complicated xhr old-school
Ajax requests so I think it's good to
start to get into you know building
applications with pure JavaScript so
enough of the the babble let's go ahead
and get started with this application I
want to give a huge shout out to today's
sponsor male tag male tag is a Chrome
extension that allows you to track your
emails in real time for free it also
lets you track other cool things like
link clicks email reopens and even the
device that was used to open your emails
be sure to check out male tag by
clicking the link in the description
below alright guys so to get started I
just have a folder called local
patient finder that is completely empty
and we're just going to create an
index.html file in here and that should
be all we need for this small
application now to get the location info
we're using an API called zippopotamas
if apothem us and it just basically it's
a very simple API you don't need a key
or anything all you do is make a request
to API dot zip upon m dot us slash and
then whatever country you're using this
is gonna be strictly US zip codes that
we're doing but feel free to build your
own application using different
countries and then just the zip code
okay and then it'll give us our response
which will include the info that you saw
the the longitude latitude all that
stuff the city you can also make request
to slash country slash state slash city
and get the zip code if you want to do
that and you guys know that if you if
you kind of if you want to take the
application that I build and tweak it
and you don't create something on your
own and you can look at it kind of it's
like a homework assignment if you guys
want to do this
I'll always approve those links you know
most links will go straight to spam in
the comment section but I'll always
approve those if you guys want to
display your work alright so just to let
you know so that's what we'll be using
this API here so what I'm gonna do over
here in index.html is just put in some
basic HTML tags using Emmet alright so
let me just close that up and we'll go
ahead and have a title here we'll call
it location finder all right now as I
said we're not using any kind of
JavaScript framework or anything we are
going to use a CSS framework called
Balma CSS so we want to get the CDN so
I'm gonna say bulma CSS CDN and let's
grab it from CDN J Escom and I'm gonna
grab this right here so we'll say copy
link tag and we'll throw that in the
head area
alright I'm also going to use font
awesome which is an icon library so
let's search for font
awesome CDN and we'll go ahead and grab
that let's say actually we'll just grab
this right here this link tag and we'll
put it right under the Balma CDN link
alright so we'll save that now I'm using
live server as you guys know if you if
you watch my tutorials I use a plug-in
for vyas code called live server that
will just open up my HTML file on my
local host so if you want to install
that you can go ahead and search for it
here and install it and then you can
right-click and say open with live
server all right so that's gonna open up
our page over here
alright let's close this back up alright
guys so let's go into the body here and
we're gonna wrap everything in a section
so we're gonna put a section tag and
we're gonna add a bunch of classes now
I'm using Emmet so I'm just gonna use
the dot syntax here and say dot here oh
that's gonna be the first class which is
a Balma CSS class kind of like a
Jumbotron or a showcase area it's also
gonna have an a hero - body class and
then we also want a class called is -
dark which will make it dark and make
the text light and then we also want a
container which will contain everything
into the middle and then I'll hit tab
using Emmet and it'll make those all
into classes alright so if I save this
you should get this this black bar
alright so in here we're gonna have an
h1 we're gonna give this h1 a class of
title and in here we're gonna say us
location info I'll save that and then
underneath that we're gonna put an h2
and give that a class of subtitle which
is also a Balma CSS class and we're just
going to say enter a zip code to get the
location info alright and then
underneath that we're gonna have our
form so let's create a form tag we're
going to give this an ID of let's call
this zip form
okay we don't need an action we're not
actually submitting this to a page
alright so what I'm gonna do now is go
to the Balma CSS not CD and I just want
the documentation and let's see we want
forms alright so this is you know what
alright so show code so each field
should be wrapped in a class of field
and then let's see we want it we
actually want some icons so we're gonna
need this this class with control has
icons all that stuff we want it to look
like this right here and you can see
that they're actually using font awesome
as well there's no there's no icon
library associated with Balma so you
want to use font awesome so I'm just
gonna copy this second field right here
and we're gonna go ahead and put that
right in the form all right and we might
have to change some things up well we
will have to change some things up we're
not using a user name actually I'm not
even going to use a label so we're gonna
get rid of that okay so no label this
div right here has a class of control
has icons left and then has icons right
that's fine
let's see input is success for the for
the input class let's do input and zip
and let's say is large we want to make
it bigger all right and then type text
placeholder for the placeholder will
just say enter zip code for the value
we're not gonna have a value just get
rid of that all right and then for this
span right here it has a class of icon
is small and is left and then we're
gonna change the icon from user to map -
pin alright and then for this spin right
here we're gonna that we're gonna keep
that as a check so this is fine
let's see now it's gonna be a check if
it's a valid zip code right so we're
also gonna have an X if it's not valid
so we're gonna copy this and let's put
that this in here all right and then
let's see this is gonna be I con is
small is right we're also going to add a
class of icon - remove all right and
then this is going to be instead of FA
check it's gonna be at the FA remove so
if we save that we take a look we have
two icons on top of each other which
obviously isn't what we want and this
right here we don't want that either so
let's just get rid of that paragraph all
right so what we want to do is initially
hide the remove icon we don't want that
to display actually we want to remove
both of them to begin with and then
after we make our request if it's
successful and the zip code is a real
zip code will show the checkmark if it's
not we'll show the X so let's go up to
the head here and we'll go ahead and put
in some style tags and we're gonna
initially hide both of those all right
so let's say dot icon remove and then
actually I don't think I added the the
other class or is it so yeah this is
icon remove so for this span right here
we want to add icon check like that and
we want both of those to be hidden so
let's say icon remove comma icon check
and then we want to display none and
save forgot the dot right there and save
and now we don't have either of them
displaying all right so that's what we
want
now our HTML is just about done all we
need now is is a place for the output
okay so we're gonna go under the section
okay so we'll go under the section let's
put in Hawaiian break
and then we'll put a class of container
and inside here we'll have a div with
the ID of output
alright so that's basically our
placeholder that's where we're gonna
have our JavaScript dump all the
location info so let's save that and now
our HTML is done all right so now we're
gonna create our script tags down at the
bottom here okay so in here what we want
to do first is we want to add an event
listener to the form okay when we submit
it we want to call an event so let's say
listen for submit and we'll say document
dot let's use query selector okay which
is just like using jQuery really I will
say zip form and then we want to add an
event listener okay we want to listen
for a submit event and then we're going
to call a function called get location
info all right so now down here let's go
ahead and create that function
application info alright and that's
gonna take in an event parameter and
let's just console dot log and we'll
just console.log one two three now since
it's a submit event it's going to or
since it's a form that submits it's
gonna try to submit to a page but we
don't want that so we want to prevent
that default behavior and we can do that
by taking that a parameter and saying
prevent default all right so let's save
let's open up our console with f12 go to
console and just whatever put whatever
in there and enter and we get one two
three all right so that event that
submit event is being fired off and it's
calling this function alright so what do
we want to do next we want to get this
value so let's go ahead and get rid of
that console log
and we're gonna say let's put a comment
here we'll say get zip value from input
and we're gonna create a variable called
zip and we'll set that to document dots
get actually will do query selector so
query selector and we can get it it's a
class of zip and we want the value okay
actually did I add the class to the
input no yeah I didn't has a class of
alright so we want to get that value and
just to test it out real quick we'll say
console.log zip alright so let's go
ahead and add in a zip code here we'll
say o - 1 - 0 and you'll see that's just
gonna log it now what we want to do is
make a request to this URL right here
and we want to put the zip code in here
ok so let's grab this and we're going to
use the fetch API that's what a comment
here will say make request and it'll say
fetch and here I'm gonna put a set of
back ticks because we're going to use a
template string and let's paste this in
for some reason they didn't put HTTP so
let's make sure we do that and then this
value here is gonna be our zip variable
so to put a variable inside of a
template string we just need to put a
money sign and then some curly braces
then we can put a variable in alright
and that's just es6 syntax all right now
the way that fetch works is we're gonna
put in dot then right here okay make
sure you don't put a semicolon here this
is attached to this because it returns a
promise we're gonna take that response
and it's good we're gonna map it to
Jason so we want to say response dot
jason like that and then we want to put
another dot then in and that's where we
can get our data alright so in here
we're gonna put data
and we're going to use an arrow function
and let's just for now console dot log
that data all right so let's go ahead
and save this and then let's go back to
our app and enter and you'll see that it
gives us our data back okay so it gives
us the postcode back it gives us the
country the country abbreviation and
then a places array so the the actual
city and stuff like that that's going to
be inside of an array okay and it's
gonna be usually an array with just one
value okay so it's the zero index and
that's where we can get all of our stuff
so when we go to output this down here
in our JavaScript we're gonna have to
loop through it okay so we're gonna have
to use a for each loop or something to
go through that array and output it all
right now we have to check to see if
this is a working zip code and the way
that this works this API is if this
isn't a valid zip code so if we just put
something in here and we hit enter it
gives us a status of 404 okay because
this link here this is not found because
that's not a zip code so what we need to
do is go into this first then and we
need to test to see what the response
code is is it 200 which is a good
response or is it something else like a
404 and then that's how we can tell if
it's a working zip code so instead of
just directly mapping this to response
dot JSON we're gonna set this to a set
of curly braces and we're gonna do some
stuff in here alright so just to show
you the response I mean I'm sorry the
status you can say response dot status
all right and if we go ahead and we put
something crazy in here you'll see that
the status is 404 if I put a working zip
code
oops I put a working zip code we get 200
as the status so what we're gonna do is
a little check right here and we're
gonna say if the response dot status is
not equal to 200 all right so if it's
not equal to 200 that means it's not a
good zip code all right so what will do
is will output an alert here that says
it's no good
so we'll say document dot let's do query
selector okay remember we have that
output ID that's what we're going to
grab and we're going to say dot inner
HTML equals and we're going to use
template string so I'm going to put it
set of back ticks here whoops all right
so in our back ticks we're gonna put the
alert now in Balma this is actually a
called a message so if we go to
components message we want the red one
here which has a class of I think it's
is danger or is it yeah right here so
class of message is danger then it has a
we don't want the header we just want
the body so we're just going to put an
alert or a message in here and we're
just going to use an article claw tag
all right so we'll say article and we'll
give this a class let's give this a
class of message we'll put the message
body in here as well and then let's put
is danger all right and then in here
we'll put our actual message we'll just
say invalid zip code please try again
okay and then what we'll do is we'll
just throw an error if this happens so
we're gonna go under here and say throw
error
let's hope cerar and then in here we'll
put in the status text in addition to
the status it'll actually give you the
status text so that's what we want to
throw so response dot status text okay
and then we'll do else
okay so else then we just want to
basically just map the Jason just like
we did before before we did this check
and we can do that with just returning
response dot Jason like that all right
so let's save that let's go back and if
we put in something crazy here and enter
we get our error now we're getting this
uncaught down here because we threw the
error but we didn't catch it so down
after the second dot then we're gonna do
dot catch and in here this takes in an
error and then we're just going to
console dot log the error all right so
now do that again and it'll actually
just log the error here okay you know
what this text should actually be read
though so actually you know what I think
let's not put the message body in there
we're gonna put a separate div here oops
so div class message body
and we'll wrap that text all right
so that should look right let's try that
there we go
all right so we took care of you know
checking to see if it's as a rail zip
code or not to get in then we get the
alert but I also want that the check or
the X over here so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna create another function
under the get location info and we're
gonna call this show icon all right so
this is gonna choose to show you know
either the check or the or the the X and
this is going to take an icon okay a
variable called icon and we want we want
to clear make sure that there's no icon
displayed there first before we do
anything so we're gonna say document dot
query selector let's get the class of
icon remove okay and then we're gonna
say dot style dot display equals none
okay we're gonna do the same thing for
the what's the other one icon check I
believe so we'll say icon check all
right so this is just making sure that
there's nothing here before we do
anything so once those are cleared then
we want to show the correct icon okay
now I'm just gonna copy one of these and
we're gonna say document query selector
and then whatever's passed in here this
will either be check or remove so we
just want to change this right here to a
template string so we want to use back
ticks because we're going to include a
variable and we're gonna say dot icon -
and then whatever is passed in so
remember to use a variable we use this
syntax and we're going to put in our
icon variable now instead of setting it
to none we're going to
set it to inline - flex all right that's
what Balma uses to actually display
their icons here so it's gonna go from
none
you know display:none to inline flex
okay and then we need to decide where
we're actually going to show the icons
and when so when we make our request and
we figure out that it's not good it's
not equal to 200 then we're gonna show
the icon alright and we want to show the
the remove icon so we'll pass in remove
all right that way it's gonna display
icon - and then remove so down here in
the else right before or is it right
here right before we do the response dot
Jason will call show icon and we'll pass
in check
all right so let's go ahead and save
that let's try it out we'll put in
something good and enter okay we get our
check let's try something that's not
good
enter and we get our X all right so the
last thing we need to do is just display
the correct info if it's a real zip code
all right so we want to go down to where
we have our data right now it's just
console logging so if we put a good zip
code it's just logging the data what
we're gonna want to do is loop through
the places array that it gives us and
then output those okay our output that
so let's go ahead and get rid of the
console.log and we'll just say show
location info and we're gonna create a
variable called output and we'll set it
to nothing at first and then we're gonna
loop through those places okay we can
get this this array with data dot places
okay so let's say data dot places and
then we're going to do a dot for each
and in here we're gonna put in place and
then set that
an arrow function alright and then we're
just going to append to that output
variable so we'll say I'll put plus
equals which is going to append it and
then I'm going to use a template string
so make sure you use backticks here
alright so in here we're going to use
again we're gonna use an article can I
use Emmet I'm not sure if I can use
Emmet in here let me try it message okay
I can good alright so we'll put a
message let's make this is primary which
is going to make it I believe the green
greenish color and then we're gonna put
a header so we'll say I div with the
class of message - header and then here
we'll put a paragraph oops
just put a paragraph and we'll say
location info and we're also going to
have a little delete button so that we
can get rid of it if we want so we'll
say button and this is gonna have a
class of delete ok and then I believe I
don't think we have to put anything in
here I think just putting the class of
delete gives it the little X so
underneath the header the message header
will have the body so let's put a div
with the class of message - body and
inside here I'm just gonna put
everything inside of a UL alright so
we'll have let's put an li and we'll put
in some strong tags and we'll say city
colon space and then we can access
everything with this place variable
alright so remember to use a variable
we're gonna use the syntax es6 and we're
gonna say place and then we can access
with inside brackets we're gonna say
place space name which is kind of weird
that they use a space if you look here
you'll see place space name ames bear
so we need to use the bracket syntax and
then wrap it in quotes all right so
that's the city or the place name I
don't know why they didn't just call it
city but let's go ahead and copy this Li
and we'll paste in three more so after
the city will have the state so we'll
change this right here to state then
we're going to have the longitude and
let's see this is gonna be place
longitude and then we'll do the latitude
all right and that should do it as far
as the the mark up here now we need to
do is just insert it into the output div
that we have up here okay we have this
div with the ID of output so what we
want to do is go outside of let's see
outside of this for each which ends
right here and let's just say insert I
will say insert into output div so
document dot query selector
I D output dot enter hTML is gonna equal
the output variable that we just created
all right so that should do it let's
save let's go ahead and put something in
here
oh one nine one three and there we go
now if we want this delete button right
here to work we're gonna have to add
that functionality so we're gonna have
to add another event listener so let's
go up to the top here and we'll say
listen or delete all right so we're
gonna have to use event delegation here
because the delete is inside of the for
loop or is it right here so it's inside
here so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna listen on the body on the document
body and then we're gonna fire the event
and then we're gonna check to see if the
delete button was clicked all right so
let's go ahead and add an event listener
I'm just gonna copy this and we're gonna
listen on the body okay and we're gonna
listen for click and we're going to call
a function called delete location all
right so let's go ahead and add that
function down here say delete location
box I guess
and passing an event parameter there and
then let's just do a console dot log one
two three so right now if I click
anywhere in here we're gonna get the one
two three so what we need to do is we
need to make sure that what we click has
a class of delete so we can do a little
if statement here and we can take that
event parameter that event object
poisonous there we go so we can take
that event object and we can look at the
target and then the class name okay so
if that is equal to delete then we know
that that's that's we want to keep going
because the delete button was clicked so
in here what we'll do let's just test it
out first will say console.log one two
three so now if we reload you see it's
not working
if I go and I search for a location and
then I click on if I click anything down
here not working I click the button we
get one two three okay so what we want
to happen here is we just want to take
the message okay I remember this has a
class of message and then we want to
just remove it from the Dom all right so
let's say document dot query selector
message our dot message it's a class of
message and then we're gonna do dot
remove okay which will just completely
remove it from the Dom and then I'd also
like to clear out this value so we'll
say document dot query selector and
remember that has a class of zip that
input and then we want to say dot value
and we want to set it to nothing all
right so if we save that let's try it
out so oh one nine three and we click X
and it clears out now we still have this
check icon here so if you want to take
care of that
and I guess we could just let's copy
this right here and we'll change this to
icon - check and we'll remove that as
well let's try that there we go
all right awesome so I think that's it
guys so let me put a comment right here
say show check or remove icon good so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this project
it went a little longer than I thought
but then again we had these you know the
Balma CSS mock-up and all that removing
the icons and so on so that's gonna be
it guys hopefully you like this if you
