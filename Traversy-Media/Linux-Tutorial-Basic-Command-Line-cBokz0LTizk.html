make a video for people that are new to
Linux and new to the clan line to maybe
help you out a little bit and show you
how to navigate the terminal and do some
very basic tasks so a lot of people ask
me why I work on Windows in most of my
videos and let me just clarify by saying
that I'm in no way shape or form a
Windows fanboy I actually like working
on Linux better for web development
programming there is a few reasons why I
have Windows installed on my main
machine one is for the recording
software I use Camtasia which works
flawlessly for what I needed to do and I
haven't found a linux based solution
that works how I need it to and
processes the videos as fast as I need
them to I also use Dolby Photoshop and
then a lot of other Windows based tools
I also have six monitors and it's a pain
in the ass to try and get them working
with the bun too and working with the
drivers I know I could do it if I really
tried but it's just something that it
hinders me another reason is gaming I
have a pretty beefy system with SLI
graphics cards and obviously if you play
games you want to run Windows now that's
not a huge deal because I very rarely
play games anymore because I'm so busy
but that is is one of the issues and
then the main reason I use Windows in a
lot of my videos is because I'm trying
to reach everybody of all skill sets and
chances are a person that is just
learning HTML and front-end development
is running Windows and they may get lost
if I'm using Linux or a Mac now I know
many of you do use Linux or Mac but I
think that there's more of a chance of a
Linux or Mac user knowing and
understanding what I'm doing in Windows
than the other way around so that's
probably the biggest reason for my own
personal development I do work on Linux
in a virtual machine and I'm going to
start using Linux more on my videos so
anyway let's jump in and learn some
basic commands now if you're a Windows
user I would suggest getting something
like VMware or VirtualBox and installing
a Linux distribution
you may not want to go as far as to
install it on your main machine for your
everyday use but you should get into it
and start to experiment with it as far
as distros I prefer a bun - or debian
and there's also there's a lot to choose
from okay for beginners I would
recommend Debian Ubuntu or even Linux
Mint open Zeus or open SUSE however you
say it is a little more complicated but
I do like that as well so let's get into
it currently a bun - is using the unity
desktop interface but you can use a
different environment if you want and
we're going to go and open the terminal
now I use a program called Terminator so
that's what I'm going to be using if you
install bun to fresh you're going to
just have the regular terminal which is
this right here but it doesn't really
matter you use the same command alright
so let's go ahead and just make that a
little bigger now when you first open
your terminal that you're going to be in
your home directory okay every user on a
Linux system has a home directory much
like on Windows if you go to users you
have your your user names for each
account so when it does the same thing
in fact if we look at the file manager
and you can see that actually opens in
the home directory as well if we go to
the actual root directory it's going to
be in home you'll see I have a folder
called Brad today I only have one user
on this system so over here you can
actually check your what path you're in
with the command PWD ok you can see I'm
in home Brad so that's the first command
now if you want to show the listings
like you do in file manager in your
command line you can use the LS ok of
the listing command and you can see that
these are the same folders that we're
seeing here all right now with commands
you also have options okay almost
commands have some options you can use
now with LX we have an option of - a and
what that does is it'll show everything
even the hidden files the system files
that begin with the dot it will show
those as well
default those are hidden okay much like
hidden files and windows now we can also
use the dash l so if we say LS dash L
and that just shows us some extra
information the time it was created the
day to the side now this here at the
beginning this looks kind of weird what
this is is the permissions of the folder
or file basically it's broken up into
three parts the first is for the owner
the permissions of the owner of the
folder or file and then the permissions
for the group ok because you can also
have user groups and then the permission
for everyone else for the rest of the
world or the public now these basically
stand for delete the be is delete read
write and execute ok so basically the
owner of the folder a file has all these
permissions they can do whatever they
want the group can only execute and read
and then the rest of the world can only
execute ok so they can't change anything
at all that's what that is and then here
you see Brad Brad the reason it says it
twice is because one is the user and
then one is the group ok so there's
actually a group called Brad and you can
change these with certain commands but
I'm not really going to get into that
today I just want to be I want to keep
things very basic so that's the LS
command now the next command I want to
look at is mkdir ok and that is make
directory and it does just that it will
create a directory so let's create a
folder or a directory inside of our home
and let's call this we'll call it 0 1
all right and over here you can see that
now we have dyrone if we do LS you
seeder 1 alright let's create another
one called der - ok so now we have these
two directories and the next command
we're going to look at is CD and that's
changed directory so if we want to go
into der 1 we can say CD there are 1 and
you'll see that the prompt here is now
changed shows us where we are if we do
PWD it will show us or in directory 1 ok
now if we want to go back one level back
into the home we can do CD space dot dot
and so you can see now we're back in the
home ok if you want to navigate to the
absolute root of your system you could
do CD and then slash and now if we do LS
you'll see we're in the the actual root
of the entire system all right if you
want to go back home you could just do
CD and that will bring you back home you
can also do CD and then this this tilde
which is the key that's to the left of
the number one key and that basically
represents home so we can do that if we
want to go into dirt too let's say in
the home we could do from anywhere we
could do the tilde slash dirt ooh
okay if we want to go back out ago CD
dot dot and then let's go back into door
one ok another helpful command is clear
we do clear it'll just do just battle to
clear out the terminal alright so you
know how to find your path you know how
to create directories how to list the
content how to change directories that's
very basic now what we're going to do is
I'm going to show you how to create a
file so let's say we want to create a
text file we could use the touch command
so we say touch we'll say file one dot
txt and now if we do an LS you can see
we have that file one now if we want to
edit that file of course you could do
that from within your file manager so
you could just go to file one dot txt
and I think yeah it will open with G
edit if you open it here but you can
also use command based command line
based text editors so the one that I
would recommend for for our beginners is
Nano okay it's very easy to use now if
we say Nano file one dot txt it's going
to bring us into a screen like this so
this is the Nano editor and like I said
it's pretty easy to use basically we
could just let's just say hello world
okay now if we wanted to exit out we
want to do a control X and then it's
going to ask if we want to save or not
okay so we're going to say y for yes and
then enter and then that will edit the
file and save it okay so control X to
escape yes or no to save okay and you
won't get prompted if you don't edit it
at all you won't get prompted to save or
not now you can also use the cat command
to see what's in a file so we'll say cat
file one dot txt and it'll show us
what's in it it basically takes the
input and puts it to standard output
which is what's shown here now if this
is a really really long file and you'll
have to page down you can use less
instead of cat so file 1 dot txt and you
could you'd be able to page down ok and
see the whole file and then to get out
of it you just want to hit Q and that
will quit okay so that's cat and less
now let's say we want to rename this
file okay so there's a command to move
files and rename and that's MV so if we
say MV file 1 dot txt and space file 2
dot txt
okay and then we do an LS you can see
that file 1 has now been renamed to file
2 and if we say cat file 2 dot txt and
see it's the hello world now we can also
copy file so let's say we want to take
file 2 and create file 1 but also keep
file 2 then we could do CP ok that's the
copy command file 2 dot txt and we want
to copy it to file 1 dot txt and now if
we look at the content so we have both
files and if we say cat file 1 hello
world
ok so let's clear this out
now we can move and copy to other
locations as well so if we want to let's
say copy file 1 dot txt we want to copy
it to let's say tilde for the home and
then slash der to slash file 1 dot txt
okay and then we'll switch directories
let's say CD dot dot and then CD der -
well CD there are two and LS and there's
the file 1 ok so we can do that as well
now if you want to delete a file or a
move a file you can use the RM command
ok so let's say we want to delete file
one we can say RM file 1 dot txt and now
if we look now it's gone
all right now if you want to remove a
directory let's go out to our home and
let's say we want to remove directory -
we can do RM dir dirty - okay so now if
we do LS directory - is now gone now I'm
going to put it back we're going to make
directory there are two and then I'm
going to go into it and I'm going to
create a file so touch file 1 dot txt
and I'm going to go back out to my route
and I'm going to try to delete Ghaderi -
and now you see it says failed to remove
their two directories not empty so this
command isn't going to work if the
directory is empty if it's if it has
files in and you want to delete it you
want to use RM but if you just do RM
door - it'll say can't remove it so you
need to add the - capital R option which
is for recursive so you want to do
RM - R and then dirt - and now if we do
an LS there - is gone as well as all the
files that are in it so let's clear that
out and then
and I want to look at is which so what
which does is it'll search for a file or
a folder location and give you that
location so let's do say we want to look
for the Mongo D application which is the
MongoDB server we could say which Mongo
D and that will show you exactly where
it's in it's in the the USR bin Mongo D
ok so that can come in pretty handy so
what else let's say let's use the
history command and history will
basically show you your last was at 500
or so 400 well I think it's your last
500 commands ok so that's that can be
handy see what you've been doing or see
what someone else has been doing let's
see what else so we went over pretty
much all the basics of you know moving
files and folders around and deleting
them and renaming them so those those
are the most important those are the
things that you absolutely need to know
now some things you can't run as your
user you have to run it as the root user
and you never want to be really you know
messing around with stuff logged in as
the root user so for that you could use
sudo so let's try to run for instance
apt-get update which I'll go over in a
minute
it's not going to let us basically it
says that we don't have the permission
to so if we do sudo apt-get update it's
going to ask for our password and then
it will run it ok
and that's just updating our packages
and I'll get to that in a second so you
want to use sudo to run run as root
let's clear this out now let's look at
some system commands so these are you
don't need these to be able to navigate
or anything but they're good to know so
first one is ifconfig and this is just
like IP config on Windows basically it's
going to give you all your network
information your Ethernet card
your IP address your local IP address
your loopback things like that pretty
much identical to IP config in Windows
if you've ever used that for wireless
you can do IW config and that's going to
show you I don't have any wireless on
this machine but if you did it would
show you that stuff okay um now if you
want to ping another machine or over the
either over the internet on your local
network you could say ping for instance
let's say google.com to see if that's
online you can see we're getting a
record getting a response back from our
request okay and it's just going to keep
going like this but if you want to stop
it you can do a control C okay so if we
try to ping something that's most likely
not a domain you'll see we get unknown
host okay so that's how you can tell if
you can actually reach a certain machine
or not okay so let's look at some other
system commands let's say we have you
name do you name - a that's going to
just basically give us a summary of our
system the operating system the version
things like that okay we also have let's
- BLD do
I'm sorry blk ID and what that does is
basically shows us our hard drive so I
have a and my regular hard drive and
then what's called a swap okay so when
Linux partitions you drive it puts a
little bit aside for a swap file here
let's see what else if we do top that's
another command that's basically going
to show us our processes and how much
memory and CPU they're taking out things
like that I'm kind of like the task
manager in Windows even though there is
a system monitor right here that you can
use in Linux as well and that will show
you a resources stuff like that the
running process is okay and to get out
of this you just want to hit Q
let's see what else those that I wanted
to DF is another command that'll show us
our available and unavailable disk space
we have LS USB which will show devices
like USB hubs things like that for PCI
stuff you can use LS PCI and I will show
you all that crap a lot of which I don't
even understand but it's available to
let's see I think that that's pretty
much it
whole package managers packages manages
are our big part of most Linux
distributions different distributions
use different managers W in a bun to use
as apt-get so we can say sudo apt-get
and then install and then we can install
any package that's available so let's
say we want to install FileZilla which
is an FTP client ok so as long as it's
available
it'll go ahead and install that for us
on our system alright and now if we go
to up here and we search for FileZilla
there it is ok and we can move it over
here if we want and it's as easy as that
which is much easier than you know in
Windows having to go to the site
download it go through the Installer
this is one of the the best reasons to
use Linux now if we want to get rid of
it we could simply do sudo apt-get
remove FileZilla and that will host say
yes and that will remove it you can see
it just disappeared okay now if you want
to update or see if there's available
updates for packages on your system you
can do sudo apt-get update and it will
run through and check everything and if
it finds something it will let you know
so I think that's pretty much it guys
umm I don't want to get too deep into
anything he has just meant to be just
for you know a beginner guide we also
have the shut
on command it's a pseudo shutdown and if
you want it to restart you could do a
dash R but I'm going to halt shut the
whole thing down so I'm going to do dash
H and then you can also set a time if
you want to do like 10 minutes you could
do that but I'm just going to do now
okay and it's going to go ahead and shut
down so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
and if you did and you not subscribe
please do so if you feel like it if you
liked it leave a like if you didn't you
can leave a dislike and that's it thanks
