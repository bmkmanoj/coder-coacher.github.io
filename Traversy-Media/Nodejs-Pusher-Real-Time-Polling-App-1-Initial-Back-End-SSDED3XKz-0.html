gonna be building a full stack real-time
polling application and what I mean by
real-time is there's no need for
refreshing the browser you're gonna see
the votes or the results as they come in
and we're gonna be using canvas j/s on
the front end to display the results and
a chart
now we will be using quite a few
different technologies we'll build the
back end with nodejs and Express and
we'll be using a service or an API
called pusher for the real-time
subscriptions basically when a vote is
submitted to the server through the form
pusher is gonna trigger a response and
it's gonna update the front-end which
will be in vanilla JavaScript and it
will then we'll see what we'll see that
reflected in the chart all right so you
could use something like react or
angular in the front-end but this is a
good example of an application where you
don't need a front-end framework okay
unless you're gonna add a lot more stuff
to it the way it is now there's really
no need to add a framework it would just
add bloat to the application now I'm
gonna break this up into at least two
videos maybe more depending on how long
it takes but first I want to implement
everything to make it a real-time
application where we'll be able to
submit votes and see them as they come
in but when we refresh the page
everything will go away in the browser
because the data won't be persisted
alright so once we get that initial
functionality then I want to move on and
add MongoDB and Mongoose so that we can
actually persist the votes to a database
so when we enter the application we can
see all the votes that are already there
alright so if I were to reload this
you'll see the votes are there because I
already have them persisted to the
database okay so let me just give you a
quick demo I have two tabs open and
these are basically two different
clients if this was live this could be
somewhere in I don't know your upper and
this could be somewhere in Massachusetts
in the US and if I were to vote let's
say Linux
we'll give Linux some love and say vote
it goes up from three to four and it
also goes up over here so anyone viewing
the application is going to see that
change as well they're not going to have
to reload their browser okay which is a
very powerful thing and you can see if I
go to em laughs which is what we'll be
using for MongoDB it's basically just a
remote Mongo database you can see all
the different votes here okay and each
vote has an ID and ID is added by
default and then it has an OS and points
okay and we can change points if we want
but I'm just going to leave it set to
one for each each vote okay so let's see
what else do we want to look at pusher
pusher is not actually let's go to the
pusher home page first
so pusher is not a polling service or
anything like that
polling is just what I chose to do with
it but it's just it's just used to build
real time applications so chat chat
rooms things like that and is those are
good ideas for real-time apps data
analytics stuff like that and as far as
pricing goes for free you'll get a
hundred max connections and two hundred
thousand messages per day okay so a
message is basically just a like a
subscription or a a triggered response
from your server in our case it'll be a
vote so 200 thousand per day for free if
you were to deploy this make this a
production application that actually had
traffic then you'd want to pay more okay
or do you want to pay something just
like with any other service same thing
with M lab or Heroku all of these
services they give you a certain amount
of whether it's data or bandwidth or
requests they give you a certain amount
and then once you pass that threshold
you have to pay okay so it's great for
testing and learning and developing so
that's what we'll be building guys let's
go ahead and get into it now you're
going to want to create an account with
pusher it's completely free to sign up
you can sign up with github which is
what
I did and then once you're signed up you
can go to your dashboard now I already
have an app created so you're looking at
the dashboard for that and it shows you
the total messages the total connections
you've had for the day stuff like that
but I'm gonna start from scratch because
I want you guys to be able to follow
along so I'm gonna go to your apps and
create a new app all right so you should
be following along if you want if not
just you can just watch but we're gonna
call this pusher poll that's gonna be
the name of the app and then we can
choose our front-end technology so we
can use Android angular iOS backbone
JavaScript jQuery or react okay I'm
going to choose JavaScript for the
backend tech I'm gonna choose nodejs but
as you can see this is not limited to
JavaScript you can use Python PHP even
specific frameworks like Django symphony
so it's it's very powerful and very
diverse so right here you just just ask
you what you're building I'll say
real-time polling app and create and
there we go so now we have a new app
created this is our dashboard and then
it gives you an example of just a very
bare-bones implementation on the back
end we're using nodes so we want to
install the pusher module and then just
initialize it you want to make sure you
use your own app data here your ID and
secret key all that stuff and then when
we want to send a or trigger a response
we use pusher dot trigger and then on
the front end when we want to catch it
we subscribe to it like this push your
dot subscribe okay so we don't really
have to do anything else here this is
just our dashboard if we go to overview
again you'll see all your connections
and stuff like that but we can close
this up for now and get started with our
application okay so what we're gonna do
is create a new folder I'm gonna create
mine in my Dropbox code prod and I'm
gonna create a new folder here called
pusher pull and we're gonna open that
with vs code you can use whatever text
editor you want of course but I'll be
using vs code I'll also be using the
integrated terminal which if you hit
ctrl or command backtick that'll open I
also have github our git bash integrated
with my terminal here alright so let's
go ahead and generate a package.json
file with NPM in it and we'll just go
through this real quick well quick
description I'll say real-time polling
app and entry point I'm gonna use app J
s see author feel free to put your own
name license I'm gonna say MIT okay but
you can put whatever you want doesn't
really matter all right now we need to
install some dependencies so I'm gonna
clear this out and we're gonna do NPM I
our install we want to Express we want
body parser because we're gonna be
handling a form submission we need to
get the data so body parser is used for
that we also want pusher and we also
want korres because i want people from
other domains to make room to be able to
make requests without having issues
alright so i think let's also add
mongoose we won't be using it till later
but we might as well add it so those are
the main dependencies now we're going to
install one more as a dev dependency and
that's node mon so that we can
constantly watch our applications so
we'll say npm i - - save - dev - make it
a dev dependency and then node mon okay
and we're gonna create two scripts in
our npm file as well or a package.json
file so we can get rid of this test and
let's say start so this will be the main
start script which will be node app dot
j s so that's for like deployment your
your standard start and then we'll do a
dev script which will use node
on so we'll say node Mon app dot je s
and node Mon we'll make it so that we
don't have to keep refreshing our
application our back-end so let's save
this and that should be good now what
we're going to do is create our App J's
file and let's go ahead and open that up
and we're gonna start off just building
a basic Express server so let's bring in
Express I'll say Const Express equals
require Express and you guys will bring
in some other stuff as well the path
module is included with nodejs it's just
to deal with file paths we're gonna use
it to to declare the public folder now
for the front-end you could build it
anywhere I want to keep everything in
the same push or pull folder so we'll be
building it inside the public directory
but you don't have to we enabled cores
and you'll be able to actually make
requests from anywhere so you don't need
to do that but it's just for simplicity
okay and we're not using any kind of
template engine or anything like that
it's just going to be an HTML file with
some front-end JavaScript so we also
need body parser which again is for
getting the data from our form and we
also want cores for cross domain
functionality or authorization alright
now what we'll do is create our app
variable and set it to Express and next
thing we'll do is let's set our public
folder
so we do that by saying app dot use
Express dot static and then in here we
just want to reference the folder we
want to use here we're going to use the
path module and the join method and
we're just joining the current folder
which is under stubble underscore order
name and then we want that we want that
to go to the public folder all right so
basically current directory slash public
should be our static folder now under
that I'm just gonna do the body parse or
middleware this is just a couple lines
that you need to have if you're going to
use the body parser it's right in the
documentation as well so it's gonna be
apt dot use body parser dot jason and
then we also want app dot use body
parser dot URL encoded and we're gonna
pass in an object with extended and set
that to false all right so just standard
middleware and then we want to enable
cores you don't need the cores module
for this but if you if you didn't use it
you'd have to add that to the code
manually which is like I don't know five
or six lines of code by using the core
the cores module we can just do app dot
use and then pass in cores like that
alright so next thing we'll do is create
a port number I'll set that to three
thousand and then we want to be able to
start the server so we do that with app
dot listen pass in the port number and
we can put a call back or an arrow
function and then I'm just gonna send a
message to the console that says a
server started on port and I used back
ticks inside here so we can use this
syntax for our variable and that should
do it so we'll save it and now what I'm
going to do is create the public folder
and create an index.html file okay now
we're gonna finish the backend first but
I just want to make sure that the the
front-end loads the index page loads so
in this file let's use Emmet will do
exclamation tab which will give us our
head body tags and inside the title here
let's say push or pull and then we'll
put an h1 here and let's say OS vote and
that's it for now
I just want to make sure this loads so
we'll save this and it should load
because it's index.html and it's in the
public folder and we don't have a
specific route set in our app J s so it
should work so let's go down here and
say npm run dev let's see oh I already I
have something running on three thousand
let me just cancel that real quick all
right so let me see should work oops
should work now hopefully yep all right
so it's running on three thousand so
let's open up a browser I'm just gonna
go like that and we'll go to localhost
3000 and there we go so it's loading the
index.html file from the public folder
which is what we want so like I said
we're gonna do the back end first which
isn't going to be too difficult
especially since we're not implementing
Mongoose or anything like that yet but
what I want to do is anything that has
to do with pusher or with our poll I
want to put in a separate file so we're
going to use the Express router so what
we'll do is create a folder in the root
called routes and we're gonna have a
file in there called pull dot Jas okay
and then let's go back to our App J's
file and let's include that so we'll
just go right under here and let's say
Const pull equals require it's gonna be
dot slash it's in the same folder it's
in the same root directory and then in
routes and then pull okay and then to be
able to use that with the router we're
gonna go down to the bottom right before
the port and let's say Const
I'm sorry not constant app dot use and
we want to say anything that goes to the
slash pol URL is going to reflect in the
pull file okay which we just set right
here alright so we'll save that and then
we'll go to our pull j/s now it's going
to give us an error because it's telling
us yeah we haven't set up the router yet
so let's go into Polje s and inside here
what we'll do is first bring in Express
because we need to use the Express
router
all right and then we're gonna create
our router so router equals Express dot
rotor and let's go ahead and set up I'll
say router dot get for the slash now
since we're in the pull routes file when
we do a slash that actually means if we
go over here that actually means slash
pull okay because in the app J s that's
what we set anything set to slash pull
will reflect in the pol file and slash
will actually mean slash pol so we'll
put in our arrow function here and every
route should have a request and response
passed in and then let's just put in
here res dot send for now and we'll just
say I don't know pull and then if since
we're using the router we have to export
it with module dot exports equals router
and save and now let's go to slash pull
get requests and you can see we get that
sent to the browser all right
so later on what will happen here is
will fetch from the database all of our
polls and we'll send a JSON response to
the front end but for now that's fine so
when we submit our form okay so this
page will have a form and it's going to
make a post request to slash poll so
what we can do is say router dot post to
handle our post request it's going to be
- slash poll but remember we're in the
polls route files so it's just gonna be
slash here
and then we're gonna just pass in here
request/response and then this is where
we actually want
whoops we actually want to trigger
pusher so if we go back to our pusher
dashboard which is here and let's see is
this the right application no all right
so if we go to our pusher dashboard and
we go to get started let's go down here
we need to bring in pusher we need to
initialize it with our app data and then
do the trigger inside the post
okay so let's bring in pusher and we're
in the pull j/s file let's see so const
pusher equals require pusher and then
i'm gonna grab this here now you'll have
different app ID love a different ID key
secret all that stuff make sure you use
your own okay and then i'm gonna paste
that in there and then for the trigger i
guess i'll just go ahead and grab that
so when the forms submitted its gonna
hit this route and then we're gonna call
pusher dot trigger but we don't want to
use my channel i'm not going to use that
so let's put in here OS - pol and then
instead of my event let's use OS - vote
and then we don't want to send a message
that says hello world what we want to
send is the points and the actual vote
or the OS so let's do points and i'm
just gonna put a 1 here and then the OS
is gonna come from the forum which we
can get from request dot body dot OS
okay because we're using the body parser
and then as far as what we're going to
return it's just going to be a jason
we're gonna say res dot
Jason and pass in here will say success
true and we'll put a message which will
be a string that says thank you for
voting alright and that's it so we'll
save that and up until we start to work
with the database this should be it for
the back end okay so now what we'll do
is in the front end the index.html let's
finish up the UI here which is pretty
simple we do want to use materialized
CSS so I'm gonna just go and search for
materialized CSS comm get started and
we're gonna grab the stylesheet the CDN
here and let's put that in the head
right there and then the JavaScript will
grab that script put that right above
the the ending body tag now materialized
also needs jQuery so I'm going to search
for the jQuery CDN and we're gonna grab
the uncompressed version doesn't really
matter and just grab the script tag make
sure you put it above the materialized
okay so if we save that and we go back
to our front-end you can see that the
it's changed a little bit now I want to
wrap everything in a container alright
so we'll go ahead and bring this h1
let's bring that up here and then we're
gonna put a paragraph and we're just
gonna say vote for your favorites OS to
develop on
and then we need some options so we're
gonna put in a form gonna give it an ID
of let's say vote - form and we don't
need an action get rid of that alright
and then inside the form let's put every
every radio button inside a paragraph
I'm just gonna make this smaller
actually let me make sure yeah okay so
everything's good on the back end so
inside the paragraph we're gonna put in
input and we're gonna give it a type of
radio and it's gonna have a name let's
say name is gonna be OS for all of them
ID for this one will be Windows and the
value for this will be Windows with a
capital W alright so underneath that we
want to have our label which will be for
Windows that should match the ID of the
input and we'll say Windows alright
let's save and see what it looks like so
far good so now what I'll do is take
this paragraph I'm just gonna make this
smaller so we'll take this paragraph and
we'll just go ahead and copy that down
three more times so should be four total
and let's change the ID here - Mac OS
change the value to Mac OS
that and that and then this one here
will be Linux value should be uppercase
that's what's actually going to be put
in the database let's see let's just say
Linux distro meaning that whether
they're using a bun - or mint or
anything they can choose this option and
then the last one will be other all
right and for the text I'm just gonna
say something else for should be other
alright so those are our options now
let's put in an input with the type of
submit and the value will be vote and
let's give it a class of BTN to make it
look good and save reload and there we
go there's our form now as far as the
HTML the only other thing we need is a
container for the chart so I'm gonna go
below the form and just put in a couple
line breaks and then under that I'm
gonna have a div with the ID of chart
container and we're also gonna give it a
style and that will be a height of 300
pixels
oops 300 pixels and then let's do a
width of 100% so 100% and that should be
good okay so that that's where our chart
will go nothing's going to show up yet
because we need to have to initialize it
in the JavaScript now there's a couple
things we need to add here in our
scripts we need to add the CDN for
canvas j/s as well as the CDN for pusher
on the
and all right so we're gonna search for
pusher CDN and this first option here
from CDN je s we'll grab right here
pusher Minjae s I'm gonna copy the
script tag and we're gonna put that
right under the materialized script and
then let's also search for canvas je s
CDN and we're gonna grab the canvas min
script tag and put that right here okay
and then we're gonna have our own
JavaScript file on the front end as well
so let's put in script source and we'll
call it main dot J s so let's save that
and let's create that file so in public
we need a main dot J s file all right
and this is where all of our jobs our
client-side JavaScript is going to go
now this video is getting kind of long
so I think I'm gonna go ahead and stop
it here now that we have our back-end
pretty much done until we're dealing
with the database and then our front-end
UI is done all of our scripts are
connected now we just want to write our
client-side JavaScript so we'll do that
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
