storage features it has two api's we
have local storage and session storage
and they have basically been a
replacement for JavaScript cookies it's
a faster more secure way to store data
locally in the users browser and the
only difference between local and
session is that session storage will go
away as soon as your session ends or as
soon as the browser's closed local
storage doesn't have an expiration date
it will basically be there until the
user gets rid of it all right and
they're actually just key value pairs
all right so it's very easy and I've
made something real quick here we have a
form and we have we can set a key and a
value and store it in local storage
all right so for instance let's say
first name will be the key Brad will be
the value we save that you can see it
pops up over here let's put in a last
name okay so if we save it and now if we
go ahead and reload that's gonna stay
there and it's gonna stay there until
the user gets rid of it all right so
this is what we're gonna be building and
if you're using Google Chrome you can
use the the if you hit f12 you can use
the chrome tools and if we go to
resources you'll see this column over
here we have a local storage area we can
look at so let's click on that actually
you know what I think we using session
storage yeah all right so we're using
session storage here you can see that we
have the key and the value all right so
if we add something else say age 30 to
save
well I guess it doesn't show up right
away oh yeah here it is
all right age 32 all right so that's
what we're gonna be doing so let's um
I'm gonna create a new file and this is
going to be just one HTML file that's it
all right so I'll call this web storage
and we want that to be HTML so create a
file called web storage HTML all right
now I want to open this in sublime text
you can use whatever editor you would
like all right and let's open up this in
the browser all right so now we have a
clean slate to work with so we want to
just create our HTML shell so we want
the dark-type doctype is going to be
just HTML we're using html5 HTML tags
let's get those out of the way
one head area you know just give it a
title just to look a little neater I
will call it html5 web storage alright
and we want to put our javascript up
here as well so let's open up some
script tags let's see alright so let's
go ahead and create the form we want our
we want some body tags of course alright
so in here we want let's create a
section this is an html5 element and
we'll give it an ID of we'll just give
it an ID of box all right because this
is going to be just the box that the
form is enclosed in alright animals
close that tag section and then inside
here let's create a form
all right and our form tag doesn't even
action or type or anything like that
let's see put each field inside of
paragraph text and call this one the key
and I'm gonna give it a line break and
then the input so input type is gonna be
text
let's see type is text the ID we'll call
key okay all right so that looks good
um let me strip just open a little more
that's a little easier to read alright
so next we want the value so I'm gonna
just copy this paste that in and we'll
change this to the value in the ID as
well
okay value now what we want is an input
button a Save button so we're going to
let's see get rid of this and the type
here is going to be submit submit and
let's see it will give it an ID of just
button and then the value the text we
want the button to say will just be
submit all right so let's go ahead the
code make sure you close the form and
then after the section we need to create
another section where we want our data
to be displayed so this will be section
ID equals say display data
all right so that's good that's really
it for the HTML let's go ahead and save
it and take a look all right so we
haven't added any CSS so what I'm gonna
do is just paste in some CSS because
it's not really the goal of this video
so we're gonna put this right in the
head
all right so very basic CSS we just have
the box give it a width we're going to
Center it with margin Auto and then our
text area of text box will have a width
of 97% 5 pixel radius so let's save that
alright so now we have a form and right
now obviously nothing's been gonna
happen if we submit it all right so we
need to add in our JavaScript to handle
all that and the first thing we want to
do is add in we need to have an event
listener to listen for our click alright
and you can do this with jQuery as well
but I'm just going to use regular
JavaScript in this in this video so
let's create a function and I'm just
gonna call it do first because we want
this to run before we actually save the
data alright so in here we're going to
create a variable called button and that
will be equal to the button we have so
we'll say doc
documents was a document dot get element
by ID all right so obviously that's
going to do exactly what it says it's
going to grab it by the ID and we gave
it an ID of button you just verify that
so input ideas buttons all right so that
this is how we're grabbing this button
all right and then under here we're
gonna say button dot add eventlistener
sorry I can't really type and talk at
the same time listener alright and we're
gonna listen for a click you need to
click event and let's see when that when
it's clicked we want it to call the save
we'll just call it save function and
then we want to put in false here
alright and then we want to run our
display function which we have to create
alright so that's what that's gonna do
now under here we're going to add the
atom add the event listener to the
window so window dot add event listener
and this is when it loads alright so I
want to say load and we're gonna call do
first false right so now this is going
to be called first and we want to run
the sate we need to create the save
function now all right so right here
we'll say function save and we want to
grab the key and the value we can do
that with the get element by ID function
so let me copy that and let's change
this here to key and it's going to get
by the ID of key and then value okay and
we're gonna grab that we're gonna grab
the item with value for an ID and let's
see we want we want to set the item the
key value pair using session storage so
I'm going to say session storage dot set
item
and then we're gonna put in here key
value alright so this this here is the
API this is what sets it this one line
so really easy to work with all right so
let's see after that we want to call
display with yourself to create and then
we want it to clear we want the input
boxes to clear so we're gonna set key
I'm gonna say key dot value is going to
be equal to nothing okay we want to do
the same with the value value dot value
is equal to nothing
all right so that's the save function
this is really the heart and soul of it
this one line it's gonna save our object
now we need to display just all function
display and first thing we want to do is
get we see this display data section all
right we want to put that into a
variable so say variable display data
display data is going to be equal to
document
get element by ID display data alright
so that puts it into a variable for us
well
then what we want to do is set it we
want to set it blank all right so I'm
gonna say display data dot innerhtml
is equal to nothing all right
now what we want to do is we need a loop
so that we can loop through each key
value and I'll put that in the display
and we're going to use a for loop all
right so what we're going to say here is
we're going to set a variable I will say
variable I is equal to 0 all right then
we need a semicolon and then we want to
say as long as I as long as I is less
than session storage dot length all
right and we're going to increment that
by 1 so I plus plus so it's a very
standard for loop if you know JavaScript
then this is should be quite easy to
understand so we're basically just
looping through them all and help
putting them onto the screen all right
so we need to create we need to get the
key from inside this function so I'm
going to get create a variable called a
and equal that to session storage
dot key and then we want to put the I
variable in here right and that will be
replaced with whatever the the number
had that through that iteration so a
variable B will be equal to session
storage what session storage dot get
item all right so this is how you can
get items and we want to put in here a
the key okay and then finally we want to
set this we want this to display so
we're gonna say display data dot
innerhtml is going to be equal to look
alright it's going to be equal to
actually you know what we set it to
nothing up here so we actually need to
append down here so we're going to say
plus equals which will append instead of
over right all right so what we're going
to put here is a we want the variable a
we actually want to get rid of these
quotes for now I'm going to say a and
then we want to concatenate a string
because we need a dash in between a and
B so we want to concatenate the quote
the quote with the - like this and then
we want to go back to JavaScript and we
want our be variable and then we want to
again concatenate on a br tag alright so
say BR right so that's what this is
doing its gonna display the key which is
the variable a and then the value which
is the variable B alright and that
should be good
the last thing we want to do we need to
create a clear link all right I don't
think we put that in yet so down here
still in the form after the Save button
I'm going to create a link and what
this is going to be equal to JavaScript
okay I'm gonna say JavaScript clear it
well just clear all right so what this
link is gonna do is call the clear
function when it's clicked will say
clear items
all right so now the last thing we need
to do is to create that clear so
function clear and let's see what this
is going to do is just run the clear the
clear method in the session storage API
so session storage dot clear and then we
want to reload we want to reload the
page so say location dot reload all
right so that looks good let's save this
and test it out okay so we'll say first
name Brad
all right so we have an issue here it's
it's outputting is this object HTML
input element let's just check that out
real quick it's coming from here
Oh up here we define the key and value
this needs to be the actual value right
so we want to add that on to the end of
these we don't want the element itself
we want the value in the element to be
stored in these variables so let's save
that and reload here now let's clear it
and reload and we'll try this again
there we go
all right so it looks good clear works
alright so that's that's pretty much it
the most important thing to remember
about this is this how to set the item
set the key and the value and then how
to retrieve it which is session storage
get item in this example we're doing it
in the loop but you can store single
values and retrieve single single key
value pairs as well alright so that's it
