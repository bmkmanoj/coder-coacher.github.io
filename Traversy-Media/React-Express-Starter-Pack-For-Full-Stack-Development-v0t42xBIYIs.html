hey what's going on guys so in this
video we're gonna create a react and
Express starter pack because I've been
getting a lot of questions lately mostly
from new developers asking me how to
integrate a front-end react application
with a back-end Express app and I
figured that I'd create something that
made it easy to get started with so I'm
gonna show you that but I'm not just
gonna show it to you we're gonna create
it from scratch so you can see exactly
how we can integrate the two together in
an elegant way so basically all we have
to do to get started with this is clone
it or download it install the
dependencies for the server-side with
NPM install and then I have a script to
install the react dependencies and then
we can simply run npm run dev and that
will actually run the client and server
at the same time and we're able to do
that because we're using a small module
called concurrently and that allows us
to have multiple commands inside of one
npm script so it's gonna run the server
and client at the same time so before we
get started creating this i'm just gonna
show you how to grab it and use it for
your projects now you don't have to
follow along with this part i'm just
gonna give you an example so i'm gonna
copy the git link right here you can
also download the zip if you want but
i'm just gonna go ahead and clone it so
let's see i mean my projects folder i'm
gonna get clone and then paste in that
link and then it's gonna create a folder
called react express starter so I'm
gonna CD into react Express starter by
the way I'm using Linux Ubuntu 1710 if
you're wondering but it doesn't matter
if you're on Windows or Mac it's it's
the same thing same steps so now we're
just gonna do NPM install and that will
just go ahead and install Express and
any dependencies Express needs and then
once that's done we'll go ahead and say
NPM run client install which as you can
see it just CD into the client folder
and then it runs NPM install so it
installs all the dependencies for react
and when we create this we're going to
use the create react app CLI alright so
once this is done we should be able to
just simply run NPM run dev and it
should start both the client and the in
the backend which is nice and I think
you've got you guys that don't know how
to do this we'll find that it's it's
actually a lot easier than you thought
so let's do NPM run dev that should
start up both and it's gonna open up and
there we go so we have I'm using the
basic layout that create react app gives
you now these customers here these are
actually coming from our back-end so if
I go to another tab here and I go to
HTTP localhost 5,000 slash API slash
customers you'll see those three
customers okay so this is coming from my
Express server so we have both running
and they also have a Campari act
component that I created sorry about
that guy's called customers and it's
it's pulling it from our API okay so
we're just using the fetch API to grab
these so I'm going to show you how to do
that how to create it how to create the
react component how to interact with the
API and all that so that's all be doing
in this video guys hopefully you enjoy
it and let's go ahead and get started
alright guys so I completely scrapped
what we just did I just wanted to give
you an example of how we could pull it
up the package and use it so now we're
gonna start from scratch so I'm in my
projects folder here in my terminal I'm
gonna just go ahead and create a new
directory and I'm gonna call it react
Express and then we're gonna see the
into react Express and from here let's
open up visual studio code in this
directory by just saying code dot and
you can use whatever term whatever text
editor you want okay I'm gonna use my
integrated terminal you can get to this
by going to view integrated terminal or
you can use control tilde to toggle it
all right so let's create a package dot
JSON file with NPM in it so package name
that's good version description will
just say boilerplate for react and
Express entry point I'm gonna use server
dot Jas and let's see author I'm gonna
put my name but you can of course use
your own this is open source I'll give
it an MIT license and everything should
be good let's get rid of this so this is
our package dot JSON file now I just
want to get the dependencies out of the
way so we're gonna do NPM I Express
we're going to install Express and
concurrently alright we're not gonna use
concurrently until the end but I figure
we'll just install everything now and
then the only other thing that I want to
install is node Mon and I'm gonna
install that as a dev dependency so - -
save - dev and for those of you that
don't know what node Mon is it's
basically just it'll run your
application and constantly watch it for
development so that you know when you
make changes it updates all right so
let's clear that up and then in this
package JSON file I just want to add a
couple scripts for now so I want to add
a start script which is just gonna call
node
and then the main file which is server
che s and then I'm also gonna have a
server script which is gonna use node
lon
so node lon server dot J s so that's it
for now let's save this close that up
and let's go ahead and create a server
dot JS file and then we'll go ahead and
we'll open that file up alright so this
is gonna be a very very simple Express
server basically we want one route
that's going to return just an array of
customers so first thing we'll do here
is bring an Express so we want to
require Express and then we want to
create our App variable and initialize
Express and let's go ahead and and let's
create a port variable to listen on and
that's going to be 5,000 I wouldn't use
3,000 because that's the default for
create react app and that's the tool
we're using to generate our react
application so now let's just do app dot
listen on that port and we'll put in an
arrow function here oops
and let's just do a console dot log and
we'll just put in some backticks and
we'll say server started on ports and
then we use a template string and we'll
put the port variable alright so the
only other thing we need to do in here
is add the route so app dot get and the
route I'm gonna use is slash API slash
customers and let's put an arrow
function here and we're gonna need to
put our request and response and then
what I'm gonna do is just create a
variable called customers and we're
gonna just create a hard-coded array
here now in real life this would come
from a database but this isn't going to
be a full application this is just a
starter pack
and it's up to whoever is using it to to
take care of that I don't know if
they're gonna use MongoDB or MySQL or
postgrads or redness or something else
so we're just giving kind of an example
here with some hard coded data so we'll
do an ID let's say ID 1 and let's do a
first name first name John and last name
say Doe all right let's copy this we'll
do 3 customers and let's see we'll just
change up some data here so this will be
ID 3 for the name let's do Mary and
let's do last name Swanson I don't know
where I get these names Smith say Steve
Smith ID - all right so now we have our
customers and now all we need to do is
respond with Jason so res dot Jason and
I'm just gonna pass in customers and
that should do it so we'll save very
very simple server but again this is
just like a starter pack there's no
reason for us to really add anything
else to it now let's see if we can run
this with node I'm sorry not node NPM
run server ok so that worked because of
the script that we added right here so
this server that's what we're running
and it's actually running node Mon
server so let's go to our browser and
let's visit localhost 5000 API customers
and there we go so that's our three
customers so that's essentially our
back-end alright so now what we want to
do is create our react application so
close this stuff up now I'm gonna let
this server run and I'm going to open up
a new terminal so envious code I can
just hit plus and
we'll open up a new terminal and I still
have my server running here for the
Furyk's press alright so in the second
terminal what I'll do is first of all we
need to install create react app which
is the CLI for react so we'll say npm i
we want to install it globally and if
you're a react developer chances are you
probably already have this installed but
if not then just go ahead and run this
and you know what it's gonna give me an
error because I didn't do sudo because
I'm on Linux so I just gotta add sudo to
the beginning there alright alright so
now that we did that let's create our
react app with the command create react
app and we're gonna call it client so
that's gonna click create a client
folder inside of our directory here
alright guys so now that that is done
what we want to do is let's open up our
client folder on the side here and open
up package dot Jason now this is a
really important step because we need to
define our back-end and URL as a proxy
so in the package Jason we're gonna put
a comma here and we're going to define
proxy and we want to define our back-end
server which is HTTP localhost port 5000
now by putting this here we can actually
make request to our back-end without
having to include this inside of our for
instance our fetch request will just be
able to do fetch slash API slash
customers and it'll it'll know where to
go so it's very important to put this
here alright and that's all we need to
do in this file so let's see let's close
that make sure you save it close it up
and then let's CD into the client folder
here and let's run our react server so
we can do that with NP
start okay so what's going on here is we
just started the react server on 3000
and the back-end server is still running
in this terminal okay on 5,000 so we
have two separate terminals running two
separate servers one front end one
back-end alright we're not going to do
that concurrently and mash them together
until the end but what I want to do now
is in react I want to create a component
I'm sorry a customer's component and
integrate that or not integrate but
fetch the data from the backend alright
so let's go into the client folder which
is our react out into source and then
let's create a new folder called
components and then inside there I'm
going to create a new file or I'm sorry
a new folder called customers alright
and then in customers let's create a
file called customer zas and then I'm
also going to give this component its
own CSS file called customers dot CSS
okay so in this customers j/s
we need just the basic structure of a
react component so what I'll do is copy
app dot J S which is also a component
that's the root component so I'll copy
everything there and paste it in
customers J s and I'm gonna get rid of
this s this logo we don't need that and
then let's import customers dot CSS
which is the file we created and we're
going to change the class name to
customers inside of our render we want
to just get rid of everything inside the
div the main div here I'm also going to
get rid of the class name we don't need
that and then for the export we want to
make sure we explore default customers
all right and then in the div for now
I'm just gonna put in h2 I don't have my
Emmet set up for JSX
so I actually have to type it out which
sucks and in here we'll just say cost
we'll save this and we'll go to our main
app j/s so our main co-op component and
just replace this paragraph right here
with component by component customers
like that and of course we have to bring
that in so up here we're gonna say
imports customers from and that's gonna
be from let's see dot slash components
slash customers slash customers all
right so let's save that and go back to
our application and now you can see that
our customers component is being
embedded into our main app component all
right now I'm not I know I'm not
explaining everything about react I'm
assuming that you guys that are watching
this at least know the very basics of
react if not check out my crash course
on YouTube but basically we're just
embedding that component we haven't made
any calls to the backend yet so that's
what we're gonna do next
so in our customers j/s let's go ahead
and add a constructor here alright so
we're gonna add a constructor and this
is where we want to initialize our state
so we're gonna say this dot state equals
an empty and not an empty object but an
object with a customer's array which is
empty
alright we also have to call the super
function here because this is being
embedded into a parent component so
basically we just have our customers in
our state which is completely empty
right now so what we want to do is make
a request to our back-end and then fill
this customers with the data that's in
the backend
so we're going to use a lifecycle
function or a lifecycle method called
component did mount and that what this
does is it runs automatically when the
components mounted so in here we want to
make our fetch
so we're gonna say fetch and then we can
just do slash API slash customers now I
don't have to do HTTP localhost 5,000
because we put that proxy value in
inside the package dot JSON file so we
can do this whenever we want to access
any routes in our back-end all right now
with fetch we have to do it's going to
return a promise we got to do dot then
take the result and then map it to res
dot JSON and then we do another dot then
and that gives us our data so we'll call
it customers and I do have a fetch API
crash course as well so it's gonna give
us our customers from our back-end and
then what we want to do is put it inside
the state so we'll say this dot set
state and we want to do customers now
this is actually like this customers
customers but this is redundant so we'll
use our es6 style and just do customers
ok so again to reiterate we have our
empty customers array in our state and
then we're making our call to our
back-end and then when we get the result
there of the response which is gonna be
the customers we're setting our state
alright now set state you can actually
pass in a callback or an arrow function
in this case and we're just gonna do a
console dot log and put in let's say
customers fetched like that and then put
in another parameter and we'll actually
put in the customers that were fetched
so now we can test this out and see if
it actually grabbed the data so let's go
back to our application open up our
chrome tools our console and you can see
customers fetched and we have an array
with three values so these are being
pulled from our back-end
okay so reactant Express are completely
integrated they're still running on two
different terminals which
is an ideal and then we're gonna fix
that after but let's continue on and
let's output the customers in our
front-end application so to do that
we'll go down to the render and let's go
under the customers and we'll put in our
ul and in here we're going to take our
state we're gonna take the customers and
map and we'll say customer for each
customer we're going to output an Li and
each Li is going to have a key card I'll
complain
it'll bitch about not having a unique
key so we're gonna say K equals customer
dot ID and then inside the Li we're
going to say customer dot let's do first
name and then we'll do customer dot last
name
alright let's save that let's check it
out and there we go so these are
actually being pulled from Express
alright so I do want to style these a
little better because this looks
horrible so that's why I created that
CSS file so in here we're gonna put ul
we're gonna say list-style:none
padding:0 with 30% in margin auto
alright and then for the Li I'm gonna do
font size 1.3 REM and let's do a line
height
of to rem and let's do a border bottom
of one pixel dotted and then triple7
alright let's take a look at that and
that looks much better
alright so that's pretty much it guys we
have our data customers coming from
Express so the last thing I want to do
is make it so that we don't have to run
these two different terminals so this is
where it concurrently comes in so I'm
going to stop the front end application
with control C so this is in the client
folder I'll go to the server and ctrl C
and stop that and then let's go into our
servers package package dot JSON file so
right here with this is starting our
back-end server now instead of going to
into the client folder ourselves and
saying NPM start what we want to do is
create a client script and then we can
go and we can say CD into client and do
NPM start and that will start the react
server or we could do NPM start and then
just add - - prefix client and that'll
do the same thing so we're gonna keep
that and then what we want to do is do a
dev script and then this is going to use
concurrently so this I actually have to
look at because we have to escape we
have to use double quotes but we have to
escape them so I need to just see
exactly how this is yes so we need to do
concurrently back slash to escape colon
and then we're gonna do NPM run server
and let's do another back slash and then
quote and then we want to do our clients
so NPM run
client like that and then like that so -
it should be - on the end here so what's
happening is concurrently like I said it
runs more than one command from one
script so it's running both of these our
server and our client at the same time
so all we have to do now is run NPN run
run dev so let's test it out I'm gonna
clear this up and just say npm run dev
and there we go it starts both up and
you can see we're getting our customers
and if we go to localhost 5000 you'll
still see that that works as well
all right so that's that's pretty much
it I mean one other thing that I did for
the github package so that you didn't
have to go into the client and install
dependencies as I created a client
install script and for that I just did
CD client and NPM install so that way
you can install the react dependencies
without having to actually go into the
client folder yourself alright and
that's it
so hopefully this helped you guys out
that that were kind of confused on how
to you know mix react with express and
build a full stack application and you
know I would suggest using this this
little package it's very simple I'm sure
a lot of you guys are surprised at how
simple it is but feel free to you know
use the the the starter kit feel free to
actually add to it and make a push
request one thing I would like to do is
add Redux so if any of you guys want to
work on that and push to the repository
that would be cool it can be kind of a
community effort but that's it if you
liked this video please leave a like
please subscribe if you're not hopefully
you guys have a great new year it's New
Year's Eve just try not to get too drunk
definitely don't drive drunk
and have fun I have two kids so I will
be spending the the evening here
hopefully I can make it till midnight
but yeah thanks thanks for watching and
I will see you next year
