you how to use some of the built-in
template directives ng-if ng-switch and
ng4 alright so what I have here is just
a default QuickStart application if you
need to get the QuickStart you can get
it from this github page you can
download it or you can clone it we
cloned it in the second part of this
series so if you need to go back you can
do that alright so we're gonna just work
in the root app component that is
included by default and what we're gonna
do here is down in the class let's
create a constructor alright and let's
create a property
we'll say private and let's call this
show heading that's not that what I
doing alright so show heading and then
here we'll say this dot show heading set
that to true alright and then up here in
our template in the h1 we're gonna use
ng-if now the syntax is a little
different from angular 1 what you're
going to want to do is use the asterisk
and then say ng-if and then set it to in
this case show heading alright so if we
save that and we take a look you can see
that it's showing the heading if I go
down and I change this to false and save
now it's not ok so it's it's testing to
see if show heading is true or false
which were setting right here
alright very very easy so next thing I
want to show you is the switch statement
I'm just gonna set that back to true
alright so for the switch what I'm gonna
do is let's create a property and we'll
call it a name and then in here we'll
say this dot name equals John Doe all
right now up here in the template what
I'm gonna do is use backticks here so
that we can use multiple lines
all right and then let's see we're gonna
put a span and we want to use our ng
switch now the ng switch is actually
going to go in brackets all right and
then we're going to set that equal to
name now inside of here we're going to
use more span tags and this time we're
going to use a asterisk and say ng
switch when and then let's set that
we're going to put single quotes inside
the double quotes here because we're
using a string and let's say John Doe
all right and then inside the span we're
gonna say John Doe actually let's just
use first names say John there and there
and then down here we'll just say John
alright and then I'm gonna copy this
okay this one here we'll set to Sam and
this one we'll set to Jeff alright so
let's save that and run it and you can
see that we're getting John because what
it's doing is it's checking name alright
and it's saying when name equals John
then do this spit out John alright so if
I go down here and I change this to Sam
and save now we get Sam now what if we
changed to something that isn't even
there so let's say Mike alright so it's
not showing Mike because that's not one
of our cases so what we would usually do
is use a default all right so let's
paste that in and then change this to
switch
default and we can just get rid of this
totally in here let's just say not here
okay we'll keep this set as Mike and now
you can see we're getting not here
because it's it's default it's not John
Sam or Jeff all right so that's
ng-switch the final one that I want to
show you is ng4 and this is to tilt to
create a loop so what we'll do is create
an array up here let's say private
colors and in here we'll say this dot
colors equals red blue and green okay so
we have these colors and we want to
output each one of these so let's go up
here and I'm gonna put in a line break a
couple of them and we're going to create
in IUL and then we want to take the
element that we want to repeat so this
is going to be an ally that we want to
repeat and then we're going to say
asterisk ng4 and set that we're gonna
use the number sign and color of colors
all right and then in here we can say
color okay so you can put whatever you
use here you can use here and then this
color is is coming from the property
colors so let's save that and now if we
look you can see that it's looping
through the colors and outputting them
on the screen
all right so those are some of the
template directives that you can use in
the next video we're going to take a
look at pipes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
