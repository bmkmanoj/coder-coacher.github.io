coding video our series this may be a
couple videos and we're going to be
building a code igniter application code
igniter is a PHP framework it's an MVC
Model View controller framework and it's
been about two years or so since I've
used it so try to bear with me I may
make some mistakes that I may have to
fix hopefully guys like this type of
video I didn't really plan anything out
I have an idea of what I want to do I
just want to build a basic blog using
code igniter alright we're going to be
using code ignite of three initially I
was going to use version four but it's
so new that a lot of the documentation
hasn't been created or updated so I got
stuck so we're going to just go with
code igniter 3 for now alright so let's
go ahead and download it I'm at code
igniter calm if we click download and we
want code igniter 3 X so if we click
that and save alright and then we'll go
ahead and open that and we just want to
bring all this into our server ok now
i'm using xampp which is gives us an
apache server PHP mysql gives us all
that on our windows system and the
document root for xampp is going to be
in the c drive xampp and then htdocs
alright and of course you can use some
other type of server if you want now I'm
going to create a folder for this app
we're going to call it CI blog and let's
bring all that stuff over all right now
with code igniter all the main files are
in the application folder this is where
our entire MVC structure is we have
controllers models and views ok now I'm
going to open up sublime text and we're
going to add that as a folder to our
project alright and let's see what
happens if we go to http
localhost /ci blog alright so that
brings us to the code ignitor welcome
page and if we look in the file
structure and we look in controllers we
have this welcome dot PHP so this is the
the Welcome controller that a default
code ignitor installation gives us
alright so this is what's being set as
the root ok now if we were to go to
slash welcome or actually it has to be
for now index dot PHP slash welcome and
that brings us to the Welcome controller
as well all right now we want to get rid
of this index.php we want to just be
able to go to slash and then our
controller name so we're going to edit a
couple things let's go into config and
if we go to config PHP first of all
we're going to set our base URL all
right so that's going to be localhost
/ci blog and then we want to get rid of
this index.php okay we'll just clear
that out all right we're going to save
that alright now let's go over here and
try to go to slash welcome ok we're
still good object not found what we need
to do is create a dot htaccess file that
will allow us to redirect to just the
controller name so we're going to create
inside the root not in the application
folder but in the root new file and
we're going to save it as dot htaccess
and then I'm going to paste this in and
you can use this as a boilerplate for
all of your code ignitor applications
alright we're basically redirecting to
the controller but we do want these
files to be still these folders to be
static ok we want an assets folder
images Jas and CSS alright so let's go
ahead and save that
and now if we reload we now see our
welcome controller so any controller we
create we can go to here and then any
method in that controller we want to
all like say we have a post controller
and we want to call show and then when
we might want to pass in an ID as a
parameter so we could do that as well so
post show too so that's what we'll be
doing all right let's close that out and
let's create a pages controller in case
we want to add for instance an about
page your services what some some kind
of static page so we're going to create
a controller for that so when
controllers will say new file and we're
going to save it as pages dot PHP now a
good rule to follow is for your
controllers to keep them plural ok pages
and then for your models to keep those
singular so it will be a page controller
so page PHP now in here what we'll do is
let's add in the class which will be the
name of the controller pages and then we
want to say extends c i underscore
controller all right that's the main
controller that all of your controllers
have to extend all right and then let's
do public public function view and in
here it's going to get passed a page and
I want to set the default of that as
home so let's just save that for now and
then we're going to go into views and if
you look at the Welcome message view it
has the HTML tags the head tags all of
that and we don't want to have to put
that in every single view so we're going
to create a header and a footer file
that we can include in each view all
right so let's create a folder inside
views and we're going to call it
templates and we're going to create a
file called
header oops dot php' and let's also
create footer dot PHP all right now
inside header we'll put an HTML tag head
body and we'll put a title in here we'll
just say CI blog and that's it for now
so save that now in the footer we want
to close that body tag and we want to
close that HTML tag okay we'll save that
now let's go back to the controller
pages controller and inside the view
we're going to check to see if a view
exists of this page okay so let's do if
I'm going to say if not file exists and
then we'll pass in here our app path
okay that's a code in that a constant
that gives us the path to our
application folder and then we want to
concatenate onto that views / pages /
so we're going to concatenate that and
then dot PHP alright and then inside
here all we want to do is show an error
so we'll say show underscore 404 okay
which is a code ignitor function to load
a 404 error all right now under that
we're going to create a variable inside
of a data array called title alright and
this were the data array represents the
the data that are the variables that we
want to pass into the view so for a
title we're going to just use the page
okay but we want that to have a capital
letter to begin with so we're going to
use you see first we're going to wrap it
in that function alright and then we
want to load our views we want to load
the header we want to load the page in
the footer so we'll say this load this
load view and in here we want from the
templates it automatically looks in the
views folder
alright so templates header and then we
want to pass actually we don't need to
pass anything into that so let's copy
that this one down here will be the
footer and this one will be the page so
we want this to go to a full off folder
called pages and then we want the page
name so we're going to concatenate that
okay and then we want to pass along any
data that we put in that data array okay
which right now we just have the title
so let's go ahead and save that now if
we try to go to let's say /pages slash
you'll see we get a 404 error because
it's it's looking for about PHP inside
of the views pages folder it's not there
so we're getting a 404 so what we'll do
is go into views create a folder called
pages and let's create a file save it as
about dot PHP and we'll just say this is
about save that and let's see why isn't
that loading pages about
Oh actually know what it's it's pages
slash views or view slash about because
we want the pages controller but we want
the view method alright and then the
page so let's load that and we get this
is about if we look at the source code
we have the HTML and then we have that
we have it down here as well so we know
we're loading the header and the footer
all right so that's what we want so far
now it's for routing we don't want to
have to go to pages / view / about I
want to just be able to go to / about
all right so what we can do is go into
config and then go into routes dot PHP
and let's see I'm going to just get rid
of all this comment stuff we don't need
this and then we're going to go right
here we're going to say route and then
pass in some quotes and then parenthesis
and we want to say any so this is going
to get anything that we go to so see I
blog / anything alright and then we want
to set that to go to pages / view now
remember if we don't pass in a page such
as about it's going to call home by
default this right here home alright so
to look for home dot PHP and that's what
we're going to have to create alright so
let's go ahead and save that and then if
we try and go to just see I blog slash
about well that didn't work
oh you know what we got to put in pages
/ view / money sign 1 okay because that
represents anything so go ahead and
reload and now we get this is about
alright now if we just go to let's say
CI blog all right so it's still going to
welcome for our default controller and
we don't want that we want it to go to
pages / view alright now if I save that
and we reload we get page not found
because it's looking for home because
that's what gets passed in by default if
we don't provide a page so let's go to
views pages create a file and we'll save
it as home dot PHP and let's just say
this is home go back and now we get this
is home so this is our home page now we
can pass in or we did pass in the data
if we look at our pages controller okay
so right here we're passing along data
which we have the title so let's go to
about PHP and let's put in an h2 and
then here we're going to use this syntax
and we want title okay we'll save now if
we go to a boat we get a boat okay we're
passing that data variable in and it's
just extracting the title variable from
it and we can use that anywhere in our
view alright if we go back to the home
page we still have this as home because
we didn't include the title on that if
we were to do that
we're going to get home alright but I
don't actually want it to say home I
don't want this on this page I do want
it on the about alright so for now we'll
just leave that alright so now that we
have our basically our static routing
system I want to make this look a little
better I also want some navigation so
we're going to use bootstrap alright I'm
going to use a custom bootstrap template
from boots watch okay so you can choose
from any of these and we're just going
to grab let's grab this flatly alright
so if I click download I'm going to just
grab the link here feel free to grab the
whole file and download it but I'm just
going to grab the link and then we'll go
to header and we'll provide the link
here ok we'll paste it in save it and
now bootstrap is in effect
alright so let's grab let's put in a
navbar in the header that way it shows
on every single page now I'm going to
paste this in there's going to be some
stuff that I pasted in just to save time
but basically just have a very simple
navbar we have a brand or logo of CI
blog and let's just make that go to the
home page and then we have a home link
and about link
okay so let's save that okay so there's
our navbar if I click a boat oh you know
what that's taking us to localhost /
about so what we need to do is provide
the base URL and we can do that in code
ignitor by saying PHP echo base
underscore URL
and that should bring us to the home
page and then down here let's let's copy
that and then put that in here and then
slash about all right let's try that
does that not work anymore
let's see Toth igniter baseurl
oh you know what we did we need to
enable the URL helper all right so with
code igniter there's different things
there's helpers
there's libraries there's other types of
elements too and we need to load those
if we want to use them okay there's a
form helper there's an HTML helper so we
could load it right in our controller or
we can load it globally so we're going
to do globally so if we go to config and
then auto load PHP here's all the stuff
we can autoload packages libraries
drivers helpers config files language
files and models so we want the helpers
which is right here I'm going to pass in
URL all right so let's try that okay so
now it's working home takes us to home
about takes us to about perfect all
right so we're there's going to be some
other stuff we're going to load as well
now let's go to I want to wrap this in a
container so that the contents pushed
over so if we go to our header file
we're going to put a div at the bottom
here and give it a class of container
oops we're not going to end it here we
want to end it in footer because we want
it to wrap around everything so let's
open footer dot PHP and then we'll put
an ending div
okay and now we have a container around
our content you know what let's just put
a title inside of home.php grab that and
put a paragraph we'll just say welcome
to the CI blog application all right and
then in the about page this is CI blog
version 1.0 okay so now if you want to
create other static pages you can do
that really easily just by adding a view
down here and then a navigation item all
right so let's close everything out and
we're going to now work on the post kr
blog post so let's create a controller
we'll say new file and we're going to
save it as hosts dot PHP alright and
then let's just copy this our pages
controller paste that in and let's just
do an index function first okay we'll
get rid of this parameter we'll get rid
of this and we'll keep a title let's
just say latest posts and we want the
header and footer to show and what's
going to change this to posts slash
index all right so let's save that and
then we'll go to our views and we're
going to create a folder called
hosts and let's create a file here
called index.php and we just want the
title just like we have with the pages
so we'll grab that and let's put that in
there we'll save it and let's say all
right this still says pages that should
say posts all right and then what we
want to do is add a route so let's go to
config routes and we're going to say up
at the top here route posts and we want
to set that to posts /index okay so now
if we go to slash posts we get our index
view now before we go any further
because we need to create a model we
need to add a database table for our
posts so I'm going to go to localhost /
PHP myadmin and we're going to create a
database for this application and we'll
call it CI blog alright and let's create
a table called posts and I don't know
two six columns alright so we're going
to put an ID which will be an int and
that's going to be the primary key we
also want to set it to auto increment
and then we'll have a title which will
be a varchar' we'll say 255 we're going
to have a slug which will be basically a
URL version of the title so we're going
to set that to varchar' and let's have a
body actually that's what that we'll set
that to text let's have I can't remember
if if CodeIgniter actually put some a
timestamp on it I don't think so so
let's say created
at will set that to time stamp and we
want to set the default to current
timestamp so let's go ahead and just use
that for now okay we'll say save and now
we have a post table so now we're going
to go back and we're going to create a
model
so inside models let's say new file and
let's save it as let's say we want to
save it as post I'm just yeah
post on the score model dot PHP alright
and let's add the class so class host
underscore model and we want to say
extends c i underscore model and let's
create a constructor so public function
double underscore construct and we want
to load the database okay we want to
load the database library so let's say
this load database alright and we'll
save that let's make sure our
application still works now let's go
back to the post controller I'm sorry
not the post controller we still want to
be in the model and we want to create a
get post method so let's say public
public function get underscore posts
alright and that's going to get passed
I'm going to say slug and we're going to
set that to false as default alright and
then let's check for the slug
if whoops
if slog is equal to false then we want
to say query equals and then we're going
to we're using active model here in
CodeIgniter so I'm going to say this DB
get and we want to get posts and then
let's say return query result underscore
array all right and then under the if
statement we want to do it as if there
is a slug passed in okay so then we can
say query equals this want the same
thing
except we want to pass in actually let's
do get underscore where and then we want
to pass in the second parameter here
which will be an array and we want to
say slug and point that to the variable
slug that's passed in okay and then we
want to return the same thing let's copy
this okay except for this we're going to
say with row array
all right let's save that we'll go back
to our controller and let's see inside
index here what we're going to do is
we're going to add to that data array
okay you want to add data posts and
let's say we want to set that to this
post underscore model and then we want
to call get underscore posts all right
so let's see what that does for us okay
so no errors which is a good sign let me
just change the name of this model just
to see if it throws an error no it's not
hmm because we do need to load the model
so let's go to config and then auto load
and go down to where the models are
right here and we're going to say we're
going to pass in here post on the score
model okay we'll save that and then
let's go back to the controller
and I want to just do a print out of
this to see if it's actually getting the
data oh we need to go to DAR we need to
go to slash posts all right so undefined
property post model let's see this post
model get posts and should be getting
loaded from here how do we have to do
that
Oh alternative model name we don't have
to do that so that should be loading so
I'm not sure why it's saying undefined
property post model all maybe this has
to be a lowercase yep that was it
alright so no database selected oh we
didn't configure the database so if we
go to config database and this is really
easy we just want to put in our
information I'm using the root user with
a password and then the database is CI
blog there we go alright now this is the
what that print our is outputting an
empty array which is fine because we
don't have any posts yet so what I'm
going to do is go to PHP myadmin and go
to insert and let's just put in some
data here so we'll say post 1 for the
slug I'm just going to do post - 1 and
then the body
let's grab some data from lips um
and we'll just grab that and let's paste
that in there okay we'll do another post
say post
- okay body oops
alright so let's say go and now we have
two posts if we go back and reload there
we go so we know that we're out we're
taking the posts out from the database
alright so let's go back to our
controller and get rid of that and now
we know that we're passing that post
along in this data variable we should
have access to it with the post variable
so let's go to our view our index view
and what we want to do is loop through
it using the for each loop so say PHP
for each I'm going to use the shorthand
syntax here so I'm going to say for each
posts as post and then down here let's
end it
okay then let's put an h3 this will be
where the title goes so we should be
able to do
let's PHP echo post title and then under
that we want to do the body and let's
also have the date so we'll put small
tags in right here and let's say posted
on and then we want to echo and I think
we called it created at let's try that
alright so now we're able to echo out
the post information why is that let's
put a line break there
all right and for the date I'm just
going to wrap that lets give it a class
class here and we'll just say post date
now I want to be able to add custom CSS
so let's create a CSS file we're going
to put that in the we don't have an
assets folder so let's create a folder
in the root or not file folder and we'll
call it assets and inside the air we'll
create a folder called CSS then we'll
create a file called style dot CSS
alright and then just to test things out
let's say body display:none alright then
we're going to include that in our
header so let's go to templates header
and we'll go right here
and then I don't think we'll be able to
just say assets / CSS style dot CSS
let's try it though
no localhost assets so what if we do
base URL let's try that alright so that
works so now we can get rid of that
style and let's say post date and we're
going to give this a background of light
gray and then add some padding margin
and let's reload let's see let's display
it as block and the margin I only want
to be on the top and bottom there we go
all right so now we have our post coming
from the database into our application
so let's add a link to this page and the
navigation so we'll go to header and
let's copy this okay we'll call this
blog and let's set it to go to slash
posts okay so now we have a link going
to our blog and that has double slashes
about does too so apparently when we use
base URL that gives us the slash we
don't need to add an extra one well
alright and then for the the navbar
brand we want to put the base URL in
there as well all right so so far so
good now we want to be able to click on
a link and have it bring us to the
actual post page so in the index.php for
the the posts we're going to add under
the body a paragraph and let's put blank
ok so this is going to go just a PHP
echo site underscore URL and in here
we're going to put slash posts let's see
slash posts and bear with me here just
trying to figure this out post okay so
my posts and we want this slug so let's
put that there oops so post slug and I
think that should do it and for the text
will say read more and if we hover over
it it goes pull oh we didn't put the
slash
like that alright so take this the post
slash and then the slug so that's what
we want let's format this a little bit
we'll give this link a class of BTN and
BTN default
okay let's also put a line break well
put another line break okay
so now let's make this work
alright so we're going to go to our post
controller and let's create a view
method this is going to work similar to
our pages view method it's going to take
in a slug which by default we're going
to say no all right and then we're going
to create a data variable or a data item
and let's call it post and let's set
that to this post model get underscore
posts and that's going to take in the
slug okay and then we're going to check
to see if that's empty or not so I'm
going to say if empty data posts then we
want to show a 404
all right and then after that let's put
data title and we want to set that to
the post title so let's do data data
post and title okay then we want to load
up our views let's copy that we want the
header in the footer and then we want to
load up post slash review and pass in
the data so let's save that and then in
the posts folder inside views we're
going to create a new file save it as
view dot PHP all right and then in there
let's put an h2 and we want the title
here so PHP echo host title and then
under that we want the body let's
actually put that in a div class of post
body all right and then we can say PHP
echo post body
all right let's also put the date so
just like we did in the index view
where's that I'm going to grab this
small tag
and that'll go right here all right
so that's not going to work yet we need
to go to our routes and just like we did
here with the pages let me just grab
this put this up top and then this is
not going to be just any it's going to
be posts /ne and we want that to go to
posts view and then the variable all
right so let's save that and let's
reload click read more okay so that's
still not working
post /n e equals post view that I save
it did I save that close to
Jews all right guys I found a problem
right here we're setting it to post
single but we're checking for posts
which is empty so it's throwing a 404 so
let's get rid of that s and save and
reload and now we can get the single
page awesome so I think that since we
can now read our posts and we can view
single pages we're going to go ahead and
stop here and we're going to continue in
part two where I'll show you how we can
add a form to actually add posts through
our application alright so thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
