absolute beginners so in this mini
course we're going to be looking at all
the fundamentals of the JavaScript
programming language now if you're
already fairly good with JavaScript this
course will probably won't give you too
much more than you already know but feel
free to use it as a refresher or to just
polish up on your skills or just to
watch it for fun if that's your thing
all right so we're going to be covering
a lot in a relatively short amount of
time about an hour so we're going to
look at things like variables arrays
loops if-else statements events things
like that form validation pretty simple
stuff so forgive me if I if I kind of go
over things you already know I'm going
to try not to spend too long on each
subject I'll just get you just
understanding the fundamentals so that
you can actually start typing JavaScript
on your own all right so hopefully you
guys enjoy it and you learn something
from it so let's get started so what is
JavaScript a brief definition would be a
programming language that is used to
make webpages interactive all right it's
what's known as an interpreted language
and what this means is that it doesn't
have to be compiled like languages such
as Java or C or visual visual basic and
this makes things a lot easier for us
okay we can just run our code we don't
have to run it through a compiler or
anything like that another really
important thing to understand is that
JavaScript is executed on the clients
computer or in their browser and
languages like PHP was just like Ruby
with Ruby on Rails they run on a server
somewhere else but with JavaScript that
actually runs on your computer all right
in again this makes things much easier
because we don't need any kind of
special server or anything like that we
can simply create a j/s file and include
it in our HTML all right it's also
object based it's it's it's an object
orientated
gramming although you don't have to use
it like that now the difference between
this and another object-oriented program
programming language like Java its
prototype based instead of class-based
alright and we'll get into that later on
so I'm sure most of you know this
already but javascript is not Java it
has nothing to do with Java Java is much
more complex and it's a high-level
language that is in the same category as
a language like C or C++ and those
languages are typically used to build
desktop applications games stuff like
that javascript is a scripting language
which means that it's a lightweight
language that is interpreted by a web
browser when the page is loaded so this
is what basically what we'll be going
over in this mini-course
variables arrays which are just
basically groups of variables loops are
used to iterate through data and then do
whatever you'd like I'll put it on the
screen or whatever it may be
conditionals we have going to have if
statements if else switches comparisons
and operators objects functions we'll
talk about program flow data types such
as strings numbers prototypes and also
events events is a big one when we have
interactive elements on our web page we
usually have some kind of event or
action associated with that element so
what do you need to run JavaScript all
you need is a modern web browser so
Chrome Firefox Safari or Internet
Explorer
I would suggest chrome but everyone has
their preference to create JavaScript
all you need is a text editor so you can
just you could use Windows notepad
there's also notepad plus plus there's
no pad to sublime text is what I use
textmate which i think is only for Mac
and then there's a ton of premium IDs
that you can use if you want to spend a
little bit of money things like
Dreamweaver I don't even know any other
ones I've never bought an ID sublime
text I use for most development
so HTML versus JavaScript this isn't
really this doesn't really make sense to
have them compare them because they're
completely different and they work
together alright HTML is a markup
language and javascript is a programming
language a markup language is just that
it's used to to display web pages so to
have things like paragraphs and headings
and HTML uses a tag syntax and hopefully
you already know at least the basics of
HTML if you don't I would suggest
learning that before you learn
JavaScript so what can you do with
JavaScript this is just a very minimal
list there's obviously a lot more but
you can do things like put content or
text in an HTML page on the fly you can
make web pages interactive and
responsive you can detect user browsers
and operating systems and other info you
can create cookies which are is
basically holding data in memory
validate forms you can create animations
and slideshows scrollers things like
that and you can even take it up a notch
and start building applications using
javascript frameworks like angular react
backbone j/s things like that all right
and then you have no js' which is
JavaScript running on the server which
will we'll look at a little bit but I'm
not going to really get into that that's
more advanced all right so enough of
this enough of these slides let's go
ahead and write some code all right so
before we can actually jump in and start
writing JavaScript we need to choose a
text editor all right now this is
strictly preference I'm choosing to use
sublime text but there are some other
choices that you may like better all
right so let's take a look at some of
them all right so the first text editor
that we're going to look at is sublime
text and that's actually what I'll be
using sublime text is very simple but
it's also packed with all kinds of
features its cross-platform you can use
it on Windows Mac or Linux and it also
has a long range of plugins that you can
install and use to add additional
functionality all right so that's what
we'll be using there's sublime text 2
and 3 I'll be using sublime text 3
another really nice option is notepad
plus plus and this gives you Windows
notepad with a bunch of additional
feature so one nice thing about this is
the interface is very customizable all
right you can make your toolbar as
minimal or as rich as you would like it
has a document map so you can see where
you where you're at in your work at any
time and also a tabbed interface so that
you can work with multiple documents
auto-completion and text shortening
alright so if you want to grab that just
go to notepad - + - + org
another option is notepad - which just
like notepad plus plus it's basically
Windows notepad with some additional
feature I can't really say too much
about it because I haven't really used
it but I've talked to a lot of different
developers that really like it
especially for HTML and JavaScript
alright
another one is Emacs now Emacs is a
little difficult to use if you're a
beginner so I wouldn't really suggest it
but it is an option it's been around for
a long long time I think it was it was
written in like 1976 or something like
that so that's another option you have
if you're on a Mac textmate is basically
the equivalent to notepad or notepad
plus plus for Mac I've never used it I
don't use a Mac but I've heard good
things about it all right so like I said
we'll be using sublime text if you want
to grab that just click on download and
you can see it's cross-platform if
you're using a Mac or Windows or Linux
32 or 64-bit you should be fine
I'm not going to go through the download
or anything like that because I have it
on my system but it's just a standard
Windows installer so now we're going to
talk about a really important part of
not only JavaScript but pretty much
every programming language and that is
variables and data types let's take a
look all right so before we get into
variables and data types I just want to
show you the document that I created
that will be working in okay very simple
it's just an index.html file we have all
our base HTML right here we're going to
link a style sheet style CSS which I
have here if you want to go ahead and
get that copied and then we just have a
header inside of the body and a
container which is where we'll put any
output that we need to alright now to
start writing JavaScript we can do one
of two things we can either link a
JavaScript file or we can put it right
in the HTML inside script tags now I'm
just going to show you both methods but
we're going to use the script tags just
for simplicity all right so let's say we
want to link an external javascript file
what we would do is say script and then
give it a source attribute SRC and then
let's say we want to call it main dot
j/s and then we need a closing script
tag oops
alright now let's save that and then I'm
going to just create a new document and
we'll call that main dot j/s okay we'll
open that up and just to test things
we're just going to send an alert and
we'll say file linked ok save it and
make sure that index.html is saved
reload and you can see we're getting
file length all right so that's how you
can link on an external javascript file
but what we're going to do we're going
to get rid of that and we're just going
to put in script tags down at the bottom
here
okay and just to test this will say
alert and say script tags work save it
reload and we get script tags work okay
get rid of that so let's talk about
datatypes okay so we we have a couple
different data types that we're going to
be working with okay we have number we
have strings or string we have an array
and we have an object okay I'm not going
to get into a raisin objects right now
I'll be doing that in a little bit but
what we'll do is talk about numbers and
strings all right so let's create a
variable we can do that with the keyword
var and then we'll name it we'll just
call it number one and let's set that to
35 okay
now since it doesn't have quotes around
it it's going to be looked at as a
number if it had double quotes or single
quotes it would be looked at as a string
and just to show you that we can do
something with that variable we'll just
do an alert and we'll say number one
okay if we reload you can see we get 35
now when you have a variable that is a
number data type you can perform math
operations so let's create another one
we'll call it number two and let's just
give it a value of 40 and then let's say
alert number one plus number two and I'm
sure you know what it's going to give us
okay so it's going to give us 75 it
added the two numbers together now let's
change these from the number data type
to a string by putting quotes around
them all right now if we save and reload
we get 3540 because since it's looked at
as a string it's just doing what's
called concatenating the two strings
together and if we want we can
concatenate stuff we can cause a
concatenate text or other strings to
these variables so let's say
my actually will have to put this in
quotes because it's a string will say my
favorite number is and let's just take
that one out we can concatenate just
like that just like we did with the
variable reload and we get my favorite
number is 35 all right so that's how you
can put a variable inside of a string
all right and even if this was a number
data type that's still going to work
okay so now let's talk about the naming
conventions of variables all right so
there's a couple different rules that we
have to follow all right so first one
variables can contain letters numbers
underscores and dollar signs okay so
these are the only characters that you
should be using in your variables now
they should begin with a letter all
right even though you can have any of
these four types you want to start the
variable with a left now they can also
be started with an underscore or a
dollar sign all right but we won't be
doing that in this in this course okay
they're also case sensitive okay so if
you have let's say let's create a
variable called test and set it to a
string this is a test and then let's
create a variable called test with a
with a capital with an uppercase T at
the beginning and we'll set that to this
is another test okay and then what we'll
do is say alert test we'll save that now
if it's not if it weren't case sensitive
then this would give us this because
this test would overwrite this one but
if we reload you can see we get this is
a
test okay if we change that to an
uppercase T and we reload we get this is
another test so you can see that they
are case-sensitive unlike HTML tags
which are not alright so those are the
basic rules now we also have different
different styles of variables all right
so we have something called camelcase
which I'll give you an example let's say
var will say my number all right this is
camelcase and what that means is it's
going to start with a lowercase letter
and then every word after that will be
an upper K will start with an uppercase
so this let's say my favorite number
okay so that's camel case we also have
something called partial case which is
very close to camel case except the
first word is also in uppercase all
right and then we also have the
underscore style which would be far my
favorite number okay so with this you
can see each word is separated by an
underscore and this is often used in PHP
but also in the JavaScript world now if
you have experience in any other
programming languages that uses
variables you'll notice that JavaScript
follows a lot of the same rules and
conventions
now notice with these I just claimed the
variable I just declared it and didn't
set it equal to anything that's
absolutely fine too you're just
initializing it without a value all
right so if you initialize it with var
then you can later on let's say my
favorite number equals five and you
don't have to use the var it's already
initialized the next thing we're going
to look at in javascript is arrays and
arrays are used to store multiple values
in a single variable so in our document
we're going
go down to our script tags and let's
create a very simple array all right so
when you declare an array it's it's it
is a variable so you want to use var and
then we'll name it let's call it colors
all right now we're going to set this
equal to and then we're going to open
some brackets all right and this is what
defines it as an array we could just
leave it like this and it's inert Kitson
initialized array okay so let's add some
values to this we're going to add some
strings so we need quotes we'll say red
blue and green okay so now we have an
array of colors that has three different
values inside of it so how would we
access let's say red to do that what
we'll do is we'll do an alert and we'll
say colors now let me just show you what
happens if we do that okay so what it's
going to do is it's going to just print
out everything so it's giving us all of
the values now what if we want to target
just the second value here blue so to do
that we would use just some square
brackets after the variable and let's
put in one okay so if we save that and
reload you can see we're getting blue
now you might be wondering why we put in
one but we got the second value and the
reason for that is arrays are zero-based
okay so the first value of an array is
always going to be 0 it doesn't start
from 1 so we have 0 1 2 so if we go
ahead and reload this we're going to get
red okay if we put in 2 I'm sure you
know what we're going to get we're going
to get green if I put in 3 and reload we
get undefined because there is no third
value here so this is one way to create
an array but it's not the only one all
right so another thing we could do here
is we could save our colors and set it
equal to new array and then just open up
some parentheses
and then in here we could say red let's
say yellow and orange alright so that
also creates an array now it's it's all
preference on how you want to do it I
prefer the first way we did it just
because it's a little easier to read but
this certainly does do the same thing so
let's say alert and we'll get colors too
and we should get orange okay now what
if we wanted to add to this array so of
course we could just add in another
value here but we can also add it down
here so what we can do is say colors and
if we look at this array here we have
red yellow orange which is 0 1 2 so we
can set 3 let's set 3 to green all right
and then of course we could do alert
let's just alert colors and we'll get
red yellow orange green now you might
not always know how many values you have
here so this isn't really an effective
way to add to an array so though the
correct way it's better way to do this
would be to use the push function so to
do that we'll say colors dot push ok and
we'll want to push in is let's say
purple all right and then we'll say
alert colors and let's get the fourth
one which would be three okay if we
reload now we get purple and this here
this is known as dot syntax so we're
taking an element or an object in this
case which is an array and we're calling
the push function with the dot case
we're saying colors dot and then a
function called push which we're passing
in
a parameter of purple all right we'll
get in we'll get more into this stuff
later you can also chain onto this and
you could add other functions is now
open to this point our array only has
strings in it all right so we can also
let's create an array called numbers and
we can set that to just an array of
numbers okay and what makes the numbers
is that there's no quotes around it so
it's not a string so we could do
something like alert and let's say
numbers 0 plus numbers too ok if we do
that and reload we get 11 it's good it's
giving us 5 plus 6 and not only that
that could use numbers but you could
also mix and match so we could also put
a string in here and let's say 7 okay we
could certainly do that and let's do
alert numbers 2 which gives us 6
actually I want to do numbers 3 which
should give us the string of 7 now a
couple minutes ago I showed you the dot
push function which is also called a
method okay when you say methods and
functions in JavaScript it's generally
the same thing as well as properties and
attributes alright and arrays can have
these things they can have properties
and they can have methods so let's look
at the method of I'm sorry the property
of length so what we can do here is say
alert numbers dot length and if we go
ahead and we reload we get 4 because the
length pertains to how many values are
in the array so if I add something else
here let's say 155 and then we reload
now we're getting 6 because there's 6
there
so that's an example of a property now a
method would be just a function just
like push that we just used there's also
one called sort alright now if it's a
method or a function it has to have
parentheses on the back of it so let's
save that and then what we'll do is
reload and it's going to sort them by
value okay so you can see the one is
moved to the beginning and it goes up to
the string of seven which attacks on the
end okay we could also use one called
reverse all right and if we go ahead and
reload that it's going to give us the
reverse order from which it was created
so 55 you can see it's at the beginning
all right so that's going to do it for
arrays so now we're going to take a look
at loops
alright so there's different types of
loops and I'm going to give you an
example of each one now if you have
experience in other programming
languages chances are you know what a
loop is and the different types of loops
they run across a wide range of
programming languages for instance a for
loop you have for loops in JavaScript
you have for loops and PHP Java really
high-level languages so if you know a
for loop in another language then this
should be very easy to understand all
right so the basic types of loops we're
going to go over is a for loop a while
loop and a for each loop which is used
for arrays all right so let's start out
with a for loop and loops what they do
is they iterate through something
whether it's an array or a result rows
from a database or whatever it may be so
let me give you just a very basic
example ok so we're going to say for
okay so structured just like just like a
function and this is going to take three
different parameters the first we're
going to set a variable so we're going
to say var and we'll call it I we're
going to set it to 0 to begin with all
right and these parameters are set
rated by semicolons the next is going to
be the condition so what we're going to
do is we're going to say as long as I is
less than let's say 10 okay so that's
the condition and then the last one is
to increment and we want to increment by
1 so to do that we can say I plus plus
that's going to increment it by 1 now
inside the curly braces is what we want
to happen through each iteration all
right so what we're going to do is we're
going to do a console.log and if you
don't know what that is it's just a way
to print stuff out kind of like we've
been doing with alert all right so if I
go into my Chrome browser and I hit f12
it's going to open up a console all
right so just to give you a quick
example let's say console dot log and
we'll just put in a string here we'll
say hello okay if I save that and then
we run it you can see down here we're
getting hello and I can make this bigger
okay so you can put whatever you'd like
say 1 2 3 and we can print that out so
what we'll do is after each iteration
we're going to console.log all right and
what we want to output here is the eye
okay the eye variable because that's
going to change the reach iteration
because we're adding one to it so let's
go ahead and console.log I and reload
and you can see that it's starting at 0
because we set the variable I to 0 and
then each iteration it's going to add to
1 it's going to add 1 to that until it
meets this that this right here I less
than 10 all right so as long as this is
true which is going to keep going now
when you get to 9 it's going to stop
because if it goes to 10 it's this isn't
true anymore okay if you actually want
to include the 10 you can say I is less
than or equal to 10 and then if we run
it now you can see we're getting the 10
okay and I can put whatever I want here
if we say 20 it's going to loop through
up to 20 ok and you could do whatever
you want here we could
console.log of string and attach it to
it and will say say I love the number
and then I alright and then you can see
it's going to do it 20 times so that's a
four loop next thing I'm going to show
you is a while loop and I want to do
pretty much the same thing so what we'll
do is we're going to say while and then
here we want to put our conditions so
let's say as long as I is less than 10
and then here we want to do whatever we
want to do through each iteration so
let's do the same thing we'll just
console dot log I okay and then we have
to include our increment so I plus plus
all right so let's run that I is not
defined we have to actually define it
outside of the while loop
all right so we'll say var I is equal to
zero all right and you can see it's
doing the same exact thing as we did in
the for loop so the next loop I'm going
to show you is a for each loop and for
each loops are they're built to work
with arrays alright so before we do that
let's create an array okay we'll call it
numbers and we're just going to put just
some random ups some knit random numbers
in here okay so we have an array of
numbers and then what we can do is we
can say numbers numbers dot for each
alright and then inside here we're going
to put another function just like that
and here we can put whatever we want
let's say number and that's what we can
use in here so console dot log
number so we'll save that and reload and
you can see now we're iterating through
the entire array now you can also use
for loops or while loops with arrays you
don't have to use for each alright so
for an example what we'll do is say for
I or VAR I is equal to zero and then
what we want to test is to say as long
as I is less than the name of the arrays
which is numbers and then we want to add
on the length property so dot length
okay so in this case the length is going
to be six and then of course we need to
increment all right and then down here
what we can do is let's console dot log
and we want to say numbers and then I
okay so this is making it dynamic so
let's save that reload and you can see
we get the same thing and if we want to
let's say I'll put this in Reverse we
could just write here say numbers dot
reverse reload and I can see they're
going the opposite way so you can change
it up you can add methods to it after
you create the actual array alright so
another part of JavaScript that is very
similar to many other programming
languages is conditionals so if
statements if else switches if you know
these in another programming languages
language then you're not going to have
any problems with it in JavaScript so
first thing we'll take a look at is the
if statement okay so down in our script
tags what we're going to do is we're
going to say if and then we want to open
up some parentheses and then curly
braces so in here will be the condition
so let's say if I will say if one is
equal to one now notice that I have two
equal signs here in JavaScript in most
programming language
if you use one equal sign that's usually
assignment you're assigning whatever
this is to this variable or this this
element all right so when you're
comparing you want to use a double equal
sign
now there's times when you may actually
see three equal signs and what that
means it's the same thing as double
equals except that these two data types
have to match okay so even if we have a
1 here as a number and then we have a 1
as a string you want to use 3 equal
signs to make sure that they're the same
the same data type in this case they're
not because 1 is a number one's a string
all right so that's what it means if you
see 3 of these so let's go back and
we'll say if 1 is equal to 1 then let's
console dot log and we'll say this is
true okay and then we'll run that and
you can see that this is true if I
change this to 2 we know that 1 is
obviously not equal to 2 so it gives us
nothing all right
and we can of course use variables in
here so let's save our I will say var 1
is equal to 3 bar 2 is equal to 4 and
then we could just compare those so
we'll say if R 1 is equal to var - then
we'll say this is true ok we get nothing
because obviously it's not true if we
wanted to test if it was not equal then
we could use an exclamation and then
equals ok so this is going to be true
because var 1 is not equal to var - ok
so let's put that back to equals and
then what if it's not true but you want
something to happen if it's not true
all right so what we can do is we can
use else ok so we'll say else
console.log
and we'll say this is false alright so
now if we reload we're going to get this
as false so another thing we can do is
we can add conditions to this we don't
have to just stick to one so let's say
if var 1 is equal to V 2 and then we'll
use and K which is going to be a double
ampersand so we'll say and var 1 is
equal to 3 ok so not only does this have
to be true this also has to be true
okay so let's actually make it true by
saying we're going to set them equal to
each other and then also var 1 is equal
to 3 so if we save that and run it we
get this is true now if I put it back if
I put the 4 back and then we try it we
get false because even though var 1 is
still equal to 3 it's not equal to var
two now what we can do here is we can
say or instead of and and you can do
that with a double pipe character
alright so if we save that reload we get
true alright because although it's not
equal they're not equal to each other
var 1 is equal to 3 now another thing we
can do is we can use switch statements
all right so let me give you an example
of that we're going to save our fruit is
equal to apple ok so we have a variable
called fruit equal to apples so what we
want to do is run a switch statement on
the fruit variable alright so in here
we're going to add fruit ok and then
what we're going to do is we're going to
create cases so let's say case and we'll
say
banana and we want to put a colon here
and then whatever we want to happen
let's say alert and we'll alert I hate
bananas alright and then we have to put
in a break okay at the end so that's one
case and probably tab these over so in
the next case let's say Apple okay so
for apples we're going to say alert I
love apples and then we want to break
and let's say case orange little alert
and let's say oops
oranges are okay alright and then we
want to break and then finally we're
going to have a default so I'm going to
put that and for default we're going to
say alert I love all other fruits okay
and then we just want to break all right
so let's save this and we'll go ahead
and run it and we're getting I love
apples okay because fruit is equal to
Apple so it's it's calling this right
here if we set it to banana and save we
get I hate bananas if we set it to
orange and run it
oranges are okay if we set it to let's
say grapes reload I love all other
fruits because grapes is not listed as
one of the cases so it's calling the
default all right so that's a switch
statement all right so we've already
talked about array
so now I want to talk about objects
which are kind of similar alright so
let's take a look at that alright so
there's a few different types of objects
or a few different ways to work with
them okay so the first one is going to
be an object literal okay so what we can
do is we can set a variable let's call
it person and set it to an object which
uses curly braces alright and if you
know Jason Java JavaScript object
notation then this should be no problem
so first we'll give it a property of
first name okay which will be a string
and then we'll also do a last name which
will also be a string and then we can
use a number okay we'll say age and
we'll have a number type okay so this is
an object it's an object called person
with a first name last name and age now
let's say we want to access this
person's first name okay so what we can
do is let's do console dot log and we'll
say person dot first name okay objects
use this dot notation so let's save that
and reload and you can see we get Brad
okay if we want to get the age we could
say person dot age and we get 34 now
we're not limited to just having one
straight value for a property we can
also have a raise all right so let's say
we want to add children and we want to
set this to an array and put my children
okay so we have an array now if we want
to access let's say the first one then
we can say person dot children zero
right and we get Breanna and we can
certainly loop through these just like
we did in you know a few minutes ago
when we use the for loop
and the for each loop or while loop you
can do that just like as if it was just
a regular array all right so next thing
we can also have embedded objects okay
so let's say we want address and we can
set that to a whole nother object so
let's say Street we'll say five five
five something street and say city
Boston and State mass all right so what
we can do here is let's say person dot
address and if I just do that let's see
what happens okay that's going to
actually show us the object with the
street city and state now if we want to
access just the state we could just add
dot state okay and we get mass now we
can go even deeper and we can actually
include functions here as well so let's
say we want a function called full name
okay so we'll set that to function and
then in here let's return this dot
first-name now the keyword this is used
in many different programming languages
and what it refers to is the current
object that it's in which is person okay
so we can access this first name using
this dot first name
alright so let's return that and then
let's just concatenate oops a space and
then we'll add on this dot last name
just like that and then down here we'll
say console.log person dot full name
since it's a function we need to include
the parentheses all right so let's go
ahead and reload that and we get Brad
Travis E alright so this is how you can
encapsulate everything inside of its own
object okay so that's an object
litora let's move on to an object
constructor okay so this is just another
way to create a single object so let's
create a variable called Apple and we're
going to set that to new object just
like that and then we can add properties
to it by saying Apple dot color we'll
set that to red and then we'll say Apple
dot shape we'll set that to round okay
so if I need a semicolon there so what
we did is created an object and then we
added some properties okay if we want to
add let's say a function
we'll say Apple dot describe set that to
a function and let's do return and we'll
say an apple is the color and then we'll
just concatenate this dot color and say
and is the shape and then we'll just
concatenate again and we'll say this dot
shape okay we don't need that last I can
just go like that all right and now what
we can do is let's console.log Apple now
we can just console.log Apple and it'll
show us the object okay and we can say
dot color which will give us red or we
can say Apple dot describe which is
function and we get an Apple is the
color red and is the shape round all
right so that's another way to do but
what isn't good about this is let's say
you want a couple different fruits you
want oranges bananas you'll have to do
this whole thing for each fruit all
right so this is a much simpler way to
do this we can use a
instructor pattern okay so what we'll do
here is we're going to say function
fruit and that's going to take in a
couple parameters okay we want a name of
the fruit we want a color and a shape
all right and then the first thing we
want to do is assign the values that are
passed in as properties of fruit so we
can do this using this dot name set that
to name we'll say this dot color set to
the color passed in and then this dot
shape set to the shape that's passed in
okay now before I go and create a method
in here I'm going to create a new fruit
so let's save our apple we want to set
to new fruit all right and then we just
want to pass in whatever we want here so
let's say apple for the name let's say
red and round okay and then let's do
console dot log apple if we reload you
can see that we now have an apple if we
wanted to create let's say melon we
could just say new fruit melon and let's
change this to green okay so now if we
console.log melon and let's say we want
the shape we could say melon dot shape
and that gives us round so we can create
methods in here which are just functions
so let's do this dot
describe alright actually we don't want
to do that we want to set it equal to
function and let's do return and I'm
just going to put a string in here with
some of these elements up here are these
properties so we'll say a and then we'll
add on this dot name say is the color
this dot color and is the shape this dot
shape okay and then down here let's say
Mellon dot describe and we reload Mellon
up I can uncomment this and there we go
Mellon is the color green and is the
shape round so the more fruits we want
to add all we have to do is this one
line of code instead of having to do the
whole thing that we just went through
with the object constructor so hopefully
that's clear to you guys now we can also
have arrays of objects all right so
let's say we want a variable called
users and we'll set that to an array but
inside here we're going to have objects
okay so let's say name John Doe and age
I'll say 30 all right and then we can
just put a comma here and we can add
more users okay so this one will say
Mark Smith age 44 and then here we'll
have Shelly Williams who's 20 okay so
now we have an array of objects and we
could do something like console.log
users and let's get well actually yeah
we'll get the first one so 0 and that
should just give us this person right
here if we reload okay and we can get
the specific properties if we want we
can say dot name and that will give us
John Doe all right so those are objects
alright so one of the most important
aspects of learning javascript is events
alright because javascript was created
to make webpages interactive and dynamic
and in order to do that you need to have
some kind of event handling for clicks
or Scrolls or drags whatever it may be
so let's take a quick look at events so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to create an element inside my container
here and actually know what let's make
it a button okay so we have a simple
button let's display that okay obviously
it's not going to do anything if we
click it what we want to do is in it we
want to attach an event handler to this
element so what we're going to do is say
on click equals and then what we want to
happen so what we're going to want is to
run a function all right so let's say do
click OK so on click we're going to call
a function called do click so let's
create that down here we're going to say
function do click and let's just do an
alert and we'll say you clicked ok we'll
save that reload and we get you clicked
ok so it's as simple as that to create
an event now we can do other stuff here
it doesn't have to be a custom function
alright for example we can say this
which pertains to the button I'm going
to say
this dot innerhtml which is a JavaScript
core function and we're going to set it
to lets see single quotes and we're
going to say you clicked alright so we
can get rid of that let's save it and go
and reload and click it and you can see
that the text of the button changed to
you clicked now you probably wouldn't
want to do this you don't really want to
call mix your javascript in with your
HTML you know as much as you can you can
not do that so a better way to get that
same functionality would be to let's get
rid of that create it your own function
called change text okay and then pass in
this and then down here you could create
your function change text and pass in
let's say ID okay you're passing this in
here as the ID and then what you want to
do is say ID dot inner HTML set that to
you clicked ok so go ahead and reload
and you can see it does the same thing
but this looks a lot neater now you
don't have to just change the element
you're in you can change something else
for instance let's say we want to change
this heading
alright to do that we're going to add an
ID to the heading first and we'll just
call this heading and then once this is
clicked we don't need to pass in this
anymore because we're not working with
that right so we'll get rid of that what
we want to use here is a Dom function
called get element by ID all right so we
need to say document dot
get element by ID and has the idea of
heading okay and what we'll do is set
this to a variable called heading and
then right here we're going to say
heading dot innerhtml and we'll set that
to you clicked all right so if we save
that reload click the button now you can
see the heading has changed so let's do
something a little different what I want
to do is we'll have this button and
we're going to hit when it clicks I
wanted to show us the date
okay so let's change the text to show
date and let's change this here to a
function called show date and we'll
change this show date all right and what
we want to do is let's put an element up
here right above the button okay we'll
put an h1 and let's give it an ID of
time all right we're not going to
actually put anything inside of it it's
just an empty element okay and then in
show date what we're going to do is grab
grab this h1 okay so we're going to say
document dot get element by ID okay this
time we want to grab the ID of time and
let's actually set that to a variable
okay and then what we'll do is say time
dot innerhtml
and we're going to set that equal to the
date function all right so let's save
that and reload show date and now it
gives us the date and time
now on click isn't the only event we can
use this there's a bunch of them or
another one would be onmouseover okay so
for this one let's save it reload and
now if I just hover over it it runs this
it runs show date okay we don't even
have to click it we just hover right
over it now we also have one called
on Mouse out so let's let's attach that
so on Mouse out we'll set to a function
called clear date all right and then
down here will create that function and
what we'll do is we'll take this
actually we'll take this whole thing and
set time dot innerhtml
to nothing all right so let's save that
reload and you'll see that well it's
it's kind of awkward because once I
click it you know what let's put the
date underneath so that it doesn't
change positions ok so I go in and it
shows it caught that's onmouseover when
I leave it it goes away ok we also can
do onload which usually you'll attach to
the body if you have something that you
want to run when the page loads a lot of
times you'll attach this to the body so
we'll say onload and let's say show date
alright if we save that and we reload
you can see that the date is now shown
alright so let's move on to forms all
right I want to talk about forms because
JavaScript plays a really big role in
form validation and other types of
functionality with forms so let's take a
quick look at that
all right so I've created a very simple
form here with three fields we have
first-name lastname and we have a
background color select box so what I
want to do is just show you how we can
link some events to some of the form
fields we have and also how to do this
very simple form validation so before we
go into validation I just want to show
you how we can link this select box to
change the the body background of our of
our application or website okay so what
we're going to do is we have our select
okay and we're just going to add to the
Select tag I'm going to add on change
and we're going to set that to change
background okay and we want to pass in
this because we want this select element
so down here we'll create a function
called change background alright and
that's going to take in let's just put X
here okay that's going to represent this
so let's test it out and say console.log
and we'll just say hello just to make
sure the event work so let's reload and
we'll just change it okay notice I
didn't submit the form I'm just changing
the select list okay we're getting hello
let's see what happens if we console.log
X okay so what that's doing is it's
giving us the entire select element so
we can access anything we want in here
for example to get the actual value we
can say X dot value okay we'll reload
choose blue and you'll see down here we
get blue green red okay so now we have
access to the value there so what we
want to do is we want to change the CSS
of the body to whatever that value is
all right the background of the body so
first thing I'm going to do is
the body tag I'm just going to add an ID
to it called body okay and then down
here what we'll do is create a variable
called body set that to document dot get
element by ID and we want the ID of body
okay so now we have that that element
what we want to do is say body and then
we're going to call style okay dot style
and then the actual CSS that we want to
change is background color alright and
we just want to set that equal to X dot
value okay so let's go ahead and save
that reload and now let's choose blue
and you can see the whole body changes
green red alright now let's say we just
want to change the heading here we could
just change this to heading and let's
see does it have yeah it has an ID of
heading so I can just change that
heading instead of background color
let's just change color okay so now if I
change that to blue you can see the
headings blue green and red okay so this
is a perfect example of how Java Script
makes things dynamic and interactive so
now let's move on what we're going to do
is just very simple form validation we
want the first name to be a required
field and we shouldn't be able to submit
the form if the first name is blank and
then we'll also add a rule saying it has
to be at least three characters so let's
just delete this we don't need that okay
actually we don't need the background
select list at all anymore
alright and I'm just going to take the
ID off of body okay so what we want to
do we want to figure out what event we
won
use hair so when you're working with a
form you probably want to use on submit
so let's put that in here we're going to
say on submit and we're going to set
that equal to return validate form okay
so let's create that down here we'll say
function validate form okay and first
thing we want to do is grab the first
name input element so to do that we'll
say first name now I should mention that
when you're doing something like this
it's probably a good idea to use jQuery
or something like that some kind of
JavaScript library it makes things a lot
easier it shortens your code the reason
I'm not showing you that is because this
is a strictly JavaScript tutorial and I
think you should learn how to do that
first but after that just look into
jQuery because things it's a lot easier
to select different elements from the
Dom okay so but just to show you how we
can do it with pure JavaScript we can
use document dot forms okay and what
that's going to do is it's going to look
at all the forms now we want to be
specific this form has a name of my form
so we can actually use that so we're
going to open up some brackets and it'll
say my form and then we want the first
name so we're going to specify that okay
and then we're going to say dot value
okay so that's going to give us the
value you could have also used document
dot get element by ID on the input form
but this is just another way to do it so
what we want to do is we want to run a
check on that first name
okay so we want to say if first name is
equal to null or whoops or first name is
equal to nothing okay so if that's true
then we're going to alert I'm going to
let the user know say first name is
required all right and then you want to
be sure to return false which is going
to stop the form from submitting all
right so let's save that and we'll go
ahead and reload and let's try to submit
and it's giving us first name is
required okay if I put something in
there and submit it lets us go through
and I just have it going to a file
called something dot PHP alright because
usually you would submit a form to to
either PHP or some other kind of server
server language file all right
so that's that now let's say we also
want to check it and make sure that
there's at least three characters so
what we'll do is let's copy that and
we'll say if first name dot length is
remember all objects have properties
length is one of the properties
so we'll say length is less than three
we'll say first name must be at least
three characters and return false okay
so if we reload and we put one character
in submit it's telling us it must be
three characters if we put more than
three submit it goes through all right
so that's the very very basics of form
validation with JavaScript and you
should also have some kind of form
validation on your server side if you're
using PHP or whatever it may be because
JavaScript is only done on the client
all right so that's going to be it for
this short well it wasn't that short I
actually wanted it to be a little
shorter than this but hopefully you
learned something from it at least the
the fundamental
of not only javascript but programming
in general because things like loops
arrays variables these things are are
global to most programming languages
