you how to build a really simple react
component alright so all this is going
to be it's going to be a bootstrap
Jumbotron alright so basically we're
going to turn this into a react
component and we're going to use it as
an example so I can show you how to
create properties state things like that
all right how we can encapsulate it into
its own component so let's take a look
at our file here our HTML file we're
including the bootstrap CDN so we can
use bootstrap and then these two scripts
here are what you need to build a react
application alright so we have the main
react j/s file this is 0 14 7 and then
we also have the react Dom file we need
that as well in addition to that we're
going to be using JSX and our components
so we're going to need babel core ok so
you also want to include this and this
is just CDN now the latest version of
babel is version 6
but there's issues with that and using
reusing it with react that hopefully
will be cleared up soon but for now you
want to use version 5.8 alright in this
case five point eight point 25 all right
so these scripts are absolutely
necessary you need to have them in order
for this to work alright and then down
here we just have some simple bootstrap
setup we have a container a row and then
12 column div and then you'll see this
div here has an ID of jumbotron this is
where our component is going to be
inserted alright so what we're going to
do is we're going to go down the bottom
of the body tag and we're going to
create a script tag alright now we need
to include the type of text slash babble
all right if you don't include that it's
not going to work
all right and then in here what we'll do
is we'll create a variable for our
component so jumbotron all right now we
have to set that to react dot create
class all right and I should also
mention if you're building a real
application you probably want to use
something like browserify or webpack
where you can use nodejs and npm and you
can install react that way but we'll get
into that later on we will be doing that
this is just very very basic just to
show you the syntax of a react component
all right so we have react create class
and then we need to pass in some curly
braces and we're going to create our
first function which is render all right
and this is required render it's the
only one that's actually required all
right so we want to say function and
then let's just return okay so what we
do here is we're going to return our JSX
and when you return something the
top-level element has to be just just
one element you have to return just one
so we want a div now if we wanted
something else we couldn't put another
anything else down here maybe an h1 or
something you couldn't do that you'll
get an error what you need to do is do
everything inside here if you need a div
and then an h1 here you can do that but
make sure that the top-level only has
one element all right so let's just go
ahead and say test okay now if we save
this and reload it nothing's going to
happen all right because even though we
created the component or not rendering
it we're not putting it into our
application or into the browser so to do
that we're going to go down here
and we're going to say react Dom dot
render and then we're going to pass into
there the component so it's jumbotron
and you want to go like that okay you
always want to include your slash here
all right it's basically XML or XHTML
alright so that's the first parameter
and then the second parameter is where
we specify where we want to put this so
we can use just standard JavaScript and
say document dot get element by ID and
we'll pass in Jumbotron because that's
what we have up here that's where we
want to put it alright so let's go ahead
and save that and now if we reload you
can see we get tests all right if we
open up the console make sure there's no
errors here but that's basically it
that's how you can create and render a
react component so what I want to do now
is I'm going to grab from bootstrap the
jumbotron alright so I'll just grab this
alright and we're going to paste it
right here ok we'll fix it up a bit
and then for the paragraph oops just
grab that okay so we get a paragraph we
get a button now if we save that and we
go ahead and reload now we're getting
the content you can see we have the
heading the paragraph but we're not
seeing the formatting and the reason for
that is when you're using JSX you can't
use the class attribute all right you
can see we get it we have an error down
here
unknown DOM property class to do mean
class name so the reason it's doing that
is because we can't use class what we
need to do is use class name so whenever
you include a class in your JSX you need
to change it to class name all right so
now if we save that and reload now it's
rendering correctly and we're not
getting that ever
all right so very very simple you've now
created your first react component so in
the next video we're going to talk about
props or properties where we can insert
dynamic content through attributes or
properties all right so I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
