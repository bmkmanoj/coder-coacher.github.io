and set up our fire store we created an
angular application we brought in all
our dependencies including materialized
and font awesome
also of course firebase and angular fire
we set up all the stuff we need to for
angular fire in our app dot module dot
ES file we created our service we did a
bunch of stuff and ultimately we were
able to fetch the an array of items from
fire store and display them on the
screen now one issue we have is we don't
have access to the ID which are going to
need later so instead of if we go into
our service instead of using value
changes we actually want to use snapshot
changes and then we need to basically
map the the ID so that we have access to
it so what I'm gonna do is comment this
out I'm going to keep it but just
comment it out and instead set this dot
items equal to this dot af-s dot
collection we want the items collection
and then we want to do snapshot changes
okay and then in here or from here we're
going to say dot map and pass in
something here now this sometimes you'll
see actions sometimes you'll see changes
I like to use changes and we're going to
set that to an arrow function alright
and then basically we want to return
changes and then we're gonna call dot
map again and here I'm just going to put
a set that to some curly braces we're
gonna create a variable called data and
set that to that a dot payload dot doc
dot data all right you see this stuff
comes up and intellisense if you're
using I should have mentioned this a
while ago I'm using an extension called
or is it's right here angular version
five typescript snippets okay so I
should have mentioned that late earlier
because you guys probably haven't been
seeing
the errors that I have so sorry about
that but you should get that installed
if we're using angular with vs code
all right so Kant's data a payload doc
data and then we're going to say we want
this as item ok the item comes from our
model and then we want to set data dot
ID equal to a dot payload dot dot dot ID
ok so that's how we can get the ID and
then we just want to return data so all
that code just did is made it so that in
addition to the title and the
description we also get the data I'm
sorry we also get the ID so let's go
ahead and save this if we go to our
application it should look the same but
if we go to the HTML and let's just for
a second change title to ID and save now
we can get the ID ok so that that's
basically why we just did that it's a
little more difficult there's some more
code we have to write but we're able to
get the ID which we're going to need
later on alright so I think the next
thing I want to do is add the nav bar
which is going to be really easy it's
just it's basically a dumb component
meaning it has no functionality to it
it's just to display so let's go ahead
and generate that we're gonna go down
here to our terminal and say ngg
component it's gonna go in the
components folder navbar ok and we'll go
to let's see we'll go to the HTML and
this is gonna be very very simple
because we don't even have any links
it's just basically for show so we'll
put in a nav tag and then we're gonna
have a div with the class of nav -
wrapper I'm also going to give it a
class of black the default is pink and I
don't want pink and then we'll put an a
tag here that'll just go to slash and
let's see this also should get a class
brand logo
and center so that we can Center it and
then we'll just call this FS item
manager and that's it okay so we'll save
it let's go back to let's go to our app
component so our core app component HTML
and we're just gonna put this navbar
above the container so it has a selector
of app - navbar and save and there we go
alright so now we want to generate our
form to actually add an item okay so
let's go down here and say ngg component
it's gonna go in components slash and
it's going to be called add dash item
alright so now let's go to let's first
go to the TS file and we're going to be
using the serve the item service so
we're gonna bring that in it's gonna be
from dot dot slash twice services slash
item dot service we also want to bring
in our model item
oh there we go all right so since we
brought in the item service we need to
inject it into the constructor so let's
say private item service item service
okay so let's see this is going to have
a property of item which will have a
type of item and then we're gonna set it
to an object with just an empty title
oops empty title and description all
right and then that should be good for
now let's save this let's go to our HTML
for the add item component and we're
gonna create our form alright so this
form I'm going to put it inside of a
card which is a materialized class then
we're gonna have a class called card
content and inside here we'll have a
title I'm going to put that in a span
with the class of card title and we'll
say add item alright and then we're
gonna put in a form form does not need
an action we're going to give an an
event handler we're gonna say ng submit
and set that equal to a function called
on submit ok which will create later and
then let's also give this a class of
call and s-six so basically a six column
div and it's the inside here we're gonna
have a class of row we're gonna use the
materialized grid system we're gonna
have two six column divs with the title
on one and then the description in the
other all right so let's say class input
field and also a class of call and also
a class of s6 like that
all right and then let's see we're gonna
have our inputs type of text let's give
it a placeholder as well so placeholder
will say add title okay now we're going
to be using ng model which allows us to
bind properties to inputs or to anything
really now to use ng model we need to
import the forms module into app module
TS okay anytime we need to use anything
we need to bring it in through here so
we're gonna say import forms module and
that's from angular so it's from angular
slash forms alright now since it's a
module it needs to go in imports just
like the rest of the modules so forms
module alright save that you can close
that up for now let's go back to our
form and let's add brackets inside
brackets we'll have the parentheses and
this represents two-way binding all
right and we'll say ng-model
equals now we want to bind it to if we
look at our app I mean I'm sorry our add
item component we want to bind it to the
item title okay so we're gonna say right
here item dot title now we also have to
include a name attribute and that's just
gonna be title okay and let's see
underneath that we're just gonna have a
label and that will just say title okay
so that's one field now let's copy the
div with the class of input field and
we're gonna put one right underneath and
then this one's gonna be the description
okay so we'll change that the ng model
will be item dot
description and then the name will be
description and the label okay and then
we just want a submit button so we're
gonna go under this div right here we'll
say input it's gonna have a type of
submit oops
value submit and to give it a class of
BTN alright let's save it now we're not
gonna see it just yet because we haven't
we haven't inserted the custom element
anywhere or the selector so let's put it
in the main app component so let's see
we'll go to app component HTML we're
gonna go right above the app items and
say app add item and save and there we
go so now we have our form now if we
submit this we'll get an error because
it's trying to go to a function called
on submit so let's go ahead and create
that in our add app component or add
item component ts alright so down here
we'll say on submit now I'm not gonna do
any extensive validation all I just want
to make sure that there is a title in
the description before it we move on and
go through the service to actually add
to firebase and all that so let's just
do a simple if statement here so we'll
say if this dot item dot title is not
equal to anything four to nothing and
this dot item dot description is not
equal to nothing then we can continue
all right and what we're gonna want to
do is call the item service which we
brought in and then a function called
add item okay now we're gonna get this
red squiggly line if you have your
angular typescript
extension installed because we don't
have an add item function in this
service yet alright but we will create
it and then we're gonna pass in this dot
item okay so hopefully understand what's
going on we have our an item property
which is this object and when we fill in
the form whatever we put in this field
will be the title because we're binding
it using ng model we're binding it the
item dot title to this field
we're also binding item dot description
to this field so whatever we put in here
is going to then be that property and
then when we submit we're taking we're
first checking the title and description
fields of the inputs and then we're
calling the service function at item and
we're passing in the item which is
whatever they put in the form all right
so that's what's going on here and then
once that's done I just want to clear
the fields and we can do that by saying
this dot item dot title equals nothing
this dot item dot description equals
nothing okay so now we want to create
this add item so let's go to our service
item service and we're gonna go down
below the get items and we're gonna say
add item okay and then that takes in an
item which I'm going to give a type of
item which comes in from our model right
here alright now this is actually really
easy we already have this items
collection right here so all we have to
do is basically add to that so we can
say this dot items collection dot add
and then we can pass in the item
all right so let's save it that should
fix okay and let's go ahead and try it
so our title will say item for
description we'll say this is item for
enter okay looks like we have an issue
here cannot read property out of
undefined all right so let's see service
so this dot items collection dot ad Y oh
you know what we just have to go into
the constructor and let's see we're
gonna go right here and we'll say this
dot items collection equals this dot AFS
dot collection like that and then yeah
and then pass in items okay and then
instead of repeating this notice that
this and this are the same we can just
take that and replace that since that's
the same thing which is a little cleaner
all right we just we weren't setting the
collection to the items collection we
brought it in up here we set the type
but we didn't actually set it to the
collection so that should now work so
let's try it again all right
enter and there we go
item for now if you want to sort this
notice how there are there they're not
in order I'd like to order them from I
guess alphabetical for the for the title
so what we can do is we can go see where
we just were which is right here
AFS collection items and we're going to
just put a second parameter in here and
we're gonna say ref put an arrow
function and we can say ref dot order by
we want to order by the title and let's
let's order it ace ascending ASC so
we'll save that go back and now we have
them ordered in the right order
alright so it's as easy as that to add
to your fire store just calling add and
then you know items collection add
alright so now what I want to do is the
delete now I'm gonna start off by just
being able to delete them by double
clicking on each one of these because
later on we'll have the we're gonna
create the icon over here to edit and
we're gonna have to start getting into
like state we're gonna make it so that
we can enter an edit state which will
open a form for us to update things like
that but I just want to do a simple
delete at first so what we'll do is go
to our items
let's see items component dot HTML where
we have our allies right here and we're
going to add an event to the li so we're
gonna say actually double click dbl
click so when we double click it's gonna
call a function called delete item now
we need to know which which item is
actually being deleted so we're gonna
pass in two things here one is the event
we're gonna say money sign event and
then the
actual item like that all right so we're
gonna save that and then we'll go to our
item component TS file and let's create
delete item okay and remember it gets in
the event and the item okay and then
we're gonna call service function so
this dot item service dot delete item
okay which we haven't created yet but we
will and then we'll pass in item save
that let's go to our service now this is
where we need to deal with the angular
fired doc okay because we brought our
document angular fire stored document so
we're gonna set an additional property
right here called item doc we're gonna
set it to angular fire store documents
and we'll give it a type of item okay
and let's see we want to go down to the
bottom here and we'll create a function
called delete item okay remember that
takes in an item we're gonna give it a
type of item and then we can say this
dot item doc which we just defined above
and then we're gonna set this to this
dot af-s so angularfire store dot doc
and then it needs to know which actual
document we're talking about when I say
document I mean the item okay the the
record I guess so
that's going to be these back ticks here
so we can use a template string that's
going to be in items slash and then the
ID so we can put a variable in here like
this with a template string and we can
take that item and we can get the ID
from it so that way it knows what actual
item we're talking about now once it
knows which item we're talking about we
can simply do this whoops this dot item
doc
dot delete and that should delete it all
right so let's save that should fix and
let's go ahead and double click for and
there it goes if I reload it stays
deleted all right so I think that's a
good place to stop in the next video
we're gonna start on the edit which is
probably one of the probably the second
hardest thing to do because we need to
deal with different states and stuff so
we'll get into that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
