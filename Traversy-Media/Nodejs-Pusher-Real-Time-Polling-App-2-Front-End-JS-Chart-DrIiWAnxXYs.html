up our backend with node Express pusher
cores some other stuff and we built the
the form on the front end with
materialise we have our all of our
scripts connected now we want to add the
front-end JavaScript so what we need to
do is when we push this vote button it
needs to make a request to our back-end
to this this route right here this end
point which is slash poll okay and then
pusher is going to trigger an event that
we're going to subscribe to on the front
end and it'll then get the points and
the OS that was submitted and K whatever
OS and also just a message a thank you
message so in our main J s that's on the
front end let's create a variable called
forum and we'll set it equal to document
dot let's use get element by deep
because we gave it an ID of vote - forum
all right and then we're gonna add an
event listener
so we'll say form dot add event listener
and in here we want to listen for a
submit and we'll just put an arrow
function here and let's pass in our
event parameter so we'll just pass in E
and let's do an e dot preventdefault
just to prevent the default behavior and
now this is where we want to make
requests actually before we do that we
need to add a couple more variables one
is going to be the choice now there's a
lot of ways to get the checked value the
older way would be to do like a select
by class name or something like that and
then loop through them grab the correct
value we're gonna use query selector
which makes things a lot easier
so we'll say query selector and we're
gonna grab the input that has the name
equal to OS which is all of them but we
want the checked version so we can use
colon
ok so you can use any kind of selector
that you could eat that you could use in
CSS and this makes it really easy and
then we just want the value okay so you
want to make sure you do dot value
that'll give us our choice and then I'm
gonna create a variable called data
which is just going to be an object that
has OS equal to that choice and that'll
be the data that we send along with our
post request all right so to send our
post requests we're going to use fetch
so we'll say fetch and the URL is going
to be HTTP localhost 3000 slash pol okay
and then we're gonna send a second
parameter with an object and we want to
make sure that this is a post request so
we'll say method equals our method is
post and then we want to send the body
which will contain the data okay now I
want to wrap this data in a function
called JSON dot stringify so we can make
it a JSON string before we send it off
and then we're going to need one more
property here of headers and we want to
set this to new headers and inside here
we're just gonna pass in an object and
let it know that it's jason with by
using content - type and we're gonna set
that to application slash jason all
right now fetch returns a promise so we
want to go right here get rid of that
semicolon and do a dot then I'm actually
going to put that on a separate line I'm
using the prettier extension so if I
save it might yeah it knocks it back up
but just for now I'll go ahead and do
that
so with fetch we have to do two dot
bends because first we have to map it to
the type of data we want to return which
is Jason so res dot Jason and then we
need to do another dot then
okay and then if there's an error we can
do a dot catch as well so this dot then
will actually include the data and all
I'm going to do with this data is
console.log it okay and then for the
catch that'll give us an error if there
is one and then I'll console dot log the
error so that's our request all right
now this is not going to do anything to
do with the chart yet but let's just
save it and let's open up our console
and just make sure we can actually make
that post request so I'll say Windows
and vote and nothing happens let's see
did I include this in the HTML script
source main je s I missing something
here
formed out event listener submit let's
try again oh there we go all right so we
get back success true message thank you
for voting
now it's also triggering push is also
triggering an event right here this OS
poll an OS vote with this data but we're
not catching it yet so what we're going
to do is we're going to implement canvas
je s and build our chart and then we're
gonna basically subscribe to this and
then add those add the data points by
this trigger right here okay so we're
gonna go completely under the form
events actually let's give this a
comment will say form submit event and
we're gonna go all the way down under it
and then we're gonna implement canvas je
s so let's go to canvas je s and just to
give you an idea of how it works we'll
go to the docs and let's see working
with data
basically what we want to do is create
an array called data points and it's
gonna have for instance it'll have label
windows
Abell Mac and then each Y value is that
going to be the number of points which
one point is one vote that's just to
make it easy all right we're gonna start
with all zeros and then once we
implement our database we'll fetch from
the back end the number of votes in the
database and we'll fill that data points
all right but for now let's just create
the data points and I'm using let
because we're gonna actually be changing
this late later on so let's say let data
points equals an array and each one will
have a label so this will be Windows and
they're all gonna have a y-value of 0
that should be a comma all right so
let's put a comma here and let's copy
this down we need 4 of them so this one
will be Mac OS Linux and other alright
so those are our initial data points now
we need to create a variable with our
chart container okay remember in our
index file we have our chart container
ID let's grab that set that to document
dots query selector and it's gonna be
the ID of chart container alright and
then we're gonna just do if chart
container exists then we're going to
create a variable called chart and we're
gonna set it to a new I think it's
canvas J s dot chart pretty sure let me
just yeah right here new canvas J s
chart and then we put the name of the
container in quotes so we'll say chart
container and then we have a second
parameter which will be any any any
objects we want let me just get rid of
this sidebar I'm sorry I said objects
options we want inside of this object so
I do want to do animation enabled which
will give us that little that so the the
chart will slide up the bars we'll set
that to true you can also set the theme
there's theme one theme to I'm just
gonna set it to theme one and then we
can do a title which is actually an
object and I just want it the text now
later on I wanted to actually show the
number of votes but since we don't have
we can't have that yet because we don't
have a database hooked up I'm just gonna
say OS results for now and then we want
our data for the chart which is going to
be an array and we want to put an object
in here with the type okay so it's gonna
be a column chart you can also do a bar
chart I think you can do a pie chart you
can look at the documentation if you
want to learn more about canvas and then
we want our data points which are going
to set to the data points variable or
array that we have above all right then
we want to render our chart which is
going to go right here so chart dot
whoops chart dot render and let's save
that and now if we reload chart is not a
constructor let's see
what do they do wrong Kant's chart
equals new canvas Jo this should be an
uppercase C there we go so it's so now
we have our canvas nothing's going to
happen if we vote we're just going to
get our response down here we need to
implement the subscription down here so
we're gonna go right under the chart
render and if we go to our pusher
dashboard here and we look at the
client-side implementation we're gonna
grab this to log to console this will
basically just show you everything
that's going on in the console we also
need to initialize our app like that and
we then we need to subscribe so we're
gonna actually copy all of that and put
that right here okay your ID app ID will
be different and it's okay to have this
here it's not putting your app secret
anywhere cuz this is the client-side
anyone could see this by just saying
view source but it's okay to just have
this and then when we subscribe we're
not subscribing to my channel or binding
to the event to my event what we want if
we look at our back-end is OS poll an OS
vote all right so we're gonna change
this to OS - poll and we're gonna change
this to OS - vote all right and then for
this we don't want to alert data message
what we want to do is we want to
basically add the data to our chart okay
so the way that we can do that is by
taking our data points we're going to
manipulate the data points array and
that's why I had to use let and not
Const so we're gonna set it to data
points and then we're gonna map through
it we're gonna use the high order
function map and I'm just going to use X
here and then we want to check
to see if the X dot label is equal to
the data dot OS okay and if it is let's
take let's say X dot Y meaning the Y
meaning this this value here so X dot Y
and then we're going to append to it so
plus equals we're going to append data
dot points okay which could be anything
but we remember we set the points to one
so right here each point is one and then
after that we just want to return X okay
if it's not equal so we want an else
here to the data dot OS then we just
simply want to return X and do nothing
else all right and then we need to
re-render the chart so we're gonna go
right here and just say chart dot render
all right let's save so now if we go and
let's just refresh this and now you'll
see we're getting all these logs in the
console because we we said logged a
console but if I go and I vote let's say
windows vote there we go it's put on the
chart if I say Mac vote and we can vote
more than once if you wanted to
implement something so that people can't
vote more than once that's beyond the
scope of this but we can so now you can
see Mac has two windows has one alright
so we now have our real-time
functionality if I were to go to a
different browser
I'm sorry different tab or client
whatever it's gonna start over because
we don't have our votes stored anywhere
all right so what I'll do is reload this
page but if I vote on this page you'll
see it on this one as well all right so
we do have we have the real-time
functionality complete so now what I
want to do in the next video is start to
implement a database on the backend so
that we can save our votes so that this
doesn't happen and we can actually come
and see how many votes there are and
that stuff alright so that's that's
basically how you use pusher for
real-time applications I just want to
take a step further and add a database
so I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
