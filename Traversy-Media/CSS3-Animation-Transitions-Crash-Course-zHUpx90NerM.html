crash course this is a beginner friendly
course and we're gonna look at things
like animation with keyframes as well as
CSS transitions ok we're also gonna
build a pretty simple landing page with
some entry animations so if you're brand
new to CSS I suggest watching my CSS for
absolute beginners video which I'll link
in the description this is kind of a
good next step after watching that video
basically there'll be three parts we're
gonna start off with learning about
keyframes now we're not gonna build
something that is that actually you know
something you would deploy we're just
gonna test some stuff out you see we're
gonna move objects around and change the
shape change the colors things like that
then we're going to move on to
transitions which are basically
animations that need some kind of
trigger such as a hover so you'll see
when we hover over this it'll actually
change the shape it'll change the color
and it will rotate all right now these
are obviously not real projects it's
just to learn once we do that we'll go
in we'll create this landing page where
if I reload you'll see the heading comes
down the paragraph comes in and then the
button fades in and we have a little
transition effect here as well alright
so that's what we'll be doing this video
guys hopefully you enjoy it and let's
get started I want to give a huge shout
out to today's sponsor male tag male tag
is a Chrome extension that allows you to
track your emails in real time for free
it also lets you track other cool things
like link clicks email reopens and even
the device that was used to open your
emails be sure to check out male tag by
clicking the link in the description
below alright guys we're gonna go ahead
and get started here I have Visual
Studio code open on the left here and
google chrome open on the right I have
an empty folder called CSS animations
okay so like I said we're gonna break
this up into three parts we're first
gonna look at an experiment with CSS
keyframes then we're gonna move to
transitions and then we're gonna build
our little landing page alright so first
thing we'll do is create a new file and
I'm gonna call this key frames
dot html' okay so that's our HTML file
and then we're gonna create a CSS file
to go with it which we'll call keyframes
dot CSS all right and we'll just put
some standard HTML and they are using
Emmet whoops this is not the right file
that's CSS we want to go into HTML and
put some basic HTML tags let's say
keyframes and animation and all we're
gonna need here actually in both the the
keyframes and the transitions HTML all
we need is one div with the class of box
everything else is gonna be done in CSS
so let's save this now I'm going to open
this you can just open the HTML file
locally or you can do what I'm doing and
use an extension I'm using live server
for vs code if you want that you can
just search for an install it and that
allows you to just right click and say
open with live server alright so now
we're we have it'll open over here
alright so I'm gonna go ahead and just
close this up okay so now we're gonna go
to our CSS file and from here let's just
add a body style I just want to make the
background dark so I'm gonna say
background 333 which is a dark gray and
you see the sense of using live server
it's gonna auto load alright so let's
add the box class which is the div we we
added and from here we want to give it a
background let's say background white
let's give it a width of let's say 200
pixels a height of 200 pixels and there
we go there's our box okay I also want
to position it relative we're gonna be
moving it around
all right so now we want to start
working with the animation so there's a
couple different properties that we're
going to be using here the first is
animation - name okay and you can call
this whatever you want I'm just going to
call it my animation alright and then
what we want to do is set a duration for
it
so we want to say animation - duration
and I'm going to set this for 4 seconds
so we want to do 4s okay now we want to
take this name that we created and we
want to create a keyframe so we're gonna
go down below here and we're gonna say
at keyframes and then we're gonna put in
my animation okay because that's what we
chose to use your sort of space here
alright now in here we want to specify
different points all right so we're
gonna start at 0%
okay so it's zero percent of this
animation what kind of styles do we want
let's start with just using a background
color so it's a background color and
it's initially white so that's what I'm
gonna use here is white all right and
then let's go right to a hundred percent
so when that when it's finished okay 100
percent is gonna be when it's finished
we're gonna say background yeah
background color also set to white okay
so it's going to start white it's going
to end white now in the process of the
animation within this four seconds here
or whatever you define we want to change
the color okay to some different colors
so let's say a 25% we want to set the
background color to red okay I'm just
gonna copy this so we'll do 25% we'll do
I'm gonna paste this in two more times
we'll do 50% okay so at 50% through
let's change this to green and then at
75% through let's set this to blue
all right so I'm gonna go ahead and save
this and you'll see it goes red green
blue white okay so it goes through it
and it's gonna do it all in four seconds
if I put this to one second and save
you'll see it'll go through it in one
second if I put ten seconds it'll go
very slow okay so it's gonna fade
through those colors so that's how
keyframes work pretty simple now
obviously you can do other properties
aside from just the color so what I want
to do now is in addition to changing the
colors I want to move it around a little
all right so I'm gonna set this back to
four seconds and in addition to will go
to 0% and in addition to background
color we're gonna set the left to zero
pixels okay so basically we want it
starting here zero from the left and
then we want to go from the top zero
pixels okay so we just basically wanted
to start where it is now and then 25%
through we're gonna say from the left we
want it to go 300 pixels and from the
top we want it to go zero pixels because
we wanted to stay at the top we
basically just want to move it over all
right now at 50% we want it to go down
okay because I wanted to go in a square
motion so once it's at 300 pixels left
top zero we want it to go down 300
pixels and still at left 300 pixels so
let's go ahead and add that I'll say
left 300 pixels and top 300 pixels okay
and then from there we wanted to go over
back this way so it'll be zero left
because it's over to the extreme left
but it's still 300 pixels down so we're
gonna set this to left
let's see it'll be left zero pixels and
it'll be top 300 pixels and then the
final position is going to be back where
it started which will be zero zero okay
left:0 top:0 so let's do that
top zero pixels and let's try it so
we'll go ahead and save it it'll it'll
auto load goes down back and up alright
so that that is our animation so you can
see we animated the color and the
position now let's do the radius which
will actually make it morph into a
circle alright so we're gonna add to
this and we're gonna say border radius
and we're gonna set them all to zeros so
zero zero zero zero so top right bottom
left and let's go to the next one here
okay so this one we're gonna set the top
to 50% and then zero zero zero
alright and then at this point which is
the 50% we're gonna set border radius
and we're gonna set it to 50% twice and
then zero zero and then here we'll say
border radius
and it's gonna be 50% three times and
then zero and put a semicolon there and
then for the last one here we're gonna
say border-radius and it's gonna be 50%
all around
so we'll just go like that all right so
let's save and it's gonna go it's just
gonna morph into a circle as it goes
around all right now there's some other
properties we can use so notice how it
only went around once and it's stopped
so you can actually set the the
iteration count so if we go up here and
we say animation - iteration count and
we can set it to whatever we want let's
set it to two and let's save and it
should go around twice okay so it'll
stop after two times and then you can
also set it to infinite I spelt that
wrong didn't I should be an eye so
infinite and it'll just keep going okay
we can also delay the animation
so if we say animation - delay and we
set it to two seconds let's save that
and it'll wait two seconds and then
begin okay we can also set the direction
if we say animation direction and we can
say reverse so now if we save it'll
delay two seconds and then it'll go the
other way so notice that it's now going
counterclockwise alright and then we can
also set this to alternate
so what alternate will do is it'll go
one way the first time I'm actually
going to comment the delay out and then
it'll go the other way okay so it's
gonna go clockwise and then
counterclockwise alright let's see
another thing we can do is the timing
function so if we say animation where is
its timing function and we can set it to
basically ease in or ease out change the
way that it moved so if we set it to
linear I'm actually going to comment out
the dirt the direction here so it's
saved that and now you'll see that
linear it's it's basically at the same
speed all the time okay which starts and
stops at the same speed we can also do
like ease in we'll save that and now you
can see it's easing in it's basically
starting slow and ending fast and we can
go ease out where it'll start fast and
end slow okay ease out and then we also
have ease in and out which I believe is
the default okay it'll it'll basically
you know start slow and end slow so
it'll ease in and out all right and
there's other ones as well if you want
to check out if you want to check out
the documentation at mdn or whatever it
is but I think that that's good let's go
ahead and stop this I'm just gonna say
one for iteration it's kind of making me
dizzy
now if you want it to to not reset at
the end you see how it goes into a
circle and then it just kind of goes
back into a square if you want it to
stay as a circle or whatever type of
animation you're doing then you can do
animation what the heck is it animation
I feel exactly what it's called fill
mode yeah animation film no that's not
it
or is it yeah animation film mode
forwards alright so if we go ahead and
do that when it gets to the end there
you'll see it'll actually stay as a
circle okay let's see I think that's
pretty much it if you want to experiment
with this and you know maybe you want to
take away the the positioning and just
have it morph into a circle or or
something like that or used to use some
other properties maybe the opacity but
you get that you get the point you can
basically just change different
properties inside of your keyframe for
your animation alright actually let's
try it without the without the movement
I'm just going to comment this out and
copy it and then we'll just take out the
positioning
all right so we'll go ahead and try that
I'll save and it'll just morph into a
circle which is pretty cool okay
so I'm gonna save this and I'll have the
link in the description for you guys so
you can download it now we're gonna work
on transitions okay so I'm going to just
close this up I'm gonna copy the HTML
here and then we're gonna create a new
file called transitions dot HTML and
we'll paste that in and we're just going
to change this to title the CSS
transitions and we're going to point to
a file called transitions dot CSS okay
we're gonna leave that the class of box
and then close that up create our CSS
file transitions dot CSS and let's go to
transitions dot HTML and we're just
gonna get a blank page so again I want
to make the body dark I just think it
looks a little cooler
so we'll say background 333 and then
we're gonna take our box class and we're
gonna add some stuff here let's do the
background will say background white and
let's do a width of 300 a height of 300
but I should be putting spaces here
let's put position:relative and I want
to set the margin Auto I want it I want
it to go in the middle and then I'm
gonna set from the top 200 pixels all
right we'll save that now we have a
white square in the middle so as I said
before transitions are a little
different because they need some kind of
trigger this is usually a hover or an
active State
a focus State something like that so
we're gonna work with hover alright so
let's go ahead and
say box hover okay and then we're gonna
change some values here let's change the
background color will say background red
alright so even without adding a
transition if I go whoops this shouldn't
shouldn't be a space here if I go and I
hover over it it's gonna turn red but
there's no transition there's no middle
point it's just it's it's straight white
to red
okay so transitions allow us to give us
some some some flow to it I guess I
don't know if that's the right word but
to go you know from from white to a
lighter red to a tool to a docker add to
a darker red until it gets to the actual
red color okay same thing with some of
the other properties and I'm actually
gonna paste in here just all of the
different properties that you can use
with transitions okay basically they
have to be properties that have an
identifiable halfway point so it can't
be just like for instance display it's
either none or block there's no in
between okay if you want to do some kind
of fade then you can use the opacity
okay but you're not gonna use display so
let me just paste these in just so you
guys have it you know color positioning
the width spacing font size all of this
stuff has some kind of midpoint it's not
just one or the other all right so you
can use any of these in a transition so
let's go ahead and add to our box class
here we're gonna say transition property
so we want to define what property we
want to actually add to this transition
and it's going to be the background okay
we also want to set a duration so I'm
going to say transition duration and
we'll set that to let's say 3 seconds
okay and then I'm gonna save that and
then when I hover over it you'll see
that it fades in to the red instead of
just going white to red automatically it
fades in and then fades out when I leave
the hover State
all right and it doesn't have to be
hover active we can use active which is
when we click on it
so if I click if I keep clicking you'll
see that it'll get darker and darker
alright and then if I stop clicking
it'll go back but I'm just gonna keep it
at hover okay and I'm gonna change it to
one second actually it's a little too
slow alright so that's the background
now we can add other properties as well
so let's do the let's do the border
radius so I'm going to put a comma here
saying we also want to transition the
border radius so border radius and then
down here in the box hover we're gonna
say border radius and we're gonna set
this to 50% alright so let's go ahead
and hover over it and now you'll see
it'll morph into a circle and back which
looks kind of cool alright now we can
set things here like delay we can set
the transition delay let's say we wanted
to lay it to seconds so now whoops what
I do alright so it actually fades in as
well
but if I hover hover over it it'll wait
two seconds and then it'll go okay you
can also change the timing function for
transitions just like we did with the
animations so transition timing function
and we can say linear there's a bunch of
them but you can see that the it also
delays going back but you can see the
movements a little different we can do
like ease-in ease-out it's two E's in
I'm gonna take the delay off actually
all right so kind of ease is it you see
how it starts slow and then it ends up
going fast so I mean there's a lot of
different timing functions you can look
that stuff up if you want to check the
different ones out but yeah so that's
transitions now if you wanted to set for
instance a duration to be different for
the background and then for the border
radius we could add a comma here the
first this would be for the background
and then the border radius we'll say
three seconds okay so we can separate
the duration for the different
animations so you'll see in one second
it'll go to read and it'll take three
seconds to actually make the circle and
you can do the same thing with the delay
if you want to delay the border radius
four seconds you could do that and the
background would only delay two seconds
okay so let's do a rotate or transform
rather so we're gonna add up here we're
going to say transform and down here
we'll say transform and we're gonna say
we want this whoops we want this to
rotate Y and let's rotate it 180 degrees
so we'll save that and I'll go and hover
over it and it'll do the little rotate
which is cool now if you don't want to
separate like if you don't want
different durations or delays and stuff
if we want just one second for
everything like that then we don't have
to specify all these properties we can
actually you know I'm gonna do those
just comment this out so you guys have
it but we can just do all so we can go
like that and save and you'll see that
it'll all just work together okay it'll
cradled it'll animate all of these and
it'll all have the same duration and
stuff okay so I would encourage you guys
to just experiment with this you know
these types of videos where we're not
building an actual project this is for
learning purposes
for you to you know try to get your own
ideas and create some cool stuff you
know and do do some a little more
research you know this is just a kind of
a beginner type crash course there's a
lot that you can do all right so that's
for that's it for transitions now we're
gonna build our little landing page so
I'm gonna create a new file and I'm
gonna call this landing dot HTML and
let's create another file called landing
dot CSS okay so the HTML we're gonna put
in our standard tags here title will
just say landing page and we're gonna
link a stylesheet and it's gonna be
landing dot CSS all right now for the
markup well it's not going to be too
difficult we're just going to put in a
header and we're gonna give this an idea
of showcase and inside here we're just
gonna have an h1 and we're gonna say
welcome to my site under the header
we're gonna have a div with an ID of
content and I'm gonna give it a class of
container as well okay and then we're
just gonna say lorem 50 tab which if
you're using Emmet like I am it'll just
give you 50 words of dummy text okay and
then we're going to put in an a tag and
we're gonna give this a class of BTN all
right that's not really gonna go
anywhere and for the text we'll just say
read more all right so now we'll go to
landing dot HTML and it should look like
this so let's go to our landing CSS and
we're gonna add some styles here I want
to zero out the margin and padding for
everything so I'm just going to use a
reset by putting an asterisk here and
saying margin zero and
padding:0 okay and then for the body
let's see for the body we're gonna add
my well we don't need margin:0
let's do font-family so for font family
I'm just gonna say arial helvetica
sans-serif we're gonna set the
background color let's set that to a
hexadecimal value of 1 2 4 7 5 F which
is a bluish color so we'll save that
let's set the color of the text to white
and let's set the line height to 1.6 and
we're gonna set text align to Center I
want the whole site centered alright so
there we go now we're gonna do the
container okay so the the paragraph has
a container class and I'm just going to
set a max width of 960 pixels and we're
gonna set the margin to auto so it's
pushed to the middle and then we're just
going to add some padding I'm gonna put
30 pixels on the left and right alright
so we'll save that let's see what else
so now for the showcase which is the
header
okay so for the showcase all I want to
do is set a height I can't spell hei ght
height is gonna be 300 pixels and save
alright so now we have our showcase with
the height now we're going to work with
the h1 which is in the showcase so
showcase h1 and in here let's let's set
the font size to 50 pixels I'm gonna
just set the line height cannot spell
height today for some reason 21.3 yeah
let's do 1.3 save that and we're gonna
set the position to relative all right
so now we want to start our animation so
we're going to be using keyframes
basically what I want to do is I want
this to come in from the top and just
slide down okay slide down to to this
area here so we're gonna say animation
and this is gonna be pretty easy it's
gonna be easier than the stuff that we
just did we'll call this heading okay
and then we're gonna go right under the
showcase h1 and create a keyframe so
we'll say keyframes heading and we're
just gonna have two points so we're
gonna have 0% and we're gonna have 100%
alright I know we had a lot more the
last time but we only need two points
when it's when it starts and when it
ends here so we wanted to start above
the fold right here where it's kind of
like out of sight so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna set top to negative 50
pixels okay
and then when it's at a hundred percent
I wanted to move down 200 pixels
so we'll say top 200 pixels whoops
all right so it's saved that now it's
not gonna work yet because we need a
duration so we're gonna go up and say
animation duration and let's make this
three seconds all right so if we save
that it's gonna come down and it's gonna
go back to its original state
okay now remember we have a property for
that called animation film mode and we
want to set that to four words
so let's say animation film mode for
words save and now it's gonna come down
and it's gonna stay in its place all
right so that's the first animation the
next one we want to do is the content we
want this to come in from the left so
let's go down here and let's say id
content and we're gonna set the position
to relative and set animation name I'll
set it to content set the duration to
we'll set it to the same thing 3 seconds
and you guys can experiment with this
and then we wanted to stay so we're
going to do the film load of four words
okay and then we'll create our keyframe
what I'm gonna do is just copy this and
this is gonna be keyframe content and
except this time we're not coming from
the top or coming from the left and we
need it to be way over here and it's
it's it's quite wide so what I'm gonna
do is set this to negative 1000 pixels
okay and then for the hundred percent
we're gonna set the left to zero like
that
all right so our semicolons in here so
let's save that so that comes down that
comes in and that's good all right so
now we want to do the button so that has
a class of BTN and let's say this this
we want to display as an inline block
okay we want it to go on on the next
line like a block but we don't want it
to go all the way across so we wanted it
as inline block alright we'll set the
color of the text and the button to
white
let's do text-decoration:none because we
don't want the underlined let's give it
a padding of one R M on the top and
bottom to R M on the sides what else
we're gonna give it a border of white
one pixels and solid alright and then
let's give it a margin top move it down
a little bit
forty pixels and save okay so right now
you know it's it's just gonna be there
when the site loads and that's that's
not what we want so let's set the
opacity to zero and that's gonna make it
invisible so we can't see it at all all
right and then what we want to do is add
our animation so we'll say animation
name is gonna be BTN we'll set the
duration so duration we're gonna set it
to three seconds now I don't want this
to fade in while these are coming down I
want it to be afterwards so we know that
the duration of these two or three
seconds so let's set the delay to three
seconds because that's when we want this
to start all right so set that to three
seconds so we also want to set the fill
mode to four words and see yeah we'll do
that and then down here we want to set
our keyframes I'm gonna copy this this
is going to be BTN and instead of doing
positioning for these what we're doing
is opacity all right so zero percent
we're starting at zero opacity so
completely transparent and then by the
end by a hundred percent we want it to
be one which is obviously in full
you all right so let's go ahead and save
it's gonna animate those two three
seconds and then that button comes in
all right so that's exactly what we want
and then just to add that little
transition that little flip we can say
transition - property and we're going to
set it to transform and let's set
transition - duration - one second and
then we're just gonna add a hover State
so BTN hover and let's set the transform
to rotate y 180 degrees all right let's
try it so we'll save you have our
initial animation button comes in if we
hover over it we get the little flip
effect all right so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this and you learned a little
something and again I'd encourage you to
to explore and an experiment for
yourself with some of these animations
and this is just a basic introduction
and yeah you may want to you know look
at some blog posts or you know some
articles that have to do with with CSS
animation if it's something you're
interested in I know I've done videos on
on some libraries like animate dot CSS
and that stuff makes this easier I think
we actually did something similar to
this with animate CSS but this shows you
how to do it with just you know just
core CSS not having to use a library so
hopefully you know you can appreciate
that but thanks for watching if you
liked it please leave a like if you're
not subscribed and you like these types
of videos please subscribe and I will
see you next time so I just want to give
another shout out to male tag who
