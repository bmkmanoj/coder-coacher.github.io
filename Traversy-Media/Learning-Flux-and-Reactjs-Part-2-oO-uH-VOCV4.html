learning flux and react in the last
video we went ahead and created all of
the files and folders for the flux
boiler application and now what we're
gonna do is just add some code alright
so we're gonna start out with the HTML
all right so index.html and this file is
gonna be very very simple alright so
we're going to just add some base HTML
here and for the title will say flux
boiler alright and we need to include
our style sheets so link rel stylesheet
and this is gonna be for bootstrap dot
CSS actually that's gonna be in CSS
slash bootstrap and let's just grab that
real quick did I already put it in there
no I didn't alright so we'll go to get
bootstrap
all right so let's open that up okay and
we're just gonna grab just a CSS file
that's all we really need all right so
let's see flux Euler and we're gonna put
this in the CSS folder okay just like
that
let's see next thing you know what while
we're at it let's grab jQuery now jQuery
is gonna go in let me close some of
these up real quick okay so jQuery is
gonna go in our source JavaScript and
then vendors
okay so we'll grab that let's just grab
the compressed version looks like I
already have it there oops I don't want
to open it
let's see all right so let's grab that
put it over in vendors all right so
under the bootstrap CSS let's put in our
style CSS all right now as for the body
all we're gonna have in this file is a
div and we're gonna give it an ID of app
okay this is where our core application
component will be going okay I react
component and then down at the bottom
inside the body we're going to include a
couple scripts so this is gonna be J s
slash jQuery dot dash 1 dot 12.0 I
believe is that when it's 1 12 0 yep and
that's gonna be the minified version
okay and then the next script we're
gonna need is our main J s so this will
be our compiled file some people call it
bundle J s or index I usually choose
main alright and that's all we need in
our index file
so we can close that up so now what
we'll do is we'll go and start from the
top here let's go to actions and then
app actions dot J s and what we need to
do here is we need to include the
dispatcher and also the constants file
all right so we're going to create a
variable called app dispatcher and we're
going to set it to require and we'll
pass in dot dot slash we want to go
outside of this folder and then into
dispatcher and then after
dispatch rjs actually I'm sorry we don't
need the J s alright so that'll include
the dispatcher then we also need the
constants and you don't need a constants
file you could just put the string the
actual string but it's it's a lot
cleaner to have an object that holds all
of your constants so that's recommended
and that's gonna go in constants and app
constants all right then we need an
object to hold all of our actions so
this is going to be app actions and
we're gonna set that for now just to an
empty object and then we need to export
it so that it's available outside of
this file so let's say module exports
equals app actions alright and that's it
for now so let's go ahead and save that
next thing let's do the dispatcher now
the code in the dispatcher
we're not once we write it we're not
going to need to touch it at all all
right so you don't really need to
totally understand it because we're not
going to be dealing with it but the
first thing we want to do is record is
require the dispatcher and that comes
from the flux module that with that
we're going to install that we put in
our dependencies so what we want to do
is say require flux and then we want to
say dot dispatcher all right just like
that and then we also need that object
assign module I'm sorry about that
so a sign equals require let me just put
that on vibrate okay so require object
to sign
all right and you'll see why we need
that we need to create a variable called
app dispatcher equals a sign and then
here we're gonna say new dispatcher and
then the second parameter here is going
to be an object and this is where we're
gonna create our handle view action all
right and that's gonna be a function and
we're going to pass in the action all
right and then what we'll do is we're
going to have to send a payload that has
the the string or the constant and then
the action so we're going to create a
variable called payload and that's gonna
be an object itself and I'm gonna say
source view action and we want to send
along the actual action all right and
then we just need to call this dot
dispatch okay so this starts
dispatch and we want to send the payload
all right and then the last thing we
need to do here is just export so module
dot exports equals app dispatcher and
that's it we don't have to touch this at
all so we'll save that now the constants
file is also really simple all we're
going to have here is module dot exports
and that's going to be an object of
constants so for instance we might have
add form so we would say add form and
then we put in the string add form all
right something like that so I'm gonna
just get rid of that save it and that's
it for now
so now let's take a look at the the
components okay we got components and
then we have app KS so every part of our
application in the interface is gonna be
its own component but they're all going
to be nested inside of the app component
all right so there's a few things we
need to do here one sec all right so we
need to include react so we're gonna
save our react require react and we need
to include our actions so we'll say app
actions equals require and then in here
we're gonna pass in dot dot slash
actions
oops ah
all right actions slash app actions all
right and we also want to include the
store so we're gonna say app store
require and we want to go out of the
fist directory into stores and then into
app store yeah just like that all right
so we need to create a variable called
app for our component and that's going
to equal to the act I can't type today
so react dot create class and if you are
familiar with react and this should you
should know this should be recognized
you should know what this is we're just
creating react component alright and
there's a bunch of different life cycle
methods that you can use here but the
one that's actually required is render
okay you want to render the component so
that's gonna be a function all right and
when you render something you have to
return it alright and when you return
something it has to be a single element
all right and then you have everything
else inside there we couldn't say div
and then put like a UL here it has to be
oops it has to be just one element
you're returning so we'll say my app now
when we're working with state in react
there's a lifecycle method that we can
create called get initial state and
that's where you can set initial States
all right so basically defaults for your
different state objects so let's get the
initial State
function okay put a comma there and
normally you would say return and you
would return for instance I don't know
maybe you have a post state and you'd
have whatever some kind of function
that's going to return post what we're
gonna do here is return a function
called get app state all right and then
we're going to create that that's where
we're gonna put our initial state so say
function get app state all right and
then you want to return an object with
all your states all right but for now
we're just gonna leave that alright in
order for us to actually set the states
that we put in here we need to put
another function down here and we're
gonna call this one underscore on change
all right and that's gonna be a function
and we're gonna say this dot set state
and then pass in our get app state
function all right now we're in with a
regular react application you would call
this from wherever you want to set the
state but we're not going to do that
we're gonna be using the store to set
our state's so we'll be calling App
Store dot and then whatever function we
want and then we can set the state from
there all right so hopefully that's
clear and then we just want to export it
so we're gonna say module dot exports
equals app alright and that should do it
for now so let's save that so we're
gonna go ahead and stop here and then in
the next part we'll be creating our
store which is where the majority of the
code is going to be alright so I will
see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
