to take a couple minutes to introduce my
latest udemy course which is myrn stack
front to back and I've been talking
about this for a while a lot of you guys
are asking for and have been waiting for
it and it you can see it's not published
yet but by the time you're watching this
video it will be published and available
all right so just to give you a little
information about the course
it says 149 here but I'm putting a link
in the description to get it for just 10
bucks
udemy you know you put crazy prices and
then they they market down 85 percent so
don't worry about that price no one is
paying that price but basically we have
16 and a half hours of content and we're
building one single application and
that's that's exactly what I wanted to
do I did not want to do like a four or
five to do list type projects I wanted
to do something that's actually gonna
help you in your career and help you
understand how to put together something
of substance something that you would
really do in the real world so we're
gonna build a small social network for
developers called dev connector alright
and obviously we'll use node and Express
on the backend will use react and redux
on the front end and MongoDB for our
database alright so we're gonna start
off with the backend building up all of
our API routes and endpoints we're using
JWT JSON web tokens for authentication
along with Passport
we're gonna create some in-depth
validation server-side validation once
that's done we'll start on react in the
front end we have authentication so
basically we'll we'll get our token from
the back end and then we'll store that
so that we can use that to access
protected routes from our front end okay
then we'll work on the dashboard which
you can see is quite a few videos we
have two parts to creating our dashboard
and I'm going to show you the
application in a second we have our
profile display our posts and comments
will be users will be able to create
posts they'll be able to like posts and
stuff like that and then we'll prepare
and deploy our app to Heroku
all right so let's quickly take a look
at the application this is the landing
page it's a custom bootstrap floor theme
it's a pretty simple theme over here I
have the redux extension open so you can
kind of see what what's going on as we
move through the application basically
we have a landing page and if you want
to create a profile or an account of
course you have to log you have to sign
up and log in but you can view
developers view their profiles without
having to log in and you can see over
here and redux
we had the profile loading action run
get profiles you can see how state down
here so basically if we look in our
profile state we have these two guys
here and all the fields and if I click
on View profile it'll take us to the
single profile we're using Gravatar for
the profile image so if you just use an
email that's associated with Gravatar
then it will use that image as your
profile okay as your profile image and
you have information like your status
your company your location your social
network links your bio skill set you can
add you can add experiences so you can
see the two jobs here education so if
you if you went to a college or a boot
camp you can add that to your profile if
you want to add your github latest five
github repositories you can just simply
put in your github username and it'll
reach out to that API and pull those in
to your profile so pretty extensive
profile for you know for a course
application now if we go to sign up and
I'm just gonna click Submit you can see
we have some really good validation here
everything gets put into the error State
so if we go to errors you can see all
these errors coming from the server side
and then we're gonna output them through
the bootstrap template okay are the
bootstrap theme if I go to login and I
try to log in with an account that
doesn't exist you'll see we get user not
found so we're just going to reach to
the back end and then send the errors
back through Redux and through the
reducer all right if I put a user that
does exist
and with the wrong password of course
we'll get password and correct let's go
ahead and actually log in and then this
is the dashboard alright so from your
dashboard you can edit your profile and
you can see there's quite a bit of
fields here you have a handle for SEO so
you can go to slash profile slash Brad
traversée or whatever you want for your
handle you can choose your status junior
developer or senior developer and so on
your company website all this stuff your
skills which will get turned into an
array if we look at our profile right
here we look at skills you can see that
that's actually an array down here if
you want to add social media links you
can click that and toggle these fiea
these input fields here so there's a lot
that goes into this ok there's a lot of
different fields a lot of data if you
want to add an experience or a piece of
education college or bootcamp or
something you can do that very easily
just give it a quick example here so you
can choose a date you can also make it
current and then it will gray gray the
to date out but I'm gonna just choose a
date here and submit and you can see
that that gets added to the experience
if I go to my profile and go down to
experience you can see that that's been
added there as well alright and I can
easily go back to my dashboard and
delete that experience ok and you can do
the same with with education alright now
for the posts if I go to post feed it's
basically like a very very simplified
version of Stack Overflow we just create
a post people can like that you like the
posts they can leave comments you can
see if I go ahead and I click light the
like the thumb will turn green and I
can't like it more than once because
what's happening is it's putting my user
ID into the likes array and I can
actually show you that in redux right
here so if we look at post and let's go
to posts and just choose one of these
you'll see it has an array of likes
which has the has an ID of its own and
it has the user so it's gonna check to
see if you already have a like in the
and you're not going to be able to do it
more than once okay if I unlike then the
thumb will go back to gray and if I
click on comments it'll take us to the
single post I can say this is a comment
and submit and there we go and of course
since it's my comment I can delete it
same thing with the post notice that any
post that his mind has a delete next to
it so I can easily delete my own posts
and that's pretty much it okay up here
you can see we have the little Gravatar
and we can log out and we can't access
any protected pages if I try to go to
dashboard without being logged in it
just kicks me back to the login page
alright so in a nutshell that's what
we'll be building it may seem simple but
it's gonna take us 16 and a half hours
to build it because we're building
everything everything from scratch the
entire back-end all the endpoints all
the testing through postman all the
authentication with JSON web token and
passport so there there's a lot that
that's going to go into this okay on top
of that of course we have Redux you have
to create our reducers and actions we're
gonna create a post build script so that
when we deploy to Heroku react actually
gets compiled and built on the server
instead of us having to do it manually
and then deploying it so a lot of stuff
like that and it's gonna be I think you
guys would really like it
and like I said I mean it's it's it's
gonna help you if you have experience
with react and note at least the basics
but if you do if you're really good with
JavaScript then you should be alright
you should be able to follow along
because like I said I try to explain
everything the best I can all right so
check it out if you're interested
there'll be a link in the description
for just $9.99 and that's it thanks guys
and hopefully I'll see you in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
