be building a recipe application using
nodejs and PostgreSQL all right now
we're using postgrads because i wanted
to kind of change it up a little bit and
you know vert way from MongoDB and some
of the other popular new SQL databases
that are often used with node and just
to show you that you can use relational
databases as well so MySQL postgrads and
all you have to do really is just use
some kind of client and we're going to
be using this Brian C slash node
postgrads client and this has some good
examples and documentation that you can
check out all right now this this series
is actually one of twelve project course
on nodejs that I have so if you enjoy
this series I would definitely suggest
checking that course out right now it's
only 29 bucks and this does 12 of these
projects so it's packed with information
just go ahead and use the affiliate link
in the description all right so let's
take a look at the application you can
see we're listing some recipes here if
we wanted to add a recipe it's going to
open up a modal we're using bootstrap so
we'll just say test recipe and just test
and save and you can see it adds it now
the the order I have it in right now is
reverse alphabetical but that can be
changed and then if we want to check out
the recipe so we can click on one of
these arrows and that will open up kind
of a little drop-down and it has
ingredients and the directions and then
we can also edit if we want so let's go
ahead and edit this one we'll just say
test recipe edited and save and now you
can see that that's edited okay if we
want to delete it simply click the
delete it's going to do a confirmation
and it deletes it alright so very simple
but it you know I'll show you how to
work with nodejs along with Postgres now
this video was made a couple months ago
but I don't believe there's been any
major updates where the syntax won't
work or anything like that if there is
just leave a comment and I'll try and
help you guys
all right so thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
