nighter blog application it's been a
little while since the last video so I
apologize for that I've just been really
busy so what we're going to do in this
video is we're going to finally add a
login and registration system because up
to this point anyone can go to the
application create a post category they
can also edit the posts okay whether
they're both they can't be logged in
because we haven't added that yet so we
want to fix that we want to add a login
system I'm not sure if this this will be
all in one video or another video but we
want to get this set up alright so first
thing I'm going to do is set this create
the users table because right now we
don't have a place to store users we
have our post comments and categories
table so what I'll do is we're just
going to go and add a new table let's
call it users and I'm going to give it
seven columns and let's see we want the
ID which is going to be an int it's
going to be auto increment and primary
key we want a name for our user so
that's going to be varchar' 255 I also
want to do zip code in case we want to
do something with authentication later
on alright I'm just going to make all of
these 255 all the varchar' alright let's
let's see what else we need email we
need a username and what else email
username password which will be
encrypted we don't want to store plain
text passwords and then let's do
registered date which is going to be a
timestamp if I can find it timestamp and
we're going to set the default to the
current times timestamp all right so
that's our users table let's go ahead
and save it okay and then the next thing
we want to do is go to the post table
and we need to make it so that the
system knows what user added what posts
that way they can only delete and edit
their own
posts so what we'll do is go to
structure and then we're going to go to
let's see we're going to go here and say
after categoryid I want to put it right
here we want to add one column and this
is going to be the user underscore ID
column which is going to be an integer
we can leave all that and click Save
okay so now our database should be all
set let's go into sublime text or
whatever editor you're using and what
I'm going to do is create a user's
controller okay so we'll go into
controllers new file and let's save this
as users dot PHP all right so let's
throw our PHP tag in there and we're
going to say class users which needs to
extend or extend the CI underscore
controller which is the base controller
and then let's do public function and
we'll say register okay so this is going
to be for the user to register and this
this function is going to handle not
only the display of the the registration
page loading the view but also the
submission we want to do our form
validation and stuff just like we did
with creating a post or creating a
category so we have dynamic titles so
let's say data title so we can change
that if we want and this is just going
to say sign up okay and then what we
need to do is set all of our validation
rules so let's say this form validation
and let's say set rules and the name and
then the readable version which will
just have an uppercase n and then the
rules which we just want to have
required all right so I'm going to copy
that
all right so we have name we also want
user name that's going to be required
and let's see what else email I guess we
won't make the zip code required some
people may not want to share that
password and see this is going to be for
password too because we want them to
confirm I confirm that password and for
this we'll just say confirm password and
that's going to be required but we want
this to match this okay we want to make
sure the confirmed password matches this
one and there's actually a rule that we
can that we can enter for that so in
here we're going to say matches and then
some brackets and we want to match the
password field so this should match this
okay so that takes care of our rules now
we want to basically say if the form is
submitted then we want to keep going if
not or if there's some errors then we
want to just load the view okay just
keep the views loaded so let's say if
this is going to have an else and let's
see we're going to say this this
underscore I'm sorry not on the score
this arrow form validation and then we
just want to do run and we're going to
say if that is equal to false then that
means we just want to reload the view so
we'll say this load view and we want our
header loaded first so that's going to
be in template slash header and if
you've been following along you should
know exactly what we're doing here we've
done it before
so the footer is going to be here and
then the main view which is going to be
in a folder called users and then a
template called register
okay we just want to pass along the data
and then this is going to be we'll just
say for now continue alright so let's go
ahead and save that and then what we'll
do is create our registration template
so let's go down to views and go in
views and create a new folder called
users and in here let's create a file
and we're going to save this as register
dot PHP so let's first output our title
which is actually generated in the
controller so we just want to output
here we just want to do title which is
that what we were doing we're reusing
those the shorthand yeah okay so now we
need a place for the validation errors
to output if there are any so we're
going to save PHP let go validation
errors okay so if there are any errors
they'll spit out here then we want to
create our form all right now I'm going
to use the form helper here so we can
just do form underscore open and
actually no we don't need multi-part
when our out we're not doing any images
all right so that's going to be
submitted to users slash register which
is the function we just created and then
we'll close the form down here so we
should be able to do echo form close
alright so in here we're going to have
all of our fields that and each one will
be wrapped in a div with a class of form
group
now that should be a - all right so form
group and let's put in our label which
will be named and then under the label
we'll have our input and that's going to
have a type of text class of form
control we're using bootstrap and let's
see a name of name and a placeholder and
we'll just say name all right so those
are our first input let's just tab this
over and then we're just going to copy
this paste it in couple more times so
after name we're going to have our zip
code okay after zip code we'll do the
email I'm actually going to change the
type to email as well
and then we'll do user name and password
okay change the type to password and
then this is going to be the confirmed
password and we're going to give that a
name of password to alright and then the
last thing we need is a submit button so
it's a button type this is Nick and
let's also give us a bootstrap class so
that's going to have a class of BTN and
then BTN primary whoops okay and then in
here we'll just say submit so there's
our form let's go ahead and save it now
we should be able to view it if we go to
see I blog slash users slash register
and there we go there's our signup form
and if we try to submit we're going to
get these errors because we have the
form validation incorporated and let's
try to submit and pass email just leave
Brad at Gmail it's not my real email
address but that's alright okay so
everything should be okay we submit and
we get the die function with continue
good so that's all set so now we want to
go back to our controller and go into
the register but we want to go where we
have this die continue if you want to
get rid of that so before we actually
submit through the model we want to
encrypt the password and we're just
going to use md5 encryption it's not the
strongest but it is extremely easy so
let's say encrypt
password and all we need to do is create
a new variable we'll call it Inc
underscore password and we're going to
set it to M md5 function which is a PHP
function and it will encrypt whatever we
pass in here we want the value of the
form so we can say this input from a
post and we want this to be the password
field okay so that should encrypt it and
then what we want to do is call our user
model to actually do the submission
because the model is where you do all
the database interaction so let's do
this and we can call the user model and
we're going to have a function in there
called register okay and then we just
want to pass in the encrypted password
now we could have done the password
encryption in the model and not have
passed it in but I like to follow some
of the MVC rules I guess you could call
them and that is to do anything that's
not to do with the database such as
insert select and all that that stuff
should go in the model anything that's
not that should go in the controller
including encryption so that's why I'm
doing it here you could just as well do
it in the model though there's no it's
all preference there's no solid way to
do it okay
so then after we do that we want to
redirect that to let's say the post page
okay now up to this point we haven't
been we haven't been working with any
kind of messages so for instance after
we submit a post we haven't made it say
you know your posts has been submitted
or anything like that so what we can do
is we can load the session library and
that has a function that we can use to
create flash messages so basically what
that means is we can set a message here
and then redirect and then have that
caught on the other side of the redirect
and then displayed all right we're also
going to need the session library to
actually handle the you know when we log
in we need to
store that information somewhere and
that's going to be in a session so we
want to load that library we could do it
here but I want it loaded across the
whole application so we're going to go
to config auto load dot PHP and we're
going to go to see it's a library so we
want to put it right here okay session
now we can use sessions it's as easy as
that
so we'll close that up and then to set a
message before we redirect we can do
this session and the function is called
set flash data okay and then it's going
to take in basically an ID we're going
to say user registered and then the
second parameter will be the message
that you want to send so we're going to
say you are now logged in or not logged
in registered so you are now registered
and can login so let's save that and
then let's say I think that's that's it
for the controller now we need to go to
our model okay I'll create our model so
in the models folder just like we did
with posts and categories we're going to
create a new one and we're going to save
this as user underscore model dot PHP
okay now here we're going to put in our
PHP tag and let's create a class user
model and we want that to extend CI
model which is the base model and then
let's let's create our register function
and remember this gets that encrypted
password as a parameter
okay we're calling this right here
passing in the encrypted password oops
and then what we want to do is create
our data array so let's say data and set
that to array and then we're going to
have all of our fields in here so we
have the name and then we can access
access the post values that are
submitted with this input and then the
name
I'm sorry nothing anything post and then
the name alright so we're setting this
to whatever is typed in in the name
field and we want to do the same for the
rest of the fields which I'm just going
to paste in alright so the email we're
also getting from the form the username
however the password we're getting that
ink password and I don't need this right
here okay so that's going to be the
encrypted password that goes in there
and then the zip code alright and then
once we have that we can do the insert
so let's say return we want to return
this DB insert and this is going to go
on the table called users and we just
want to pass in the data and that will
do it so let's save that and then let's
try this out Oh actually I want to add a
link up here to register so let's go to
header which is in views where is it
templates header.php well we also need
to spit out the messages that's the
flash messages that we want and we're
actually going to do that in this file
okay first we'll add the link so I want
it on the right side so let's just copy
one of these
paste that in here register and then
this is going to go to users slash
register now I'm going to have
everything shown at first register login
create all this but once we get the
login down we're only going to show for
instance the login and register links if
the user isn't logged in and we only
want these to show if the user is logged
in but for right now everything is going
to display now as far as the flash
messages we want to go down in this
container so this will basically be
right under the nav bar but on but above
the content and then we want to check
we'll just put a comment there we first
want to check for the message so let's
say if this is going to be the syntax
here
all right so if this session flash data
and we want to check for a user
registered okay and if that's found then
we want to say PHP echo and in here
we're going to put paragraph of the
class of alert and alert success okay if
it's an error you probably want to use a
larger but this is just a message so we
want to use success which will make it
green okay and then inside here let's go
ahead and just concatenate this session
flash data
and user registered all right so we're
checking for the this right here if
that's found then we're going to spit
that out right here okay and then before
we do anything we test this out I want
to just add some messages elsewhere so
for instance in posts we want to put one
when we create a post so this is the
create function right here and we want
to go down right before we redirect and
I'm just going to copy from users this
right here okay so paste that in and
then this one will call let's see we'll
just say create or now let's do post
created and here we'll just say your
post has been created okay and then
let's see we'll also do it for the
update so right before the redirect
paste that in and then this one will
call post updated and for the message
we'll just say my post has been updated
and then I want to do it for the
category as well so if we go to
controllers categories which and then go
to the create function again right
before we redirect paste that in and
we'll call this one category created and
we'll say your category has been created
all right so now we set that part of it
now we need to go back to header.php and
catch all of those so I'm going to copy
this paste it in three times and then
this one is going to be post created
and then let's see this one will be post
updated and then this one will be
category created and then we should also
do one for the post delete so let's go
back to the post controller copy that
and then for delete I'll call this one
post deleted you'll say your post has
been deleted
alright and then back in header we'll
paste that in alright so that should add
all the messaging now we can get back to
the registration so now we have this
link we click that go ahead and fill
this out email username I'm just going
to use Brad and then password one two
three four five six submit that's all
you know what we didn't load we didn't
load the user model that we created so
let's go to config auto load and go down
to the bottom and where we have our
other models it's a user model alright
and then we can reload continue you are
now registered and can login so let's
check that in database we go to users
there it is ID name zip code email
username and check the password out
that's hashed to md5 hash and the
registration date now before we go and
get into the next video which will be
the login we want to make it so that I
use
I can't register a user name or an email
that's already been taken now we can do
this by adding our own custom validation
rule so let's go to so you want to go to
our users controller let's just get out
of all of these
so users controller and we're going to
go up to the validation rules here and
let's go to user name so we made it
required but we want to add another one
so we're going to put a pipe character
in here and then we're going to say
callback underscore check underscore
user name underscore exists so this is
going to be a custom validation that
we're going to set and we need to put
this callback underscore before the
actual function name so now we want to
do is go down here and create a new
function so we want to go right under
the register will say check if the
username exists and the function is
going to be called check user name
exists what's the hell is that
okay now this we can pass in a parameter
which will be the actual text that's
passed in so we're just going to call it
user name and then we need to set a
message that we want for this if it is
actually true so let's say this form
validation and then we want to use the
set message function okay it needs an ID
which is going to be check user name
exists and then the second parameter
will be the actual message so we'll say
that user name is taken and it's also
safe please choose a different one okay
so that's the message now we need the
actual logic so we're going to do the
database check in our model so let's put
an if statement here
if elves and we want to check this user
model and we're going to have a function
in there also called check username
exists okay we're going to pass in that
username value and then if that's true
then we're going to say return true if
not return false
okay so let's save that and create the
model function or method whatever you
want to call it so it's a public
function check user name exists okay
which will get passed in the user name
or whatever the user types in and what
we want to do is just run a query so I'm
going to create a query variable and say
this DB and we want to use get we're
kind of using active record here
actually that shouldn't be it all
actually that should so this DV get
where and we want to specify the table
we want to look in which is users and
then we want an array of data that we
want to match okay so we want to match
the user name and we want to match that
to whatever is passed in here okay so we
need to put that right there and then
we're going to check to see if it's as
the result is empty or not so let's say
if empty query row array because it's
going to give us an array of results if
it is empty let's return true if not
then we will return false
all right so pretty simple it's just
going to reach in and look for that user
by its username oops I forgot the E and
then it's going to give us the results
we're going to check to see if the
results are empty if they are we're
going to return true and if they're not
we'll return false
all right so let's save that and then go
back to users and again we're just
calling that method here and if it's
true we'll return true if it's else or
turn false so let's save that and try it
out so if we go to register and in the
username and just going to put Brad we
know that that is taken submit and we
see the username is taken I put
something else and submit we don't get
that our so that's working now we want
to do the same exact thing for the email
so let's go to email right after
required and we're going to say call
back underscore check what does it check
email exists and then go down here we'll
just copy this okay same logic so if
email this is going to be the email
that's whatever the user types in and
then let's change this and we have to
change the message now we'll say that
email is taken and change this basically
just change everywhere that says
username to email okay same thing in the
model so we'll go on the model and copy
this
okay users table is correct but we want
to match email to the email variable and
that should be good so let's save that
let's go back to register and let's see
for email will say Brad look Brad at
Gmail and submit that email is taken
okay so if we put both in here
we should get both errors there we go
now before we go I just want to mention
something that you should change in your
post controller so let's go to
controllers posts and it's where we
create a post and we upload an image
someone pointed this out to me I have
the max width at 500 max height at 500
and there's a good chance that you may
upload an image bigger than that so I
would suggest changing it I'm just going
to change mine to 2,000 okay because
this chances are that image probably
won't be bigger than that but you can
make this whatever you'd like so if you
were getting an error and the image
wasn't uploading then this is probably
the reason why okay and thank you to the
person that pointed that out so I'm just
going to save that all right and then
that's going to be it for now I'm
actually going to do the login video
next right after this one so hopefully
I'll get that done and uploaded the same
day as this one alright so thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
