front-to-back series now initially this
was going to be a crash course in one
video but I find that crash courses
limit what I can show you because I
don't like making them longer than 45
minutes to an hour and my goal for this
series is to teach you an entire
language not just get your feet wet but
teach you start to finish or rather
front to back now like with any
technology that I choose to do videos on
some of you are going to be saying damn
it I hate PHP but I would still
encourage you to watch the series and
learn it because whether you like it or
not PHP is all over the place and you
don't have to like it to learn it all
right now a little while ago I realized
that my channel has so much JavaScript
and so many frameworks and very little
PHP and I actually know more about PHP
than I do JavaScript all right so once
this series is over we'll do another
language
okay so whether it's Python or Java or
anything else basically I want to have a
channel that anyone can go to to learn
anything when it comes to programming
all right so that's my little spiel now
let's take a look at what's included in
this series now this is just what I came
up with in a few minutes they'll be
adding things as you move along but
we're going to start with talking about
what PHP is and why you would use it and
we'll try to get that out of the way in
this video then I'm going to show you
how to get PHP set up on your machine
now PHP needs a server to run so we're
going to be installing a software suite
called xampp or also pronounced amp
which will give us an Apache server PHP
MySQL and a tool called PHP myadmin to
manage databases okay i'm using xampp
because it's cross-platform now I'm
using Windows but it's also available
for Linux and Mac okay and you don't
have to use that there's a lot of other
tools you can use or you can just set up
a lamp stack in fact it doesn't matter
what environment you're working in for
this series the code is all the same
alright so we'll also look at the basic
code syntax such as variables arrays
loops conditionals etc I'll try to
combine a couple of those into single
videos so that we don't have an entire
video on just variable
all right even though I do want to
really get into the syntax so PHP is
very flexible which can be a good thing
or a bad thing
but I'll be showing you how to use
procedural programming as well as
object-oriented programming and how to
create classes and so on all right we'll
also create dynamic web pages and we'll
look at includes and how how to write
code without repeating yourself we'll
look at form submission and superglobals
how to make and receive get requests and
post requests we'll also be working with
databases almost mostly at MySQL but
I'll also show you how to use post grabs
and maybe even something like MongoDB
alright and then once you learn all the
basics we'll go ahead and create some
mini projects such as a contact form a
user login system and then maybe at the
very end we can do a big project alright
so now that we know what's going to be
in a series let's talk a little bit
about what PHP is and some of its basic
principles so PHP has stood for a couple
different things throughout the years it
now stands for PHP hypertext
preprocessor so it is a recursive
acronym it was created back in 1995 by a
guy named Rasmus lured off ok PHP is an
open-source server-side programming
language or scripting language
so all PHP is hosted on a server and
it's not like Java Script that can be
run on the user's client machine it
needs to need the server to run ok and
Apache is the most popular type of
server that PHP runs on but you can use
other things as well
Pachi is part of the lamp stack which is
Linux Apache MySQL and PHP and that's an
extremely popular stack to work with all
right let's see so PHP can be directly
embedded into HTML markup this is one of
the huge advantages of PHP we need to
use PHP tags when we do that which we'll
talk about later and then in order for
PHP to run the file has to have a dot
PHP file extension so even if your HTML
file is on the server
it won't process the PHP unless it has
the right file extension all right so
let's take a quick look at how PHP works
okay so if you look at this image over
here on the right it starts with a user
on a client machine making a page
request usually to a PHP file then the
server process is that request and uses
a PHP interpreter ok PHP also has a
bunch of extensions some are enabled by
default and you can add and remove
extensions and then if you know enough
you can even create your own
now while PHP is being processed it has
the ability to work with a database
that's one of HP's best features is that
you can use it with almost any type
database MySQL is probably the most
popular one for at least for small and
medium-sized applications it can also
interact with other files on the system
you can read from other files as well as
write to them ok once the processing and
the interpreting is complete it'll send
the results to the client or the browser
now it's important to understand that
the actual PHP script and the PHP
programming isn't sent to the browser it
doesn't work like it does if you were
just requesting an HTML page it sends
the result of the script ok and this is
usually HTML but PHP can also send plain
text
Jason XML PDFs etc alright but it
usually just sends the HTML result if
you were to view your source code in
your browser you'll see the HTML you'll
see the client-side JavaScript you'll
see the CSS but you won't see the PHP
alright so most developers either love
or hate PHP I just did a video called
should you learn PHP pros and cons so
I'm not going to dive deep into the
advantages and disadvantages you can
check that video out if you want and
learn a little bit more about that but
some advantages are that it's very easy
to learn when you compare it to other
server-side languages it's not tight you
don't have to define your data types and
so on it's free and completely
open-source there's a ton of support on
the Internet
there's really good documentation and so
many people know it
no PHP bad you can always find help when
you need it alright it's also completely
cross-platform like I said it can run on
Windows Linux Mac and usually runs on an
Apache server but can use other types of
servers as well
okay PHP also gives you a lot of freedom
which I said could be either good thing
or a bad thing but it allows you to be
unique and original but at the same time
it allows people to write horrible code
okay because there's less structure and
less strict PHP also has a ton of
frameworks some are great some are not
laravel is probably the most popular
right now I also like symphony and code
ignitor which is really easy to learn
and then PHP is also very compatible
with almost any type of database okay
MySQL PostgreSQL and even no SQL
databases like MongoDB so you can do a
lot of stuff with PHP it can pretty much
do anything that any other server-side
language can do it can create dynamic
page content interact with other files
on the server and files of all different
types it can also collect information
from web forms and process them it can
send and receive cookies to and from the
browser it can also use sessions which
we'll talk about later it can create
read update and delete data from a
database and it can implement access
control on your website it can encrypt
data and just about anything else all
right so here's a couple of types of
websites and applications that are
usually created with PHP so basic
websites like a business site or
something like that blog type websites
where your content is stored in the
database and pages are created
dynamically shopping cards or e-commerce
sites social networks where people can
register and login you can easily
encrypt passwords content management
systems in fact PHP is used with all of
them the most popular CMS applications
such as wordpress joomla drupal and
there's a bunch of others as well all
right you can make membership websites
with access can
trol you can build search engine engines
and make complex full-text search
queries and you can also build back-end
API including restful JSON api's alright
so I don't want to take any more time up
with these slides now we're going to
jump in and we're going to set up PHP
and we'll start to code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
