view application up and running we have
our firebase or fire store up and
running and we have our config for our
firebase and the initializer now we're
gonna start to create our components so
over in the components folder in the
source folder we're gonna create a
couple new files first one is gonna be
the dashboard so it's going to be called
dashboard dot V UE for the extension and
basically a view component consists of a
template and then an element so let's
put a div here and we'll give this an ID
of dashboard like that and then down
below here actually inside here I'll
just put an h3 for now and we'll say
dashboard and then down here we're gonna
have some script tags with an export
default and this component will have a
name of dashboard and then we're gonna
have a data function here and we're just
going to return from here an empty
object like that so it's basically our
boilerplate for our components so let's
go ahead and save this and then what I'm
gonna do is copy this here all this that
we just typed in and create another
component so new file and we're gonna
call this new employee dot view and then
we're gonna paste that in and we're just
going to change up some stuff here so
the heading will say new employee I'm
gonna change up the ID and the name so I
can actually select both of these by
saying change all occurrences and we'll
change this to new - employee and we'll
save that ok then we'll go and create
another component so we'll say new file
and we'll call this one view V IEW
v ue and we'll paste this in change this
here to V
employee actually this this will
actually be the employees name but
that's fine front for now let's go ahead
and say select all and occurrences and
we'll change the ID and the component
name to view - employee and we'll save
that okay and then we also want let's
say we have that we want to edit
employee as well so say new file edit
employee dot view paste that in and
we'll say edit - employee and save and
then we're gonna have one more component
and that's gonna be the nav bar
so now if I dot view and this is
basically a just a dumb component it's
not going to have anything associated
with it aside from just a template with
HTML so for now I'm just gonna put just
a div with an ID of nav bar and we'll
just say nav bar ok so now we have at
least our component files created and we
have our basic templates so what I'm
gonna do now is is go to the router so
we'll go to router and then index J s
and then we need to import all of these
components except for the nav bar cuz
that's not actually going to be a route
that's just gonna be placed right in the
main app component so we don't need the
hello world so let's bring in dashboard
that's gonna be from components
/ - board and then we'll go ahead and
just bring in the rest of them so we've
dashboard we have new employee
we have view employee and we have edit
employee okay and then down here we'll
define our routes now the home route I
want to be the dashboard so for the name
I'm gonna say dashboard and for the
component I'm gonna say dashboard okay
and the case should match that the
component should be Pascal case alright
and then what we'll do is put a comma
here and we'll copy this let's put in
three more this next one will be slash
new for the path and then the name will
be new employee and then the component
will be new employee Pascal case and
then this one here this is gonna be the
edit
so we'll say slash edit slash and then
we need our placeholder here this is a
parameter so this is gonna be the
employee underscore ID make sure you
have the colon here and then the name
for this will be edit - employee and the
component itself is edit
employee and then the last one will be
for the view employee which I just want
to be slash and then whatever the
whatever the ID so it'll be employee
underscore ID and then this will be view
employee and then the actual component
name which is view employee so that's
our router
okay so let's save that and now what
you're seeing here rendering is our
dashboard component because that's what
we said we want the slash the index to
be this image here is coming from our
main app dot view file you'll see right
here it's loading the logo I don't want
that so I'm going to get rid of it I'm
also going to get rid of the styling
down here
we don't want any of that so we'll go
ahead and save and now we just have a
basic boilerplate and now if we go up
here we go to slash new you'll see new
employee if we go to edit let's say edit
/ one doesn't really matter
edit employee and if we go to just slash
1 we get view employees so our routes
are working now what we want to do is we
want to first add materialise for our
styling and then we're gonna create a
nav bar so we can navigate
well actually the nav bar isn't really
going to be used for navigation it's
just for looks we're gonna use the
floating button to get to the add and
the Edit Page things like that but we do
want the nav bar so let's go ahead and
get materialized setup so we're gonna go
to materialise CSS comm go to get
started and we just want the CDN so we
want to grab this link here this is the
CSS link we're gonna put this in
index.html so right up here above the
title and then we're gonna grab the
script that's right here put this down
right here now materialise j s actually
needs jQuery as a dependency so we're
gonna search for jQuery CDN and we'll go
ahead and grab the latest version so I'm
gonna grab this script tag and put that
right above the materialized script tag
okay and then another thing I want is
font awesome which is an icon library so
we're gonna go actually let's search for
font awesome CDN so we'll grab that
right here get this link tag and put
this right below materialized and then
one other thing we need to do because I
want to actually nevermind I was gonna
say I was gonna initialize the sidebar
for the materialized navbar but we're
actually not gonna have any links so we
don't need to do that
if you wanted to use the sidebar in the
hamburger menu with materialise you just
need to add a little jQuery to
initialize it but we're not gonna need
that so we should be all set let's go
ahead and save and now if we reload our
application you can see that the font
has changed the spacing has changed so
materialise is now kicked in so let's
just close up the index.html and let's
go to our navbar dot view file so we're
gonna actually remove this div and it's
gonna be a nav tag so we're gonna put
that in and then we just want a div with
the class of nav and by the way I'm
using Emmet that's what these shortcuts
are right here so div dot nav dot wrap
we also want a class of green I'm gonna
make the nav bar green and then hit tab
and then in here we want a container to
move everything to the middle and we're
just gonna have the the branding logo or
the the title alright now I want this to
I want to click the title or the logo
and have it go to the home page or that
the dashboard so in view we don't use a
tags two for our routes or for our links
we use the router link and then we do to
use an attribute called two and then say
we want to go to slash ok and then well
we can also give us a class just as if
it were an a tag or any element and
we're going to give it a class of brand
logo ok and then here we're just gonna
say employee manager and save oh we need
we need to insert it into the
application so what we'll do is go to
our main app dot view file and from here
we'll be able to just insert it but
first we need to register it down here
as a component so we need to bring it in
so import navbar from and we're
importing it from dot slash components
slash
now now the bar and let's see let's go
up here and we'll put it right in the
div with the idea of app right above the
router view okay this is where all of
our views will render whatever route
we're on whatever the content is for
that component is gonna render here I
want the navbar to be right above it so
let's go ahead and say navbar like that
okay and then we just need to register
it down here so we'll put a comma right
here and say components and that's gonna
be an object and we're gonna say navbar
all right and that should do it so let's
save and there we go now it's not green
let me see what did I do here class
why is it no oh this should be should
actually be nav
huh it should be green that's weird
div class nav rapper and you should be
able to use a color here what if I say
blue it's not working either come on let
me see if I add something here 1 2 3
that's not being updated either so I
think something went wrong with the
server so I just I'm gonna stop the
server with ctrl C and then just do NPM
run dev again there we go all right so
sometimes that happens I'm not sure why
but that fix it all right so let's
continue on here now I want all the
content under the navbar to be wrapped
in a container so it gets pushed over a
little so in the app dot view file
let's wrap the router view inside of a
div with the class of container
okay so that pushed that over a little
now we're not going to work with fire
store yet in this video this is
basically just setting up the UI routes
components all that but what I want to
do before we end this video is have the
floating button down here to go to the
new employee page or the add employee
page so to do that we're gonna go to our
dashboard and go up to let's say we want
to stay within this div so we'll go like
right here and we'll put in a div with
the class of fixed - action - BTN and we
want let's see we're gonna put a router
link and this router link needs a two
attribute and it's gonna go to slash new
and then we're gonna give this a class a
couple materialised classes so we want
BTN - floating because we wanted to
float down in the corner
BTN - large and let's make it red so
we'll just put a class of red and then
it's gonna wrap a font awesome icon so
we'll have an eye tag with the class of
FA and FA - plus that should be FA not
CA so let's save that and there we go we
have our little icon if we click it
brings us to the new employee page okay
we will put a form here we'll have a
cancel button to bring us back but we
can also click the logo here to bring us
back so I think now that we have our
basic shell of our application we'll
stop the video here in the next one I'm
going to show you how we can actually
fetch our data from fire store and then
bring it into the dashboard so we can
see all of our employees so we'll do
that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
