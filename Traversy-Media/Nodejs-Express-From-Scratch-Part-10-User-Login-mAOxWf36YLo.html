think this is episode 10 of our nodejs
an express application in the last video
we set up registration so we can now go
to register and create an account and it
goes into our MongoDB database now we
want to implement the login and this is
where we're going to use passport so a
good idea is to create a config file and
put your passport strategy inside that
so what I'm going to do is create a new
folder here in our route and we're going
to call this config and then we're going
to have two files in here one's going to
be passport j/s and then i'm also going
to have a database config file so let's
call that database dot j/s whoops fix
that jas and this is just a cleaner way
to do it we're just going to store I
would say module dot exports so that we
can access this stuff outside and it's
just going to be an object with a
database value and then also a secret so
the secret we can choose anything I'm
just going to say your secret and then
for the database if we go into our app
j/s file we're going to grab this right
here and put that in here and actually
want to add the port number so it's
going to be the default port for MongoDB
is going to be two seven zero one seven
okay make sure that you have the correct
name as well and let's save that and
let's go back into our App J's file and
we can we can include that file so let's
go right here and say Const config
equals require and this is going to be
dot slash config slash database and now
we'll have access to that object so
right here we can just say config dot
database
all right if we need that connection
and any other files we can just easily
bring it in so what we're going to do
now is go to our passport JS file and
we're going to bring in a few things so
let's say local strategy ok variable
called local strategy and we're going to
set that equal to require and in here we
want to bring in passport - local which
you should already have installed in the
last video and then we just want to do
dot strategy all right and to make sure
you have installed if you look in your
package adjacent file you should have
passport and you should also have
passport local alright so let's go back
there and let's also bring in the user
model just like we did in the other
files we brought it into so we're going
to require and that's going to be dot
dot slash and then models slash user ok
we also want to bring in the database
connection which is the config file we
just created so let's say require and
that'll be dot dot slash config slash
database and then we also want to bring
in bcrypt so that we can compare our
passwords so let's say bcrypt
set that to require and you want to make
sure you do be crypt j/s I'm sorry be
crypt Jas alright now we're going to
have to explore all this functionality
so let's say module dot exports and then
set it to a function and we're going to
pass in here passport all right so let's
implement our local strategy and if we
look at the documentation it should have
some examples of this so right here
I'm saying passport use passed a new
local strategy and that's going to take
in the username password and a callback
called done
and then we're going to look for the
username all right if there is no
username will do this or return done
with false then check the password if
that doesn't match it's going to return
done with false and then if everything
passes it's going to return done with
the user object so let's go over here
we'll say passport use and we'll pass a
new local strategy and in here we'll put
in a function ok and that's going to
take in the username password and done
and then in here we want to match the
username so what I like to do is just
create a variable called query and set
that to an object of what we want to
match we want to match user name to user
name alright and then we want to do our
query so we're going to take our model
user and do dot find one ok because we
only want to find one user and pass in
the query and then the callback okay and
then this function is going to take
error and user so first we'll check for
the error so I'm just going to do if
error then we'll just say throw error
all right and then we want to check to
see if there is no user so if not user
ok it's going to look at this right here
and if there's not a user then we want
to return done and we want to return it
with no and then false and then we can
do a message so we're going to create an
object with a message value 3 s's and
the message will just say no user found
ok and if there is a user it's going to
just skip this and it's going to keep
going and then we want to match
- the password alright so for that we
first need to bring in our call bcrypt
okay we're going to say be Crypt dot
compare okay has a method called compare
and that's going to take in the password
we want to test okay which is going to
come from here which is also going to
come from our form so we want to pass in
that and then we want the actual
password hash that's in the database and
that's coming from in this object
because we're finding the user and then
we'll have access to the hash password
so we want to pass that and user dot
password then we want a function and
this function is going to have error and
then also a true false value so we'll
call that is match and then we want to
check for the error okay then we want to
check the is match value and see if it's
true or false
okay so we'll say if is match if it's
true that means that the password
matched and we want to return done and
pass in null and then the user instead
of false okay because everything's
alright else then we just want to do the
same thing we did here so I'm just going
to copy that
and we'll just change the message here -
I will say wrong password alright and
that should do it that's our strategy
now you also need to add a serialized
user function and deserialize and we go
over here to see where is it
so you can figure that gives it right
here serialized user deserialized so
let's grab that and we're going to put
this see we should still be in the
module exports so right here and we'll
paste that and see it's tab this over so
serialize we're going to have this
function here with the user and then
we're just going to return dealt no and
then the user ID and then deserialize
we're going to have a function and we're
going to going to find user by D okay
that's going to get passed in and then
it returns done with the user all right
just just part of the configuration
really so let's go ahead and save this
file and that should be all we need to
do here okay I'll play this there's no
errors and we want to bring this into a
pas now but before we do that let's also
bring in passport so require passport
and let's see we're going to go down
let's go right below the validator
middleware all right and we want to
bring in the passport config okay so we
just want to require and we're going to
require dot slash config slash passport
and then we want to be able to use that
passport value so we need to pass it in
like that
alright and then it has just two lines
of middleware to initialize so let's see
where is that see what I mean like the
documentation things are just very
spread out
let me just search for in it alright so
right here we need app dot use passport
initialize and passport sessions so I'm
going to grab those and put those in
right here alright so now that the
configuration is all set we're going to
work on the route because when we have
this login form it's going to submit
it's going to make a post request to
users login so let's go to our routes
and then users and let's go down here
and put a comment here so this is for
the login form the get request and then
we want login process so that's going to
be router oast so it's going to be post
slash login
okay
and what we want to do is call passport
but I think yeah we need to bring it in
because we didn't bring it in yet and
this is where we call passport
authenticate okay so that's what we're
going to do passport dot authenticate
and if you want to look at the
documentation for that it's right here
okay so post request to login
authenticate you want to pass in your
strategy which in our case is going to
be called local and then a success
redirect okay wherever you want to go
after as you log in and then the failure
redirect so if it doesn't work and then
also if you want to display a flash
message so let's go ahead and do that so
we'll pass in local that's a strategy we
want to use and you can have multiple
strategies if you want to and then the
success redirect which is going to be
slash just going to be the home page and
then failure redirect which is going to
be slash users slash login and then we
want to specify failure flash and that's
going to be set to true
now once one other thing we need to do
is pass in the request response and next
value so right here we're just going to
put in some parentheses I'm going to say
request response next alright and that
should do it that should should give us
that the whole login process and use our
local strategy so let's go ahead and
save this and probably have an error at
first but let's give it a shot so I'm
going to submit with nothing next is not
defined and that's because that also
needs to be passed in here
all right okay missing credentials which
is good I mean we have nothing here
let's put the wrong username wrong
password so no user found now you just
put a space on that right here alright
now if we put a user that does exist we
know that there's a user called Brad and
we put the wrong password we get wrong
password alright now before we do the
right password I just want to edit this
if we look at the source code for this
message it has div class alert and then
alert error which in bootstrap
doesn't do anything we need this to be
alert danger but instead of trying to
change it which I'm not exactly sure how
we're just going to add a class for
alert error so let's go into our public
CSS style dot CSS and we don't even have
anything here yet and let's say dot
alert - error and let's set the color -
we're gonna use the bootstrap red so a
nine four four four - and then the
background color which is going to be F
to D D d e f - d e de okay and then for
the border we're going to set that to EB
C CD one alright and then when it's a
success message with with passport it's
going to be alert - success message so
let's just add that while we're here I'm
just going to actually copy this alright
it's going to look like this success on
the score msg and then for the color
let's do three C seven six three D
for the background let's do D F F 0 D 8
D F F 0 d 8 and then for the border
that's going to be d 6 e 9 C 6 all right
so now if we go back over here and try
this again now it looks good all right
so let's go ahead and try to log in so
Brad and then I'll put the correct
password and we get redirected to
articles so we are now logged in there's
nothing to show us that we're logged in
but we are and what it does is it now it
creates a request dot user object and we
can check for that and we can enable
certain things based on that now we also
want to log out so what I want to do is
I want to hide this if we're logged in
and just have a log out now in order to
do that I'm going to set a global
variable for the user object so let's go
back to and close all these let's go
back to AB js-- and we're going to go
right under the initialization of
passport and this is going to be we're
going to create a route that goes for
all URLs and we just want to enable a
global user variable so let's say app
get and in here we're just going to put
an asterisk because because we want this
for all routes and let's say function
quest response and next and in here to
set a global variable we can say read
locals dot user and we're going to have
this request user object if we're logged
in and we only want to set this if there
actually is a request user objects so we
want to say or no all right and then we
just want to call next ok which will
call the next route of a.m. the next
piece of middleware all right so now
let's save that and let's go into
see where the navbar is which is in the
layout and right here we have register
and login what we want to do is only
show these if we're not logged in so
right here would say if user because we
remember we created a global variable
called user then we want to show a log
out so let's say Li and this is going to
go to slash users slash logout which we
will create logo and then we're going to
put an else and then just tab these over
because we want these to be in the else
alright now if we save the server up
reloads and it actually knocks us out
we're not going to be logged in anymore
every time we reset the server with no
daman we're going to be kicked out so we
need to log in again submit and now over
here what did I do oh that should be on
a different line see now if I save and
the server resets oh it didn't kick us
out oh you know I didn't kick us out
because we didn't change any of the J s
we just changed the pug code alright
let's give that a capital L so let's
take care of our log out so we're going
to go to our user routes file and we're
going to go all the way to the bottom
and this will be the log out so app dot
I'm sorry router dot get and this is
just going to be slash logout actually
did I put the right URL there yeah user
slash logout all right so logout and
then we'll put our function and let's
say request response and in here to
logout all we have to do
is call request dot log out and then
we'll just set up a flash message so
let's say red I'm sorry
rec dot flash and this is going to be a
success message and we'll just say you
are logged out and then we'll redirect
okay we're going to redirect to the
login page so users slash login all
right so now if we reload we're going to
be logged out because we change the
JavaScript file so let's go login again
okay and we're logged in if I click
logout there we go and you can see this
goes back to register and login all
right so we're going to go ahead and
stop here and in the next video we're
going to add some access control meaning
that if we're not logged in we don't
want to be able to add an article all
right we also need to add user we want
to add the user ID to the articles table
when we submit an article we're actually
going to get rid of this author and
we're going to make it so that whoever
you're logged in as that's going to be
the author it's actually going to be the
user ID field okay but we can leave it
we can call it author still that's fine
all right so that's it I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
