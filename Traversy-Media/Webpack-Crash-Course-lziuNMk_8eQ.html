you an introduction to webpack ok which
is extremely popular at this time so
this is going to be for absolute
beginners if you've use webpack in the
past then this will basically be a
refresher for you guys so there's a ton
of stuff to learn especially when you
get into the different loaders and
plugins and all that but we're going to
focus on just the basics okay just to
set up webpack to have it convert our
dynamic code and modules into static
assets all right so let's go ahead and
get started now webpack is what's called
a module bundler and it takes modules
whether that that's a custom file that
you created or something that was
installed through NPM and it generates
static assets to represent those modules
ok so then you can take a fully dynamic
application and package it all up into
static files which you can then upload
and deploy to your server ok so you can
also extend what web pack can do with
plugins loaders which all have their own
separate set of configurations all right
so let's take a look at some of the
properties of a module and what a module
basically is you can require any
JavaScript file with web pack but when
we say module we usually mean a discrete
chunk of functionality or chunk of code
and it's usually abstract and it
delegates functionality to libraries so
that we don't really have to understand
the complexity of it okay we can just
require it and we can use the public API
that's exposed it's usually based on a
single task or responsibility and more
often than not it's reusable whether
that's in reusable within that
application or within other applications
as well all right now there are other
modules out there one one example would
be browserify so what makes web pack
different so web pack uses something
called code splitting which allows us to
break up our code base into chunks which
can be loaded on demand ok this is an
opt-in feature
you can provide split points in your
code if you want another great feature
of webpack our loaders so by default web
pack can only work with native
JavaScript but there's loaders that can
be used to transform other resources
into JavaScript so we can actually
transform CSS into JavaScript and then
just require it right in that script
another example would be with the react
library react uses JSX which is
JavaScript syntax extension and web pack
has a JSX loader to work with react okay
sass is another example we can simply
require sass or F CSS files right in the
JavaScript alright web pack also has a
very clever way to parse just about any
third-party library so we can use
expressions in dependencies such as this
Jade
this Jade import right here web pack can
also use both AMD and common j/s modules
and then it also has a plug-in system
you can write your own plugins but
that's way beyond the scope of this
crash course alright so these are some
of the example loaders there's liver
literally hundreds of them these are
some of the popular ones so there's the
CSS and style loader that allows you to
just include CSS right in your script we
also have sass and less which are CSS
pre compilers so we can simply include
SAS or SPSS file or or a less file JSX
is used for react so we can use that
babel is used for a few different things
but it's often used so that we can use
es6 JavaScript syntax and it will then
compile down to es5 so you have full
browser compatibility ok coffee it is
uses is used for CoffeeScript
typescript which is a superset of
JavaScript and then we also have loaders
for template engines like ejs which is
embedded JavaScript also pug which is
formally known as Jade and handlebars
okay we also have a JSON loader to
handle Jason so there's a lot of loaders
that you can check out
on the documentation so to set up web
pack is pretty simple we just want to
install it with NPM we can install it
globally so that we can run it from
anywhere and then there's also a module
called web pack dev server which
basically just takes all the
auto-generated code and just loads it up
into the browser on localhost I believe
it's port 8080 by default all right so
this is a diagram off the documentation
and this basically shows you how web
pack works so if we look at this one
here web pack reads the entry point and
analyzes its dependencies also its
dependencies dependencies and so on ok
so this is what we would have basically
have in our source folder so we'd have a
main app j/s and then we could simply
require in a module such as this cats
module and this cats module basically
just gives us this array that we can use
and then here you can see we're just
console logging that array all right so
we're able to include JavaScript files
within each other just that alone is a
reason to use webpack all right and then
web pack bundles the entry point and all
of its dependencies into a single file
in this case it's called app bundle j/s
so this is the the file that you would
include in your index.html inside of a
script tag and it'll take all the
modules that you have and just bundle it
into that one file ok and you'll have
all that functionality you won't need to
be running a server or anything like
that
all right so that's the I guess the very
brief summary of web pack now we're
going to jump in we're going to install
it and I'll show you how to do a few
things with it all right guys so we're
going to go ahead and dive into web pack
ok now I'm using Linux Ubuntu but all
the stuff is the same whether you're on
Linux or Mac or Windows you will need
nodejs installed so make sure you go to
node.js org and download it install it
and get that set up all right and then
once you do that we can install web pack
now I'm going to install it globally so
that it can be accessed from anywhere so
I'm going to go to my terminal and just
do an NPM actually I need to sudo
because I'm on
so pseudo npm install and we want to do
the - g4 global and then webpack and
that'll get it installed on your system
okay while it's doing that I'm going to
create a project folder it's going to be
in my project sandbox directory and
we're going to call this just web pack
underscore app okay and then we also
want to open that up in the text editor
which I'm using atom so I'm going to say
add project folder and go to project
sandbox and web pack app alright so now
web pack is installed next thing we want
to do is create a package JSON file
which is part of nodejs
and it's a manifest file and it holds
all the information for the app the
dependencies things like that so let's
say NPM in it and that will go ahead and
generate it actually I don't want to do
it here I want to go into web pack app
ok and then we'll do NPM in it okay name
that's fine fine description I'm just
going to say sample web pack app entry
point I'm going to put a pas and then
we'll just enter through the rest all
right so now we have our package JSON
file and it should look like this now I
want to do our testing in the browser so
we're going to create an index.html file
for that okay and then in this file
we're just going to put our basic tags
in I'm just going to say web web pack
app and we want to include a file down
here which is a script source okay and
then this is going to be pointing to a
file called bundle dot J s okay that's
going to be the final result of the
JavaScript when it gets passed through
web pack okay but we do need a source
file to work with so that's the app.js
file so let's create that okay and just
for now I'm just going to do let's do an
alert
colonel just alert hello world
okay so we'll save that now this is the
source file this is what we want to run
through web pack so let's go back to our
terminal
clear this out and what we're going to
do here is say web pack and then the
source file which is a BIS and then the
the compiled file which is going to be
bundled j/s so let's go ahead and run
that and this is what it looks like when
it's successful if there were errors
they'd be shown here in red but now
notice that we have a bundled dot J's
file and if we look at it it has a ton
of code in it this is all web pack stuff
you don't have to worry about any of
this and you can see the actual
console.log that we have in app j s is
down at the bottom here I'm sorry not
console.log it's an alert all right so
remember the index file is pointing to
the bundle J s so it's pointing to this
file and the app.js file is the one that
we do stuff in this is the source file
all right so let's go ahead and open up
our index page so index.html we're going
to open with Chrome and we get an alert
that says hello world now for the
functionality that we have which is just
a simple and alert there's no reason to
use webpack okay because we're not doing
anything that you need web pack for but
if you wanted to let's say import a file
into this app J s as a module you need
web pack for that if you wanted to add
your CSS through the JavaScript web pack
can do that if you want to use babel and
you want to convert es6 javascript down
to es5 you can do that you do need a
loader but I'll get into that in a
little bit but there's literally
hundreds or I don't know even thousands
of different things that you can use
webpack for alright so let's start off
with just requiring modules so I'm going
to create another file and I'm going to
call this let's call this people dot J s
okay and what we want to do is say
module dot exports
now what what this does is it makes
available whatever we put here to the
outside okay so for now we're just going
to make it a string that says hello
world
okay so we'll save that and now we
should be able to go to app J s and
let's take this out this alert and let's
just do a require of people dot J s okay
we'll save that and let's go ahead and
run the web pack command again I can't
resolve people J s can let's see oh
that's because we need to put a dot
slash here telling it at sinister in
this folder so let's try that again
alright so now it's successful and if we
go over and reload we get hello world
now that's coming from the people module
if I change this to of say hello
everyone save now notice if I do it now
it's not going to show hello everyone
because we didn't run it through web
pack so we'll have to just run the web
pack again reload and now we get hello
everyone ok so now we can import
different things into our main app J s
file and then once it gets bundled
through web pack it gets put into the
bundle j s which then is being included
in the HTML file ok so hopefully that
makes sense now if you don't want to
have to keep running that web pack
command after you make a change you can
actually use it in watch mode so what we
can do is say web pack app J s bundle j
s and at the end here just tack on - -
watch and now you can see that the
command prompt is now just sitting here
and it's waiting ok so if we make a
change let's go into people and let's
just add an exclamation here and put and
then save and then we'll go and reload
and you can see the exclamation mark
okay we didn't have to run it again
because it's just running in the
background watching our files alright so
back to people J s right here we're just
exporting a string but it doesn't have
to be
like be a string it can be anything it
could be the results or the return of a
function so if we wanted to say function
get too low and just return let's just
say return hello there and then set the
exports to just get hello and then we'll
save that go back to Abby is and we'll
just leave that as is reload and we get
hello there it's now getting the result
or the return value of that function all
right but what we're going to do is
create an object okay so I'm actually
going to just comment this out I want to
leave most of the stuff in the files for
you guys so what I'll do is create a
person or not persons create people and
what that's going to be is an array of
people objects so let's say name of John
Doe of course and let's say name Steve
Smith and say name Carol Williams all
right
so we have these people because people
array and then I'm just going to say
module look sportspeople okay so let's
save that and then we'll go over to app
j/s and let's just leave that and see
what happens okay so an alert doesn't
work well with objects because it won't
show us the data in the object it
basically just says it's an object so
what I'll do is change this to a console
dot log okay and then we'll save that
and reload and then let's hit f12 to
open up our chrome tools and you'll see
that gives us an array with three three
items and if we look at those items we
have our people okay now usually you
won't do this you'll put it in some kind
of variable so if we say
let's people equals require people je s
and then let's consult log people okay
that looks a lot better okay but it does
the same thing and let's say we want to
get an individual person we could say
people and get the first one which is in
the zero index reload and it gives us
that one object which is John Doe if we
want to get a specific field like the
name we can say dot name and now we get
John Doe okay so you can see it's very
easy to create a module and import it
into or require it into your app J's
file alright so up to this point we've
created our own file people in and
required it in but let's use something
else from the node package module
directory okay so let's say we want to
use jQuery so we'll go over to our
command line I'm going to keep that
running and then go down here and go
into web pack app and then we're going
to do an NPM install jQuery and then - -
save ok so that installed jQuery through
NPM and what we want to do here is just
bring it in just like we did with people
so we'll say let money sign equals
require and let's say jQuery all right
and then down here let's do just
anything in jQuery so we'll say we want
the body and we want to append on to
that and let's say we want to append an
h1 and then inside here we're just going
to concatenate the person's name which
is this right here
ok so I'll grab that paste that in there
and let's go ahead and save that and
reload and now it's getting put into the
okay so we're using jQuery from the spy
lair and it's still it's all going to
get compiled into bundle j/s remember
that's the only file that this that the
index that the HTML is including so no
matter what we do it's going to end up
in that file so if we look at that it's
just basically a bunch of gibberish okay
you can see there's our people array and
then we have all the jQuery stuff should
be down there as well
okay but we don't really have to look at
this file ever so just for shits and
giggles let's go ahead and loop through
the names of the people and output them
using jQuery just so this file does
something all right so we're using each
loop so jQuery dot each and then we're
going to pass in people which is the
array that comes from the people J s
file and then we'll do function and that
will take in the key and the value and
then I'll just grab this right here cut
it put it in here and just change the
zero to the key which is going to be an
integer a number so let's go ahead and
save that reload and now it's printing
out all the people from the people J s
file or module so now what I want to do
is introduce to you a loader okay we're
going to use the CSS and the style
loader so that we can actually require
CSS files and styles from our JavaScript
so to do this let's first create a new
file and we'll call it style dot CSS
okay and in that full in that file we're
just going to give the body a style and
we're going to say background something
very prominent let's say red okay so
we'll save that now we have this
stylesheet
so we actually need to install loaders
just like we would anything else so
we're going to go to our terminal here
and we're going to say npm install see
what is it CSS - loader
and then also style dot Tom's not dot
dash loader and then we're going to add
this to our dev dependencies so just do
- - save - dev and that will install
those two loaders okay so now if we look
at our package JSON file you'll see we
have those loaders right here now we're
going to do is go back to app J s and
we're going to let's go to the top I
guess and let's do require and in here
we're going to say exclamation style
well actually we want the actual file
which is going to be dot slash style dot
CSS but that's not going to work because
we need to implement the loaders so we
can do that right here and we'll say
exclamation style and then exclamation
CSS and then exclamation okay so that's
telling it that we want to use the style
loader and the CSS loader and I believe
now you have to add dash loader because
you didn't have to before but I think
you do now and I don't want to get the
error so let's do that and let's see
what happens if we save and we reload
now you can see that we have the red
background so that stylesheet is
actually being included in our
JavaScript all right if we look at the
source code here there's no there's no
link to any CSS file it's all in this
bundle file that web pack created for us
okay so hopefully that makes sense now
this here doesn't look very nice and
there's a way that we can fix this and
there's a way we can fix a lot of things
actually for instance when we want when
we run web pack we have to include app J
s and then bundle j s for the output we
can actually put all this stuff inside
of a config file for web pack so let's
go to our application root create a new
file and we need to call it web pack dot
config dot j s ok and then here we want
to do a module dot export and set that
to some curly braces and then we want to
specify an entry file ok so for us it's
going to be dot slash app dot J s ok and
then we want an output and the output is
actually an object which is going to
have a path so for the path I'm just
going to say double underscore dur name
which will be this current path and then
also a file name and for the file name
that will be bundle j s ok now when
you're using a loader like the CSS style
loader we have to define those in this
file so right right under output we'll
put a comma and then we need to say
module which will be another object and
then we can do loaders and loaders is
going to be an array of objects
ok so let's create our first one here
now this is going to take an element for
test and basically what we're going to
put here is an expression so we're going
to put forward slash backward slash dot
CSS money sign and then forward slash
now what this is saying is that this
loader is for any file that ends with
dot CSS that we that we require all
right so we're going to put another
parameter here and specify loader and
for that we're going to say style
- loader and then put an exclamation and
we want CSS loader all right so let's go
ahead and save that and then let's go
back to app KS and get rid of this crap
here it's just going to be including the
file now since we put in the config file
we put the entry and the output then we
don't want to include that in the actual
web pack command so let me just clear
this out and we should now just be able
to run
webpack okay and that should compile it
reload and everything is still good now
what I want to do now is I want to
structure this in a better way because
this is not how you should package your
application we have both the source
files and the the compiled file in the
same level okay so what we'll do is
create a folder and we're going to call
that source and that's going to be for
the source files and that's going to be
apt Jaso we'll move that in we're also
going to move in there actually no I'm
going to do is in the source create
another folder called Jas and put a
pious and there we also want the people
module in there alright and then we're
going to create in the source a folder
called CSS and we're going to move in
style dot CSS into there okay and then
what I'm going to do is delete the
bundle file because that's going to be
regenerated okay so we'll move that to
the trash so all we should have in the
root here is the h2 index.html the
package dot jason and the web pack
config now since we move those files we
have to edit the config file all right
so we're going to change this now to
slash source /j s slash app J so that's
going to be the entry and then the
output I don't want it to be in this
root folder I wanted to go into a folder
called dist
okay so what we'll do is just add to
this we'll concatenate slash dist okay
and then the file name can stay the same
that's bundle J s so let's save that and
then another thing we need to do is go
back into our app J s and the source and
change the location here because right
now it's going to be dot dot slash into
CSS and then style dot CSS okay and then
that should do it so let's save it and
then what I want to do instead of just
saying web pack I'm going to put us an
NPM script that we can put in
package.json file so see where we have
scripts I'm going to change this to
build and then that's just going to run
web pack okay so we should be able to do
npm run build so let's save that and
let's try it out
so let's go and say npm run build
alright and if we go and now this here
isn't going to work we need to go to our
source folder i'm sorry not a fork so
for that we want the index.html here we
have to change that because now the
bundle is in the disk folder which you
can see got created when we ran the run
build so we just want to change this to
dist slash bundle reload and now
everything's working ok so this is a
much more professional type of structure
than just having everything in on one
level alright so I really hope I didn't
lose too many of you guys there because
this is kind of important where you know
your source files and all that if it did
if it did sound confusing then maybe go
back and kind of listen to it again
now there's also something called web
pack dev server that we can use to to
run just a development server instead of
loading it from the file like we're
doing here so let me just close all this
stuff out
see you don't want to say that all right
so we need to install this with NPM so
we're going to go over here and we're
going to say NPM install and we're going
to install this globally and then web
pack - dev - server and we'll add that
to the dev dependencies let's see I got
to do sudo
okay so now that that's installed what I
want to do is go back to our package
Jason and we already have the build
command here let's add a script for
start okay so for that we're going to
run web pack dev server now we need to
specify where the entry and the output
files are because we have those in the
source folder so we're going to say - -
entry and that's going to be dot dot
slash source / J s slash fjs that's the
entry file and then we want to do dash
dash output - file name and then that's
going to be in the - I'm sorry dot slash
dist slash bundle dot J s okay so now it
knows where those two things are and it
can run it in basically in a development
server all right I'm just going to put a
comma at the end here okay
so let's save that and let's hope this
works I'm going to close that out and
we're going to go over here clear this
and let's run NPM start okay so if you
look up here it says it started on port
where is it port 8080 so let's go to
localhost port 8080 and there's our
application okay so when you're working
when you're working on development you
want to use this dev server when you're
ready to build it out then you can just
run NPM run build now there's one more
thing I want to do and that is show you
how to use the babel loader
okay babel is used to basically take es6
code which is the newer javascript mark
not markup but syntax and then convert
it down to es5 so that you have maximum
browser compatibility and you don't have
issues on older browsers and all that so
what we're going to do is I'm going to
say NPM and
stall babble cor babble - loader and
then we also want the es2015 preset so
that is going to be babble - preset -
es2015
alright and then we'll just do save
depth for that alright so once that's
done all you have to do is go to our web
pack config file go down to where we
have our loaders and let's go right here
put in another set of curly braces and
we'll say test and then let's do forward
slash back slash dot J s money sign
forward slash so this is going to affect
all all files that have the J s
extension ok so we're going to say
loader and that's going to be the babel
loader ok now we want to exclude the
entire node modules folder we don't want
that do not want anything changed in
there so let's say exclude and then do
slash node modules splash and then we're
also going to add this query and this is
where we want to put our preset ok we're
using the es2015 preset so it's a preset
and that would actually be an array so
we want some square brackets and then we
just want to type in es2015 all right
and I believe that should do it so let's
go ahead and save that and then what I'm
going to do is go over to where we have
our server running and I'm just going to
cancel that and I'm going to build it
out ok so we're going to say was at NPM
run build
what's this see
pre-set invalid let's say that I use the
wrong syntax here exclude node modules
query Oh an extra are there so presets
is 2015 that should that should work so
let's try that again
alright so we'll do NPM run build
alright looks like it went ok and now if
we go to our bundle our disk bundle file
and let's actually let's search for
something that's in the app J s so we
have let's say let people so let is part
of es6 now since we're using babel which
should happen is it should take the let
and convert it to var which is part of
es5 ok so let's go to the bundle and
let's search for people and we'll go
down and there it is var people so it's
taking our es6 code converting it to es
5 so that we have maximum browser
compatibility okay there's the bars
again ok so that actually is really
really helpful I know that the modern
browsers are they're really catching up
to es 6 but there are some people that
still are using older browsers where you
know you may want to use Babel alright
so hopefully this hopefully it was clear
I kind of feel like I didn't explain
certain things as best as I could have
but I don't know hopefully I understand
at least the gist of it I will make this
