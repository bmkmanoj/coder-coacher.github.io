in this course we're going to focus on
the actual structured query language
syntax so we're going to put away the
fancy graphical user interfaces and
we're going to get into the actual
programming so we'll be using PHP
myadmin which is a graphical tool but
we're going to be using the SQL shell to
do pretty much everything except look at
the actual rows that are being returned
all right so before we get started I
just want to remind you to subscribe
with us follow us on Twitter and
Facebook and if you're feeling really
generous donate a couple bucks so that
we can keep making these free courses
all right so let's take a look at what
we'll be doing what you'll learn so
we'll take a look at kind of an overview
of SQL talk about what it is what it's
used for and then we'll start to look at
how to create alter and delete databases
and tables how to query a database using
multiple operators
we'll take a look at some of the various
data types that are available I'll show
you how to insert update and delete
records how to join tables together use
aliases we'll look at primary keys and
foreign key constraints and also indexes
alright
among some other stuff that'll get
thrown in the mix so what is SQL it
stands for structured query language and
it's a special purpose programming
language that was created to work with
relational databases
all right SQL has been around for a very
long time but it's still relevant it's
the main it's the main method of
interaction between an application and a
relational database all right and SQL is
used anywhere from just small individual
blogs to you know enterprise corporation
level all right so it's very very
flexible and also very scalable so some
of the popular databases that use SQL
this is by no means the entire list
there's a lot more but these are some of
the more popular ones that you may have
art of alright first we have MySQL which
is extremely popular that's what we'll
be working with in this particular
course but you also have postgrads which
is another really popular relational
database Oracle Microsoft SQL Server SQL
Lite and then you have D base Hadoop max
DB Moorea DB which is drop-in for MySQL
and open base okay so these are just
some of the many relational databases
that use SQL alright so when we talk
about SQL tools there are dozens and
dozens of tools some are dedicated to
one specific relational database system
others are cross-platform so these are
just a few of the many so the
command-line client when you download
let's say MySQL you get you get a shell
program that you can log into through
the command line and you can start to
create your tables and do all that all
right then you have graphical tools like
admin error which will be using that
give you an easier way through a
graphical user interface to do that
stuff but also give you the option to
use some kind of SQL shell alright and
did I say we're using that we're not
using that were using PHP myadmin which
I'll get to in a second admin error and
Firebird the next one are both
cross-platform so you can use these with
MySQL Postgres and a bunch of other ones
as well
MySQL workbench is very popular that's
it's actually offered free from the
official MySQL website you can do
diagrams and some really nice graphical
stuff with that PHP myadmin is a web
tool that is offered on on many cPanel
hosts so if you if you get a hosting
account with Hostgator or Bluehost or
something like that they usually offer
PHP myadmin
with that with their packages all right
PG admin 3 is a really nice desktop tool
for postgrads I do have a video on that
if you want
check that out sequel Pro is a Mac tool
I don't know too much about and in high
D SQL I've used a couple times but never
really got got too much into it alright
so these are just some of the many many
tools that are available alright so
before we can actually dive in and start
looking at SQL you need to have some
kind of SQL database installed on your
server or on your local machine whatever
it may be now what I would suggest is if
you're just using let's say Windows or
Mac and you don't have a server that you
actually want to set up an easy thing to
do is to something like exam or xampp
what that does is it gives you an apache
server mysql PHP and a bunch of other
tools available on your local machine
alright so you don't have to connect to
a special server or anything like that
all right that's what we'll be doing if
you want to download zamp you can go to
Apache friends org and it's a
cross-platform it's available for
Windows Linux and Mac so I already have
it installed I'm not going to go through
it but I do have a video on how to get
examp set up and running on Windows
alright it's actually very very easy so
once you do that you'll be able to
you'll be able to open up PHP myadmin
which is a graphical tool to manage your
server here are databases so you can get
to that with localhost / PHP myadmin now
when you first install zamp you probably
won't have a password for your your root
user and you want to fix that so what
you can do is in PHP myadmin if you
click on user accounts and you look at
where it says root for the username and
localhost for the hostname you probably
have an O right here if you if you have
a yes then it should be fine then you
know you have a password if you have an
O then let's click Edit privileges and
then you want to click Change Password
and then just put in the password here
and click go alright now if you get
booted out of PHP myadmin because you're
not logged in they
what you need to do is go to your your
zamp folder look that's not it we want
to go to zamp and then go to PHP myadmin
and then this config file right here
config Inc PHP you want to open that up
and then just whoops just put the
password that you chose in this field
right here this should be empty okay you
want to put it in there and save it and
close it go back and you should be okay
so creating a database is extremely easy
okay so what we're going to do is we're
in PHP myadmin and we could simply
create a database through here but
that's not what we want to do we want to
focus on the SQL programming language so
let's click on the SQL tab up here and
this is where we can actually run
queries alright let me make this a
little bigger okay so what we're going
to do is say create database and then we
want to name it okay I'm just going to
say test for now and we're going to end
all of our statements with all of our
lines with a semicolon
so let's click go and you can say see we
got an OK message but just to check we
can click on databases and there's our
test database alright and while we're at
it I'll show you how to delete a
database to do that you want to say drop
database and then whatever the name okay
if we run that we get an OK message and
if we look test is now gone alright so
that's how you can create and drop a
database now I'm going to create one
just to work with throughout this course
so again let's say create database and
this is going to be just a fictional
company I'm just going to call Acme
alright so click go now we have our Acme
database okay so we have an empty
database now which isn't very useful
because we have no tables all right so
let's create our first table to do that
we're going to say create table and this
I need to make this a little bigger
all right that should be good so we want
to say create table and then we want to
name it so let's create one for
customers all right and then what we
want to do is in here we want to specify
the fields that we want are the columns
so I'm just going to space this out a
little bit and we know that we want an
ID so to create a column you want to put
the call name and then the data type in
this case it's going to be an integer so
we want int all right and then we also
want to make sure that the ID cannot be
null okay now we want to separate these
with a comma and the next field that I
want is first-name okay now as far as
the naming conventions for columns this
here I like to use camel case which
means that the first letter is lowercase
and then every word after that the first
letter will be uppercase
okay often you'll also see something
like this you'll see that we separate
the words with an underscore all right
so it's all preference you could you
could do whatever you'd like
some people use partial case which the
the first letter would be capital as
well but I'm going to stick to camel
case okay so we have a first name now
for the data type that's going to be
what's called a varchar or a VAR car and
that is a just a string of characters it
could be letters numbers characters
whatever and then we have to specify the
max length which is going to be 255 all
right and you could do lower obviously a
first name isn't going to be 255
characters but just to be safe I use 255
for pretty much everything okay next
we're going to have a last name same
thing I believe that the rest of our
fields are going to be far car oops okay
then we'll have an email
I might as well just copy this okay so
email then we'll have address and let's
do city state and let's do code okay so
this here will create the customers
table for us but I want to do a couple
things one we need to specify a primary
key okay a primary key is unique and is
usually attached to the ID so all we
need to do to create this is just add on
to the end here primary key and then we
want to specify the which column we want
and we just want to put that in
parentheses so it's going to do the ID
all right now there's one more thing I
want to do and that's setting the ID to
auto increment okay and what that means
is that let's say we enter we enter a
row and it has the ID of five well the
next time we go and create a new row a
new record the ID will be six it's going
to increment by one by default all right
you can change it to something else but
one is the default and that's what
usually used so what we want to do is
just add on to this we want to say auto
increment just like that alright so
we're ready to create our table let's go
ahead and click go what's this no
database Oh
alright so we're actually not inside of
the Acme database so what I'm going to
do is just I'm going to copy this with
ctrl C and then go to databases click on
Acme and then click on SQL and now you
can see we're in the Acme database okay
so let's go ahead and do that okay so
now if we go to our Acme database you
can see now we have a customers table
okay if we click on that
not going to see anything here because
we have no records in here no rows but
if we click on structure you can see
everything that we just created and you
see the little key icon next to the ID
because that's a primary key all right
it's also set to auto increment and you
can see all the data all the data types
here as well so we created our first
table now I'm going to show you how to
insert data into the table alright guys
so now we're ready to insert some data
and you can see here that we're in the
Acme customers table all I did was went
to the screen and then click SQL okay
actually let's click on customers and
then SQL and when we're in this view you
can see we have all the columns over
here that we can use for reference okay
so let's go ahead and insert some data
so to do that we're going to say insert
into customers alright and we want to
specify the fields that we want to enter
so let's say first name basically this
is going to be everything except the ID
the ID is auto increment and we'll
create on its own
okay so then what we want to do is say
values and then some more parentheses
and we want to put in our values okay so
we have let's say for first name we'll
do John lastname doe email we'll say J
doe at gmail address we'll say 55 Main
Street and we'll say Boston okay so this
should insert the customer let's go
ahead and click go
okay so notice it says one row inserted
if we click on browse there you go we
have our John Doe customer okay so what
I want to do is insert a few more so I'm
just going to paste this in alright so
this is how we can insert multiple
records at once so we say insert into
customers and then we specify all of the
columns but we only specify these once
okay and then we can add multiple
records and we're just separating them
with a comma and the last one gets a
semicolon
alright so let's run go ok so you can
see it says five rows inserted and if I
click browse you can see we now have a
bunch of customers so now I'm going to
show you how to update a record ok so
let's say that one of our users wants to
change their email address so what we
can do is say update and then whatever
the table name update customers and then
we want to use set actually I'm going to
put these on their own lines just to
make it a little more readable so we
want to set email equal to whatever we
want to set it to let's say
we'll just a test at gmail.com okay so
we want to set email to that and then we
want to say where which this part is
very very important because if you don't
include the where then all of the
customers emails are going to change to
this so you want to specify this we're
going to say we're ID we're ID is equal
to three okay so let's go ahead and run
that okay so we get one row affected if
we go to browse you can see the the
customer with the ID of three which is
Cathy her email is now test at gmail.com
all right guys looking at our table
I want to show you how to delete a
customer all right so let's say that
Derek is not a customer anymore and he
is the ID of six so what we want to do
is go to our SQL and we're going to say
delete from customers again the where
part is extremely important if you don't
have this it's going to delete all your
customers so we'll say we're ID is equal
to three
alright so let's go ahead and click go
okay we get one row affected if we look
now you'll see oh did I say three oh
okay I deleted the ID of three I'm at
six but that's fine same thing so you
can see that we deleted a customer
alright guys so before we get into
selecting data and fetching data I want
to show you alter table alter table is
used to do things like add columns to to
tape delete columns change the data type
things like that alright so let's go to
our as well actually let's figure out
what we want to do first so the first
thing I want to do is show you how to
add a column so we're just going to add
one called
test or test call so let's go to our SQL
and what we want to do is say
alter table customers and we want to say
add test call okay and we also want to
specify the data type let's just say
varchar' 255 alright so let's go ahead
and click go okay so we got an OK
message here let's click browse and
you'll see we have test call now
everything is null because we haven't
done any inserts with the test call
included ok and if we click structure
you'll see that test call is a varchar'
ok so the next thing I want to show you
is how we can change the data type for
column so let's go and say
alter table customers all right now the
syntax varies depending on what database
you're using we're using MySQL so what
we'll do is say modify alright but with
other databases you might see alter
column okay so let's say modify a modify
column what we changing test call and we
want to change that to an int and let's
just give it a max of 11 characters okay
put a semicolon there and go alright now
if we go to our table and test call if
we click structure you'll see that it's
now an integer with 11 max characters ok
so last thing with alter table is I want
to show you how to actually delete a
column so we're going to say again alter
table customers
and we're going to say drop column test
call okay and now if we go back now
you'll see test call is gone alright
guys so now we're going to get into
selecting data and there's a lot to it
there's a lot of different types of
queries select queries that we can make
so we're going to start simple and then
just move up ok so first thing to do is
the easiest select statement would be
select all from customers ok the
asterisk is used as a placeholder for
all all columns ok so let's click go and
you can see it just gives us all of all
of the columns ok now if we want to
limit that we can say let's select first
name and last name from customers and we
click go and that just gives us the
first name in the last name now let's
say we want to select a specific
customer so to do that let's say select
all from customers and then we just want
to use the where clause so we'll say
where ID is equal to 3 ok actually I
don't think we have a 3 anymore
alright now we're using the ID because
that's the primary key and because it's
unique ok so if we were to say select
from where name or first name equals Bob
or something like that then it's going
to find all of the Bob so if you have
two customers named Bob then you have a
problem all right so you want to use
something unique in your where clauses
so let's go ahead and run that and you
can see that that gives us Mike he has
the ID of two all right so that's how we
can select
a specific customer now what if we want
to sort it okay if we want a certain
order so what we can do is let's say
select all from customers and then we're
going to say order by and let's do last
name okay run that and you can see we
get all rows and it's by last name okay
it starts with the D goes down to W we
can also change the sorting order okay
if we want we can say descending des see
and click go and now you can see it
starts with Williams okay and same thing
you can also do a sending which does the
same thing as the default okay now let's
say that we want to return all of the
the different states all right so we
could do select state from customers
okay we click that go and now you can
see it gives us the states but what if
we don't want duplicates okay what if we
just want one of each state all for that
we could use distinct okay so we just
put right here select distinct okay we
click go and now you can see it just
gives us one of each now there's some
other select statement too that I want
to show you but some of them have to do
with integers with numbers so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to add I'm
going to alter the table and add an age
column all right so we'll go to SQL and
let's say alter table customers and then
we want to
add column age which will be an int okay
so if we go to browse now we have age
and just really quickly I'm going to add
their ages through here okay we'll say
2345 33 20 and say 64 okay so now our
customers have ages so let's go back to
the SQL window and let's say select all
from customers where age is is less than
let's say 30 okay so this is an operator
the less than and I'll get to some of
the other ones in a minute so if we
click go you can see it's returning us
John and Lillian which are age 23 and 20
so these are the customers that are
under the age of what was it 30
okay so there's different operators that
we can use as I just showed you we have
we use the less than and of course we've
used equal to but there's actually a
whole bunch okay so you can see we have
equal to this here is not equal to which
you can also use in many different
database systems you can use exclamation
equals which means not equal to alright
we have greater than and less than we
have greater than or equal less than or
equal between which will give us a range
which I'll show you in a minute
like which will match a certain pattern
this is often used for searches okay if
you have a website and you want to be
able to search articles or something
like that
in will be equal to one of multiple
possible values we can use is or is not
- compared to null is not distinct from
which is is equal to value or both are
not
and then we have as used to change a
field name when viewing results alright
we have some examples over here but I'm
going to show you some examples all
right so let's say we want the customers
that are an aged between let's say 22
and 40 all right so what we can do is
say select we want to say select all
from customers where whoops age and then
we want to say between what I say 22 and
30 all right so let's go ahead and run
that and it looks like the only one we
have is John there's 23 um let's let's
actually do 40 ok we click go and we get
Stephen who is age 33 okay so that's how
we can use between so another one we can
use is like okay like we'll match some
kind of pattern so what we're going to
do here is let's say select all from
customers and then we want to say we're
City like and I forget what we have I
know we have Boston so let's do % n and
let's see what that gives us
okay so what that's giving us is all of
the customers where their city ends with
n ok because if we look at it the % this
is a wild card okay so that means that
anything could be here and then we
needed to end with n okay which Brooklyn
in Boston obviously that makes sense ok
if we put o N and click go now we're not
getting Brooklyn anymore because it
doesn't end with Oh n okay now let's say
that instead of just percent n let's do
percent N and then another percent and
let's see what that gives us okay so
that's giving us three records Boston
Brooklyn and Yonkers and the reason for
that is that now we're putting a
wild-card on this side of it so
basically this is getting any city that
has the letter n in it and you'll notice
Yonkers has it it's not at the end but
it's still showing up because we have a
wild-card on on both sides all right and
then at the same time we can also use
not like okay so if we put here instead
of like we put not like
and then click go okay now it's giving
us Amesbury and exeter because these
cities don't have the letter n in them
okay so that's it for like now I want to
show you in okay in is also very helpful
what that does is it allows us to
specify multiple values in a where
clause which can really shorten it up
all right so let's say select all from
customers and then we're going to say
where state in and then we want to open
up parentheses let's say New York and
New Hampshire okay and we'll click go
and you'll see that we're getting all of
the customers that are from either New
York or New Hampshire okay the
Massachusetts customers aren't coming
back all right now imagine if you if you
wanted to specify you know nine or ten
states if you were to use just aware you
would
bu it would be a long long query and by
using in we can just specify them all
inside of our parentheses alright so
we're going to talk a little bit about
indexes all right indexes are used to
speed up queries alright it is it's a
pointer to data and a table so an index
in the database is very similar to an
index in the back of a book ok it's it's
used to find data more quickly and
efficiently
alright users do not see indexes they
are just used to speed up search queries
or searches if in your website you want
to be able to look up let's say users
buy an ID you would put an index on that
ID field and speed up things
alright you only want to create indexes
on columns and tables that will
frequently will be frequently searched
against okay so you don't want to put
them on every single column or table
okay so let's say that in our
application we're going to want people
to search customers or your admins to
search customers by city so we want to
add an index on the city column so let's
go to our SQL here so let's say creates
index and then we want to give a name to
it let's just call it see index and then
we want to say on customers and let's
say city now we're going to ignore that
X for now so let's click go and now we
should have an index on the city column
so now if we go to structure and we look
at City you see we have this little key
icon which means that we have an index
on it all right let's make sure we can
still select data from it
okay so if we say select city from
customers all right and the search is
going to be much more efficient in
faster all right to remove an index is
very easy as well so let's say drop
index C index on customers okay if we go
ahead and run that and we go back to
structure you'll see that City no longer
has an index all right so we've gone
over quite a bit pretty much all of the
fundamentals of selecting data from one
table okay so what we want to do now is
create some other tables and create a
relationship between them and then I'll
show you how we can actually join tables
together for select queries all right so
what we'll do is I'm going to paste this
stuff in because it's stuff that we've
already done so what this is going to do
is it's going to create a table called
products we're going to have an ID which
will be auto increment it has a name and
a price and then a primary key of ID
okay so let's go ahead and run that okay
so now you can see we have a products
table so we're going to create another
one called orders so the orders table is
going to have an ID primary key auto
increment and then you'll see we're also
going to have an order number which is
just going to be just a made-up number
that we create and then product ID and
custom ID these are going to be foreign
key fields all right what that means is
that this Product ID column is going to
match up to the products table ID and
then this one will match up to the
customers table ID okay now we haven't
defined our foreign keys yet but I'll do
that in a second all right and then
you'll see we just have age we don't
need don't know why that's there order
date which
is going to be set to the date time
datatype and then we're just saying the
primary key is going to be ID so let's
go ahead and add the foreign key
restraints okay so what we want to do is
say foreign key let's say customer ID
and then we want to specify its
reference so we want to say references
will be to the customers table and then
to the ID field okay and then what we
can do is copy that we want to do the
same thing for products so this will be
foreign key on product ID references is
going to be to the products table to the
ID field now before we run this is one
more thing I want to do for the date the
order date I don't want to have to
manually put that in so we're going to
set a default so what we can do is just
say default and we want to say current
timestamp okay
so that'll that'll happen for us we
don't have to manually include the date
and time all right so let's go ahead and
run this we'll click go okay it looks
like it went okay we'll click structure
and you can see we now have orders okay
if we click in orders and go to
structure
notice that the product ID and the
customer ID have a key icon that's
telling us that these are foreign key
fields now the purpose of a foreign key
field is so that we can prevent data
corruption within our database or just
create an unstable database so let's say
we have this orders table and we have we
have an order that has a product ID of
three okay well we don't want to have
this Product ID of three and then in the
products table not have that specific
product with the ID of three all right
so it won't let us delete certain
records that are needed for other
records if that makes sense hopefully
all right so that's why we need foreign
key constraints all right so now we're
going to take a look at another very
important part of using relational
databases and that is table joins all
right joins are used to combine rows
from two or more tables based on a
common field between them
alright and there's different types of
joins we have an inner join left and
right joins and a full join all right so
let's take a look alright so before we
can do any joins we need to actually
have some data in our orders and
products table so let's go ahead and go
to products and we're going to just add
some data here all right so we're
inserting some products here okay we
have a name and a price and I just call
them product one two three four and five
and then just some integers for price
all right so let's go ahead and run that
okay we look at the structure actually
want to go to browse and you can see we
have our products alright so now what we
want to do is you want to go into orders
and I'm going to create some orders
alright so let's take a look at this
we're sitting insert into orders and we
have three things we want to put in an
order number product ID customer ID okay
now notice we don't have the order date
because that has a default of the
current timestamp all right if we look
at this we're just giving the order
numbers 0 0 1 and then just going up by
one alright and then we have our product
IDs you want to make sure these actually
exist same thing with the customer IDs
alright so let's go ahead and click go
alright and if we go to our orders table
now you can see we have all of these
orders now if you want to fetch an order
along with its information if we were to
just get from the orders table this is
all we could get and this this obviously
means nothing to us as far as
readability so what we need
do is do some table joins so let's go to
SQL and we're going to start with an
inner join which is probably the most
popular and what that does is it will
return all rows when there is at least
one match in both tables alright so let
me give you an example so we're going to
say select now we're using two different
tables so we need to specify the table
name along with the column name so let's
say we want to select customers dot
first-name okay we want to get the
customers dot last name and then we also
want the orders say orders dot ID and
let's also get orders dot order number
okay so the goal is to get the customer
info along with the order number okay so
we want to say from customers all right
but we want to join in the orders table
so we're going to say inner join orders
okay then we want to say on and then
this is where we want to match them
together so we want customers dot ID to
be equal to orders dot customer ID okay
these should match and then let's just
do order by let's see we'll order by
customers dot last name all right so
let's see what that gives us alright so
let's look down here and you can see we
have our first name last name we also
have the ID of the order and the order
number all right actually you know what
we probably don't want the ID
eat so let's take that out and let's run
go and now we're just getting the actual
order numbers all right and you may want
to order it by the order number okay so
if we run that now you can see it's
ordered by the order number now for a
left join that's going to return rows
from the left table with the matching
rows on the right table so let's say
select first name and we want orders dot
order number all right actually you know
let's also get the date so orders dot
order date all right and then we're
going to say from customers and then we
want to left join orders customers dot
ID should be equal to orders dot
customer ID okay and then let's just do
order by last name ok let's go ahead and
run that okay and I see same thing we're
getting the first and last name with the
order number and we're also getting the
order date and time so now let's do a
right join all right so actually what
we'll do is let's specify
borders dot order number we want
customers and let's see this time we're
going to say from orders okay and then
this will be a right join will say right
joining customers on I'm just going to
switch these and then let's do order by
orders dot order number okay so now you
can see we have our order numbers and
then the first and last name and this is
probably how you would want to do it now
another thing you might want to do is
bring in the product okay we might want
the product name so that means that we
have to join in products and orders so
let's go back to our SQL we want to
select orders dot order number we want
customers dot first-name customers dot
last name products dot name ok so that's
what we want and then we're going to say
from orders ok then we want to inner
join products
on orders dot product ID and products ID
okay then we want to also join customers
okay for that we're going to say on
orders dot customer ID equals customers
dot ID all right and then we're just
going to say order by order number
orders dot order number all right so
let's go ahead and run that and there we
go so now our result here is pulling the
data from three separate tables okay we
have the order number which is coming
from the orders table first name and
last name is coming from the customers
table and name is coming from the
products table so that's how you can
join three tables and of course you
could do more than three if you wanted
alright so now we're going to take a
quick look at a li is's okay aliases are
used to give tables or columns a
temporary name and make them more
readable all right so the column names
for this table aren't too bad but we may
want first and last name to be formatted
a little differently all right so to do
that lets go to our SQL and we're going
to select let's say first name what you
want to do is use the ads keywords so
we'll say first name as now if you're
going to use two two or more separate
words then you need to have quotes
around them so we want first space name
okay so that's that and then we also
want last name as
last name okay and then we'll say from
customers so let's go ahead and run that
and now you can see that the column
headings here have changed to a more
read readable format now another thing
you may want to do is you may want to
combine columns all right for instance
first and last name you may want that to
be returned in one column instead of two
separate ones so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to say let's just get
rid of all this now this is where we
need to use concat okay so we need to
say select concatenate I first name and
then comma then we want a space in
between them and then last name alright
then we can do has actually let's just
say name as name and then we also want
to grab the address city and state from
customers all right so let's run that
okay so now you can see we have a name
column and it has their first and last
name all right now we may want to also
join the address fields together and put
them in a single column called address
so let's go back up here and we're going
to do concat and then we'll wrap these
up okay between each one let's do
that okay let's try that
oh okay so the heading isn't correct oh
I didn't do as I'm gonna do as address
there we go
okay so we've turned it into just two
columns name and address so you can see
this can be very helpful now we can also
use this for tables so let me give you
an example of that okay so let's do
select will select ODOT ID and then
let's do Oh dots actually let's do order
date okay so this will be from the
orders table you'll see why I'm doing
this in a second and then let's do C dot
first name C dot last name and then
we're going to say from customers as C
and then also orders as o so let's go
ahead and run that and there we go we
get the order ID and the date and then
the first and last name okay so we can
use aliases for tables and columns
alright so now we're going to look at
aggregate functions in SQL okay so
there's a few of these the first one I'm
going to show you is average or AVG okay
so for this we can take a column and we
can get the average so let's do it with
the age in the customers table actually
do we still have an age yes we do okay
so let's go to SQL
and we're going to say select AVG and
then we need the column name in this
case it's going to be age from customers
okay and if we run that you can see that
the average age is 37
so that's average or AVG now let's take
a look at count so what we'll do here is
we'll say select count and let's say age
from customers okay if we run that it
gives us five ok there's five customers
with an age in the customers table okay
we also have max so if we want to find
the maximum age we can do that which is
64 and we also obviously can do min for
the minimum age which is 20 another one
is sum so if we want to get the sum of
all ages we can do that which is 185 not
sure what what that could possibly do
for us but you can do it now another
thing we could do is we can use the
group by statement and what that does is
it's used in conjunction with an
aggregate function to group the result
set by one or more columns so what I'm
going to do is just very quickly I'm
going to just make one of these ages the
same as another so let's say 33 we'll go
ahead and change 45 to 33 all right and
then let's go to our SQL and what we're
going to do is say select age and let's
use count age
from customers and we'll say where
whoops where age is greater than 30 and
then let's do group by age okay so if we
run that what it's doing is it's finding
all the ages above 30 and then it's
giving us the count of each one so
remember we have to with 33 so we get
two here okay and one for 64 and we can
also we could take out that we're if we
wanted to and that gives us everybody's
all the ages in the amount of records
with that age okay so that's group by
and another thing we could do is let's
say we only want the ages that have two
or more results okay so what we can do
is take the same thing but just add on
to it having okay so we'll say having
account that account for age that is
greater than or equal to two
all right so if we run that you can see
we only get 33 because that's the only
age that's seen two or more times okay
so back to some of the more simple
aggregate functions we have you case so
let's say we'll say select you case and
let's pass in here first name from
customers and you probably know what
this is going to do okay it's going to
put all the names in upper case and of
course we could select other things here
as well if we wanted to say last name
okay it's going to give us the last name
too but only the first name
is uppercase all right now we also have
lower case so we can do L case and let's
put this one as u case and there we go
so this is L case this is u case all
right so I think that that's going to be
it guys I mean that is that's the
fundamentals of SQL now there are good
there's going to be some stuff that I
didn't cover some more advanced stuff
but I really wanted to keep this video
under an hour and basically just give
