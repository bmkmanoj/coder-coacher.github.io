on markdown and I know that if you've
been a web developer for a while you
probably already know markdown or at
least some of the syntax if you use
github and you commit readme files and
so on but I wanted to make a crash
course on it because it's something that
everyone should know and you can
literally learn the syntax in less than
an hour so this is gonna be for
beginners as well as for people that
have used markdown but may not know the
entire syntax and what you can do with
it so we'll talk about what it is what
it's used for and then we'll jump into
vs code with the markdown preview
extension and we'll create kind of a
cheat sheet that you can use for future
reference all right so let's get into it
coding dojo is a programming school that
turns beginners into developers in only
14 weeks over 90% of their grads land
jobs within three months of graduating
often making over 70 K per year to learn
more visit coding dojo com or click the
link in the description below so what
exactly is markdown it's a lightweight
markup language with a plain text
formatting syntax so like HTML it's a
markup language but we don't use tags or
anything like that it's a very readable
syntax and it can be converted into HTML
XHTML as well as other formats and its
main purpose is readability the creators
of markdown basically one of the
documents to look like as is plain text
documents without any HTML tags or
anything like that so kind of what you
see is what you get you put a space in
the document it reflects a space no need
for a br tag and so on markdown kind of
keeps that positioning in place alright
then you can use certain characters or
punctuation marks to format stuff to
make it bold or italic you can create
lists things like that and we're gonna
take a look at all that stuff in a
little bit so what is markdown actually
used for it's widely used for readme
files and documentation markdown is
heavily used by github when you go to a
repository page
you see all that documentation that's
underneath the the the application file
structure that's usually written in
markdown in fact all you have to do when
pushing your code to a repository is
create a file called readme dot MD
markdown uses MD as a file extension it
will automatically display on the in the
github repository okay it's also used
for things like forum post blog post
things like that pieces of content on
websites and applications it's also used
quite a bit with static site generators
that's one of the reasons that I'm doing
this crash course one of the reasons I
got the idea for it is because I'm
looking into Gatsby right now which is a
static site generator that uses react
but you can also create blog posts using
a few Gatsby plugins and markdown files
okay so I was working on that and that
gave me the idea to kind of do a little
crash course on markdown itself so
here's some of the basic types of
formatting that you can do with core
markdown so headings lists emphasis like
bold and italic links you can create
links you can create blocks of code you
can have images displayed block quotes
horizontal rules things like that now
there's also basically extensions to
mark down like with PHP markdown there's
an extension you can use github itself
has its own special flavor of markdown
where you can add things like tables
task lists things like that we're gonna
take a look at some of that stuff as
well so it's gonna be kind of an
extended tutorial now as far as writing
markdown you can write it in any text
editor but it's really nice to have
something that gives you like a preview
of what its gonna look like so what I
use is vyas code for visual studio code
and I use a an extension called auto
open markdown previewer and that's
that's what I use but you can also use
other extensions for v/s code and then
of course other text editors like atom
sublime text they also have markdown
extensions or plugins you can use that's
what I would recommend but then you also
have editors that were actually created
for markdown so mark pad haru pad
markdown pad to type aura these were all
created for writing markdown and i can't
really say much about them I haven't
used them I know some are free some
aren't some have free versions and some
have premium versions but in all honesty
I would just suggest using a text editor
with an extension but it's up to you
okay but we'll be using vyas code with
with one of the extensions all right so
there's not really much more to to say
about what markdown is it's pretty
simple it's just a very lightweight
markup language so let's get into it and
let's create a cheat sheet so that you
guys can have it for future reference
and you can use it to whatever create
readme files or create blog posts things
like that alright guys so what I have
here is Visual Studio code with an
extension called Auto mark auto open
markdown preview so that's what I would
suggest for writing markdown but of
course if you want to use another
extension or another text editor with
another extension or even something that
is for markdown like Mark pad or
whatever it's absolutely fine it doesn't
really matter but I really like this
because it shows the preview on the side
and it's it's it's you don't have to
save it or anything it's really cool so
we're gonna start off with with headings
okay so I'm gonna put some comments in
here just showing what we're doing we
can use HTML style comments so for
headings we use the number sign or pound
sign hashtag whatever you want to call
this and if we just do one that's going
to give us basically an h1 it's going to
give us the largest heading okay if we
want to do in h2 we can do two whoops
close this up here hate these
notifications if we wanted to do three
say heading 3
and four five and six okay so there's
our headings so very very easy next
thing we're gonna look at is some
emphasis let's look at it-- Alex
so italics we can you we can wrap
whatever we want to italicize let's say
this text is italic so let's say we want
to wrap this text and I make that
italics so we would use either asterisks
single asterisks like that so now you
can see over here in the preview and on
the side as well that you can see it's
also italic or we can use underscores
single underscores so we can go like
that and that will also be italic all
right now if we wanted to do strong if
we wanted some strong text we could use
double asterisks so that'll make it
strong we can also use double underscore
and that will make it strong as well
all right so next thing we'll look at is
strikethrough so for strikethrough we
can use the tilde or double yeah double
tilde so we'll say this text double
tilde is strikethrough okay let's do
horizontal rule so you can use this is
like a separator and for that we use
triple what are these - x' or we can use
triple underscores and it gives us these
lines so you can use these to kind of
separate your your content now one thing
I want to mention is that if we actually
wanted to display like let's say we
wanted to show the asterisks over here
next to this text we can escape these
characters with a backslash so if I go
like that now you can see this is no
longer italicized and it's actually
showing the the the asterisks so it
works like just like in JavaScript if
you if you wanted to escape a special
character or something like that all
right so let's see continuing continuing
on let's look at block quotes so for a
block quote we use the greater than say
this is a quote and it just gives us it
gives you like background and gives you
this blue line on the side here this
border okay links
so for a link what we do is the text we
want to use for the link goes in
brackets and then for the link that will
go in parenthesis okay so now that's a
link and if I wanted to have a title
where if I hover over it it'll show the
title what I could do is copy this and
go to the end here still within the
parentheses we'll put a space and then
some quotes and whatever we want to use
as the title so now if I hover over this
now you'll see the title will be
displayed
so that's links let's move on to
unordered lists and I don't list are
easy it's just one asterisk so for each
item so let's do item one we'll say item
two has to be a space there item three
and so on and then if we wanted to have
nested items we could just tab over put
another asterisk and say nested item one
nested item two alright and you can see
the bullet is is is different as well so
if we wanted to do an ordered list we
could do one dot will say item one and
again one dot item two item three and
over here you'll see that it's actually
incrementing numbers so one two three
and so on so very easy to create lists
now if we wanted to create an inline
code block
we could use one of these vac ticks
could use back ticks so for instance if
I wanted to display like P tags we could
go like that alright if we wanted to do
let's see an image we could do it's
similar to it's actually very similar to
Lynx except we want to put an
exclamation in front of our brackets and
let's say markdown logo and then in
parentheses you want to put the location
of the image which I'm going to use HTTP
and markdown
- here dot-com /img /a con 256 dot PNG
and that will actually display the image
in the file okay so that's that's the
basics of core markdown now github has
kind of its own flavor of markdown so
we're gonna look at some of that stuff
so we'll say github markdown so four
code blocks and if you guys have created
repositories with with documentation
you've probably done this before but we
can use triple backticks so if we go
like that and you might want to do like
you know show them what they have to do
to set up so NPM install NPM start you
might see something like that and a lot
of times you might see like bash right
here or bash because you can specify
syntax specific code blocks so let's say
we want to do something in JavaScript we
could do JavaScript
and then in here let's do we'll just say
function ad and we'll say num1 num2
in return num1 plus num2 and it gives us
special highlighting for Java Script
which is nice if we wanted to do let's
say Python we could specify Python and
of course this is not Python syntax we
would do def so we wanted to find a
function we'll do ad and we don't want
our curly braces we want to put a colon
here get rid of that get rid of that and
now we have our Python syntax all right
so that's code blocks we can also do
tables and this I'm actually gonna just
paste in because it take me too long to
type and you'll see that this preview
actually translates or converts it into
this nice-looking table which is cool
another thing we can do is task lists
which should show up is like check boxes
on github if you're using this as a as a
readme file and and I'll show you that
I'll actually push this to a repository
but for task lists we would just do just
like an unordered list and then we put
some brackets and an X and say task one
so that would be like a task that's
complete and we'll do another one and
then let's do one that's not complete
like that
so that's a task list all right so I
think that's that's about it what I'm
gonna do now is actually push this to
github to see what it looks like on a
and a readme file so it's called sample
dot MD I have it on my desktop what I'm
gonna do
let me just delete that I'm gonna create
a new folder called test you guys can do
it can follow along if you want and then
I'm gonna copy that whole file we just
created and put it in here but I'm gonna
rename it to read me all caps dot MD and
then let's see I'll just grab something
I don't know
there's nothing in there we just grabbed
this app.js file it doesn't really
matter just something and we'll put it
in here and then I'm gonna open this
folder up in get bash and let's
initialize a git repository with to get
an it and I have I have an entire get
tutorial get github tutorial it's about
40 50 minutes long if you want to check
that out but we're going to do add dot
which means add it all to the staging
area
then we're gonna commit it I'm gonna add
the a.m. flag and then just a comment
I'll just say test so now we need to
github repository so we'll go and head
over to github
okay and I'm just gonna go new
repository I'll just call it test I'm
gonna delete it right away and then I'm
gonna grab the remote command right here
get remote or on that and then we want
to push to the remote repository to the
master branch I don't have my SSH key
set up on this machine okay so that
should push and let's reload and there
we go so there is all of our markdown so
you can see a little the code blocks we
did there's the table and the task list
which actually has checkboxes okay so
pretty cool now if you wanted to see the
HTML version of what we did we could
grab all this and there's actually
converters online so if we say markdown
to HTML and paste that in and it gets
converted and you can see all the HTML
with all the tags alright so hopefully
this gave you a good idea of what
markdown is what it's used for and of
course the syntax which is very very
easy it's it's really easy to remember
you may not remember it right away you
might have to look at the cheat sheet a
couple times but you'll get it pretty
quick so I'll put a link in the
description to that cheat sheet so you
guys can get it and you can use it in
the future if you want but that's gonna
be it thanks for watching guys and I'll
see you in the next video coding dojo is
