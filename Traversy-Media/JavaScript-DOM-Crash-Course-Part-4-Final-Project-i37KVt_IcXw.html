of the JavaScript Dom crash course
series in this video what we're gonna do
is take what we've learned in the last
three videos and build an actual project
just a small project with it so it's
pretty much the same interface that
we've been working with I just added a
couple things I added this search form
or this filter form up here
I also added these these delete buttons
on each item okay so if we look at the
HTML you can see that in the header we
now have the filter I split it up into
two six column divs okay we're using
bootstrap and then down here I added a
button to each list item okay I also add
an ID of add form to the form now if you
want to follow along with me just click
on the link in the description for the
code pen and just grab all of the HTML
put that into an HTML file and then link
a JavaScript file to it okay so I have a
file called main j/s which is completely
blank okay so this is gonna be our
starting point so let's look at this and
think about what we want to do so we
want to be able to add an item type
something in and add it so this is gonna
take an event right we probably want a
submit event on this form so let's go
ahead and do that we know that the form
has an ID of add form so let's create a
variable here
and we'll call it add form actually we
just call it form and we'll set it to
document dot get element by D and we
know that it has an idea of add form
alright so now that we have that let's
also put the item list the UL here into
a variable so we know that that has an
idea of items write UL ID items so we'll
save our the I will call it item list
and we'll set it to document dot
get element by ID and of course you
could use query selector if you want
however you want to select it is fine
all right so we have these two things in
variables so now what we want to do is
we want the form submit event so we're
gonna take the form variable we're gonna
add an event listener we want to say add
event listener and we want to listen for
a submit event okay so once that gets
fired off we're going to call a function
called add item alright so let's go
ahead and create that
so we'll say function add item alright
we're gonna pass in our event parameter
here our event object and remember when
we submit a form we have to stop the
prevent behavior of the the initial
behavior we have to prevent it so we
have to say prevent default in order for
that to to not happen in order for the
the normal submission of the form to not
happen all right so let's just test this
out by just saying console dot log and
we'll just say one we'll just say one
alright so we go over here and we open
up our console and submit and we get one
good so what do we want to do now we
want to basically get the value of this
input so what we'll do is to get rid of
this let's say get input value and we're
gonna create a variable for this we'll
call it new item and we'll set it to
let's say we'll set it to document dot
get element by D and we should have an
ID on the input let's hope so
oh let's see where is it
okay so the input does not have an ID so
I'm just gonna add one I didn't want to
have to do that but
okay we'll just add an ID of item all
right so that way we can grab it by D
item now I could have just used like a
query selector and said input type text
or something like that but what if we
add another text box above it it's gonna
grab the wrong thing so we I want to be
very specific here now once that we have
once we have this what we want to do is
we want to create a new li we want to
create a new one of these and add it in
with that text so remember the create
element method we're going to be using
that so let's say create new li element
and we're gonna save our li set it to
document dot create element and we're
gonna create an li alright let's also
add a class name to it because if we
look at the list item here let's look at
one of these it has a class of Lists
group item so that's what we want to add
so we'll say Ally dot class name equals
list group item alright and we can go
ahead and check it out by just saying
console.log Li
and let's just submit and we get a li
with a class of list group item alright
so now what we want to do is we want to
append the text which is going to be the
text that comes from the form all right
so let's put the comment here we'll say
add text node with input value so we'll
say Li and we're going to append child
and then we want to use document dot
create text node
and the text no we want to create is not
something that we want to you know type
in here it's gonna be the variable new
item okay that whatever came from the
form that's gonna be the text okay now
we could have put this in its own
variable this document dot create text
node and then put the variable in here
but it would just be another extra line
of code so all right so let's let's go
down here now and let's say we want to
take the item list okay which is the UL
and we want to append child okay we want
to append child and we want to pass in
Li which is the the element we just
created so let's go ahead and save and
let's type something in here and submit
let's see object HTML input element oh I
didn't get the value when we get the the
input value here this is just getting
the actual item input we want the value
so dot value all right so let's say
hello and enter and there we go it's
getting added now notice something is
wrong with this with this there's no
delete button okay that's something else
that we're gonna have to add in so what
we're gonna do is go right in here and
we want to create we want to create the
delete button element all right so again
let's just say var button I guess we'll
call it button and we'll say equals
document dot create element
okay we're creating a button
actually let's call this delete bar
delete equals the heck what's this error
variable declaration expected VAR delete
okay
can I not call it delete let's call it
delete button alright so we have our
delete button now let's go ahead and add
the classes we need because if we look
at the delete button itself it has
button or BTN button danger button small
float:right and delete so we need to add
all of those so let's go ahead and say
add classes to delete button we can do
that with delete BTN dot class name
equals BTN BTN danger BTN SM float:right
remember it has to be exact it has to be
just like the rest of them so it has to
have all these classes or it's not going
to look right and then we need the text
node okay so we're going to say we're
going to take that button or that delete
button and we're gonna say dot pen child
and we're gonna create a text node so
document dot create text node and it's
just gonna be an X okay that's that's
all it's in the button alright so now
that we have that we actually want to
append the button to the li right
because the button is inside of the ally
so let's take the Li let's say a pend
child and let's pass in delete button
all right and then here we'll say append
Li to list all right so let's go ahead
and save let's type something in hello
enter and there we go so now we have our
text and we have our button so that part
is done we can now add items so what
about removing items so what we have to
do here is we're gonna take the item
list and add an event listener to it all
right so let's say we'll just say delete
event
so we'll say item list dot you've add
events now okay we want to listen for a
click and then we're gonna call remove
item okay function called remove items
so let's go create that so function
remove item so let's see we're gonna
pass in our e object here event object
now I just want to show you something so
if we say console dot log one and we go
and we click on any of these elements
here we're gonna get that that event
that function fires off right and with
console logging one well what we want to
happen is we only want this to happen if
we click the button here okay not the
actual element I mean if you wanted that
functionality you could but I want to be
able to just click the button so what we
need to do here is we need to put in an
if statement and we need to say if e dot
target dot classlist okay dot contains
I want to say doc contains the class
deletes okay because remember those
buttons have a class of delete so we
want to check to see if what we're
clicking contains the class of delete if
it does then we want to move on so we'll
say console.log what 1 and now if I go
when I click anywhere here you'll see
we're not logging 1 if I click on the
button it does it go it logs 1 so since
this this has a class of delete then
it's going to keep going so that's what
we want and then we just want to do a
simple confirmation so we can say if
confirm so we'll have a little confirm
box pop up and it will say are you sure
ok if we click yes then we're going to
create a variable called Li set it to e
dot target dot let's use parent element
alright so basically what we're clicking
is that the button right so that's what
we're talking about right here and we
want the parent element which is the Li
ok doing you know hopefully you can
understand that that's why we're using
parent element because we're clicking on
the button we want the the parent Li and
then what we want to do is just remove
the child of the item list so the item
list is the UL okay so we're gonna say
item list and then we want to use dot
remove child and then pass in the Li
okay because the Li is a child of the
item list which is the UL so let's go
ahead and save that and let's go ahead
and delete item 3 are you sure ok and
now item 3 is gone okay so we can just
delete these if we reload they're gonna
come back because it's not persisting
anywhere but that's fine if we add
something here we can keep adding stuff
and we can just delete the stuff we add
as well
all right so we can now add and delete
items so the last thing I want to do is
I want to be able to filter these items
so this this input up here or is it it
has an idea filter so let's go ahead and
create a variable for that at the top
here we'll save our filter
document.getelementbyid d filter and
then we're gonna create an event here so
let's say say filter dot
addeventlistener
okay we're going to listen for a key up
event and then we're going to call
filter items okay let's go down here say
function filter items and let's see what
we're gonna do so first we want to get
the filter text that's being typed in
right and I want to convert it to
lowercase because I want we don't want
to match uppercase with lowercase so we
just want to make sure everything is
converted to lowercase so it's a
converts
so we'll save our text equals e dot
target dot value dot okay that's gonna
get whatever we type in but we're also
gonna add on to lowercase like that
actually that should be an uppercase C
alright and just to test it out we can
say console.log text and let's I didn't
pass in a right here
alright so even if I put in uppercase
stuff you'll see that it gets converted
to lowercase alright so now that we have
the the text that's going in let's go
ahead and let's grab all the allies
within the item list okay so we have the
variable item list so let's use that and
then we're gonna do a get elements by
tag name and we want to get all the
allies within the item list
all right oh we want to put this in a
variable so let's save our items equals
that all right and now what we want to
do is we need to turn this collection
into an array okay because there's
certain things you can't do with an HTML
collection if we were to console dot log
items what am i doing Oh up here okay so
if we look at what we're getting here
it's an HTML collection we need to
convert it to an array so we can do that
by saying array dot from pass in the the
collection which is items and then we
want to say dot for each we want to loop
through them so for each and then we're
going to run a function all right we'll
pass in here item that'll be that's our
identifier and then we're going to
create a variable called item name and
we'll set this equal to
item dot first child okay remember first
child and then we want the text content
okay so that will give us the item name
and let's go ahead and console.log this
okay so if we console.log now we're
getting item 1 2 3 every time I type
it's just gonna give us all you know
item 1 through 4 so we're getting the
item name now what we want to do is we
want to basically compare to see if what
we type in here is equal to anything
that's in down here that one that's in
this item name we will basically want to
come compare the item name to the search
box text so we're gonna say if item name
dot to lowercase because remember since
we converted the filter to the lowercase
we want to convert these to lowercase as
well so we can match them so item name
dot to lowercase and then we want to use
dot index of and then pass in text okay
so basically matching it we want to say
if it's not equal to negative 1 because
if it's not a match then it's going to
equal negative 1
all right so if this is true then what
do we want to do we want to display okay
if if it's not equal to negative 1 that
means that it's a match okay so this is
matching whatever iteration it's on so
we want to set the item dot style dot
display equal to block because we want
it to show all right else then we don't
want it to show so we'll say item dot
style dot display is going to be equal
to none we want to hide it all right so
let's save it and let's put in ad you'll
see everything goes away because it's
not matching anything so it's being set
to none okay the display style is being
set to none all right if we go ahead and
I put in an eye you'll see that they all
match that whether it's lower case or
upper case because we want that we did
that to lower case all right so if we
say eye TEM that matches everything I do
a space that matches if I do a 3
everything else disappears except for
item three so we can now filter through
these items item one two all right if I
go ahead and I add something in here
we'll say hello and if I go up here and
you can see I can filter that out all
right so we've built a very simple
interface using just vanilla JavaScript
now if you wanted to take this a step
further which we may do in another video
you could add local storage so that your
items actually get saved so if you
submit something it gets saved in the
browser in local storage that way if you
reload the page or if you leave and come
back it's still there and then you can
delete them and have those update local
storage as well all right so that may be
a project for another time but I want to
keep this series just strictly working
with you know just vanilla JavaScript
and the Dom so that's it guys I hope you
guys learned something from this course
I know that the a couple of these videos
who are really fast and kind of messy
but hopefully the the knowledge helped
you a little bit all right so thanks for
watching guys and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
