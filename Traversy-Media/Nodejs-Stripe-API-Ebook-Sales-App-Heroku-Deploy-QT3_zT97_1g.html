ton of requests to do something with the
stripe API and if you don't know what
stripe is it is a payment gateway or a
payment system that allows you to accept
credit cards on your website of your
application and it's a really nice API
there's a lot of different ways you can
implement it you can make it so it's all
on the server like we're doing with node
and Express or you can build an API with
node or Python or whatever and you can
you know send requests from vanilla
JavaScript or from react or angular you
can basically do whatever you want use
whatever platform you want and if you're
using something like Magento or some
pre-made ecommerce platform then it's
really easy to implement you just
basically plug in your API key so it's a
really nice system to use what we're
gonna be doing like i said is building a
node and express application and it's
gonna be an e-book sales site okay so
this is what we'll be building not only
will we will be building it but we're
going to deploy it to Heroku all right
so we're gonna make it live on the
Internet and basically if you see if I
push this button here to purchase for
$25 it's gonna ask us for a credit card
number all that stuff I'm gonna show you
how we can test this you can see this
you little yellow button up here we're
in test mode we'll talk about how to get
out of test mode we'll talk about how to
view your your customers and your
payments and your back-end this is the
stripe back-end here I really don't care
if you guys see it I don't I don't use
it I don't use this account at least but
that's what we'll be doing hopefully you
guys enjoy it and let's get started
coding dojo is a programming school that
turns beginners into developers in only
14 weeks over 90% of their grads land
jobs within three months of graduating
often making over seventy K per year to
learn more visit coding dojo com or
click the link in the description below
alright guys so before we actually get
started coding I figured we'd actually
look at the application and see how it
works see how I see how things get added
to stripe and all that so we're not
deployed we're not on her
now my local host but that doesn't
matter we can still use it so what we'll
do here is click the purchase button we
get the little pop-up here it's gonna
ask for an email so I'm just gonna type
in let's say Brad @ I'm just gonna say
testing to calm alright and then we can
put in a card number now if I just put
in any card number obviously this isn't
working credit card and we'll just put
in any expiration I'll say 1 9 any CVC
and then our zip code and then we try to
pay you'll see that it's not gonna let
us pay it does the actual checking right
here now what's nice about the stripe
API is they make testing very very easy
they start you out in test mode and they
actually give you a bunch of card
numbers that you can use to test this is
the one that I've been using it's just
all four twos but if I click on this
link here you'll see that there's
different kinds of cards is MasterCard
Discover American Express and all that
the documentation in my opinion is
really nice for stripe there's a lot to
it but there's a lot to the system so
we're gonna go ahead and use that valid
testing card and see what happens so
we're gonna put just all four twos and
then we'll go ahead and before I
actually click pay I just want to show
you that if you want it to remember you
you can click that you can actually
enter your number here and it'll save it
so that when you go and you try it you
repurchase something using you know the
same email address you won't have to put
your card number and again it'll just
text you a code and then you can put
that code in which is really nice but
I'm gonna uncheck that and we're just
gonna click pay all right now you see
the little green check and I made it so
that we get redirected to a success page
once we pay and it says your ebook
should be emailed to within one business
day and you can change this up and you
know put a download button just make
sure the page is protected or do
whatever you'd like I'm just giving you
a basic implementation of stripe alright
now let's go to our dashboard so this is
this is my stripe dashboard obviously
you need to sign up for a stripe account
it's free and then I'm gonna reload
and we're gonna click on actually you
can see right here gross volume $25 so
let's go and click on payments and
you'll see we have a payment for the web
development ebook we get a little ID
number here and then the customer is
Brad attesting to comm all right so
it'll show all your sales here now if we
click on customers you'll see that the
customer actually gets saved as well now
you can you can have a charge without
saving the customer but the way that we
we implemented it the way that we wrote
our code and interacted with the API
made it so that it saves the customer as
well now there's a lot more you can do
you can create subscriptions for
recurring charges you can add your own
products through the stripe API and you
can actually you know create code that's
going to purchase those products there's
a lot more you can do and I do plan on
putting out more stripe videos because I
do really like the system I think it's
really easy to work with compared to
something like authorize.net which I've
used before and even just signing up for
authorize.net is a friggin nightmare and
their API is because it's really
difficult to work with now if we go down
to what should I show you first if you
want this to go live okay if so if you
if you're all set and you want to get
out of test mode you can go to payments
settings and then you can just go right
here it says cards it says test mode
just click activate and you'll have to
do like a little application here in
order to really accept credit cards you
know you want to put what you want for
your statement for your business name
you have to put in your social security
number all that stuff and you'll have to
put your bank details because it needs
somewhere for the money to go all right
and then you just activate your account
so it by default you will be in test
mode and then when you're ready you just
want to go through this little process
which isn't isn't bad at all compared to
like I said something like authorize net
now once you are done and you want to
get rid of this test data what you can
do is go to business settings and go to
data and right here there's an option
that says delete all test data so if I
click that it's gonna you know show us
all the different test data we have to
Jive two charges one customer I'm gonna
click delete now it's gonna ask for your
pass usually it asks for a password I
don't know why it didn't but it should
be deleted now so if we go to payments
you'll see that there's nothing there if
I go to customers nothing there all
right so the back end of the stripe API
is pretty easy to use now two things
you're gonna need are your your
publishable key which is like your
public key and then your secret key and
you can get those just by going to API
alright so right here you can see we
have a publishable key which is this and
then secret key if I click reveal I
don't care if you guys see this I'm
gonna change it anyways this is your
secret key so the public key can go you
know right in the forum and then the
secret key resides on the server now
when we deploy to Heroku we're actually
going to set some environment variables
and put these inside of those so that we
don't have to have them right inside the
file on our server okay when it's live
so once you go live these these keys
should change and they'll they'll no
longer have the test in it they won't be
test Keys anymore and then you just need
to update your keys in your application
so I think that's everything I'm just
trying to get everything out of the way
before we actually start writing code so
you know exactly what's going on alright
so let's go ahead and start to write
some code now I'm gonna go ahead and
just go into the S code and they have an
empty folder called ebook seller okay so
that's the folder I'm using just create
a folder wherever you want on your
machine and from here we want to do you
know the normal stuff that we would do
with a node application we want to run
NPM in it then we want to install our
dependencies so I'm gonna open the
integrated terminal for vyas code of
course you can use whatever you'd like
notice that I'm also using git bash
inside here if you guys want to get get
bash on
those you can go to get - SCM comm and
then if you want to integrate it with vs
code you can simply go to preferences
settings and you can just add this right
here alright so this terminal integrated
shell windows and just point to the git
bash program so let's close that up now
what we're gonna do is just run NPM in
it and I'm sorry if that was a lot of
explanation I just really want to try to
explain how everything works
rather than just jumping into the code
so let's go ahead and go through this
ebook seller that's fine version
description will say app to sell ebook
and entry point I like to use app dot J
s and then we'll just enter through the
rest all right so now we have our
package dot Jason should look like
something like this
I have MIT for my default I also have my
name for the default now what we're
gonna do is install our dependency so
let's clear this out and there's a few
things we're gonna need so let's say npm
install - - save and we're gonna need
Express we're gonna need stripe
we're gonna need Express - handlebars so
we're gonna use for our template engine
and then we're gonna need body parser ok
body parser is used so that we can
actually get form data on the server
alright and I think that's it that
should be is let me just double check
yeah that should be it let's go ahead
and run that
all right and while that's going on
we'll go ahead and create our app das
file alright so this is basically our
entry point I'm gonna create a start
script for this so in our package JSON
file let's replace this test under
scripts as start and then we want to
start with node app alright our node app
J s so we'll go ahead and save that
alright so in our app J S we're going to
just pretty much set up a standard
Express server we're gonna bring it in
let's say Const Express equals require
Express then what we want to do is bring
in stripe but before we do that I'm
going to pull up the documentation for
the stripe module so I'm just going to
search for NPM stripe okay now when we
bring it in okay so when we require it
we need to then put a set of parentheses
after it with that the secret key now if
we look at our dashboard remember we
have a publishable key which is okay if
people see that and then the secret key
which goes on the server which no one
should see now when we get ready to
deploy I want to have two separate key
files one for dev which will just put
the keys right in the file and then one
for our production server where we're
gonna use environment variables from
Heroku okay but we're gonna get into
that later for now we're just gonna take
our secret key and just put it right in
so let's go back to vs code and let's
bring in stripe set that to require
stripe and then put a set of parentheses
after that and we're just going to put
in our secret key ok yours yours will
obviously be different and what's nice
is when you're looking through the
documentation here it'll actually
replace all of the stuff here any code
examples will have your actual public
key or your secret key alright if you
can see that this one ends in LA and if
we look at mine and Xan
so as long as you're logged in the API
documentation will actually show your
key and exactly what you should put in
you can see it also has my business name
and everything which is kind of cool I
really like the documentation for stripe
alright so let's get back to work here
we'll go back to visual studio let's
bring in the rest of our stuff so we're
going to need body parser
so we'll say require and that'll be body
- parser and we want to bring in
handlebars so this is going to be exp
HBS we're gonna set that to require
Express - handlebars alright so now that
we've brought everything in let's
initialize our application with will say
Const app equals Express ok just
standard Express stuff let's go ahead I
just want to get the server actually up
and running so let's create a poor it
looks like on support equals now we're
gonna be deploying to Heroku so we need
to use process dot Ian V dot port or
port 5,000 for local alright because
basically Heroku is gonna choose the
port from here but since we're you know
when we're working locally we want to be
port 5000 alright then we're going to
just say app dot listen this will start
our server we're gonna listen on
whatever port is in that variable and
then we'll put an arrow function here as
our callback and we'll just console
console dot log we'll put in some back
ticks here so we can use a template
string and we'll say server started on
ports and then we can just put in a
variable like this port so let's save
this and since we put this start script
right here we should be able to just run
this with
and p.m. start alright started on five
thousand let's go to local host port
five thousand and we're gonna get cannot
get slash okay and you guys that have
worked with node and Express should know
that this is because we don't have an
index route we don't have any routes so
we're getting that but the server is in
fact running so let's go back and before
we move any further what I'm going to do
is I'm going to stop this with a control
C and I don't want to have to keep
restarting the server every time we make
changes and we want to check it so what
I'm going to do is install something
called node Mon and what that does is
it'll it'll continuously watch our
application I know a lot of you guys
know this already but it'll make it so
that we don't have to keep restarting
the server and we want to install this
globally so we're gonna do NPM install -
g4 global node Mon alright already have
it installed so mine might go a little
quicker alright so once we do that we
can just say node Mon and it'll start it
up for us
alright so let's go ahead and add a
route here now our index route is going
to be basically just the only page we
have we're gonna have the index page and
then the success page so let's go ahead
and put that right here we'll say index
route we're gonna say app dot get it's
gonna get request to slash okay we'll
put an arrow function here and that'll
have requests and response and then all
we want to do here is render a template
so to do that we need to just do res dot
render and then the template name which
will be index all right let me make this
a little smaller here now before this
can actually work and we can render a
view a handlebars view we need to add
some middleware and handlebars isn't the
only thing we need to add middleware for
we need to add it for body parser we
also need to let Express know that we
want to use a certain folder for static
assets like images because we are
gonna use two images we're gonna have
one for the actual eBook we're gonna
also have one in the the check out box
right here I'm gonna replace this image
with my logo and of course you guys can
use whatever you'd like
alright so let's go back to visual
studio code and let's add this stuff so
let's say handlebars middleware so this
is basically just two lines we're gonna
say app dot engine I'm gonna pass in
handlebars and this is all in the
documentation for express handlebars if
you want to check that out and then we
want to do exp HBS parentheses okay so
this exp HBS comes from right here and
then we want to pass in a configuration
object and the only thing that I want to
put here is default layout and we're
gonna set that to Main
so basically we're saying that the the
layout that wraps around all of our
views should be called main dot
handlebars and then under that we just
want to say app dot set we want to pass
in some single quotes and just save you
space engine and we're setting the view
engine to handlebars so that's the
required middleware now for body parser
we want to say app dot use and in here
we'll say body parser dot jason and then
a set of parentheses and then we want to
do app dot use body parser dot URL
encoded and we want to pass it in
objects we want to pass in some curly
braces and we just want to say extended
false all right once you do this enough
you know you won't have to look that
look up the documentation anymore you'll
just remember it alright and then we
want to set the static folder because we
need a place to put our images and any
extra style sheets if you want anything
like that
so for that let's do app dot use and
inside here we're gonna say Express dot
static static open some parentheses and
we're gonna put in some back ticks here
so we can use a template string and then
we're gonna put a variable so to use
variables in template strings you use
money sign and then curly braces alright
we're just gonna put double underscore
dur name so could the current directory
we're gonna go outside of that curly
brace and do slash public all right
you'll often see this done with the path
module as well but I'm I don't feel like
bringing the path module in so basically
we're just saying that the folder that's
named public is going to be set as the
static folder where we can put our
images and stuff all right so let's save
that let's go over here and create a
public folder and let's create a folder
inside public called IMG and just to
just to do it before I forget I'm just
going to bring the images in and you can
get these in the link in the description
so this is our application I'm gonna go
in public image and I'm gonna bring in
both of these images say pcs n so one is
the e-book and one is the replacement
for the check out box now make sure that
whatever you want to use for the check
out box you call it marketplace dot PNG
that's what it's gonna look for alright
so now we can start to take care of our
views so let's create a folder called
views now remember we said the default
layout is going to be called main so
inside views we're gonna create a folder
called layouts alright and then we're
gonna set a new file called main dot
handlebars and this is gonna wrap around
all of our other views so let's put our
basic HTML head and body tags in here
inside the title I'm just gonna say web
development eBook
and wherever we want the views to output
we want to put in triple curly braces
and then body all right this will output
whatever we're whatever view were
rendering such as index so let's save
now in our app js4 our home route we're
rendering an index view so we need to
create that so not inside layouts but
inside views we want to create a file
called index dot handlebars and for now
let's just say hello I'll say hello
index and save let's go back and reload
and we get hello index so the home page
or the index page whatever you want to
call it is now loading the index view
alright so let's see what's next let's
go ahead and add the nav bar to our main
handlebars actually first of all we need
to bring in bootstrap so I'm gonna just
bring in the CDN so I'll go to get
bootstrap comm we're using bootstrap for
beta at this time we're gonna grab this
link this is just the CSS I'm not gonna
bother bringing in the JavaScript and
all this jQuery and stuff because we're
not using any of that we don't need that
so just the CSS part excuse me
and we're gonna paste it in right here
and let's go ahead and add the navbar
I'm gonna put it right above the body
right here right above this and I'm
gonna paste this in just so I don't have
to type it out and it's really easy
because there's no links or anything so
basically we just want two nav tag with
some classes we have nav bar now bar
expand MD nav bar dark BG dark and then
py three this py three is a padding
class if you guys took my bootstrap for
udemy course you know all about this if
not basically py just means padding for
the top and bottom and then three is a
multiplier this can be either one
through five all right so it's going to
add some padding to the top and bottom
then we just have a container and then
in a tag with the class of navbar brand
and then an h3 with I put traversée
media but of course you can put whatever
you want
alright let's also wrap a container
around the body okay that way we don't
have to do it in every single view even
though we only have two views but it's
good just in case you want to add more
views later alright so we'll save that
and then it should be all set for the
layout so if we go back to our index
page and reload it should look like this
alright oh one more thing I want to make
the background blue so I'm just gonna
add a class to the body called BG
primary alright actually we might as
well add text white as well class called
text white and there we go so now we're
gonna work on the index page so we're
gonna go to our index handlebars now try
to bear with me there's quite a bit of
bootstrap markup here I just I don't
like to copy and paste you guys know
that I like to do it from scratch even
though this is a stripe tutorial I like
to start it from scratch I mean I could
have done all this already but what
about the people that don't know you
know how to implement handlebars or
anything like that so I'm trying I'm
always trying to think of everyone not
just the people that you know just want
to learn about stripe so this is going
to have a class of py too so padding on
the top and bottom and that's the only
class we need for this and then we're
gonna have a row because we're gonna use
the grid we're gonna have two six column
divs so we're gonna have a class of call
MD call - MD - six and let's Center
everything so we'll also have a class of
text - Center by the way this syntax
that I'm using is because I'm using
Emmet Emmet comes pre-installed with vs
code if you're using atom or sublime
text or something you want to install it
as a plugin alright so we can use the
syntax like this and click tab
and it'll turn it into classes all right
so let's see inside here we're going to
have an h1 I'm gonna give this h1 a
class of display - 3 which is a
bootstrap for class we're gonna do MT 5
actually it's - MT 3 which is margin top
three and then let's do PT - 5 which is
padding top 5 all right and then in the
h1 we're going to say web development
eBook
and let's see under the h1 we're just
going to put a paragraph with a class of
lead which will make the text a little
bigger and we'll say learn web
development front to back all right
let's save it ok so that's what it
should look like so before we add the
pay button I just want to add the image
over here so let's see we need our
second six column divs so under this
class this column d6 we're gonna create
another one called call em d6 and we're
gonna put in our image and the source is
gonna go to / IMG / look dot PNG alright
and then we're just gonna give this
let's give this a class of IMG - fluid
which is a bootstrap for class save it
reload and there we go alright so now we
have the the markup stuff out of the way
the the uninteresting stuff now we're
gonna get into stripe so if we go and we
look at check out okay so check out is
basically this here this is this is
called check out and this tells us how
to integrate it so basically we need to
have a form it's gonna have an action
that's gonna go to whatever route we're
submitting it to it's gonna be a post
request so we want this to go to slash
charge on our express site or express
back in
and then we need to include this script
tag with all of this stuff in it okay
which I'm gonna change some of it up but
let's grab this form all right now if
you're not logged in to stripe and
you're not looking at this documentation
that's fine you can just you can just
manually typing it type it in but I'm
gonna go back to vs code and we're gonna
go under the paragraph here right yeah
under the paragraph and we're going to
paste this in alright so this form right
here the action is going to go to slash
charge all right that's where we want
this to go and then we want to keep the
source this script here this is this is
the check out script check out J s okay
we have a class of stripe button the
data key should be your public key okay
so in your stripe dashboard whatever
this is right here your publishable key
that's what you want there the data
amount is going to be the amount that
you want to charge them which and in
this case is gonna be twenty five two
five zero zero so that's going to be
twenty five dollars okay
data name for this we're gonna call web
development eBook this is basically the
product name all right in the
description
this says widget by default I'm going to
change this to e-book written by Brad
traversée and you can put whatever you
want here now this right here you can
see this is the data image so this is
this image right here where is it right
here
now if you want to change it like I said
it has to be called Market Place dot PNG
so if you go and do what we did earlier
and you put the market place PNG file
into your image folder then we can just
change this right here to / IMG /
marketplace PNG all right and then that
should be good so let's save this
and let's go back to our application and
reload and we're gonna get this pay with
card let's click it and there we go
alright so if we submit this it's not
going to do anything because it's not we
have nothing in that that charge route
in fact we can go ahead and try it
we'll say test at something calm card
number all right now since I've used
this email address before my browser
knows that I've used it it's asking if I
want to get sent the code so I don't
have to put my card in again but of
course I'm not going to do that so let's
do four two actually before we do that
let's try something that doesn't work
all right
so you can see it's not gonna work it's
actually checking it now if we put in
one that does work and pay this will
check off and it's going to redirect to
charge and nothing happens I mean if we
go to our dashboard we go to payments
we're not gonna see anything because we
don't have a back-end okay which you all
we've done is the front end form at this
point so we're just going to get this
error all right now before we work on
the backend I want to show you how we
can customize this now it took me a
while to figure out how to customize
this but still but still be able to use
it in the way that we are without having
to make an AJAX request or anything like
that to still be able to use the action
right here so the solution was to hide
the default stripe button and then add
our own so we're gonna go under this
script right here and put another script
okay and we're gonna say hide default
stripe button now you don't have to do
this if this button is fine for you this
pay with card that then just leave it
but if you want to add your own this is
how you can do it so let's see we're
going to do
a document I'm gonna say document dot
get elements by class name and then here
we want to get stripe - button - EE L
alright we want to get the first one so
let's say brackets zero and then we're
gonna set dot style dot display equal to
none all right so that's gonna hide the
initial button if we save this and we
reload the button goes away
alright now to add our own all we have
to do is go under the script tag we just
created and just put in a button we're
gonna give it the type of submit okay so
button type submit let's give it our
bootstrap classes so I'm gonna say BTN
BTN - what I do
outline - dark but I also did text white
and let's make it bigger so we'll say
BTN - LG and for the text will say
purchase for $25 and save reload and
there we go so now if I click that we
get our pop-up alright so that's the
simplest way that I could find to
replace the button and still use the
check out module alright so I think
that's it for for this side of it now
what we want to do is work on the charge
route okay I remember when we submit it
it goes it makes a post request to slash
charge so let's go ahead and go back to
our app J s
and it'll say charge route so it's gonna
be apt dot app taught post slash charge
okay it's going to take a request and
response and now what do we want to do
here so here we want to first of all
create the amount will say Const amount
and we're going to set that to 2500
which is $25.00 and then we want to do
two things we want to create the
customer and then we want to charge the
customer and if we look at the
documentation here for the strike
package it shows us right here we want
to do strike customers create and then
it gives us it's a it sends back a
promise so we want to do dot then then
it'll give us the customer and then we
can call stripe dot charges dot create
and then we can charge the customer so
ours is gonna look a little different
than this but that's the basic idea but
before we do that what I want to do is
show you what comes in from that form so
let's say console dot log and we're
gonna log request dot body that's how we
get form data with the body parser and
then let's just do res dot sin doesn't
really matter what we put here just to
have it do something so let's save that
and then we'll submit the form with the
credit card and we'll see what this
gives us and then it'll show it down
here alright so let's go back and we'll
just put in a brad at test3 dot-com
put it on let's put in our good credit
card whoops
okay expiration this stuff doesn't
matter as long as you use that card
number this stuff doesn't matter and
we'll pay we're just gonna get it's just
gonna res dot send test but let's look
at the console and then this is what it
gives us stripe token okay token this is
this is basically a reference to the
actual card you can see that the stripe
token type is card and then it gives us
the email okay and that's what we can
use to create our customer so I just
wanted you to know what that form
actually sends it's this object with
these three things all right so let's go
ahead and get rid of that now and let's
proceed to say stripe dot customers dot
create when I pass in a set of curly
braces here and we want the email we can
get that with request dot body dot
striped email all right just like it
says down here stripe email okay this is
request dot body we want the specific
stripe email value so that's what we're
putting right here all right then we
also want to put in source which is
going to be the stripe token so request
dot body dot stripe token okay which is
this here so that'll create the customer
and then what that does is it gives us
back a promise so we can say dot then
and then in here we'll put in customer
because it gives us a customer back and
we'll set that to I'll set it to stripe
dot what is it charges stripe dot
charges dot create alright and then
inside here we're gonna pass in an
object okay should look like that
believe that's right and then we want
the amount which up here we defined
so I'm going to use es6 instead of doing
amount amount since it's the same thing
we can just do amount once then we want
the description of the product which is
web development eBook we want the
currency that is being used and that's
going to be USD we want the customer
remember this promise that this gave us
back gives us it gives us a customer
object and we want to set this to
customer dot ID okay that object has an
ID all right then we're going to do one
more dot then and for this we're gonna
say charge and then we just want to
basically render the success page so
we'll say res dot render success and
that's it that's going to do everything
that's going to add the customer and
that's going to charge the customer so
pretty simple block of code at least for
what it does so now what we want to do
is create the success page that it's
going to redirect us to or not redirect
but render so let's go into views create
a new file called success dots
handlebars well I forgot the age there
alright so in here we're gonna put a
section and give this a class of key Y -
5 that's yeah it should be good and then
let's do an h1 we'll give it a class of
display - 3 and in this h1 we're just
gonna say thank you and then we'll put a
paragraph with the class of lead and
we'll say your ebook should be emailed
to you within one business day and you
can handle this however you'd like and
then I'm just gonna put a go back button
or go home button so a href - slash -
give it a class of BTN and BTN dark BTN
LG and in here we'll say go back home
alright so yeah that should be good
let's save and if you want to just check
this page out just to make sure but you
know before you actually go and do a
transaction you could just create a
simple get request so let's say slash
success and we'll load up the success
view so now if we go to slash success
there it is alright I don't want to keep
that as a route though I just wanted to
see what it looked like so I'm gonna get
rid of that okay so we should be all set
guys now there's some other stuff we
need to do before we deploy but let's go
ahead and test it out let's see if we
actually add the payment and the
customer to my stripe account oh and
just so you can see I have right now I
have no payments
I have no customers so let's try it out
alright so we want to go back to our
index purchase let's say Brad at I don't
know hello Tom card number and pay check
hopefully it went through and then it
redirected us let's go to our stripe
dashboard let's reload payments and
there it is web development ebook okay
there's a little invoice thing it shows
you it even shows you the route down
here that that it worked with Brad at
hello was charged $25 so if we go to
customers there is Brad at hello so we
have a working stripe website now if
you're not interested in deployment then
that's it that's all you need but if you
want to keep going and you want to
actually deploy to Heroku then let's
let's change some things up all right so
basically all we have to change in our
application is the way that we we have
our keys okay I don't want to just put
the key right in the file like this I
don't even want to put it in like this
our publishable key so we're gonna
create a new folder called config okay
and if you guys took my note j s dev to
deployment course this is going to be
very similar to what we did with our two
applications there we're gonna create a
new file called keys j s
okay we're gonna create another file in
there called keys underscore dev j/s and
then finally we're gonna have another
file called keys underscore prod dot Jas
so basically dev is going to be is just
our development keys and we don't want
to push that to the server the
production keys is what we want to push
to the server now in the regular keys
Jas we're gonna check to see if we're
actually in a development environment or
not or in a production environment if we
are then we're gonna load keys dot prod
if we're not we're gonna load keys dev
so let's first go to keys dot dev all
right and we're going to just say module
dot exports so we're just exporting an
object and this object is going to have
stripe publishable key okay and the
value for that is going to be our
publishable key which is I guess I mean
we could get it in our dashboard so if
you go to API you'll see your keys here
so this is the publishable one I'm gonna
grab that put that in there remember
this is the keys dev file the next one
will be stripe secret key excuse me
secret key and we're gonna set that to
our secret key which is this okay so
we'll put that in right there
and save now what I'm gonna do is copy
this and now go to the keys prod j/s and
paste that in now instead of just
putting these directly in these keys
directly in here we're gonna replace
this with an environment variable that
we're gonna add to Heroku and for this
we can say process dot E and V dot and
we're gonna call it stripe underscore
publishable underscore key
okay and then for this one here we're
going to say process dot Ian v dot
stripe underscore secret underscore key
okay and you don't have to do all this
but it's just good practice it makes it
much more secure rather than just having
your keys right on your in your files
like that but that should do it let's
save this and then we can close up both
keys prod and keys dev and now we would
we want to go into keys GIS and
basically we just want to test to see
what environment we're in so we can say
if process dot NV dot node underscore
env so if the node environment is equal
to production basically if we're on if
we're in Heroku it's going to be equal
to production then we want to export
will say module dot exports equals and
then we want to just require dot slash
keys underscore prod
all right else if we're in development
or anything else we want to export the
dev keys all right keys underscore dev
so what if one our local machine then
that's what we're going to be using all
right if we're on the server then it's
going to use those those variables so
let's save this alright now we want to
do we can close it up let's close up
everything except for app KS and now we
want to bring in the keys file okay and
we're gonna replace this hard-coded
secret key right here so you want to
make sure that you bring in the keys
file above the stripe so we'll say
kant's keys equals require and it's
inside the config file slash keys
alright and then we're going to replace
this with keys dot
stripe secret key just like that now for
the publishable key you remember that's
that's in the index right that's in the
index route so we're gonna pass that in
right here all right we'll pass it in as
a value so we'll say stripe publishable
key set it to keys dot stripe
publishable key save it and then we'll
go to our index dot handlebars and
replace the hard-coded value right here
with some double curly braces and it's
going to be stripe publishable spell
that right publishable key and save all
right so we should be good now the
purpose of half of this of separating
these is so that we don't have to have
the dev keys on the server so when we
use Heroku the way that we push to
Heroku is with git okay the git version
control system so we want to create a
file here inside the root so we'll say
new file we can't want to call it dot
git ignore get ignore dot get ignore
sorry and we just want to put in here
that we want to ignore the keys
underscore dev dot J's file okay any
file with that name should be ignored
all right we also want to ignore the
node modules folder okay we don't want
to we don't want to push that to Heroku
either so both of these should be in the
get dot get ignore all right now what we
want to do is initialize this as a
repository I get repository so let's go
ahead and get out of this clear it out
and we'll say get in it that'll
initialize it as a git repository then
we're going to do get add dot so this is
adding everything we're adding all files
then we're gonna commit so get commit -
a.m. and then in here we just want to
put us just a comment so I'm just gonna
say initial commit alright and that
commits everything to the local
repository now what we need to do is we
need to install the Heroku CLI so that
we can actually push this to Heroku
alright so we're gonna go to let's just
search for Heroku CLI and if you already
have it installed that's fine but for
those of you that don't you just want to
click on your platform I'm on Windows
and Windows has a an installer that I
can download so I'm gonna grab the
64-bit installer which I already
actually already have but that's fine
alright if you're on Mac OS you can grab
that installer if you're on a bun too
you can go ahead and run this command
but I'm gonna go ahead and open this up
and make sure you have both of these
checked will click Next install that
should install real quick
all right so that's all set so I'm gonna
click close now for some reason Heroku
does the command Heroku does not work
and get bash for me ever
I say Heroku actually let's try I mean
the first command we have to run is
Heroku login so I'm gonna try that why
was it gonna work usually doesn't know
oh it is oh alright well usually it
doesn't if it does not work and get bash
and you're on Windows just go ahead and
open up the standard you know Windows
command line and run it as administrator
and then navigate to your your
application so I'm going to go ahead and
log in here with traversée media at
gmail and password alright so now I'm
logged in so now what I want to do is I
want to create an application make sure
you're in your your apps folder so we
want to say Heroku create ok so it
created it called the peaceful island
it'll give it some weird friggin name
and then if we go to the Heroku
dashboard and reload you'll see this
peaceful island this is our application
now we still have to add this as a
repository so let's click on that and
let's go to settings
I'm sorry not settings deploy and down
here you'll see this command right here
Heroku get remote and then the name of
your app so you just want to grab that
go back to the command line I'm just
going to clear this out and I'm going to
paste that in and that's basically going
to add it as a repository so now we can
push to it now we already have
everything in our local git repository
because remember we did the git add
they get commit if I do get status right
now you'll see that there's nothing to
commit everything is already in there so
all we have to do now is say get commit
I'm sorry not commit and get push your
Roku master I'm going to push to the
Heroku master branch and that should
upload everything to Heroku and
hopefully it works all right everything
looks okay so now you can either go to
your dashboard and go to open app or you
should be able to just type in your
terminal you should be able to say
Heroku open and it'll open it in the
browser now I'm getting an application
error of course so what you want to do
now if this is happening to you if not
then that's great if it is then you just
want to say Heroku logs and let's see
what's going on here let's see can i oh
cannot find module keys dev wait a
second you shouldn't be able to find
module keys dev what do they do here hi
I forgot an e right here
since I forgot that he it was actually
looking for this file which isn't there
because we put it in the git ignore it
didn't get pushed to Heroku so let's fix
that and save and then what we'll have
to do is is we clear this out we'll have
to say git add all get commit and this
is what you do every time you want to
you know you change something and you
want to commit again
so we'll say fixed fixed Keys file
alright then we'll say git push Heroku
master
all right hopefully this works all right
so let's try it again actually just go
over here and reload and there we go and
you can see we're now live on the
internet so now we want to actually test
this out what I'm gonna do first though
is just delete all my test data from
stripe you can see we still have this in
here so I'm gonna go to business
settings data and delete all test data
okay
so now if we go back to payments you'll
see there's no payments if we go to
customers there's no customer so let's
try it from our remote application
purchase email let's do and I'll say
Harry at gmail.com card number we'll use
our good 109 18 pay you did not set a
valid publishable key oh we didn't add
our environment variables for Heroku so
it what happened is it doesn't know it
doesn't know what the hell this is here
or this so to do this we need to go back
to our dashboard in Heroku and go to
settings go to reveal config VARs and we
need to add those so stripe publishable
underscore key value is going to be our
publishable key which we can get right
here
okay add and then stripe underscore
secret key that all right so we'll add
that and then that should be good so now
it should know what we're talking about
so let's go back to our remote
application which is right here let's
just reload it let's try it again
well see I used an email address I
already used so it's asking if we want
to use the the phone thing but I don't
want to
all right so redirected us to our
success page on our remote site now
let's go to the dashboard go to payments
and reload and there we go
how are you at Gmail if we go to
customers we should see them there as
well all right so we now have our site
deployed on the internet and then if you
wanted to add a domain you could just go
to your settings and go to add domain
enter it in and then you just have to go
to your domain registrar and then add a
cname value and again if you've seen my
node dev to deployment course we did all
that so it's the same exact thing
alright so that's pretty much it now if
you want this to actually go live you'll
have to implement SSL and you can see
right here it says upgrade to paid Dinos
to configure Heroku SSL all right so you
you you definitely want an SSL
certificate if you're taking payments
all right now you don't have to use
Heroku you could use something else
digitalocean or anything else where you
can deploy a node application all right
this is just one option and when you're
ready to go live of course like I said
like I showed you earlier you want to go
to your or is it now I forget payments
settings and activate ok and just go
through the application and I believe
you'll get a different set of API keys
you just want to switch those out all
right and then you should be able to
take payments and it should go into your
bank account and you'll have your
payment system alright so I know this
was kind of long guys and I kind of went
off topic a little bit here and there
but hopefully you understand the gist of
it I'll put the code in the description
so you'll have that to look at if if you
got confused along the way but thanks
for watching guys I will have more
strife API tutorials in the future
including using other languages so
