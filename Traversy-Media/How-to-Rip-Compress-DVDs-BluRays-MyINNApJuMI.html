you how you can rip DVDs or blu-rays
onto your PC or onto your server
alright you probably want to do this
because you want to set up a home server
and if you're going to do that I would
suggest using Plex which is a whole
media server it's free and it's
basically your own personal Netflix you
can see here I have my movie list I have
nine hundred and seventy movies here and
I have access to these pretty much from
anywhere
alright so within my network and then
you can also set it up so that you can
access it from outside your network for
instance if you go on vacation you'll
have access to all your movies which is
really nice
I'm not gonna go too much into Plex I'm
gonna make some videos on plex itself
but what I'm gonna do here is show you
how you can get the movies off of either
a DVD or a blu-ray depending on what
kind of CD drive you have in your PC
alright he'll need a blu-ray drive if
you want to rip blu-rays same thing with
DVDs alright so we're gonna use two
programs to do this one is called make
MKV and what that's gonna do is it's
gonna grab all the video files off of
the disc alright so you'll have the main
video and then you'll have things like
if they have for instance
behind-the-scenes or directors cuts or
something like that and those will be
smaller video files alright so I suggest
just keeping the main movie and using
that now that itself is gonna be between
two gigabytes up to six gigabytes or
even more so that's it that's a pretty
good amount of space just for one movie
so you don't want it I mean you could
put that directly onto your server and
watch it but I would definitely suggest
using handbrake which is the second
program to shrink that file and you can
shrink it up to you can make it three
four times smaller usually around seven
eight nine hundred megabytes or so
alright so we're gonna go ahead and
install these two things and I'm gonna
show you how to do that
alright so you just want to download go
ahead and click download here
and here and I already already did it so
have the files here and we're gonna
first install make MKV alright so very
simple it's just a you know standard
Windows software installation I'm just
going to choose all the defaults
all right so that's all set now we'll
install handbrake same thing just pretty
much click Next the whole way
and there are other programs you can use
to do this but this is these are the two
that I prefer so first thing we're gonna
do is run make MKV and I have a DVD in
there now which is I think it's mr.
deeds but what you want to do is go to
file and then open disc oh shoot wait a
minute
since I'm in a virtually you guys won't
have this issue but since I'm in a
virtual machine I think that it's giving
me an issue so let's say use physical
drive see if that works
oops don't want to do that either
so want to go to file if it'll let us
all right so you want to go to open disc
there we go so you guys won't have that
issue unless you're on a virtual machine
we're going to do that and then it's
going to just take a little bit of time
just to scan the disk and and separate
the the mkv files all right so I'm gonna
go ahead and pause this until it's
finished alright guys so it's finished
looking at the disk and this is what it
gave us back alright so you can see
there's multiple files here and if you
look at the sizes the top one it's
usually the top one that's the main
movie and it tells you that we have 28
chapters and it's 3.6 gigabytes
alright then we have a bunch of others
that range from looks like around 80
megabytes up to almost 700 megabytes so
we don't want these all right so now
uncheck those so just the main movie is
3.6 gigs
all right that's that's pretty big so
now what you want to do is you want to
click this make MKV button and it's
gonna ask you it it's gonna direct you
to see your C Drive slash video slash
and then the movie name and you can go
ahead and change that I think you can
change it up in the properties but we're
just going to keep that it's going to
create the directory for us alright so
now it's gonna go through another
processing thing and it's going to give
us that MKV file alright so I'm gonna go
ahead and pause this and I'll be back
when it's complete alright so that's all
set and you can see we get copy complete
one title saved
ok so we'll click OK and let's open up
let's see
let's go to our C Drive and video and
you can see we have mr. deeds if we open
that up we have this MKV file which is
3.46 a gigabytes now I could go ahead
and put this in my library and watch it
but I don't like that file size alright
so what we'll do now is let's open up
handbrake and what we'll do is go to
source and then file alright and we'll
go to C Drive video mr. deeds and then
we want to open that up
all right
and then for the destination let's say C
Drive I want the same in the video
folder and then we want to name it I'll
say mr. G's dot and we want to use mp4
all right so then we just click start
and it's gonna go through you can see
the progress bar down here alright so
again I'm gonna pause the video and I'll
be back when it's done alright guys so
now you can see down here Burgett q
finished and if we go back into our
video folder we now have the mr. deeds
mp4 and you can see down here that it's
now one gigabyte alright so we got that
down quite a bit you could probably get
make it a little less if you messed
around with the compression settings and
all that but all in all one gigabytes
not too bad for a full DVD alright so we
can open that up and it should just play
all right so there we go
and this is a virtual machine so it's
gonna be it's gonna be able to jump up
alright so let's go ahead and close that
and if we want to add this to my media
server I'm gonna go ahead and go to my
network and let's see we want to go I'm
just gonna go ahead and manually type it
in here alright so this is my server and
I want to go to movies and comedy and
then what we'll do is let's create a new
folder call it mr. deeds
and I'm gonna bring that over
and the way that this works is in plex
if I went ahead and added a library and
I added this this whole movies folder
alright so no matter so whatever I put
in this folder is going to show up in my
library alright so we now see that
that's there so let's go back to the
plex app and this you only need to do
this if you have if you want to use plex
we already went through and ripped the
DVD alright so you see down here just
said finished processing mr. deeds and
now if we search for it there it is it's
got the cover art it's got the
background already and let's go ahead
and press play and you can now watch it
either in the browser or in any plex app
whether it's on your smartphone or your
ps4 or Xbox you'll now be able to access
it all right without the disc and it's
available for anyway really alright so
thanks for watching hopefully this
helped you out if you could leave a like
and maybe subscribe that'd be great and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
