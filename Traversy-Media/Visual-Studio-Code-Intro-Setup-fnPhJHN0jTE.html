while since I did a video aside from the
course release
I've been sick lately I had some kind of
viral infection with sore throat and
headaches and all that crap
but I wanted to do something that
doesn't require a lot of focus and
thinking and programming so I figured
I'd make kind of an intro video on
visual studio code which is just an
awesome text editor so I'll go over the
basics as well as some of my favorite
extensions settings and some of the
intellisense features we'll basically
set it up from scratch and this is
completely cross-platform so if you're
on Windows Mac or Linux you'll be
absolutely fine with it it's open source
it's created by Microsoft but again it's
completely cross-platform so if you want
to download it you can go to code Visual
Studio com I'm not gonna go through the
installation because it's very
self-explanatory just go through click
Next and you'll get it installed alright
so what I have here is just kind of a
it's not really a fresh install but I've
made it default with no plugins no
customized settings or anything like
that
so it should match that the the state of
your editor if you just installed it so
this is the welcome page just kind of
gives you some options to open a file or
a folder gives you some options over
here for your color theme and all that
but we're gonna go ahead and close the
welcome page up and we're gonna look at
the sidebar first so the the activity
bars they call it so this first icon is
your Explorer this is where you'll open
your project so all your folders and
files are in one place and there's
multiple ways to open folders of course
you have this button but I'll show you
some of the other ways in a few minutes
so this icon here is just a global
search so you can search things you can
replace you can include or exclude
certain files pretty self-explanatory
this next one is a version control icon
so this is where you can do all your get
once we have some files you'll see that
we'll be able to initialize a repository
we can push to a remote git repository
there's some really good integrated
version control with Visual Studio code
this next one is your debugger I'm not
going to go over this this is beyond the
scope of this tutorial but there's some
really nice debugging capabilities
especially for just a text editor
remember this isn't an IDE like Visual
Studio it's a text editor button has
some pretty powerful debugging features
and then this icon is your extensions so
they have some recommended extensions
that show up here you can also search
for them I'm gonna show you some of the
ones that I use later on and then down
here we have this cog icon and from here
we have some set we can go to our
settings which I'll show you in a second
keyboard shortcuts we can change the
themes check for updates we also have
the command palette so if we open that
up you get this command palette in the
middle of the screen and you could
pretty much do anything from here any
kind of command in this editor you can
find here simple commands whoops I can
actually open it with f1 as well so if I
wanted to open a file for instance if I
type file this is all your recent stuff
and then this is just everything that's
gonna match your search so file you can
see open recent refresh Explorer save
save all if we click open file it's just
gonna go ahead and let us open a file so
if you can't find what you're looking
what what you're looking to do just be
sure to check the command palette and
you'll probably find it there alright
for instance if for themes if you want
to change a theme you can go to
preferences themes and that'll show up
so it's really handy alright so what I
want to do now is take a look at some
settings so if we go to preferences file
preferences settings the way that they
do this is it's basically just one big
JSON file on the side here you just have
key value pairs you have the key which
is the option or the setting and then
the value of it and there's different
categories that you can choose from so
files window editor commonly used and
what you would do if you want to
customize any of these is take the key
value pair and put it over on this side
so this is your customized file so
you'll always have all your
customizations in one place rather than
having to remember that
toggle switches that you switched off
and on like in other editors so I
actually prefer this method of keeping
your settings so if we just put some
curly braces here one of the first
things that I always change is my editor
size and that's usually for you guys so
you can see what I'm doing by default
it's 14 but I'm gonna go ahead and paste
that key value pair in here and just
change it to 26 you want to remove the
last comma of the last setting and then
just ctrl or command s to save and it'll
kick in right away
alright so autosave is another popular
feature a lot of developers use I don't
use it but what that does is it'll
autosave and it'll save your files
automatically without you having to save
them if you want to change the delay you
can search okay so that's another thing
you can go in this bar and you can
search for settings so if I search
autosave you'll see down here are files
autosave delay it's set to one second by
default or a thousand milliseconds but
you can change that if you want okay so
another thing that I usually change is
my tab size so I'll go ahead and grab
that put a comma here paste that in and
I usually like to change this to two
because I think four makes it it's kind
of it makes your code go over to a
little bit too far so to kind of makes
it more a little more compact so that's
one thing I always change another thing
that I always change is word wrap so if
I just search for wrap right here you
can see by default it's off meaning that
my code will go off the page and I don't
like that especially for you guys I want
you guys to see all the code so I always
have to turn that on so I'll go ahead
and switch that on another thing I
usually change is my terminal font size
again so you guys can see it so we'll
say search for terminal and if we go
down here you'll see the default font
size is 14 so I'm gonna copy that paste
it in over here and I'm going to change
that to 26 all right and just remove
that trailing comma and I'll go ahead
and save that and that's all I'm gonna
do
for now and you guys can look through
the settings and kind of experiment if
you want alright so next thing let's go
ahead and open a project now I could hit
open folder and the project I want to
open is on my desktop it's this vanilla
Jas weather application that we created
in the new JavaScript course so we could
go ahead and open it that way
select folder or we could go ahead and
select the folder in our Explorer and
just go open with code and that'll open
it right inside the folder another thing
we could do is open it from the command
line or the terminal so if I go to my
get bash which is my terminal program I
use for Windows and just do code dot
that will open it in that folder as well
alright so a couple ways to open your
project so before we go ahead and look
at that code writing and efficiency and
all that and intellisense I want to take
a look at the terminal because that's
one of my favorite features of this
editor is the integrated terminal so if
we go to view and then integrated
terminal you'll see it pops up down here
we can also do control tilde that will
toggle it and we can make this bigger or
smaller if we want and by default if
you're on Windows as I am you're gonna
have PowerShell as the default type of
terminal all right now
I don't like PowerShell I don't like the
standard Windows command line I prefer
to use git bash if you want to use git
bash you can get it from git - SCM comm
it's also available for Mac but you
don't really need it with Mac because
there's a there's a pretty good standard
bash editor or terminal in Mac so are in
OSX so Windows not so much you'd
probably want something like this or you
could use the the new integrated Ubuntu
in certain versions of Windows 10 and up
but I haven't gotten into that yet I'm
perfectly content with git bash so
that's what I use now if you want to use
that down here instead of PowerShell
you'll have to add a setting so again
we're going to go to preferences
settings
and over here actually we'll just search
for terminal and we'll scroll down to
let's make this smaller and what we want
is do they pass it all right all right
here terminal integrated shell windows
and you'll see it points to PowerShell
dot exe so what we want to do is copy
this key value pair and go ahead and put
a comma here and paste it in and then we
want to change this to the location of
git bash which the default is going to
be not in the windows folder but in
Program Files and we're gonna do - - get
- - bin not - / / and then bash dot exe
ok so that should be right so let's save
this and then let's go ahead and close
this up now if I close my editor and
open it back up it's still PowerShell
what we need to do is add a new terminal
because we can have multiple terminals
you'll see it says one powershell we
only have one terminal open which is
powershell but if i click the + the next
one i open is going to be bash by
default because of that setting so we
can have as many as we want I could put
another one so now you have three
different terminals open now the
powershell one i'm gonna select them i'm
gonna hit the delete and that's gonna
get rid of it so now we just have to
bash terminals alright if i were to list
the contents of the folder here in this
one and then switch to this terminal
you'll see it's not there because this
is completely different it's a
completely different environment so what
this is great for is if you're doing
like angular development or react where
you have the CLI and you have a dev
server and you need to run that server
and that takes up your terminal so you
can't use it so what you would do is run
that for instance ng you'd run like ng
serve or or whatever it may be npm star
it's a no js' app and then just switch
to another terminal to do your all your
other stuff to create your components or
whatever it is that that you plan on
doing all right and of course you can
just do standard commands you can create
files so if I say touch file dot J s
you'll see that that creates a full file
up here file J s if I want to remove it
I can use the RM command and just say RM
file J s and that removes it and I do
have a video on basic command line if
you want to check that out all right so
enough on the terminal let's go ahead
and close that up and now what I want to
do is open up one of these files will
open up the app dot J S which is just
just vanilla JavaScript and I want to
just take a look at some of the
intellisense features now when we talk
about intellisense we're talking about
features like code completion parameter
info dropdowns quick info stuff like
that stuff that makes sure your coding
more efficient so for example this line
here we have the document object and
we're calling the add eventlistener
method passing in an event to listen on
and then the function to run when that
event runs so let's go ahead and rewrite
this line now as soon as I start typing
we're gonna get this drop down and
document is actually one of those
options okay because it by default vs
code the intellisense works with
JavaScript okay it works with JavaScript
typescript jason HTML CSS sass and less
and I think that's it by default so
anything else Python PHP just have to
install the extension to get the
intellisense which is very very simple
just go to extensions and search for it
so again let's go back and let's do a
dot and we'll see all the options
available with document dot so we want
add eventlistener
and then we'll go ahead and we'll put in
the event we want to listen on which is
Dom content loaded and we'll put a comma
here now this tells us the parameter
type a parameter info
for add eventlistener it's telling us it
takes in two type and it takes in it's a
string okay so it even gives you the
data type so what I'm gonna put here is
the get weather function so if I start
to type get W you'll see get weather
pops up because that's a function down
below so I'll go ahead and put that in
now another cool thing that this
intellisense does is camelcase hinting
so let's say I just do G and then
capital W and you'll see get weather
will show up so it'll match whatever the
case so if I were to let's see if I were
to have a function here called go while
like that and I were to go and type in
lowercase G uppercase W you'll see go
while will pop up along with get weather
so I think that's a really cool feature
of the intellisense okay so let me just
get rid of that line now as far as your
functions like let's say we have this we
have this get weather that it's calling
if we want to know where this function
is and look at the contents of it we can
right click and we can say go to
definition and that will bring us down
to the get weather function now if you
don't want your at your actual spot or
your cursor to move you can just go peak
definition and it'll give you this
pop-up with the function and you can
actually edit it here as well okay so
you could go ahead and you can edit that
function from this pop-up and save it
alright which is very handy okay another
thing you could do is you could do
right-click and you could say change all
occurrences and it'll choose all the get
weathers and let's say you wanted to
change it to I don't know get status and
you'll see down here it's also changing
here and here anywhere where it says get
weather okay which can be handy as well
now as far as keyboard shortcuts go a
lot of them are standard to pretty much
all text editors but there are some that
stand out with vs code so obviously if
you want to go to the beginning of a
line then you could click I'm going to
put my cursor right
here so if I click the home key that'll
bring me to the beginning of the line if
I hit the end key that'll go to the end
if I want to go to the the first line of
the file I could do control home if I
want to go to the end I could do control
end and that brings me down there
alright so we can move our cursor where
we want and if we want to do things like
let's say copy align so right here you
can see where my cursor is I'm gonna
just do ctrl C and then go down below it
or go anywhere let's go right here and
I'll hit control V and that will paste
it in alright and obviously control Z is
gonna undo it if I want to cut it I
could go to that line and I could do
control X it'll cut it out I could go
down here and paste it in just like that
if I want to copy a line down for
instance I could do I could go to the
beginning here with the HOME key and I
could do shift alt down and that will
copy it down okay we can copy them up as
well so if I wanted to move it down not
just copy it then I could just do alt
down or alt up and I can just move the
line around okay so if I wanted to add a
comment here I could do ctrl forward
slash and that would comment out the
line I can just toggle it again with
control forward slash now if I wanted to
comment out a block of code like let's
say this entire event listener with this
function then I could just highlight it
and do control forward slash and I can
toggle that as well all right now I'm
not gonna go over all of the shortcuts
because there's just a ton of them if
you want to change any of them you can
go to your preferences keyboard
shortcuts and you can see all the
different shortcuts here and you can
click on edit and you can change it to
whatever combination you want alright so
the next thing I want to talk about real
quick is Emmet now Emmet is really good
for HTML and CSS it allows you to use
abbreviations that allow you to write
your markup much quicker now I'm not
gonna spend a lot of time on this I
actually have a full video on Emmet it's
like a 40-minute minute video but I'm
gonna go to my HTML file and just get
rid of this for a second
and if I wanted to have like let's say
an h1 I could do h1 tab and that will
give me a beginning and ending tag if I
wanted to have a class on that h1 I
could do H 1 dot for class and then test
and that gives me a class of test if I
wanted it to be an idea I could do hash
test tab and it gives us the idea of
test okay
tab is the hot key by default but again
you can go into your keyboard commands
which I just showed you and you can look
for the the the hotkey for Emmet and
change it if you want now if we want
just a div we don't even have to specify
an element we can just say hash test or
whatever and it gives us a div with the
ID of test we could do the same for
class if I wanted the class of foo tab
and it gives us a class of foo and then
if I'd want to do let's say 3 or let's
say 4 Li tags I could do Li times for
tab and it gives us 4 of them okay and
that can also do an HTML boilerplate if
I do exclamation tab and it gives us the
doctype the HTML and head and body tags
which is really efficient so we have to
type all this stuff out every time
alright but that's about as far as into
eminence I'm gonna go like I said do
have a full video on Emmet so let me
just put my file back and save of what
actually one thing I want to mention
about Emmet is if you want to use it in
certain let's say template engines like
edge for instance which is a template
engine that is Emmet doesn't work in by
default what you would need to do is go
to your settings so preferences settings
which you can also get to with control
comma okay so you can get to it that way
as well and then just search for Emmet
and there's a crapload of options for
Emmet the one we want is included
languages so right here
Emmet included languages so I would take
this put it over here and if I wanted to
use it with edge templating I could just
put in edge and say that we want this
basically rendered as a
HTML and that would you and now M it
would then be allowed to use you could
use it with edge okay so I'll just keep
that there and I believe you need to do
the same with things like JSX for react
and other template engines as well okay
so now I'll show you how to change the
theme so if we go to this settings to
this icon down here we can go to color
theme and you have all these different
themes you can choose from abyss which I
really don't like if we go to let's say
Manik I this is actually a really
popular one this makes it looks like
look like sublime text default theme
which a lot of people like and another
way I can get here is with is through
the command palette if I click f1 and
just type in theme you'll see
preferences color theme and that brings
you to this as well let's see red I
don't know who would use that but I just
like the default theme I don't know
maybe I'm just I'm just a simple guy but
I prefer the default dark + theme which
is this here alright and if you want to
install custom themes you can just go
back there and go to the bottom and say
install additional color themes and then
you have all these themes on the side
here and you can install those just as
if you were to install an extension
alright so that brings us to extension
so let's click on this icon here let's
actually clear this up and we can search
for extensions here so the first one I'm
going to install is an extension called
brackets pair colorizer and as you can
see as you type it does kind of a smart
search and it's this one right here
bracket pair colorizer and what this
does is it adds colors to your brighter
to bracket pairs so that you don't get
confused with for instance nested if
statements when you have a bunch of
stuff nested into each other and you
have all these different break curly
braces or brackets or parentheses and it
gives them color pairs
alright this extension was introduced to
me
by Dylan from code 360 coding tutorials
360 which is a great channel and you
should check out as well so let's go
ahead and install this and once you
install an extension you just want to
click reload excuse me sorry if my voice
is a little raspy guys now if we look at
let's say the get weather function right
here so you can see the the curly braces
are yellow inside here we're calling a
get weather method from the weather
object and inside there we have we're
getting a promise so we're using then
but these curly braces are blue okay
these curly braces are blue because
they're inside of these ones now if we
were to have some kind of if statement
in here with another set of curly braces
those are yellow okay if we put another
one in here those are purple do another
one those are blue so it's gonna rotate
between these colors which makes things
much less confusing when you have a lot
of nested blocks okay so that's one of
the extensions that I use quite a bit
another one is live server and I'm sure
if you guys have watched a lot of my
videos you probably know about this one
it basically gives you a development
server and it gives you auto load
functionality and you can use it with
just a single HTML file okay so this is
great for like vanilla JavaScript
applications where you're not using
nodejs or angular or is anything with a
dev server or web pack or something like
that and you can you want to open it up
in a development server it just gives
you a better environment to work with
okay and of course you get the auto load
so let's go ahead and install this
all right so it's installed I'm gonna
click reload and then what I'm gonna do
is you want to go to your HTML file and
then this is where you want to start
your server from now there's two ways to
do it you can go down here and you see
you'll have this go live link or you can
right-click in the file and you can say
open with live server and then it's
gonna open on your loopback address your
local host on port 5500 by default and
you can see we have our application so
this is like I said this is an
application that uses a weather API this
is in the JavaScript course that I just
created
we could change the location if we want
and that'll get saved to local storage
so if I reload it's still there but
either way and no matter what it is even
if it's just a static HTML website with
no JavaScript it's still a nice little
environment to work in
and again it's auto load so I'll show
you if I snap this over here and let's
see all this stuff the weather info is
generated in JavaScript so I need to
find something I can change here let's
just take the that's the modal let's
take the change location text right here
which is this button and we'll just
change it to test and just save and
you'll see automatically at Auto loads
and changes okay so that's really
powerful instead of having to keep and
keep reloading it every time now to stop
the server you can go down here and we
see where it says port 5500 you can
click that or you can right click and
actually I guess you can't right click
so you just click the port 5500 that
stops the server and if I try to reload
this page it doesn't work okay so if you
don't want to use a server like that and
you just want an easy way to open your
your HTML files another extension that
I'd recommend is open in browser so
let's see right here open open in
browser let's install that
okay so now we have the index.html file
here and I'm just gonna right click and
I'm gonna say open in default browser
and you'll see that opens I don't think
it has auto load let me just check say
yeah yeah so it doesn't have auto load
so if I save I actually have to reload
so I don't use this too much because I I
do use live server so there's really no
reason for me to use this but it is an
option all right another another
extension that I like is vs code icons
which gives you some nice-looking icons
for each file type so let's go ahead and
install this and we'll click reload and
now if we go to our file manager here
actually we have to activate it we will
get this little drop down will slightly
activate and now you'll get these little
icons so you can see for HTML files I
have this html5 logo and then we have
these little j/s so when you start to
use other other file types like PHP or
dot pi files you'll have those icons as
well so it's just it's not really used
for like you know efficiency and or
anything like that but it's just cool
it's just nice to look at I guess and I
guess it makes you realize what type of
file it is quicker
okay another extension that I like is
faker so this is actually from faker j/s
it's called vs code faker and what this
does is it allows you to generate fake
addresses credit card numbers finance
info all kinds of stuff for your just
basically test data so let's go ahead
and click reload and now let's say let's
go down here and we'll just have a div
and let's say we wanted to put a name in
here so what I could do is go to the
command palette and type in faker and I
could choose something from here
let's see so I'll choose faker name and
you can choose from first name last name
all this other stuff title job stuff I'm
gonna choose first name and it gives us
Luverne okay so it's just a way to
create fake data on the fly I guess a
name isn't really I mean you could just
think of a name in a second but you can
do like addresses and credit card
numbers and phone numbers things like
that now those are really the the
general extensions that I use all the
other extensions I use pertain to a
certain language or framework for
instance I use PHP intellisense so this
has intellisense and advanced
auto-completion for PHP so that I would
definitely recommend if you're doing any
kind of PHP development with Visual
Studio code so go ahead and reload that
another one that I use is angular
angular version 5 snippets which is C
this one here by John Papa so I usually
use that and that will just give you
code highlighting code hinting
everything you need for angular and it
says version 5 but it'll also work for
angular 4 and angular 2 alright for a
vanilla JavaScript I would recommend the
es6 snippets so this right here
javascript es6 code snippets I
definitely recommend that if you're
working with you know promises and and
anything to do with es6 plus alright and
trying to think for react let's see what
do I use for react so you have react
native tools you have I think this is
yeah this is the one that I usually use
react native react and redux snippets
for es6 and es7 so i would definitely
recommend that for react alright and
then also view JSC view uh yeah view
view to snippets so that's what I would
suggest for view
and then for Python for Python and I'd
suggest just this top one here that's
4.8 million downloads and this gives you
everything you need for Python alright
so those are the extensions that I use
now I want you guys to make any
recommendations that that you feel
others could benefit from so extensions
that you guys use that has really major
your your coding and your development
more efficient more quick easier because
like I said I'm not a huge tooling
person and a lot of that comes from what
I do I make tutorials and I don't want I
don't want my editor to look like
something that doesn't match anybody
else's so that beginners get confused
and and they're there we're both using
vyas code but they're asking me what
editor I'm using I've had that happen
before so that's you know that's one of
the reasons I'm very simplistic with
this stuff now I know I mentioned that I
get into version control so I'm just
gonna do the very basics here just
create a neutralizer repository and push
it to github so I'm gonna do the very
very basics here and just create a
repository so this is my github account
and I'll just click the plus sign new
repository and we'll call this weather
j/s and it'll say simple weather app
using the W Underground API and create
repository okay so now usually what we
do is just type this stuff in the
command line but we have integrated
functionality that we can use here if we
just click on the version control and
let's click this icon here to initialize
it as a repository so we'll click
initialize repository and what that does
is it creates a dot get fought our dot
git folder excuse me
so as you can see all the files now have
this u next to them which means unstaged
our untracked so what we want to do is
click up here
and go to stage all changes and that
adds them to the staging area you can
see index added then what we want to do
is when we're sure we want to go ahead
and commit all it'll ask us for a commit
message so we'll just say initial say
initial commit and enter and now we have
no changes here okay now if I go and
change something like let's say just out
of comma here comma a comment we'll just
say test and save then that gets put
into the unstaged changes or actually
this is modified so what we want to do
is add that and you can actually see the
difference between your new change and
the old file that's in the repository so
let's go ahead and say let's do commit
all actually should probably just stage
it first so we'll do stage all changes
okay and then we'll go commit staged
commit message will say added comment ok
so now we have no more changes here and
I'm just gonna close that up now this is
all local okay this is all in our local
repository if you want to push the
github
then you need to add this as a remote
repository so this right here so I'm
gonna grab that and just open the
terminal and paste that in alright so
now that's added as a remote repository
so let's go ahead and go up here and say
push - and we have that option as our
repository so we'll choose that and that
should be pushing it to the master
branch now if I reload you can see all
of our files are here if I look at
index.html we have that test comment
there so if I want to change something
like let's say
we'll change tests to hello
if we save that okay now this is uh this
is modified we want to stage this so
let's say stage changes we can do it
from here or up here and then let's go
up here and say commit staged will say
changed comment and then we'll push it
so we'll go push has the master branch
okay so we want to push to here and that
should do it
so if we look at our index and you can
see now the comment says hello all right
so this is just the core basics of how
this works another thing we could do is
we can have a dot git ignore file and
the purpose of this file is for for
things that you don't want to include in
your git repository so let's say we have
let's do test dot txt and we don't want
that to to to be to go to the git
repository so what I'll do is let's go
to the version control you can see it's
unstaged or untracked but I'm going to
add this to the git ignore so if we go
ahead and do that
you can see our get ignore file now has
text test.txt so now if we make another
change let's change it to hello one and
save and then let's go ahead and stage
so we'll say stage all changes and then
we'll say commit all and we'll put a
commit message I'll just say another
change and enter
and then let's push to github go over
here if I reload our index page now it's
hello one is the comment and if we go
back to the repository whoops you can
see that there is no test dot txt
because that's in our git ignore file
okay and we can see all the commits that
we've made right here so we've made four
commits so initial added comment change
comment and another change so as I said
I'm I don't use this too much I mean I
do use it but I use the standard
commands much more so maybe this is
something I should get into a little
more maybe it's more efficient what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna link a another
video from one of my mods on my discord
server Simon also goes by Cookie Monster
on the server and he made a video on vs
code and he goes more in depth into get
into branches and so on along with some
other stuff so it's a new channel he's
just getting started so show him some
love go over there watch that video if
you're interested and that's it guys
thanks for watching and I will see you
