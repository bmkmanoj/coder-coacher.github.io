web solutions this is an installment to
my my ten part Joomla beginners video
series I'm just going to be explaining
the basics of Joomla if you're fluent in
doing more than you probably don't need
this this is for the beginners what I'm
gonna do in this particular video is I'm
gonna create a article or new page and
also link it to a menu so it can be
reached through the home page this is a
default fresh Joomla installation this
is all the sample content you can choose
to install the sample content or just
empty website so this is just a sample
content that comes with the Joomla
installation in the default template as
well so we're gonna go to the admin area
if you're new to Juma you want to type
in whatever your site is comm slash
administrator you can see I'm working on
my local host here this is an actual
website that's live so you just want to
you should have to find the password
when you install Joomla either if you
installed it either through Fantastico
FTP so I'm just going to log in here and
here we have the administrator interface
also called the backend and what we want
to do we're going to create the article
in article manager but what I want to do
is create a section and a category to
put that article in and you do that you
go to content and go to section manager
sections of the top of the hierarchy
sections then a category to that section
and then you can choose the article for
that category and as you can see there's
some sample ones here but we're gonna
create a new one so just go to new new
and you just want to give it a name what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a
frequently asked question
section so I'll just put FAQ save so we
have the FAQ actually there already is
an FAQ we'll ignore that so now what
you've done was a section FAQ now you
want to create a category and click no
and we'll just say web design say that
this is these frequently asked questions
of our website and down here you'll see
the section right now the default is
about Joomla we don't want that section
we want the FAQ that we created click
Save and you don't need to have sections
and categories you can leave the
articles on categorized if you have a
lot of content it's a good idea to to
give it a section category so now what
we want to do is go to content article
manager here you'll see all the sample
articles that comes with default joomla
installation so we want to click new and
we want to give it a name we'll say web
design FAQ FAQ alias you can leave that
blank this can pertain to the the URL if
we just leave this blank it'll be
something like all lowercase web design
FAQ I just typed this in but that this
is what would come even if we left this
blank it mimics the title just all
lowercase and no spaces so now we want
to choose this section we want to choose
FAQ which is the section we created and
there's only one category and FAQ so it
defaults to that to the web design
category here we'll just this is FAQ
page for web design and obviously you
would fill this up so that's it if you
want it on the home page you can click
yes to front page but we're not going to
do that
and make sure published yes and click
Save all right so now we have our page
created but if you go to the front end
it's it's no way to be found we have to
link it to a menu you can link it to the
main menu are maybe one of these side
menus I'm just I'm going to link it to
the top menu so what you want to do now
is go to menus and click on you know you
see all the menus available on the site
we're going to click main menu and now
what you want to do is click new and
click articles and click article layout
now what you want to do is give it a
name we'll just say link design FAQ once
again the alias if you leave a blank
it'll make up it'll make one up voyage
in here you want to leave this as is if
you want it to be a sub item of main
menu item you could do that here
you can also set the access to
registered or special admin users you
can also choose if you want the page to
be opened in a new window with browser
navigation or new window without it
we're just going to leave it on parent
window with browser navigation now over
here you want to you want to choose the
article so click select you'll get a
list of all the all the articles on site
so we're going to find eyes or just web
design fa Q's just click that so we
should be all set here so we click Save
and you'll see down here it's at the
bottom with web design FAQ you can also
change this position over here in their
order but we'll just leave it last on
the list so now let's go to our home
page and refresh oh they may oh I made a
mistake the main menu is over here on
the side I thought it this but you'll
see web design FAQ right here
and what I'm gonna created on the top
two so this is the top menu idea this is
the top menus
once again click new articles annika
layout web design faq select the article
yeah save alright so now we'll go on the
front page reload and there it is web
design faq click on it and we didn't put
very much content in it but here it is I
want to show you one more thing you can
see that here it's it has the page name
and then under it says written by
administrator and then it has the date
now this is if this is going to be an
about Us page or FAQ page you don't want
this this is more for our blog and new
style articles so we're going to do is
go into back to the article manager and
what I do is make the default hide hide
the date and they the written by line
hide that by default so you want to
click on parameters over here and you
wanna click hide for author name create
create a date name I mean to create a
date time and modified date time you
want to put all that to hide and I also
like to hide the icons the PDF icons the
email icon so I choose hide for all
these every every joomla installation i
do i hide all the icons the dates so now
if we go back and reload the page that's
gone so now it's just a title and then
the description that's it for now and i
hope you stick around for the rest of
the series next i'll be talking about
SEO so that's it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
