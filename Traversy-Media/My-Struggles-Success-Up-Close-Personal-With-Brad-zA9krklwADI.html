just hit 300,000 subscribers which is
friggin amazing to me and I just wanted
to make a video doing a couple things so
first of all I wanted to thank each and
every one of you everyone that is
subscribed everyone that watches my
videos that likes them that shares them
of course my patrons I'm eternally
grateful for you guys you guys you know
don't even have to offer any kind of
financial support but you do anyways
just because you love my content to
people that buy my courses and allow me
to feed my family I really thank you
guys
genuinely genuinely from the bottom of
my heart and I know that a lot of times
I say that and people just say you know
we should be thanking you for the free
content and the free education but it's
really a two-way street I couldn't do
this without you guys wanting to watch
it otherwise it would just be just a
youtube channel with no views or a
course with no purchases so I really
thank you guys now 300,000 subscribers
it's a big deal to me I wanted to do
something a little different and just
kind of give you a little background on
myself and kind of introduce myself even
though I've done you know I've talked
about my past and stuff a little bit in
other videos but my past isn't one that
is common for you know most web
developers or programmers or anybody in
technology or even anybody that's
successful and the reason I like to
share this stuff is because I know a lot
of you guys have issues of your own it
may not be the same issues that I went
through but you might be at a place
where you feel hopeless and you feel
like you'll never get to where you want
to be whether it's because of an
addiction whether it's because of mental
issues like depression or anxiety
whether it's a financial situation or
where you live something like that and
you can overcome anything you just need
to have that perseverance that passion
and just keep pushing yourself alright
so I'm going to talk a little bit about
myself and I really
I don't like to talk about myself but I
think that it can be beneficial and it
has been in the past and I know I might
catch some judgment from some people but
honestly if you're someone that can't
appreciate that someone had some tough
times and turned their life around
completely then that's not really
someone I want subscribe to my channel
anyways so that's that's fine but
basically you know I grew up north of
Boston Massachusetts a lot of you guys
know that you can just tell by my accent
and my hats and stuff and I've only been
on in New England one time so I'm not
someone that has travelled the world
that's done anything like that
and I didn't grow up with money you know
we weren't dirt poor I would say but you
know I didn't have money I didn't have I
didn't go to Disney World when I was a
kid we couldn't afford it I couldn't
even play hockey which I really wanted
to do when I was a kid because we
couldn't afford it so I we did struggle
now my my mother was a hard worker you
know she was a nursing assistant and she
busted her ass to put food on the table
my dad was an alcoholic and a drug
addict he was a heroin addict he
actually passed away about two years ago
from an overdose just never never
changed never learned his lesson
and you know I can understand where he's
coming from and you know you'll know why
in a few minutes but basically you know
I I grew up very shy kid social anxiety
which I still have to this day and it
kind of pushed me towards you know as I
got older as I was you know 13 14 15
pushed me towards alcohol and in smoking
weed and doing that kind of stuff
because it really helped me break out of
my shell and actually make friends and
hang out with people unfortunately it
was it was kind of the wrong people and
I don't want to say the wrong people
because that my friends growing up god
they would have taken a bat to someone's
head for me it's not it's just that it
wasn't the most healthiest you know the
healthiest people to grow up around but
basically you know I did that for a
while until I was about 17
and a lot of the kids that I grew up
with kids in my neighborhood we're
getting into like really hard drugs
opiate based drugs I'm not going to go
into which ones but opiates are you know
percocet oxycontin heroin methadone
drugs like that and it took me a while
to actually come around and try it even
though my friends were doing it but I
eventually did and it just it just was
downhill from there so I I had an issue
with opiates for years I would say from
about 17 years old to to about 24 that
part of my life was just hell it was
hell
it was just addiction it was just
needing to get get the drug because I
would be sick if I didn't have it so I
just was struggling to just be normal
everyday and then I ended up you know in
jail a couple times and I know I'm gonna
catch some judgment for that but I
really I really don't care because you
know I made some mistakes but I overcame
all of them and completely changed my
life so I'm okay with sitting here now
and telling you guys this and again I
share this because I know you guys a lot
of you have struggles in life if you're
someone that where everything was handed
to you through your whole life and you
know your mummy and daddy paid for you
to go to college and you had no issues
at all you probably can't relate to this
type of story I don't mean to be
disrespectful in that way but if you're
someone like that that is judgmental
towards people like me then you know
fuck off but anyways you know when I
when I hit around 24 I had my my first
kid I have two kids I had my daughter
she's 11 now about 25 I might have been
and that just kind of kicked my ass into
gear you know I had to know I had a
person now depending on me so I couldn't
mess around anymore I had to become a
man basically when I when I had my first
kid is when I became a man in my eyes so
what I did was I always had a knack for
technology I never did
anything with it but I always had a
knack for it I I liked computers I liked
I could actually you know put one
together and so on so I got into that
and I went to was I went to Community
College for a little bit didn't really
learn much they a lot of old technology
a lot of theory based stuff
nothing really practical and that's one
of the reasons why I kind of talk a
little bit of shit about college but
it's just from my own experience but it
did it did get me to kind of start doing
research on my own and self teaching
myself programming web development
things like that and I got to a point
where I was comfortable to start my own
business and I probably wasn't ready but
it ended up working out I did a lot of
WordPress I did Joomla which is another
content management system PHP based and
I ended up doing pretty well because I
put my all into it when I hat when I got
a client I put my all into it and they
saw that and they appreciated it so they
would recommend me to friends even
though I wasn't the best you know
developer in the world but you know I
did good for a while I had a company
called tech guy web solutions our tech
guy Computer Services was the official
name but we did both computer repair and
web web development stuff and I did
pretty good I had an office space and I
was doing really well I also started a
YouTube channel just to kind of promote
my business I guess and just you know
just for the hell of it and I was
inspired by channels like the New Boston
PHP academy' which now I think is code
course or something like that but there
was some channels back then that
inspired me to start making tutorials
and eventually I was approached by a
company called edge wanax I was a brand
new company back then and they wanted me
to do a course in html5 I believe it was
html5 and it ended up doing really well
their students liked it and they asked
me to do another one and then another
one and and I did this for years making
courses for this company which was
really
to me they're a great company they're
still selling courses I don't I haven't
done courses for them for a while but
you know check them out they have some
some really good courses but eventually
I decided to break off from that because
I wanted to do my own thing I had a big
following on a decent following on
YouTube so I decided to create
traversing media and stopped the
basically stopped my my other company my
actual client company where I was doing
work for clients and just focus on
education because that Juwanna kind of
like a part-time thing but I did that
and I recently incorporated travesti
media so I'm an S Corp now I pay myself
a salary from the business and I'm just
doing really well and it's and I have
you guys to thank for that
you know I honestly I couldn't think of
anything that I'd rather do for work
than what I do now you know I'm able to
work from my home I'm able to make a
pretty good amount of money between
courses and between YouTube and stuff
like that and of course my patrons help
me out you know but it's just it's been
it's been a hell of a ride and my life
has been very very diverse and you know
I wasn't growing up like I said I kind
of hung out with the wrong crowd I
didn't I didn't have like nerdy friends
that I could talk about technology with
which I kind of wish I did I like now
that you know we have called comments in
the Internet where I can interact and
talk about this stuff but I don't have
anyone still don't have anyone of my
life that I can really talk to about my
passion most of my friends that I grew
up with our either I'm sad to say dead
but from from drug overdoses or in jail
or just are like me and completely just
withdraw from you know withdrew from
that whole our whole circle of friends
or whatever you know my best friend my
best friend died of a drug overdose
about four years ago my dad so it's
and other members of my family it's just
been addiction is a is a just a fucked
up thing man it really is and any of you
guys that struggle with it whether it's
drugs whether its food or whatever
anything alcohol gaming addiction sucks
it really does but there are healthy
addictions I consider myself addicted to
coding I love it I wake up and I and I
just jump on and get into it and I love
it it can have some negative effects
because it can take away time from your
family and so on but yeah so I'm kind of
losing losing my train of thought a lot
of my videos I do are scripted and I
know exactly what I'm doing what I'm
gonna say what I'm gonna write for code
it's this is this is kind of new where
I'm just talking off the top of my head
so and that's one of the reasons I don't
livestream a lot of people say you
should live stream but I get my mind
goes blank and I had just feel like I
don't want to look like an idiot so I I
haven't gotten into it yet but it is
something I'd like to get into as far as
now you know of course my career
everything like that is good I do have a
lot of struggles though you know I've
told you guys before I have a son that's
autistic he also has a chromosome issue
so he he he can't talk he's still in
diapers he's very very small if you saw
I mean think he was about five or so but
he's eight so he has a lot of issues and
it's very very stressful for me and my
wife and you know his sister and just
our whole family but he's an awesome kid
he's just he's always happy I admire him
for his his positivity even though he
can't even tell us if his stomach hurts
or if he has a headache he can't tell us
that stuff which must just must suck but
he still I would say that the most
positive and happiest person in our
house so he's actually an inspiration to
me and and hopefully you guys can can
meet him someday maybe I can bring him
on video for a little bit because he's
just an awesome kid and you know I'm
blessed to have them and
my daughter is 11 she's going through
that 11 year old phase and she's an
awesome kid as well you know she she's
she's just she's funny as hell and I
just love my kids man that that they
keep me going they keep they keep
pushing me to do this and to stay
positive and never look back at what
I've done in my past and go back to you
know that crap but yeah I think that's
that's pretty much it I just wanted to
kind of thank you guys
genuinely I didn't want to do it in a
slideshow I know I do a lot of slides
and stuff I don't normally do this but I
wanted to you know face to face to
camera just thank you guys for being
there and you've helped me not just
financially but also emotionally and
giving me confidence seeing people just
say that the nice things they say to me
just really helps me out
and you know I've talked about impostor
syndrome before I mean if you look at me
I don't know if you can see but I'm
covered in tattoos I don't look like
your average programmer and it's caused
me to like be uncomfortable around other
programmers but you guys give me a lot
of self self confidence and self esteem
so I appreciate that and I also wanted
to give you a little bit of background
even though some fuckers might judge me
that's fine they can leave I'm okay with
that there's there's enough of you know
998 percent of you guys are just awesome
from from what I've seen and then the
interaction and stuff like that but
that's gonna be it guys thank you so
much and hopefully you'll continue to
grow with me as a program or as a person
you know once in a while I like to do
the self help kind of videos because
it's not all you know it's not all
friggin curly braces and in parentheses
we're people and we get you know
feelings and stuff about our jobs about
where we're at in life and that should
be addressed you know just as well as
writing code so that's it and thanks for
watching thank and
if you want please follow me on social
media if you want a more personal look
into my life follow me on Instagram some
other things I wanted to mention we have
a discord server as well right now it's
called the developer hangout but we're
kind of we're in the process of kind of
tweaking it and you can come in and if
you have an issue with code then you
know there's different chat rooms
basically where you can get help for
different languages and frameworks and
so on so look into that as well but
thanks for watching and that's it and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
