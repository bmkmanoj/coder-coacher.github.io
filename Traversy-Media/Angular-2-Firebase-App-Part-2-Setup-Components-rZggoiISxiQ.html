started on our property listings angular
to firebase website or application first
thing we're going to do is set up
firebase so you're going to want to go
to firebase google.com and from here you
if you want to look around the
documentation you can do that but you're
going to want to go to your console and
I want to click on go to console and
that's going to automatically log me in
and you can see I have this the dev
database or project here from from the
demo I showed you but we're going to
create a new project okay so let's go
ahead and click that and we're going to
call this I'm just going to call it prop
listings okay click create project and
then you'll see an interface like this
and you have three areas here add
firebase to your iOS app to Android and
to web okay now if we click this right
here it's going to open up a pop-up like
this and it's going to give you all of
your apps information your API key your
are off domain database URL things like
that and we're going to need this later
on okay we're not going to need it just
yet and then over here you have your
authentication okay so this is where all
your users would show up you have your
databases where you create databases
with collections and your storage and
this is where we'll actually be storing
the listing images now if we click on a
rules I'm sorry I want to go to database
and then click on rules and you'll see
the read and write are set to this off
not equal to null what this means is
that in order to read and write to your
databases the user has to be
authenticated now you can change this if
you want to if you don't want them to
have to authenticate you could simply
set these to true but we do want
authentication so I'm going to leave it
all right now what I want to do is go to
authentication and then sign-in method
and we're just going we're going to
enable Google okay so we just want to
click this little switch here and then
click Save so now we can write code to
Annie to allow people to
Seneca using their Google account all
right and we may get to some of these
other ones later on but for now I just
can use that and then let's go to
database and then we want to create a
listings database or listings collection
so right here we're just going to say
listings and click go okay and that's it
we now have a listings collection now
we're going to need some initial data to
work with
so I have in the description a link of
adjacent file that you can import it has
a couple listings so go ahead and
download that and then we're going to
just say import JSON and we'll find it
it's in my downloads right here I'll say
import and now we have some listings
okay you can see we have the bedroom
city image owner another path i just set
to image mansion this might change when
we actually use the firebase storage but
for now we'll just put the images local
okay so now you have some listings to
work with we should be all set with
firebase at least for now now we can go
and create our angular app now I'm going
to go into my projects folder and from
here we're going to run ng actually if
you don't have any your CLI installed
then you need to install that so if you
want to do NPM install - JEE angular CLI
okay I already have it installed so I'm
not going to run that but that will
install it globally so that you can use
the ng commands from wherever alright so
once you have that installed we're going
to do ng new and then the name of your
application so I'm just going to call
this crop listings all right so let's
run that and that should create a prop
listings folder for us
now looks while that's going on let's
open up the angularfire to documentation
looks at all like that okay we need to
install this as well if we go down here
so when you can stall firebase and
angular fire - and we need to bring that
in here now in this example they're
using it right in the component what we
want to do is create a service and use
it from there okay it's a much neater
way to do it than to just do this right
here but basically we're bringing it in
there including it right here as a
dependency so we can use AF down here
and we can just call AF database dot
list and then we would have listings or
whatever collection you want to use okay
and then we get those back and then we
can loop through them with ng4 and then
output the listings alright now it's not
going to work right away for us because
we have authentication enabled so we
have to handle that as well before we
can actually see the data that comes
back all right and if that sounds
difficult don't worry about it not it's
not too bad all right so let's CD into
crop listings and then we're going to
install dependencies so let's do NPM
install we need firebase angularfire -
and let's see we also want angular 2 -
flash - messages and I think that's it
for dependencies yeah that should be at
9 let's just add - - save so that it
puts it into our package dot JSON file
all right so now that's all set we can
go ahead and run us our dev server with
ng serve and that should open it up on
port 4200 I'm going to open up in a tab
here and we'll go to localhost 4200 and
we get app works okay let's open up the
chrome console as well hit f12 and then
the next thing I want to do is create
our components okay so I'm going to open
up my text editor which I'm using Adam
of course you can use whatever you'd
like okay so we're going to go ahead and
open up that folder the project and see
projects prop listings alright and I'm
going to get rid of all this other stuff
that I have open
okay so we don't want these
all right so here's our propolis thing
now we have our source folder here with
the app folder that's where all of our
components and services are and go
that's where most of our work is I'm not
going to go over the basics of angular 2
if you guys really don't understand how
components work and things like that
I would definitely suggest stopping and
going to the angular 2 and 60-minutes
the course that I have on YouTube and
really getting to know how angular works
because I'm not going to be able to
explain every little thing alright but
what we want to do is you want to create
some components so I'm going to create a
new folder called components and then we
can use the angular CLI to do that so
I'm going to leave the server running
here and then go down to this terminal
and let's go into with projects and then
into propped listings and then from here
we want to go into the source folder and
then app and then the components folder
that we just create and now to create a
component we can do ng g4 generate
component and then whatever we want to
call it so let's create the home
component ok so let's take a look at
what that did if we look in components
there's now a folder called home and we
have a component PS file that's the main
typescript file then we have the HTML
file which is the template it also gives
us a CSS file and then a spec file for
testing okay so the created all that for
us and then if we look in the app dot
module TS it also inserted it right here
it's importing it and then it added it
in the declarations ok so if you weren't
using angular CLI then you would just
have to create that stuff yourself ok so
any of CLI really does save a lot of
time okay so let's generate some more
components so I'm going to just hit the
up key and we're going to do ng G
component
and let's do listings okay so that will
basically just be the list of the list
of listing and then let's do generate
component now box because you want to
have a navbar let's do generate
component let's see listing and this is
going to be for the single listing let's
do what else add let's excuse an ADD
listing' that'll be the add form we also
want to edit listing for the edit form
and I think that's it yeah that should
be it okay and you can see that it just
imported all of those files for us right
here and also added it here so what we
want to do now is create our router
because we're going to have different
routes so we're going to have the home
route the listings that it yeah home and
listing and then the add listing and
then the edit listing so to use the
router we actually have to bring it into
our app dot module dot ts file so I'm
going to go up here and run it in court
and we want to bring in router module
and route and that's going to be from
angular slash router
I'll see rid of that okay now when we
bring in the router we have to also add
it to need to add it to our imports down
here okay so let's put a comma here and
then we'll say router module and then we
go to do dot for route and here we're
going to pass in approach which is going
to be the the array that we store our
routes in okay so let's go up here and
create that so we're going to do Const
app routes and we're going to set that
to so we're going to give it a type of
routes and then we're going to set it to
an array of route objects so this will
have a path this is going to be the home
page so we leave it blank and then
specify the component which will be the
home component alright then we'll put a
comma there and let's say path ok this
one will be for listings the component
is going to be the listings component
okay and that's all I'm going to put for
now so let's save that and then we're
going to have to just put in the router
out written I'm going to put that in the
main app component so you want to go to
app component dot HTML and right here
let's put router outlet
just like that and I'll save okay and we
get homework let me just clear this down
here and reload make sure there's no
errors and then if we go to slash
listings we get listings works okay so
our router is working now let's add the
nav bar so we're going to put the nav
bar right here actually it's going to be
app - nav bar whenever you generate a
component with angular CLI it's going to
put a pin front of the whatever you call
the component okay for the selector and
then I'm just going to put a div here
with the class of container because
we're going to be using bootstrap all
right so now if we take a look you see
we have now bought works that's
outputting here okay now for a bootstrap
we're going to use boots watch and we're
going to use the let's see which one was
it
read I was it readable should I forget
which one I was
I think it always caused oh yeah because
the primary one is the fire base color
so if I click download I'm just going to
grab this link here and we're going to
put that in our index.html okay save
that and now if we go over to our app it
should be implemented now you can see
the container pushes this over okay so
now we need to have the navbar let's go
to the navbar component HTML file and
what I'm going to do is go to get
bootstrap comm and we're going to go to
getting started and then examples and
the starter template right here it will
control you and we'll grab this nav tag
here okay this is the responsive navbar
and we're going to just paste it right
in there and let's change the project
name to prop listings and I'm going to
get rid of the fixed top class right
here and down here let's see for home
we're going to use the router link let's
get rid of the active class and let's
replace this href with router link and
we want to set that to a set of brackets
and in here we'll just put a slash it's
going to go to the home and then we'll
actually we don't need that bracket
right there then we'll copy that put
that on this one and then this is going
to go to listings
okay we'll get rid of this last one so
let's save that and take a look okay and
now we can switch back and forth from
home and listening now when we're done
if you're not logged in you won't see
this listing but for now we're just
going to leave it it's fine so let's go
and add the homepage content width which
isn't much let's see you're going to go
to home and then home component HTML and
let's just put a div give it a class of
jumbotron and text center and then here
let's do a Katina and h1 and then the
paragraph will say access the hottest
properties available okay and then we're
going to have the Google Google login
with Google button
so the image I'm going to put that in
the link in the description inside of
the zip file you can grab that and let's
do image source and ring set that to
assets /img /a and g now this is going
to actually have an event a click event
but I'm not going to put it on there yet
I just want to get it just get a
displaying first so I'm going to open up
my project folder see projects and it's
going to go into source assets and let's
create a folder called IMG and then
that's where you're going to put that
image I'm just going to bring it over
alright now if we reload there we go
that's our homepage and actually before
we stop this part of the series just
what I'm going to add the login link as
well it's not going to work yet but I
just want to get it an app so let's go
back to the navbar and I'm going to copy
actually this is I'm going to add a
class navbar and we're going to grab
this paste it right there and then
change this to navbar right get rid of
one of these and then this is going to
be this is actually going to be a click
event so I'm just going to remove this
we'll just put an H ref for now and then
change this to login all right so it's
reload and now we have our login now we
might as well put our add listing link
as well so let's grab this right here
and then this is going to go to add
listing we'll add that row as well so it
saves that and then let's go back to the
app module TS and just add that as a
rope and copy that so this will be add -
listing and then it's going to be the ad
listings component all right so let's
test that out
with this thing
Oh what the hell stupid autocomplete
tanks so that should be ad listings
component correct or add listing no s
there we go so that should work
alright let me clear this
so that's home that's listening what's
going on pad listing get rid of the s
there we go okay so now the navigation
is working good all right so we're going
to go ahead and stop here and in the
next video we're going to implement
firebase and I'm not 100% positive if
we're going to do authentication first
or we're going to try and fetch the
listings even though we won't be able to
see them before we authenticate so we'll
probably go with the authentication but
we're going to have to add all that
metadata that we can that we saw here so
that's right here the API key all that
good stuff okay so that's what we're
going to get to next as far as when the
video will be released it might be
tomorrow or it might be the next day but
it should be within the next couple days
all right so thanks for watching guys if
you're not subscribed please do and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
