technology informational video in this
video we're going to talk about what a
REST API is now I do have several videos
on my channel showing you how to create
a REST API of couple in JavaScript and
node and one in PHP so you may have seen
some of those but you may still have
some confusion on how a REST API really
works now you may be saying well I can
just Google this what I have to watch
the visit this video well if you do
google it you'll get a thousand
different explanations that are so
complicated that it's nearly impossible
for an entry level developer to really
grasp it so I try to explain things on a
more basic level and hopefully that's
why you guys watch my videos I try to
take complicated concepts and explain
them in plain English I'm not a real
sophisticated guy so I like things
spelled out without nonsense so that's
what I try to give my viewers alright so
before we get into rest let's talk about
what an API ends in general so it stands
for application program interface and
that's a very broad term there's all
kinds of api's but we're specifically
talking about web api's there's API
senior computer operating system in your
smartphone and even in some
refrigerators and so on so this is very
generalized but it's essentially a
contract provided by one piece of
software to another piece of software it
usually consists of a structured request
and then a structured response so one
piece of software it says give me this
information formatted in this way and
I'll give you this data or this function
or whatever that response may be alright
so to help you understand we're going to
take a look at a couple analogies this
first one is actually from another
YouTube video which I'll link in the
description I'm using it because it's
one of the best analogies I've seen so
think of yourself at sitting at a table
at a restaurant in your one piece of
software such as a web application on
the client side
and then the kitchen is the server or
the service that processes certain
requests
well the waiter is like an API is
formatted to take a certain order in a
specific way and then bring back a
certain meal this would be the data or
the response that you requested so an
API is basically a messenger or a waiter
between running software all right so
another good if another good analogy is
this box here this toy so if we think of
this as an API it's formatted to take
certain shapes so the client has to
format the request as a circle square or
triangle
anything else will be accepted you'll
get some kind of error message or error
response so this is similar to how an
API works and you can think of these
shapes as the API standard whether it's
Jason or soap or something else so to
make this operate even more like a real
API we could have some kind of output
once the formatted shape requests go in
and that would be your response okay so
hopefully this gives you a good idea as
to what an API is in general all right
so now that we talked about what an API
is let's talk about rest so it stands
for representational state transfer and
it's an architecture style for designing
Network applications it works on relying
on a stateless client-server
communication protocol and in almost all
cases this is going to be HTTP all right
you guys know what HTTP is it's
basically the foundation of the
communication of the Internet of the web
every time you load a web page in your
browser it's making an HTTP request to a
server somewhere it is possible to use
other protocols with rest but HTTP is by
far the most used because in order to
use real-world rest you need the
delivery methods that HTTP offers rest
with me to treat objects on the server
side as resources that can be created
updated and destroyed or deleted an
example of a server-side object would
blog post in a database or something
like that okay we can have we can create
these posts with a post request a delete
with a delete request and so on alright
and what makes resto awesome is that it
operates using just HTTP and usually
some kind of standard like Jason so it
can be used by virtually any programming
language because most of the good
languages can make HTTP requests in some
way whether it's PHP JavaScript rails
Java Python all of these languages are
perfectly capable of working with Rexel
interfaces alright so hopefully I
haven't lost yet just remember an API is
is the messenger and rest lets us use
HTTP request to format those messages
you'll we may also hear the term restful
api and that just refers to conforming
to the rest constraints so rest api and
restful api are essentially the same
thing so now that we've established what
a rest api is let's look at the specific
methods and request that can be made to
a server through HTTP okay so a get
request is the most common your browser
client makes get requests every day just
by going to a specific server uri get
requests are used to do just that they
get data or retrieve data from a
specified resource okay next we have a
post request and you probably use these
everyday as well because every time you
fill out a webform you're making a post
request in most cases you can also make
get requests from forms but it's not
secure and the data you submit can be
seen by anyone form form tags in HTML
can take an action and a method
attribute so the action would be the
page that you're submitting to and then
the method would be either post or get
okay those are the only two requests
that can be made from just a web form on
its own so next we have put and put will
update any specified resource usually
you would have
send requests to an endpoint which is a
URI with some kind of ID and for that
specific resource whether it's a blog
post or a product the resource itself
doesn't matter but the server needs to
know which which one you want to update
okay
can't make a put-up put request from a
forum like you can a post you'd have to
use something like Ajax you could use a
standard JavaScript or you could use
jQuery or something like that and then
if you're using a framework like angular
you have different modules including an
HTTP module that's capable of sending
puts and deletes okay a delete request
is just that it will delete a specified
resource on a server and again you have
to let the server know what you're
deleting so you want to send an ID along
with that now there are other types of
requests but they're very rarely used
ahead request is the same as yet except
it doesn't return a body in the response
it will only return the head info
options can be used to see the supported
methods of the server and then patch is
for partial resources updating partial
resources but we're not going to get
into that okay so let's look at some
endpoint examples endpoints are the URI
or the URL that our HTTP requests are
sent to so here's an example using a
sample API at my site comm slash API
okay you can choose whatever folder you
want to put your API endpoints in but
many many times you'll use an API folder
or even an API subdomain okay so this
first one here is a as a endpoint for a
get request and this would typically
just give you a list of users ok would
return a response with all the users and
we can make a get request to a specific
user by going API slash users slash and
then whatever that users ID in many
cases you may have an endpoint like this
where you're saying instead of just
users and then the ID it would be users
details and then the ID or users show
or something like that now in this case
we're making a post request to API users
and that's going to add a user to to the
server to the database now notice that
this get request and this post request
have the same endpoint but since they're
different methods are different requests
that's okay okay you can use the same
the same URL but they have to be
different requests in this case here
where he's making a put request to API
users one or you may see something like
this API users update one and that's
going to update that user okay you'll
have to send data along with that just
as you would with a post request and
then delete you can make a delete
request to API users one and that will
delete that user okay or you may see
something like this
users delete one okay now if we use
endpoints like the ones we just saw
without any kind of authentication of
who we are those are public or open API
s but sometimes you need to authenticate
before using them now this can mean just
register registering your app with the
providers website and even sometimes
you'll have to pay for it you'll have to
purchase that data access so there's a
few ways that authentication is
implemented so usually you'll use OAuth
which involves getting some kind of
access token and sending that along with
your requests so if you tend to attempt
to make a request without that then
you'll get some kind of unauthorized
ever so here's some examples of how it
works with the github API which is a
really nice API for beginners it's
really easy to use and how it works is
you can use it without any kind of
authentication but only up to I think
it's like a hundred requests per hour if
you go over that and you didn't
authorize then you're going to get an
error and you're not going to be able to
fetch the data so there's a few
different ways that this is implemented
and these examples were using curl to
make our requests curl is just basically
a tool that we can use to transfer data
using multiple protocols including HTTP
so this first one
here is by sending the token inside of
the header okay inside the HTTP header
so you can include a value for
authorization and you would set that to
your token all right sometimes you can
even send the token as a parameter in
the URI and another common way is to not
send the token itself but a generated
client ID and secret as a parameter to
your request alright so what I want to
do now is jump in and take a look at a
real world example we're going to look
at the github API we're going to look at
some of the documentation and I'll show
you what happens when you make a get
request and we'll request some user data
all right so this is the documentation
for github API version 3 if you go to
developer github comm v3 and this just
basically gives you a bunch of
information on the API and most public
API or most data guys in general have
some kind of documentation like this so
you know what endpoints you need to use
what methods are ok to use things like
that so if we take a look down here see
if we look at HTTP verb so so these are
the different types of requests that can
be made in certain endpoints so head get
post patch put and delete it shows us
how you can authenticate and this is the
information we saw on the slide it shows
us that we can authenticate through the
header through a parameter and so on if
we scroll down here some more it'll also
show you how to use pagination and you
can use that by requesting a certain
amount of of whatever it is users or
repository so in this case of saying 100
per page and then you can also specify
the page and then you can use your
programming logic to create pagination
okay so you only so you have a hundred
per page and so on let's see if we go
down some more
see actually that's not what I want to
show you let's go back up here and then
over here I want to click on users okay
so this gives us the how to get a single
user we make a get request to slash
users and then whatever that user name
okay when you see a colon in front of it
like that that usually means that this
is some kind of placeholder so this
would be whatever username you want and
then this shows you the actual response
you get
okay so 200 status means everything's
okay and then it gives you this in the
body
okay gives you Jason of all that users
information including their user name
their ID the URL to their image their to
their avatar see how many see how many
repos they have how many gifts their
blog their company and then all these
URLs as well which you can make other
requests to and if we go down some more
the update the authenticated user so if
you are authenticated as a specific user
you can actually make request to update
your information okay so you can edit
your profile if you want to get all
users you can do that by just making a
get request to slash users so what I
want to do is try this out now you can
obviously do this within your your
program but there's also tools that you
can use to make request ok postman is
what I suggest you use you crumb a
google chrome plugin or extension
whatever it's called so you can go ahead
and download that and then all you have
to do is put your endpoint in here and
then the type of request in some cases
you'll have to send data or maybe some
header values for instance if you need
to do authorization you can put that in
here and you can put the value so these
are key value pairs if you need to send
data you can do that as well usually you
can only send data you can't do it with
a get request you can see that's grayed
out but if it was a post request you can
send the body in different
or Matt's you can send it as a form or
you can send raw data or for instance
raw Jason alright but what I'm going to
do is make a get request to HTTP API dot
github.com slash users okay and then
this is what it gives us and you can see
we have basically it's an array of user
objects so this is the username the ID
all the URLs and all that stuff okay now
if we want to get a specific user we
could say we can make a get request to
just put my username send and then that
gives us all that information on that
specific user okay now with the github
API and a lot of API you can do it like
this without any kind of authentication
for a certain amount of requests in fact
let me see if I can get to it
it may here we go and you can see API
rate limit has exceeded so you get a
certain amount of requests per hour or
per cup every couple hours or whatever
it may be whatever they set it to so
what we would have to do now to be able
to keep using this in our application is
to register it okay so if we go to
github.com settings applications new and
let's say test app home page just a test
comm application description just in my
app and then some kind of callback URL
we'll just take this and let's say
register application and now you can see
it gives us a client ID and a client
secret so what we have to do now is just
include these as a parameter okay so if
we go back to our documentation here and
go down to our where is it
authentication so we can add we can send
these as a parameter you can see right
here client ID client secret so let's
take that starting with that question
mark go back to postman and we'll just
grab the client ID and we'll put that
right here place these X's and then a
secret and put that right here we don't
want that quote on the end and now let's
make let's do send and now we can get it
okay we can keep making them because
we're authenticated all right so that's
going to be it for this video hopefully
this gives you guys a better idea on how
RESTful API is work and if you haven't
seen my videos where we create a restful
api i would suggest doing that alright
so that's it thanks for watching and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
