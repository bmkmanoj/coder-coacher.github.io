toriel in this video I'm gonna be
showing you how to do overrides how to
do component overrides and what that
means is you have different extensions
for Joomla some third-party some come
with the Joomla system by default and
the one we're going to be working with
is the users component and what that
does is it controls the default site
registration login profile stuff like
that
so I have a link to my login form and
it's just the the default layout what
component override will do is allow us
to change this layout but not only
change it we'll be putting it in into
our template directory so that if you
upgrade to upgrade Joomla or if you
upgrade the users component this will
layout will stick it won't be
overwritten okay so if we go in the
backend you can see I just created the
login form menu item I'll just show you
how I did that if you go down to
users manager this is the actual
component and I chose login form so if
you guys want to do the same then do it
so what I'm gonna change I'm not gonna
change anything drastically all I'm
going to do is remove this don't have an
account and I also don't want the links
and in a in a list like this I just want
them side by side so just a very simple
very simple change maybe I'll add a
heading two so what I'm going to do I'm
working on my local host on a sample
installation so I'm actually gonna be
using my Windows Explorer as opposed to
maybe an FTP account if you're doing
this on a live site so I'm just gonna go
to my htdocs folder and this Joomla
subfolder this is where my site is if
you look at you'll see I'm at localhost
/ Joomla and then what I want to do is
go to components and comm users this is
the the the entire front end of the
users component so we want to go to
views and with many components they
won't have these these subfolders
they'll just have the template folder
but since there's so many different
views for the users we have these
different folders so we want to go to
the login folder and we have a view dot
HTML dot PHP file which is it's where
the view talks to the model and vice
versa we're not going to touch that what
we want is the template file so in this
TMP el folder many extensions will only
have the default dot PHP this one that
uses component login view has three
different layouts and it's really if you
click on default dot PHP it's just
calling they login in the logout views
which is right here at login logout okay
so that's why this three separate fold
is there what we want to edit is the
login the default login PHP so this here
is the entire layout of this page of
this component so what we want to do is
we we need to edit this file but we
don't want to edit it right here and
just save it because if we do that when
you upgrade Joomla it's gonna it's going
to overwrite it so we need to create an
override so what we want to do is just
copy this file this default login and we
want to go back to our Joomla root and
then we want to go in our templates
folder and then we want to choose the
template we're using I'm not sure if
this is B's 20 or B's 5 I'm just going
to check real quick default all right so
it's the B's 20 template and if you want
to see which template you using just go
to extensions template manager so let's
go there
to the B's 20 and your theme or your
template might not have this folder the
HTML folder if you don't have this then
you want to create it just create a new
folder called HTML and now we need to
add the folder of the component we want
to use which is calm users
and then in that in here is what we want
our template files let me just get a
side-by-side view right here
so with certain components like I said
you won't have these subfolders since we
do have these folders then we have to
actually create them in the override as
well so we want to create a new folder
called login and in that folder is where
we want to paste that default login five
file so now this should override the the
base file okay so let's open that up
let's close this one up and open that
one and we want to edit this I'm
assuming that you have some HTML and PHP
experience if you don't it's fine it's
very easy you can see right here is the
list of the links we have the login
reset the login remind and then the
register link and we don't want the
register link so we want to actually
take this all out from this PHP tag
all the way down to the end if now what
this is saying right here is if user
registration is allowed on the site then
it'll display this link so if it's not
if you go into global configuration and
you disable site registration then this
won't be here but we're just going to
take this whole block oh so that's gone
now we want to take away the list so we
want to take away the UL and the Li tags
so now we just have two links and I want
to put a pipe in between them and I also
want to add a heading I'll put it in the
div tag
actually you can see here the heading is
actually already included but we don't
have it enabled from our site so we can
actually I'm just gonna get rid of this
just to show you that you can change
this so let's save that and if we go
back to our login form we reload we now
have the heading and we have the two
links side-by-side so you can do a lot
with this you can you can change the the
entire layout of basically any Joomla
component and you can also do overrides
with modules you'll see if we go back to
override and if we delete this file and
we reload then it's back to its default
state so pretty easy that's it for
component overrides please subscribe if
you can and I'll see you in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
