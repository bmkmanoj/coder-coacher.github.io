build a codeigniter PHP app series in
this video I want to basically do three
different things all right so first
thing I want to do is I want to be able
to truncate the text if we add let's say
four or five paragraphs to a post we
don't want that to show on the index
page we wanted to truncate a certain a
certain amount of words so that it's not
so long and we can click read more and
then see the rest all right that's the
first thing I want to do then I want to
be able to I want to add categories
we're going to add a categories database
table and when we create a post we're
going to be able to select a category
and then we can display the category
here as well and then the last thing I
want to do is I want to be able to
upload images or an image to a post ok
we'll create a file upload field so that
we can add an image so we'll start with
the truncate because that's pretty easy
we're going to go and open up
application config autoload and we just
want to load the text helper so you can
see we already have the URL in the forum
helper now we're going to add text ok
we'll save that then we're going to go
to the post controller and I'm sorry not
the controller the view we want to go to
views posts and then index all right now
since we enabled the text helper we have
access to a function called word limiter
so we're going to go to where we're
outputting the body which is right here
I'm just going to wrap that in word
underscore limiter ok so it's going to
take in the body as one parameter and
then the next parameter will be the
amount of words that we want so let's
say let's see what 50 looks like alright
so we'll save that and if we look at
post too and you see how long it is
let's reload now you can see it's
shorter and it ends with this these
three dots
if we click read more we can move on and
see the full text
all right so I think that's good let's
make it 60 make it a little longer all
right
so that's all set now for categories
what we want to do is go into the
database and we're going to create a new
table called categories and that's going
to have three fields we want an ID which
is going to be a auto increment in
primary key we want a name which will be
a vouch are 255 and then a create date
or yeah create let's do created app and
that's going to be a timestamp and then
it's going to have a default of current
timestamp all right so now we have this
categories table but we need to add a
field inside the post table so let's go
to posts structure and we're going to
add one column after ID and that's going
to be category underscore ID and that's
going to be an int all right so if we
look at our posts now they all have a
category of zero let's just go ahead and
actually before we do that we'll add a
couple categories so if we go to
categories and then insert let's say we
want business as a category and
technology all right so now we have
these two categories business has the ID
of one and Technology has the ID of two
so let's go back to posts and then I'm
just going to edit the category ID we'll
say that one's 1 1 &amp;amp; 2 all right so now
they have categories so what we want to
do is on our create post form we want a
category drop-down so let's go to our
posts index I'm sorry I post controller
and go down to where we have our create
now in order to populate a drop-down
full of categories we have to fetch them
from the database so let's add another
data
element to the array and we'll call this
categories and we'll set this to this
and then we want the model which is post
model and we'll have a function called
get categories all right so let's open
up the model now you could create a
separate categories model or even a
separate categories controller but we're
just going to keep it all in posts all
right so post model and let's see we'll
go down to the bottom and say public
function get categories and let's see
what I want to do here let's let's say
this DB and let's do an order by and
order by name of the category and then
we'll say this DB this DB get and let's
pass in categories for the table now I
want this to be in a variable called
query and then we're just going to
return we're going to return query and
then result underscore array okay so
that will return the categories as an
array now since that's going to this
data variable we're passing it into the
view so we should have access to it so
let's go to the create view and we're
going to go under the form group where
the text area is we're going to create
another form group
okay let's put in a select so let's do a
label first okay then we'll do a select
with a name of category ID and let's
give it a class of form control and what
we'll do is do a for each loop through
the categories
okay so we'll say for each categories as
category and we want to spit out an
option for each one so option value now
for the text let's echo out the category
name so we can say category name and
then for the value that's going to be
the ID so we'll copy that change this to
ID all right so let's take a look at
that so now we have a drop-down and it's
being populated with the categories now
we have to handle when we actually
submit this so the controller we
shouldn't have to add anything here but
if we go to the model and we go to
create post we're just going to add in
here category on the score ID and that's
going to be this input post category ID
alright and that should get put in the
table and while we're here we might as
well also put that in the update right
here
okay we're going to have to add it to
the update form as well but let's go
ahead and try this let's see let's
delete this post for all right and then
we'll create post and let's just call
this post three will choose technology
submit and now let's go to the database
and take a look and post 3 has the
category ID of 2 which is technology now
if we want it to display here we
actually have to do a join so we can
join in the categories so that we can
get the name so in the model where we
have get posts we're just going to go
right above this this query right here
and let's see we're going to say this DB
join ok so we want to join in the
categories table right and then the
second parameter we want to say if our
categories dot ID is equal to post dot
category ID that's what's going to match
them now since we're doing an order by
ID this is going to be ambiguous because
there's an ID in both table so we have
to define which tables so it's going to
be post ID all right so now we shouldn't
see any change here yet but we should
now have access to the category name
inside the view so let's go let's see I
want to go to index posts index.php and
where we have the date says posted on
and then the date well after the date
we're going to say in PHP echo post we
should have access to name from the
categories table okay I'll go ahead
actually you know what let's add strong
tags around that
and there we go so now you're seeing
category name all right so we also want
to be able to update the category
because right now if we click Edit it's
not there so we're going to grab it I'm
going to go to the create view and just
copy the form group with the select and
then we'll go to edit I'm gonna paste
that in there and save it and now let's
say we go to post 3 and we want to edit
all you know what we're not getting the
categories here we have to go back to
the controller and then create where we
put this line right here to get
categories we're going to have to put
that in edit as well right here okay
then we'll reload and now we can get
them so post three let's change that to
business and now it's business all right
so now what I want to do is I want to be
able to add images so we're going to
have to do a couple things actually
let's go into the create view and we're
going to have to change this form open
to form open multi-part so that it can
upload files alright and then we're
going to go and add another form group
down below down below the category so
say class form group and inside here
we're going to put a label
we'll say upload image then we want
input which will have the type of file
and then we'll call the name we'll just
call it post image
and to give it a size of 20 all right so
that should give us an image upload
button let's go to create post and now
we can choose a file now it's not going
to do anything yet we have to handle it
in the controller so let's go to posts
and then create and we need to go in
this else because that's where it's
actually going to get submitted and
let's say upload image okay so there's a
bunch of config options we have to put
in okay the first one is going to be the
upload path where we want this to go so
I'm going to say dot slash assets slash
images slash posts all right now let's
create that folder so over here under
assets we're going to say a new folder
images and inside their new folder posts
so that's where it'll go now we're going
to add some other configs here so let me
just copy this okay so we're also going
to have allowed types and that's going
to be I will say gif and it separate it
with a pipe character gif jpg and PNG
alright and then the next one will be
the max underscore size and let's make
that two gigs looks like 200 for 8 and
then let's do a max width and we'll make
that say 500 and a max height will also
say 500
all right you can set that to whatever
you'd like now what we have to do is we
need to say this load okay so actually
this load library and here we're going
to pass in upload and then we're going
to pass in that config array so now we
have to check to see if it was uploads
so I'm going to say if else so if not
this upload and then we need to say to
underscore upload okay so if it's not
uploaded and that's a function then
we're going to put inside of an errors
variable an array and it'll say error
set that this upload display errors just
like that and then we're going to create
a variable called post image and we're
going to set that to no image no image
dot jpg okay so you'll be able to create
an image if you want that's kind of a
default image if the user doesn't upload
one okay and you don't have to use that
but it's just something that you can do
all right and then down here if it is
uploaded then we're going to say data
equals array and inside here we're going
to say upload underscore data and let's
set that to this
upload data alright and then we're going
to say post image is going to be equal
to the file super global and then we
want to get post image because that's
the name of the field that we created
and then we want to get the name okay
and that's going to go inside of this
variable now we want to insert this as a
database field so we're going to have to
add that field so in the post table
let's go to structure and then we'll say
after body and let's call this post
image which will be a varchar' 255 all
right so we want to insert that this
post image whether it's this if there is
one or this if there isn't so we're
going to pass it into the model like
that save it and then we'll go to the
model to create post and that's going to
be taking in post image and then we just
want to add that to our database post
image set that to post image all right
so it's doing two things when it uploads
it's going to get put in the folder that
we specified and then the name of it is
going to get put in the database all
right so let's go ahead and try it
so we'll say test post this is a test
post and let's choose a file and I'm
going to grab the angular image right
here and submit now it's not going to
show here yet because we haven't done
that but let's look at the database and
you'll see that up it has no image now I
think I know the reason for that so I'm
going to delete that whole post that we
just did and I think the reason is
because if we go in our create view we
named it post image I think it has to be
named user file
I don't know why but I think it does
alright so that means we have to also
change it right here where we put post
image should be user file alright so
we'll save that and let's try it again
so we'll go create post and let's say
test post okay
we'll choose technology as the category
and let's grab that angular picture
submit and now you can see it popped up
over here so it did upload angular PNG
and then if we look at the database you
can see the post image name is angular
dot PNG so apparently that has to be
called user file alright so we know
that's working now we want to display
the image and we know we have the image
name in the database so we can use that
so let's go to index.php which is the
view for our posts and we're going to
put under the title a div give it a
class of row and let's do two columns
call em d3 call em d9 alright and we're
going to grab this cut put that in the
nine column space that out a little bit
and then up here will be the image so
image source for that we should be able
to do PHP echo we need the core URL so
we can use site URL and then we want to
go into assets slash images slash posts
slash and then we're going to echo out
host and post on the score image okay so
that's going to pull the name from the
database so let's save that and now we
have the image now if we were to create
a post without an image now we'll say
post no image this is a post with no
image okay so we're not going to choose
a file and submit and now this should be
no image PNG okay right here no I'm
sorry JPEG no image JPEG so if we create
an image and call it no image JPEG it's
going to show up here all right so let's
grab um let's just say avatar
placeholder okay so we'll just grab like
one of these I guess so I'm going to
save it to our xampp htdocs CI blog
assets images posts and I'm going to
save it as no image dot jpg and now we
have it there okay I will have to fix
that with the styling let's see we'll
give this we'll give it a class I think
bootstrap has a class of thumbnail yeah
but that didn't do anything let's add a
class so let's just say post thumb and
then let's go to our CSS which is in
assets CSS
and save toast thumb and we'll just set
a width of a hundred percent of its
container and now nothing huh Oh post
image class post them that should work
well if we get rid of the thumbnail
that's pretty weird
oh it's not even seeing that style for
some reason is it not reading the
style.css oh maybe because there's a
double slash there let me just check out
header.php which is in the views
templates header alright so let's get
rid of that and then reload there we go
alright so now
nevermind these because we did we upload
we did this before we even had the
capability to add images so I'm actually
going to delete these alright but now
every time you add a post from now on if
you don't add an image you'll have this
if you do then obviously that image will
show up alright now let's get the image
on the main page as well so we'll go to
view what is it views posts view PHP and
let's just put this put it right under
the date so image we'll give it that
class of post is that what I called it
post image post thumb
okay and I'll just grab the source from
here I'll just grab this whole thing
alright so let's see if that works
whoa okay so it's it's giving it a
hundred percent of the entire thing so
maybe we won't do the post thumb we'll
just let it be its normal size
all right so there we go so that's how
we can add images that's how we can add
categories and that's how we can
truncate the text
all right so in the next video when I
make it I'm not going to do it right now
but we will be adding a user login
system so that you have to login to add
posts and stuff all right so thanks for
watching guys thanks for sticking
through it and I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
