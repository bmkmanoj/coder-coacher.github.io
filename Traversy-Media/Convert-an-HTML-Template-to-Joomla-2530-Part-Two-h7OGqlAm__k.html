2.5 template series what we did in part
1 is just set up the content on the
default joomla installation if you look
at the design that we're going to be
creating or the template were going to
be creating we have a menu we have two
right side modules we have a footer
right and a footer left module and then
we have a main image module and what we
did was we went in created the modules
we have the footer menu which we created
a a we created a main menu and then just
copied it you can see it has all the
links we just copied it to a another
menu called footer menu which we gotta
get rid of all these twos but um if you
just want to create these modules if you
didn't see the first part of the series
the login form doesn't really matter we
don't have that on our new template nor
the breadcrumbs so we have the main
image and then we have the two footer
I'm sorry the two right modules so if
you want to just create those if you
didn't see the first part I'll go back
and watch the first part so now we're
going to get into actually creating the
template so what I'm gonna do is create
a new folder on my desktop I'm gonna
call it business design and this is
going to be the folder that holds all a
template files
so the first thing I'll do is go to the
static HTML template and I'm going to
put this I'm gonna put the files for
this in my description hopefully if I
don't forget if I do forget just leave a
comment no I'll do that so what I want
to do is grab both the CSS and the
images folder I'm gonna copy and put it
into the Joomla template so the images
we just have the logo the big image and
then the background image and we have
one CSS file so it's a very minimal
template we don't wait we're gonna add
an index.html but it's not going to be
the one with all this content it's just
pretty much gonna be a blank file just
so people can't access the template
directly through the browser so if we
have an index.html file that it stops
them from doing that the next thing we
need is we need a in an index.php file
which I'll get to in a second but I'll
just create it now we also need every
template needs a template details XML
file so we want to create a new what is
it template details dot XML and this
will have all the author info on a
metadata that goes with the template and
I think that's I do want to create a
favicon so we can do that with dynamic
what does a dynamic drive has a really
good tool to generate a favicon which is
that the little icon in the browser so
if we just want to choose the file I'm
just going to choose the actual the logo
and create the icon so we have this nice
little logo that will show when I
browser window so I want to download
that I'm going to download it to the
just the folder that the template folder
where is it
all right so now we have the favicon so
that's that should be good for our files
what we need to do now is add some
content to this XML file all right so
what I'm gonna do is actually drag in
I'll paste in some content from a
default file that I use when i create my
templates so let me go grab that
just don't you know sorry I forget where
I put things sometimes
and we want this open it with notepad
plus plus and just copy this all right
all right so we have the XML declaration
doctype it's version 2.5 the joomla
version it's going to be a template for
the site client not the administrator
and we can add a name here and change
that just to business design and you can
add your author info your name email URL
copyright whatever and then here's the
description that'll show after we
install it I'll just say this is the
business design template
in here we have to list all folders and
files that are going to be in our root
directory our root template directory
which is right here
you should shorten this a little so we
don't have an HTML folder an HTML folder
would be used for overrides if you want
to override your component on module
layouts and we're not going to do that
usually I'd have a blank HTML folder but
if we do that we're gonna get an error
on installation so I'm gonna get rid of
that for now CSS folder images folder we
don't have a JavaScript folder this
template has no JavaScript so no need
for it we have these template previews
if you wanted to you could create a
template preview dot PNG and a template
thumbnail dot PNG and this just shows in
the back in the template manager but
we're not gonna use that for this
template we're also not going to use
error or component so that's good for
that now we have to we have to declare
all the module positions we're going to
have so we're gonna have a right if we
look at the template that we're creating
we're gonna have a right a menu module
I'll call this a showcase the big image
and then footer right and footer left so
let's do that
say menu
showcase
and then for the right for the left
so that should be good
okay save that and I think that should
do it
yeah
all right so that's it for the XML file
now what we need to do is create the
index.php file
so this is the main the main page of the
template this is where you define all
the entire structure as well as the head
and the body tags I'm gonna actually get
the the original HTML file that came
with the the static template
you know what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
grab everything in this index.html file
and I'm gonna copy it and I'm gonna
paste it into the index.php file he and
we're gonna work off of this and the
first thing the head the whole head the
doctype in the head is going to be all
replaced so what I'm gonna do is
actually get rid of that and I'm gonna
paste in a couple things first I'm gonna
paste in just the comment block PHP
comment block that just has the name of
the template and then your copyright
info and then under that we need this
line all templates should have this line
in there index.php it just makes it so
that the user can't access this your
template through the browser they
actually have to go to through the
joomla site so it's this is a very
important security measure alright so
the next thing I'm going to add is the
doctype and put it right below that and
it's just given us the xml version 1.0
and the HTML doctype this template is
actually going to be an xhtml 1.0
standard you might be doing HTML 5
that's fine too if you just want to have
just the doctype and then you wouldn't
have this pot for the XHTML and then we
have the xmlns with the HTML tag so this
is the
the opening HTML tag and I'm sure you
know at least some HTML basics we have
the HTML tag than the head tag then the
body tag so that's for the doctype now
we want to add the head the head part of
the template which opens with head and
closes with head and what we have here
is a J doc include statement and this is
what outputs all our header information
all our meta tags stuff like that it
goes through Joomla and it gets
outputted right here we do have to
define our CSS files or any JavaScript
files if we wanted to include those with
our template so what we have here is
just a simple link to style dot CSS fold
file which has all our styling
information and we do have some dynamic
variables here you can see when we're
pointing to the style sheet we use this
this base URL if this is a variable that
will point us to whatever the URL of the
current site is so we don't have to hide
code it or anything like that
same thing with here we have this
template this template just points to
whatever the name of this template is
and then points to the CSS folder and
then to the stylesheet so that's all we
need for the head if we go down here the
body the styling all the divs everything
is going to stay the same as far as the
the layout and the the div tags what we
need to change is the actual content we
need to add in our module positions and
we need to add our main call from for
our component so what we're going to do
we have the static navigation here we
actually set up the menu structure in
the Joomla back-end let's go back
you know I'm gonna log back in here
so we have our menus we have a main menu
and a footer menu which have links and
every menu is a module so if we go to
module manager we have the main menu
here and it's in well it's in the
position seven here but this is these
positions are for the the default
template and we want to actually change
these positions our main menu the
position we're going to give it is just
menu so I'm gonna get rid of that if you
remember in the XML file the template
details dot XML that's where we defined
all these positions so let's save that
let's actually check and see if these
are all in the right position footer
menu will be on the footer left footer
right right right alright so
everything's good login form we're not
using so it doesn't really matter so now
we know that our main menu is in the
menu position so let's go back to our
template and actually just get rid of
this unordered list and I'm gonna type
in a J doc it's gonna be J doc include
and this is how we insert our dynamic
code we can insert module positions
component as well as messages and you
saw here we did the head so J dot
conclude it just outputs certain aspects
of the template that we need so here we
want to do JJ include and they all have
a type and the type we want here is
modules all right so the next attribute
we need is a name and the name is just a
position so like I said our main menu is
in the menu position
and then the last attribute we have is
style which we're going to have as none
now if you want to have a heading
showing in your module than you would
you could use the style XHTML right here
and it would output that the actual
heading if you use none it's just going
to print out the module content not the
headings so now if we save that I'm
actually going to build out the whole
template before we install it so let's
just get through this real quick here we
have the the main div with the main
content and this is all we pasted this
all in one Joomla article if we go to
article manager we have the home page
and if I if we view the source you can
see we have the h1 tag and we have up
until the enjoy the design so that's
what we have right here and that's what
we want to get rid of and the main
component will also be output output and
using J doc I'm sorry I can't type today
I know what's going on here alright so
include and we're gonna have the type
except this time it's going to be
component and you'll only have one of
these per template alright so that looks
good so next we have the the right
module position which here is going to
be the the news section and we're not
going to have let's copy this here this
this module call and place it in the the
news div except this is going to be
right that's going to be the position
and we want you know it will actually
keep the none I'm gonna actually include
the heading in the module content so we
can leave this to none now we're not
going to have two of these we do have
two right modules but we're not going to
have two of these we only need to
declare this once and every module
that's assigned to the right position
we'll just come one after another you
don't have to have two of these because
we're going to have to write modules if
that makes any sense
and if we go back to module manager we
have
module manager we have our to right
position we have the copyright and then
we have the other info so if we go back
to our design you can see those right
here now there is a one tricky part of
this this template is that each block
each each block on the right is assigned
a class called news item now if we just
stick div class new news item over this
one position it's just going to have
that main div and then all the right
modules will be in between it but we
need this for each call each module so
what we need to do is give it a module
class suffix so we'll go to the
copyright module
and what I want to do is click on
advanced and then add a suffix here so
I'm actually just gonna take that what
I'm gonna take this news item class and
I'm gonna put in it's going to be an
underscore and then the news item and
I'll show you why I did the underscore
on it in a few minutes so let's save
that
and we also want to do it to the the
other right module
whenever we want to apply that design
that yellow boxing we have to add this
class suffix
all right so now we can get rid of this
now what else do we have we have the
footer left and the footer right if we
go to our module manager the footer menu
is in the footer left position so let's
copy this modules output and we're going
to replace the entire unordered list and
this is going to be footer right
and now we want to let's check out the
credit module which is the footer right
and we have the entire span so that's
what we're going to replace and this is
going to be footer left yeah for the
left
so that's it we've taken the static HTML
layout and applied all the dynamic
elements to it to make it a functional
Joomla template and you can see it's
actually shrunk a lot in size because we
instead of having the static content we
just have these one line one line calls
to different dynamic aspects of the of
the website so I'm gonna save that now
it seems like I think we have everything
done we need have our CSS images let's
just check the XML file and make sure we
have everything favicon XML PHP alright
so that looks good we have our positions
here oh the showcase that's what we
forgot to do now in this particular
template the let me just go back and
show you here this image here isn't an
inline image it's actually a background
image and it's the background image it's
using the header div so what we did in
the first part of it we actually created
a module we can go back here and where
is it main image this main image module
we just put the div in here and the
image will actually replace the div I
will not replace it but it's the
background image assigned to this div so
I'm actually going to copy this module
statement and to replace the the div
here and this is going to be the header
position so if we go here you can see we
chose the header position all right so
now it looks complete so what we want to
do is actually grab all this and wrap it
up in a zip file I use WinRAR but you
can use whatever you feel like
so now we have our zip file now this
should just be able to simply install
using the extension manager
so we just want to navigate to that zip
file
and upload
so it was installed successfully now
what we want to do is go to template
manager and we want to select the
business design I don't know why all
these I here like this
ah let's see
you know what I did install it before
and I guess for some reason it didn't
uninstall let's actually go let's
uninstall these first because I'm not
sure which one is the right one so I'm
gonna go to manage
extension manager managed
and select type template
and I'm going to uninstall both of these
business design
and then go back to extension manager
and I'm gonna upload it again and you
most likely won't have to do this unless
you installed it before so that looks
good so now go to template manager and
I'm going to select business design and
I'm gonna select make default
so now if we go back and reload our
front-end you can see we have some
styling issues but overall that the
layouts they are the contents they're
what we need to do is take care of these
right modules and make them look like
this and now I'll show you why I added
that underscore I'm going to use the
Google web tools to view the source of
these modules and you can see the div
applied to each one is custom underscore
a news item now this what's what Joomla
is doing is adding this custom before
whatever we had for the for the the
class suffixes so our actual div is
called custom underscore news item so
what we need to do is just edit the
these CSS file and changed news item
it's a custom underscore news item and
then the styling should show up so what
I'm gonna do is I'm not going to edit
and reinstall the template I'm gonna
edit the actual template that's being
used so I'm going to my Joomla
installation I'm going to templates
business design and I'm gonna go to the
CSS file and obviously if you're using a
live site you want to do this through
FTP or SSH or whatever it is you you
access your site files with so where it
says news item I'm just gonna have
custom underscore right there and right
here so now that styling should show up
so if I save that
close that out and if we go back to the
site and reload now we have our styled
styled right modules and the only other
difference I see is the menu in the in
the original template as all caps
I don't like to hard-code capitalized
letters in templates so what I want to
do is just add a CSS property that will
up or that will turn the that will make
them all uppercase so I'm gonna go back
into that custom CSS I mean I'm sorry
style.css and I'm going to in the
navigation we're going to add a text
transform property and we want to do
uppercase save that go back reload and
now it's all uppercase so well one thing
I do see down here is we have all these
twos and this is also the design by site
creative the footer right
module is a little off let's go to the
footer menu and actually delete a few of
these links
reload
all right so something is putting that
off I'm gonna go check the
I'm going to get out of all this and I'm
going to go to the actual template
that's on my site business design
index.php so we have foot or left for
the right
we go back to the module manager
and for the right
much sure why that's off
Oh
okay Joomla actually adds a class menu
to each menu and it's going all the way
over as you can see as I highlight over
it you can see that it's going all the
way over what we want to do here I'm
just going to shorten that up a little
so what I'm going to do is go back to
the CSS file and I'm going to add in the
UL menu UL with a class of menu and I'm
going to say with 60% and we'll float
that I'm going to pull up the menu to
the left alright
so I'm going to save that I'm actually
going to go back to index dot PHP and
since we're going to be floating the the
left the footer left position I'm
actually going to add an eclair just a
div style clear:both just so that div X
so that float clears so save and go back
and reload now the the right the footer
right is now in place so everything
looks good oh well you see what happened
the actual main menu also went to 60% so
when something like that happens you can
add a menu class so if I go back to
footer my footer menu
in the Advanced Options I'm going to add
a menu class of a footer menu so now if
we go back and reload and open up the
web tools
you can see now we have a UL class well
menu footer menu footer menu so I'm
actually gonna change that
I'm just gonna change it to underscore
footer so now if we go and check that
out again
so now it's the UL class menu footer so
now we just need to go to the CSS and
change this to menu footer if we save
that and reload now on menu top menus
back and we still have the the right
foot are in place all right so we're
just about done let's see let's visit
the about Us page yep so you can see the
image is now gone off the inner pages so
the home page is the only page that has
the the main image because if you
remember in the first part of this when
we created the main main image module we
made sure that we only clicked home so
if you wanted it on the about page you
could just select the about Us and then
go back and reload and the image will be
there so you can choose what what pages
you want which modules so I think that's
it it looks pretty much identical aside
from the twos in the footer menu but
it's no big deal just go in the menu
manager and delete them so that's it for
making a joomla 2.5 template if you guys
could subscribe I'd really appreciate
that and I'll see you in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
