crash course in the next hour or so I'm
gonna cram as much info as I can about
the Django framework we're gonna take a
few minutes to talk about what it is
look at some slides and then we're gonna
jump in and we're gonna build a simple
blog application with an admin area now
this video is for absolute beginners
people that have to have basically never
used Django before and want to learn
about it or have used it very briefly
and don't really understand it and don't
really understand the file structure and
all that I will have more advanced
videos on Django in the future but this
is basically a starting point for people
that want to learn it okay I know I have
a lot of JavaScript developers subscribe
to my channel because that's mostly what
I do but I would encourage you to take a
look at Django even if you don't know
Python it's a very high level language
I'm sorry high level framework and it
does a lot of the heavy lifting for you
alright so sit back relax and let's
learn Django this video is sponsored by
GPD host they offer a variety of
affordable hosting plans with flexible
billing cycles these plans include a
free ssl certificate a free domain name
website builder and many other services
including free website migration with no
downtime to find out more visit GPD host
com or click the link in the description
below alright guys so I do have a to do
list django project video and i'm not
really happy with it because i didn't do
much explanation it was more of a code
along type video so I wanted to to
remake a basic Django course and explain
things a little more go through some
slides so we can talk about exactly what
it is the type of design pattern it uses
some of the advantages things like that
alright I'm also doing this on Windows I
did the other one on Linux Ubuntu the
reason for Windows is because a lot of
beginners use it and also setting up
Python and Django on Windows is a bit
different than doing it on a Mac or
Linux it's gotten much much easier I
know that you may have heard in the past
that it's it's really difficult but it's
it's very
very easy now and you'll see that so
this is completely cross-platform the
the framework itself does not change
depending on what system you're using so
don't worry about it if you're on a Mac
or Linux you'll be able to follow along
just fine all right and as I said even
if you don't know Python just follow
along it's all convention if you if you
understand basic programming
fundamentals like functions and if
statements and things like that you'll
be absolutely fine so what exactly is
Django it's a high-level Python web
framework and I'll talk about high-level
and low-level in a minute it's also free
and open source like most great
frameworks it really encourages rapid
development and getting things up and
running very quickly it follows the mtv
or model template view design pattern
which I'll talk about in a few minutes
as well alright so like I said Python
Django is high-level compared to a
low-level flame framework like flask
which is also a very popular Python
framework now with flask you're free to
do things on your own in your own way
one flask application can look
completely different from another in
terms of the you know the folder
structure and all that type of thing
even if the functionality is very
similar well with Django there's certain
ways to do things the Django way it's
very opinionated similar to Ruby on
Rails if you've ever worked with that
framework which is a great framework now
you may even you may think that having
more freedom is better and that may be
true in some cases for some developers
and some applications but for the most
part Django is going to have you do
things that in the best way possible the
best and the easiest way possible and
not let you screw yourself up so with
that said Django is a great framework
for beginners in my opinion so what are
some of the advantages to using the
Django framework as I said it was
created for rapid development so it's
great to get something up and running
very quickly you can create an entire
back-end administration system for your
models and minutes and then every model
you create it's very simple to add to
that back-end Django is full-featured
and fully loaded
it has a ton of functionality in its
core like user authentication
administration RSS feed sitemaps we're
not going to get into all that this is
kind of just a basic overview but that
stuff you know it is included and it is
a pretty put together framework now for
the size and the feature set of Jango it
performs very well it's secure and it
protects you from things like SQL
injection cross-site scripting attacks
and cross-site forgery things like that
Django is also very scalable it can
handle lots of traffic in the next slide
we're gonna look at some of the sites
that that do use Django or have use
Django in the past it's also very
versatile it can be used to build all
kinds of diverse applications from
social networks and content management
systems to things like scientific
computing platforms and of course it
runs on Python which is a very powerful
and versatile language itself so these
are some of the sites some of the names
that use Django or have used Django in
their sites or part of their sites and
applications now when any huge name uses
a framework it's usually highly
customized sometimes beyond recognition
but all they all run Django at their
core okay so they just modify it to
their needs so sites like discuss
Instagram Pinterest these are all a plus
companies and web sites even NASA uses
Django in their stack which shows you
how secure it can be all right so it's
extremely powerful even for you know
services and in sites like this okay so
let's talk about design patterns now I'm
sure many of you have heard of MVC or
model for your controller it's a very
popular design pattern that separates
parts of your app and puts the handling
of you know incoming requests and
routing things like that into the
controller the data access into the
model and the user interface component
into the view well Django is sometimes
referred to as an MVC framework and
that's not completely wrong it is
heavily influenced by MVC and it does
use many MVC concepts
however the sea or the controller is
mostly handled by the framework itself
and it works a little different so it's
put into the mtv or model template view
pattern okay which word works a little
different basically it's you know just
like MVC that it has a data access layer
in the model anything to do with
interacting relating data validating
data that's all gonna go into the model
the template is the presentation layer
so all presentation related decisions go
here you know how things should be
displayed on the webpage or whatever
type of document and then the view is
basically the lot the basic logic layer
okay it can access the model directly
and displays the appropriate template so
the view works kind of like a view
controller and that's basically a bridge
between the models and templates okay a
lot of what a traditional controller
would do an MVC is handle actually
handled in the view okay so that's the
biggest difference between how Django
works and then traditional MVC like
let's say Ruby on Rails all right
another unique thing about Django is
that it uses the concept of apps now
usually you think of an entire project
as an app but within django a single
project or website can actually include
multiple of what they call apps so you
could have for example a blog app a
client app to handle your client
functions a store app and so on now of
course you can have a single app in your
website that you know if it's a blog or
and that's basically what we'll be doing
you can do that that's just fine you can
also move apps from one project to
another pretty easily and you can even
use other people's apps pretty easily so
this whole paradigm is very flexible and
very scalable and reusable all right so
the last thing before we get started I
want to talk about is Python has
something called virtual end for virtual
environments which gives you a virtual
environment for all of your PI Python
instances and this is this is what's
recommended to use with Django it's
really easy to set up it gives you
isolated environments with their own
directories you know this is the
recommended way to develop django apps
it's not absolutely necessary but it is
definitely recommended now this used to
be very difficult to do on Windows but
it's much more simple now in fact you
know everything to do with Python as
much is much more simple on Windows so
if you are on Windows don't worry about
it I'll show you exactly how to do it
all right
so that's gonna be it for the slides
guys let's go ahead and jump in and
let's set up Python we're going to
install Python from scratch we're going
to setup Django with pip which is the
the package manager for Python we're
gonna set up our virtual environment and
then we're gonna build our simple blog
application alright so let's get into it
alright so the very first thing that
we're gonna do is install Python now at
this time the latest version is for
Python 3 is version 3 point 6 point 3
and it's depending on when you're
watching this it may be a later version
but you should be alright alright so
we're gonna go to python or i'm gonna go
ahead and download it and save it and
just open it when done and it's just
gonna be a simple windows installer and
like I said you know installing Python
on Mac or Linux is gonna be a little
different so just you know it's all over
the web just those tutorials there's all
kinds of stuff if you want to watch my
to do app video that'll show you how to
get everything set up on a bun too
although I think we use Python 2.7 in
that video if I remember correctly but
let's go ahead and click run and we're
gonna install let's see I'm going to
make sure that you click Add Python 3.6
to your path so that you can run the
Python command let's see we're gonna say
customize installation I just want to
make sure that we have everything we
need now pip which I said is the package
manager for python it's kind of like NPM
for nodejs in JavaScript or it's kind of
like gem ruby gems for Ruby on Rails
you definitely want this included now
this is something that that has been
made much easier because before you had
to install it separately when you're
using Windows so now it's included with
this Installer which makes things much
easier so let's go ahead and click Next
and it's going to install it in this
directory here that's fine let me just
check this stuff yeah that should be
good so we'll click install and it's
gonna get python set up on our system
alright so that should be set up let's
go ahead and click close and now we
should have Python installed now as I
told you guys before I'm gonna be using
MySQL so if you're on Windows what I
would suggest doing is installing xampp
or actually if you're on Windows or Mac
or Linux it's actually a completely
cross-platform but this includes MySQL
Apache PHP it also includes a tool
called PHP myadmin
where you can you know manage your MySQL
databases and look at your tables and
all that now django uses database
migrations so we can actually do
everything through our application
rather than going into mysql itself but
PHP myadmin is really good to actually
see the stuff that happened that the
migrations did the tables that created
and all that so we will be using it for
that so if you want to follow along you
know exactly then go ahead and get xampp
installed
alright so let's close that up and let's
open up a command line so I'm going to
open up my standard Windows command line
as administrator now if you're on Mac or
Linux just open up your terminal and
usually if you guys have watched my
videos in the past I usually use git
bash on Windows instead of the standard
command line but I've had some issues
with Python and Django and the virtual
environment using git bash so we're
gonna use this so what I'm gonna do is
first of all just make sure that Python
is installed correctly so it's a Python
version alright we'll also check on pip
which is the Python package manager
good and we need to install the virtual
environment okay so we need to install
something called virtual environment
wrapper now for that we use pip so we'll
say pip install virtual env wrapper okay
now if you're on Mac or Linux you can do
that but if you're on Windows you just
want to do - win okay now it says it's
already satisfied because I already have
it installed yours may look a little
different but it should say it's
installed successfully all right now
once you do that you can create virtual
environments now before I do that I'm
going to just go into where I want to
create my project so I'm gonna CD dot
dot into my C Drive and then I'm gonna
go to users slash Brad slash projects
oops
slash projects and it's clear this and
then from here we're going to make a
virtual environment we can do that with
MK virtual env and then name it I'm
going to call it PI one alright and what
it's going to do is it's going to create
a directory in your users folder called
env s so you can see right here
Ian vs / PI one this isn't where we
actually create our project or anything
this is just where the environment files
go all right and now you can see right
here we're using PI 1 now if you have
multiple environments and you want to
switch you just do work on and then the
name of the environment so work on PI 1
alright so now we're ready to actually
install Jango so let's say pip install
Jango alright and that's going to
basically install it globally and it
might take a minute
all right so now Django is installed I'm
just gonna clear this out and we're
going to basically generate an
application and we can do that with a
utility called Django - admin ok and
we're gonna run a command called start
project and then we're gonna name the
project I'm just gonna call it Django
project ok so now if I were to do a dir
or LS or whatever and just to see what
we have here you'll see there's a folder
called Django project so I'm going to CD
into Django project alright and then we
want to open up our text editor here so
I'm using Visual Studio code so I'm able
to just do code dot and that'll open it
up in that folder alright so let's see
what that actually gave us creating our
Django app so we have another folder
called Django project which has a couple
files and in addition to that folder we
have a managed PI file alright right
here I'm getting a warning or info
saying the python extension is
recommended if you're using vs code so I
would also recommend that so if you want
to go to extensions right here and
search for Python it's this first one
right here we'll just click install and
that just gives us like some you know
intellisense and hinting and stuff like
that and then we can just hit reload and
now we have the python extension
installed alright so anyway the the
managed PI is the the CLI client or the
this the command-line interface tool
that we use to do different things and
it's basically a wrapper of Django admin
ok remember we use that Django admin to
create our application manage dot PI
basically is the same thing except it's
localized to this specific project so we
use it to do things like run migrations
run the cert the dev server things like
that ok and the actual file the code
here we don't need to do anything with
it's just the utility that we're going
to use within the command line all right
now in Django project we have a couple
files this double underscore init double
underscore PI now this is complaining
about pile inter not installed I guess
no I don't want that let's say disabled
all right so this file is empty by
default and we're going to keep it empty
this is required just to be here to
treat the directory as containing
packages by default it's empty and
that's fine like I said we're gonna keep
it empty but just having it here gets
rid of some confusion that has to do
with file names and modules and things
like that
all right so nothing that we need to
deal with settings dot PI has all of our
settings and I'm not going to go through
everything here basically you can see
that our base directory secret key this
is your production key you don't want to
share this if you push your code to
github you don't want this included this
this is for things like encrypting
sessions things like that all right we
also have the debug value set to true
which is what we want for now in
development that's going to give us you
know helpful messages things like that
before you deploy you're going to want
to set that to false you're also going
to want to include your domain names
that you want to use for this
application when you deploy in this
allowed host array down here installed
apps any application or any app you
create you need to add to this array
here and you can see there's some core
apps that are that are included
including the admin app Django comes
with an entire admin administration area
which is an application itself or I
should say app that's what they're
called in Django and in Django
but that's included authentication
sessions all that stuff is already here
ok
middleware basically are these are
components responsible for doing
something for instance authentication we
have our auth middleware that is
actually dependent on the session
middleware which is right here so the
order of middleware is very important
okay and you can also write your own
custom middleware but that's way beyond
this tutorial alright and then we have
our templates options for templates
that's pretty much it Oh database so
right now we're set up to use SQLite 3
which is not a really great database for
production applications like I said
we're using we're gonna be using MySQL
so we're gonna be changing this up quite
a bit okay so that's the settings file
URLs dot pi this is basically routing
setting up our routes and URLs and they
basically use regular expressions here
for the URL patterns you can see there's
already one set for the admin area so
basically this means the this caret
symbol here means start with so it's
gonna look at routes that start with
admin slash and then that's gonna go to
the admin app itself okay it's each app
will have its own URLs file and this is
basically just saying anything that's
admins slash is gonna go on to this URLs
file and you'll see this later on it'll
make more sense when we create our posts
AB alright and then WSGI is the primary
development platform for a Django it's
it's basically the common standard for
web servers web servers and applications
when we ran that start project it set up
a simple default WSGI configuration for
us and that's basically what that is all
right so that's you can see this the
file structure by default is very very
simple so what i want to do now is
actually run our web server so let's go
back to our command line here and let's
run python and then we're going to use
our manage pi okay which is our command
line tool and then we're going to use
run server ok that's the command we want
to use and then what that's going to do
is it's going to run the server on port
on our localhost on port 8000 so we can
actually now go to our browser and we
can go to localhost
ports or : 8000 and there we go so it
says it worked
you can congratulations on your first
Django powered webpage
alright so now our server is running now
notice this message we get you have 13
unapplied migrations so if you're not
familiar with migrations basically
they're files that will do things to our
database so they'll create tables
they'll add data things like that and if
you're familiar with Ruby on Rails or
laravel or a bunch of other frameworks
that use migrations they work in you
know very similar so unapplied
migrations means that there's basically
migrations waiting and those are those
have to do with the admin app that's
that's included by default
authentication users things like that
they haven't been applied which means
they have they we haven't created them
in our database yet now we could apply
them by running this command here Python
managed PI managed up PI migrated but if
we did that now it would go into the
SQLite database which is not what I want
to use I want to use MySQL so we're not
gonna run that just yet we're going to
hook up MySQL alright now in order to do
that we need to install the MySQL client
for django hartford python so let's go
let's do control c to get out of this
and we're gonna install it with pip so
we'll say pip install and it's called
MySQL client ok so now that we have that
installed excuse me I'm losing my voice
now that we have that installed let's go
ahead and go to our Django project
settings file and go to where our
database thing is right here our
database object our dictionary and I'm
actually gonna comment this one out and
then create a new one alright so we'll
say databases equals some curly braces
and we want to say default
okay so default and this is gonna be
engine alright so engine is gonna be
Django dot DB dot backends dot MySQL
okay just like up here they had SQLite
three we're gonna use MySQL alright then
we're gonna say put a comma there and
we're gonna say name so name is gonna
that's actually the database name now we
haven't created it yet so what I'm gonna
do is go to localhost / PHP myadmin
which is a tool included with xampp to
you know create databases and stuff now
you can use your standard SQL shell if
you want but this is an easier way so
let's click on databases and let's
create one we'll call it Django project
and create okay so now we have that
database created now we're not gonna
have to go through and create our tables
and all that that stuff is all done
through migrations which is nice we just
needed to create the database itself so
for the name it's gonna be Django
project alright then you're gonna want
to put your database user which for me
is gonna be route and you're gonna want
to put your password which for me is one
through six and then your host ok host
is going to be localhost 99.9% of the
time and you can also define port but
we're gonna leave that blank all right
so that's our database so let's save it
and now everything should be set up so
that we can run our migration and all
those default those thirteen default
migrations should now go into this
database if we're lucky if things worked
out right so let's go back to our
command line clear this out and let's
run Python managed PI and we want to do
migrate all right so everything looks ok
here let's go over to PHP myadmin and
reload the database and you can see all
of this stuff was added alright so we
have our off user table this is going to
contain our users we can have different
groups ok different user groups all our
migrations all our session stuff it all
gets put in in the database and it's all
we have tables for all that stuff so you
can see how how easy it is to get this
stuff set up ok now if we start our
server back up so let's say python
managed dot pi run server and you can
see that that message about the 13
migrations is now gone and we reload
it's going to work and we should now be
able to go to slash admin and we have a
back-end interface ok an admin interface
now right now there's no user for us to
log in as so we can actually use manage
pi to create a super user so that we can
log in here so let's stop the server
with ctrl C
clear and we're gonna do Python managed
dot PI and then we want to run create
super user I spell that right create
super user space and then - - username
equals and then whatever you want the
name to be I'm going to use Brad and you
also want to put your email so - - email
and I'm gonna set that to Brad at
gmail.com alright so we're gonna go
ahead and run that and then it's gonna
ask us for a password okay so I'm gonna
do I think it has to be 8 characters so
I'm gonna do 1 through 8 again oh it's
too common ok so there's some rules it
can't be all numeric so let's see I'll
do ABC one two three double exclamation
ok so now we have a password so let's go
back to our well first we have to run
the server again so let's do run server
let's reload the admin page and now
we'll log in with Brad ABC one two three
double exclamation login and there we go
so we have an entire back-end
admin area and we can add groups ok we
can add user groups here we can add more
users if we want
okay so username password password
confirmation if we look at the users
you'll see the Brad user we have which
has staff status so there's a lot of
functionality in a very very small
amount of code I mean we really haven't
even written any code all we did was
change up some configurations and we
already have all of this functionality
alright so you can see that Django has
is definitely for rapid development all
right so right now we don't have any
apps ok remember the concept of apps and
we want this to be a blog so we need to
create a blog
gap or a post app is actually what I'm
going to call it so I'm gonna stop the
server here actually it's logout of the
admin and let's ctrl C and stop the
server clear this up and we're going to
create a post app okay so we can do that
using manage pies so we're gonna say
Python manage dot pie and we're gonna
say start app and we're gonna call this
posts okay now if we look over in our
folder structure we now have a post
folder close that up
we have a post folder and it has a bunch
of files it has the init dot pi which
we're just gonna leave that's gonna be
blank it has an admin dot PI which has
to do with adding models to your
interface here so for instance we're
gonna want to be able to add posts from
the admin area we're gonna get into that
later apps dot PI we're not really gonna
mess with it's basically app specific
settings models is where we create our
models so we will have a post model
tests for testing which we're not going
to get into and then views is basically
it's it's basically our controller this
is where we create like our index our
details method which is going to we can
interact with the model we can pull our
pose in and then we can load templates
or load views from here as well so
you'll see all how all of that works all
right now before we can actually use our
post app that we just created we have to
go to our Django project settings dot PI
and add it as an app all right so up
here we have installed apps I'm gonna
put it right as the first one and we're
just gonna put in posts okay and put a
comma here okay that has to be done now
what we want to do is go to the URLs pi
that's in the Django project and we
basically want to say we want to put
another one of these just like admin
goes to the admin app we want anything
that goes from posts to go to our
application
now to include our application we can
use the include method and we can say
posts dot URLs
okay now this include method or function
right here this is this isn't gonna work
by default we're gonna get an error
because we need to import this okay just
like we imported URL to use that we need
to import include so we're gonna put a
comma here and say include alright and
we can actually get rid of all these
comments here we don't need this alright
so basically what's going on is anything
that goes to slash posts in our
application so slash pose slash is gonna
then get passed on to the URLs file
inside of our post app which is not
there yet you can see there isn't a URLs
file we actually have to create that
ourselves alright so hopefully that
makes sense so let's save this alright
and let's go to our post app or post
folder that we have here and create a
new file called URLs dot pi okay now
just like the other URLs file we need to
import a couple things so we're gonna
say from Django dot conf URLs we want to
import URL and include ok actually I
don't think we need include here just
URL and then we're also going to want to
import our views okay so we're gonna say
from dot meaning from all we want to
import views okay now we want to create
a URL patterns array oops
so URL patterns and you can see if we
look at the other URLs file we're doing
the same thing okay so in here
what I want to do is I want to load a an
index method in the views file so we're
gonna say URL I'm sure you don't you
might see me use semicolons in Python we
don't use semicolons but I'm at my core
I'm a JavaScript developer and a PHP
developer so you may see me mess up and
put a semicolon in here and there all
right so we're gonna say R so basically
route and we want a route for just slash
posts okay not post slash you know
something just posts
so the expression here is gonna be caret
which is gonna it means start with and
then money sign which is end with okay
so basically start with and end with
nothing so post slash nothing that's
what this what this means and I know
that may be a little confusing all right
and then what we want to do is put in a
second parameter here and we're gonna
save views dot index so it's gonna look
in our views dot Pi file right here for
a method called index okay and it's
gonna load that and then we also just
want to give this a name so we're gonna
say name equals index like that alright
so that's our first URL pattern or our
first route so let's save that and then
we're gonna go into our views dot Pi
file and from here we want to create
that index view our in index method so
in Python to create a function or a
method you use the DEF keyword so define
index whoops define index now this is
going to take in a request okay
all our routes will take in a request
and then we'll put a colon here so that
defines a function and then in here what
we'll do is we're gonna say return I
just want to basically
returned a response okay now ultimately
we're gonna want to render a template
but just to test things out I just want
to send the response to the browser so
we want to bring in something here from
Django dot HTTP we want to import HTTP
response okay and this is what we what
we use to create a restful api so I'm
going to say return HTTP response and
then in here I'm just gonna put some
text I'm gonna say hello from posts all
right just like that so let's save this
and now hopefully what will happen is we
can go to slash posts and we'll see this
in the browser
okay so we'll probably have to restart
the server you know let's go ahead and
run our server so we want to do or is it
managed up Python managed up I run
server okay so now the server's running
so let's go to slash posts and there we
go hello from posts okay so we're not
loading any views or anything like that
all we're doing is sending out a
response with some text all right just
to show you how the URLs work how you
know how these all connect together so
just to reiterate I know that this this
may be a little repetitive if you guys
already understand but the main URLs
file is saying anything that has post
starts with post slash is going to be
basically passed off to the URLs file in
the post app which is this file okay and
then we're saying for the route that is
nothing so post slash nothing is going
to load the index method from the views
file
okay we're also naming this index and
then if we look in the views file we now
have our index method okay and then
we're just basically sending out a
response with some text okay that's
exactly what's happening now obviously
we're gonna want to render
a template so what we're gonna do is
let's just comment this out because
we're not doing that anymore what we're
gonna do instead of returning HTTP
response is we're gonna return render
okay that's what's used to render
templates and that's already being
brought in up here by default so we'll
say render and then we want to pass in
our request and then we want to specify
the template that we want to load okay
so I'm gonna say posts slash index dot
HTML and I know we haven't created that
yet don't worry about it okay so let's
save that now if we try to load this
we're gonna get an error that says
template does not exist so what we're
gonna do is inside of our posts folder
we're gonna create a folder called
templates and then inside here we're
going to create a folder called posts
now I know this looks a little weird
because it's posts templates posts but
if we just put our templates inside our
HTML files inside the templates it's
going to get confused with other apps in
their templates so you want to specify
the name of the app here as well so
let's create a file called index.html
okay and then all I'm gonna do here is
put in an h1 and say hello from index
dot HTML and we'll save that and then
let's go and reload let's see that
didn't work posts index.html so we're
loading that here let's see what am I
missing
might have to restart the server what do
we got here
turtle server power pose you know what
let's uh let's restart this and run the
server again and reload there we go so
we just had to restart the server and
you can see that it's loading the
index.html file it's also parsing the
HTML we have an h1 alright good now
we're gonna want to have you know our
head and body tags and all that in our
HTML and we're not gonna want to include
that in every single file so we're gonna
have to create a layout alright so what
we're gonna do is in our templates post
folder let's create a new file called
layout dot HTML alright and in here
we're gonna put our basic you know HTML
tags I'm just using Emmet so I did
exclamation tab and it gives us this
basic structure so for the title I'm
just gonna say Django actually we'll
call it traverse e-media
blog okay so we'll give it a title and I
also want to include materialise CSS
which is a CSS framework so if we go to
get started all we need to do is include
the CSS link right here and then the
JavaScript link so we're gonna paste
this in the head right here and let's
see actually we don't even need the
JavaScript link because we're not doing
anything to do with their JavaScript so
just the CSS link now we're gonna want
to do let's close that up now what we're
gonna want to do is go to the body and
let's put in a header ok so this is
gonna be a very very simple layout my
point of the point of this is not to
create like an awesome-looking app it's
just to get you to understand Django but
then again I don't want it to look
absolutely horrendous
so we're gonna give this a class of
container and the class of center -
line all right and then here we'll put
an h1 and we'll say I will say
traversÃ©e media blog I guess doesn't
really matter you guys can put whatever
you want
alright and then let's see so that I
want to show on every template now
obviously each template you create is
going to be different you're gonna want
different content so for that we need to
put in first of all a container we're
gonna wrap it a wrap everything in a
container to move it into the middle and
then we want to put some syntax here
this is actually Jinja by default we're
using Jinja templating which is a
template engine like you know blade or
underscore or any of those types of
template engines and we're gonna say
block content all right and then we just
want to go right under it and we're
gonna put in this is just the syntax the
percent signs so here we're gonna say
end block yeah and block alright so any
other views we create or any other
templates such as index.html this is
where it's going to output but all this
stuff is gonna be on every page alright
so let's go ahead and save that let's go
back to index.html and then we want to
make sure we extend that layout okay I'm
actually going to keep that h1 there but
let's go up top here and let's say
extends and then we want to extend from
posts okay so we have it in the post
folder slash layout dot HTML and then
whatever we want to output in this block
content we have to wrap that in block
content so right here whoops so we want
to put our percent our curly brace in
percent and we're gonna say block
content and then go underneath
and say n block all right so now let's
save that and reload and now we have our
disgusting-looking header and our h1 all
right I actually want to change this to
an h3 and let's say I don't know we'll
just say posts for now or let's say
latest posts we'll also give this a
let's give this h3 a couple classes that
have to do with materialized so let's
Center it so we'll say Center align and
we can also change the color of the
background
so we'll say red and then I'm gonna say
lighten - 3 so that'll give us like a
light red so we'll save that reload and
there we go alright so that looks a
little better now we can pass dynamic
data into our views okay or into our
template so if we go to views dot PI
right and we go and add another
parameter here after the the template
name we can put in a dictionary
or an object and we can specify like
let's say title actually should be title
and we'll say latest oops latest posts
alright so we'll do that and then we'll
go back into index.html we'll replace
this hard-coded latest posts with double
curly braces and title and let's save
and reload and you can see we still get
latest posts and if I were to just just
to make sure that it's coming from here
we'll say latest post one and reload and
we get latest post one okay so this is
how we insert like our blog posts what
we'll do is we'll create a model
we'll get the data from the model and
then we'll pass it into the view like
this okay all right so let's actually do
that let's create our PO
model so just to clean things up I'm
gonna close all this stuff and we're
gonna open up inside our our post folder
we can close the Django project inside
post so we're gonna go to models dot pie
alright so in models dot pie we're not
gonna do too much here it's gonna be
pretty easy we're gonna create a class
called posts okay and inside here we
want to pass in see how we're bringing
in models right here we want to pass in
models dot model okay we're going to put
a colon and then go down here and put in
the fields that we want so we want a
title so we're gonna set that to models
dot and then there's different types of
fields we want a character field so it's
actually char field okay and then we can
put in here a max length if we want so
let's say max underscore max length and
we'll set that equal to 200 okay and
then let's set a body so we'll set that
to models dot and let's make this a text
field which is a is more characters than
a character field okay and then let's
also do a created at okay we're gonna
set that to models models dot date/time
field and I want to set a default for
that so we can say default equals now I
want to use the date/time module we have
to import that if we want to use it so
we're gonna say from date/time import
date time and then here in the default
you know what let me just make this
bigger so default equals date time which
has a method called now alright so we're
gonna say our property called now so
date time now and we're gonna set blank
equal to true okay
so let's actually yeah let's let's save
that so you can see not too much code
there and then we'll switch over to our
command line stop the server and then
what we need to do is create a migration
based off of this model because we're
gonna want to create a table in our
database that's going to hold post so
it's going to hold a title body and
created at fields so to do that we need
to use Python Python managed dot pi and
we want to run the command called make
migrations so make migrations and then
the model name which is posts ok so
let's run that so what that did is it
created a migrations file you can see
right here it's the 0 0 0 1 initial dot
PI all right now that just created the
file if we go over here you can see it
right here and if we look at it it'll
show you the different all the different
fields that it's going to create and
stuff now it didn't create the database
table yet just the file so to actually
run it and create the database table I'm
sorry table we need to say Python
managed dot PI my grades okay so it
looks like it went okay but let's go and
check so we'll go to PHP myadmin reload
and we should have right here posts
underscore posts if we look at that we
look at the structure we see ID which is
our auto
increment primarykey title body and
created that so the fields that we added
to our model in this okay so you can see
how migrations are really nice because
we don't have to go into the database
ourselves and create these fields like
we would with some other you know a lot
of different PHP frameworks not laravel
laravel is awesome with migrations but
something like codeigniter or something
like that we would have to create the
fields ourselves all right now if we go
to our admin area in fact I'm gonna add
an admin link on the layout HTML file so
let's go here and right under the end
block we'll put a line break and then
we'll put an a tag and we'll say admin
login ok that's gonna go to let's uh
let's make that go to slash admin and
then I'm just gonna add a class here of
center-aligned and let's check that out
oops all we need to run our server
that's right see run server where is it
ok so you have admin login now it's
actually not in the center because it's
displayed in line so I'm gonna just take
the short short route here and just put
a style and what display is block like I
said it's not about it's just about
teaching you guys Django I don't care
about style or anything like that all
right so we have our admin login link so
let's click that let's login with our
user we created so let's see it was what
was it ABC one two three exclamation all
right so we logged in now this doesn't
look any different okay we're not seeing
our posts we can't create posts yet so
the way that we can fix that is by going
to our posts folder
and going to admin dot pi and see how it
says register your models here this is
where we need to do this so first off we
need to bring in our models so we're
gonna say from dot models import posts
okay and then all we need to do is say
admin dot site dot register and in here
put in posts let's save that let's go
back to our admin and reload now you can
see that we have our posts here now we
can actually add posts from the admin
panel now which is great but this right
here is post with two S's at the end
that's because we use plural a plural
name for a model and it automatically is
adding on an S here so this is actually
a really easy fix all we have to do is
go to our models file and we're gonna go
right here and we're gonna say class
meta and from here we can add different
meta values so we want it we want to say
verbose underscore name underscore
plural and we can define what we want a
plural name for this model to be which I
want to be posts okay one s so if we
save that and we go back and reload now
it's just 1s alright so if we click on
this now you see zero posts let's go
ahead and click add posts and we now
should have complete crud functionality
for our posts let's say post one this is
our first post you can choose a date and
a time and save and there it is okay now
notice how it says post object that's
not very helpful I'll show you how to
change that in a minute
so if we say post - this is post to save
again post object so to fix this we want
to go back to our models and we want to
go right here and we're gonna say define
double underscore STR double underscore
we want to pass in self and then this is
where we can define what we want to show
in that area okay we want the title so
we can just say return self dot title
and save and then we'll go back and
reload and now we get post one in post
two and just to make sure that we can
update these let's say this is post two
updated and save ok so successfully
changed so all this stuff is taken care
of for you that the flash message is
everything
just imagine doing this with you know
nodejs and express and I love Express
it's it's my favorite framework but I'm
just saying Django has some real perks
to it when it comes to rapid development
so yeah so that updated good now the
last thing I want to do is we're almost
up I wanted this to be about an hour I
want to save you site we want to show
the blog post but let's take care of
this first so right now if we go to our
root it's page not found okay we have to
actually I have to go to slash posts to
see our blog now what you could do is
create a whole new app for your site
like our pages or something like that
and have a home page but what I want to
do is just make the root of the site go
to the post page or to the blog so I'm
gonna go to the main URLs file which is
in Django project URLs dot pie and we're
gonna go to the top here it's a URL and
actually I'm just gonna copy this right
here understand instead of posts we're
gonna do start and then end ok so
basically that this is the root URL and
we want that to go to the post URLs so
let's save that and now if we go just to
our root URL and reload it's going to lo
blog page all right so now let's take
care of showing our pose here so we're
gonna go to our view dot PI file it's in
the post folder okay and we're gonna
want to go let's see let's go right here
and we're gonna want to basically just
bring in the posts from the model okay
so to do that we're gonna just create a
variable called posts and we're gonna
set it equal to capital P posts so the
post model which we actually have to
bring in so up here I'm going to say
from models imports posts alright and
then we're gonna say post on objects dot
all ok we want to get all posts and then
we can specify a number of posts that we
want and I'm gonna specify : 10 okay so
we'll get the first ten posts I'm not
gonna get into pagination and stuff like
that this is just a you know this is a
crash course for the basics now we need
to take this post object and pass it in
to our template okay and we could just
add it here but what a better cleaner
way to do is to create a variable you
could call it like data but oftentimes
you'll see it called context and then
we'll set that to an object and we'll
take our title put that there and then
we'll say posts and we'll set it to that
post variable and then we'll simply pass
in here instead of the the object or the
the dictionary itself will pass in
context all right so let's save that now
our view should now be getting these
posts that come from the model so what
we have to do is go into our index page
ok our index.html which is the viewer
loading and we need to loop through the
posts okay
so I'm gonna put a ul right here with
the class of collection which is a
materialized CSS class and then in Jinja
to do a loop we're just going to put our
standard curly brace % syntax and we can
say for post in posts all right and then
when we want to end it we just say end
for and inside here what we'll do inside
here will have an Li with the class of
collection item which again is part of
materialized and then we can put our
double curly braces and say post dot
title all right so let's save that and
let's go back to our application and
reload and there we go post one and post
two now we're gonna want these to link
to details pages so I'm gonna wrap this
in an a tag okay we want this to be
wrapped around the title and the link
here is gonna go to slash posts slash
details slash and then the ID which we
can get by saying post ID like that okay
so if we save that preload okay now if I
click that it's gonna say page not found
because we haven't created this URL
pattern and we haven't created this
route but you can see it's going to the
ID of one this one has the idea of two
and so on so let's go ahead and go back
into our URLs file of for the posts so
it's a post URL spy and we're gonna see
I guess I guess we could just copy this
and this time instead of you know
starting and ending with nothing we want
this to start with details slash now we
don't want to just go to post slash
details
because we need to get the ID from the
URL so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna open up a set of parentheses and
we're gonna put a question mark P which
represents the parameter and it's going
to be whoops it's going to be the ID
parameter and we want this to be a
number so we're going to use an
expression here we're gonna use /d which
means that it should be a digit and then
the plus sign which means that it should
be at one at least one or more digits
okay and then we're just going to say
slash money sign money sign representing
the end okay
now this is going to go I'm sorry this
should go outside of the parentheses so
it should be
yeah slash money sign like that all
right and then the the view is gonna be
called details so views dot details and
then for name I guess we'll say details
all right so let's save that let's go to
our views file and under the index we're
gonna create def details
okay so that'll take requests and also
in addition to requests it's also going
to take in that ID parameter alright so
we'll be able to access the ID so we
want to fetch a single post now so we'll
create a variable called post from the
post model we're gonna say objects
instead of all we're gonna say dot get
okay and we want to say we want to get
where the ID is equal to the ID that's
passed in here that's coming from the
URL okay and then for the context I'm
going to set the context and we'll set
post to the variable post and then we
simply want to load our template just
like we did here I'll just copy this
instead of index we want to load
details okay which we haven't created
yet so let's save that let's go to our
templates post and create a new file
called details dot HTML all right and
then let's see in here we're gonna have
to extend everything so I'm just gonna
copy from the index.html and then just
clear out actually we'll leave this
we'll just change this to post dot title
now the reason I'm using post dot title
is because we're passing in post which
is this right here okay and we're at we
want to access whoops not that right
there it's coming from here which is
coming from the database and we want to
grab the title alright so we want the
title and then let's see we're not gonna
want a ul here so we can get rid of that
what I'm gonna do is put in a card class
and we'll say card content this is all
just materialized and then we'll put in
the body we can access that with post
body all right and then under the
content we're gonna say card - action
which is just another pot of
materialized part of the card component
and we're gonna put in post dot created
at which is the date okay and then we'll
just put a button down at the bottom to
go back alright so this will go to slash
posts I'll say go back and let's give it
a class of BTN which is a materialized
class alright so let's go ahead and
reload let's click post one there we go
this is our first post we have our date
we have our back button post two and
there we go and we have our admin login
so if we wanted to update a post say
hello world
and save if we go back to our front end
will save you site and there it is hello
world alright guys so I know that
towards the end this got kind of rushed
maybe it might might have seemed but I
just wanted to cram as much as I could
and just get something up and running
for you again this is for beginners this
is for people that are just getting into
Django so there's there's a lot of other
ways to do things and of course you can
have you know people add pose from your
front end you can create a front end
authentication system there's there's so
much more you can do but again this is
just a very generalized crash course so
