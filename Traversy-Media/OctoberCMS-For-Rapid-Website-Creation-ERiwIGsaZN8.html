was asked by one of my patrons about a
suggestion for a content management
system CMS aside from WordPress or
Drupal something that was was much
lighter and one thing that came to mind
was October CMS which is actually built
on the laravel PHP framework so the
reason that I suggested this is because
it's very friendly to developers and
clients so if you log into the admin
area you have four each for your pages
you can create pages you can create
partials and you can use the text editor
in the backend which even includes Emmet
it also uses the twig template engine
which can be accessed from the admin
area so you don't really have to go back
and forth from your code to your admin
area like you do in something like
WordPress and I think that's really
valuable and then at the same time your
clients also have access to their
content where if they want to edit their
about page or something like that they
can do that it also has its own set of
plugins I mean it's definitely not as
extensive as WordPress and their plug-in
repository not even close it's a much
smaller CMS a much smaller ecosystem but
I want to take a look at that today and
just put together a simple site that
uses bootstrap on the front end we'll
create a couple pages I'm going to show
you how to set up a blogging plugin as
well and also a contact form plug-in now
I'm using my localhost I'm using xampp
so I'm not gonna set up the mail server
and stuff like that so the contact form
won't actually send an email but I will
show you how to set that up
alright so that's what we'll be doing in
this video guys let's go ahead and get
started
hey guys if you've been watching my
videos for a while and you really like
what I do when I've helped you out a lot
consider becoming a patron even for one
dollar per month it pushes me to keep
bringing you guys the best content I
possibly can there's reward tiers for
discounts for you to me courses personal
support and more so check out the
patreon link in the description below
for more info all right so before we get
started one
want to address is developers that
mostly developers that are straight out
of boot camp or are straight out of you
know getting their degree haven't really
worked in the real world yet saying why
don't you just build it from the ground
up you know why use October why use open
source software just build your own and
and use that well I can tell you from
dealing with real-world clients that a
lot of them are very very cheap they're
also very impatient they want things
done fast and that's where tools like
October CMS and WordPress come in and
that's why they're used so much that's
why WordPress is you know it takes up
like I don't know thirty percent of the
websites on the internet or something
like that because it's very practical
and I'm not talking from a standpoint of
you know working with a team for a big
company where other big companies are
paying you a lot of money to build
custom applications I'm talking about
you know having a small web dev company
with with you know a couple people and
you have clients from down the street
paying you to build them small apps or
websites or whatever that's where these
tools are very very valuable and we all
know those those developers that are
straight out of boot camp that would say
I would never use this I'm not gonna use
open source software I'm gonna build it
from the ground up they're not thinking
of practicality and they're not thinking
of dealing with clients in the real
world so enough with the rant let's go
ahead and get started now October CMS is
built on laravel which is a PHP
framework so obviously you need PHP to
run it so what I would suggest doing is
installing xampp or zamp however you
want to pronounce it and it has an
Apache server MySQL and PHP we're also
gonna be using MySQL it's cross-platform
so you can install it for Windows Linux
or Mac I'm not going to go through the
installation it's very easy to setup if
you need help
the second video of my PHP front-to-back
series will show you how to install it
alright so once you do install it you
can either go into your SQL shell or you
can do a much easier solution to create
your database and that is go to local
host PHP myadmin okay and all we have to
do is click on databases and create our
database I'm gonna call it traversing
media and click create and that's all we
have to do we don't have to create any
tables or anything it does all that for
us during the installation it has an
installation process that's very very
similar to WordPress so now we're gonna
download the Installer so I'm just gonna
click download installer and you have to
hold it quite a few times because I've
done this video quite a few times so
we're gonna go ahead and open this zip
file up and see what we got so we have a
folder called install master and inside
there we have an install dot PHP file
that's the installation script and then
we have all the other files in this
folder so we need to upload this to our
server which I'm using xampp so that's
gonna be in my C Drive I'm on Windows so
C Drive xampp htdocs and we're gonna
just go ahead and create a new folder
here I'm gonna call it traversing media
and we're gonna bring over the install
script and the folder we don't need to
get ignore or the readme alright so now
that we've done that we can go back to
our browser and we can go to localhost /
and then whatever you called the folder
I called mine traversing media and
actually we want to go to slash install
dot PHP alright so what it's gonna do
now is go through a system check I'm
just gonna make sure you have PHP
version seven or greater I probably
should have mentioned that before
also some extensions you need the curl
PHP extension PDO open SSL it's gonna
just make sure all that is enabled if
you have any red marks here then look it
for instance if you don't have the PDO
extension enabled go into your PHP dot
ini file and make sure you have that
enabled alright only I'm gonna go ahead
and click agree and continue
and now we're going to set up our
database so it actually uses multiple
database types if you want to use
postgrads SQL Lite or SQL Server but
we're gonna stick to MySQL localhost is
is good this port is good database name
I called it traversing media
and you want to put your database
password I'm using my root user and I'm
gonna put my root users password and
then we'll click administrator and you
can change your admin name here if you
want write your first and last name and
then the admin login by default is admin
you can change it if you want and then
the password you want to use okay and
then we'll click continue and it's gonna
ask us here if we want to start from
scratch without any plugins or themes if
we want to start from a theme or if we
want to use a project ID okay there's
actually project full projects you can
clone on the October CMS website but
we're going to go ahead and start from a
theme and you're gonna get some choices
here some pretty nice-looking themes
what I'm going to do is use the blank
bootstrap for theme alright so I'm gonna
click install and confirm and it's going
to go through this process where it
downloads all the theme files and gets
them all set up for you alright guys so
that took about a minute or so
everything went okay so now it shows us
the website address and the admin
address which is slash back-end ok and
this is gonna be localhost / Travis
e-media in my case now one thing you
want to do is make sure you install he
will delete the install dot PHP file so
let's go ahead and go to our project
folder and just make sure we delete that
file ok now we're going to visit the
front-end of the website which looks
like this okay it's a bootstrap template
has a navbar it has a Jumbotron and has
this video that plays automatically and
and some excuse me then some features
down here some text and it also has an
author page okay which also has an
autoplay video so it just has two pages
by default now we're gonna go to the
back end which is gonna be just whatever
your URL is slash back end and you get
this really nice login form so let's use
the password that we chose and this is
the back end so it's very simple this is
just the dashboard not much to do here
it tells you if it's up-to-date or not
and
stuff like that your last sign-in but if
we click on CMS this is where most of
your work will be done we have your
pages so author and features we saw
those two pages on the front end if we
click on one of these you'll see we have
a title we have the URL which we can
easily choose we have the file name okay
which is an actual file that's in your
in your project folder and then down
here we have the markup okay and this
editor is really really nice it actually
uses Emmet so you can do things like h1
tab if you wanted to do like a div with
an ID of tests you could just do hash
test tab and that'll give you an ID you
can do like lorem 30 tab that'll give
you 30 words of lorem ipsum dummy text
so it's really really nice and then this
stuff here is part of the twig template
engine okay if you know twig this
probably looks familiar but it's similar
to you know blade which is the default
laravel template engine which i'm not
sure why they didn't use since this is
built on laravel but it's similar to
that it's similar to handlebars you know
all those template engines so these are
the pages we also have partials now
partials are kind of like components I
shouldn't call them components because
there are actual components as you can
see but they're like pieces of your site
so the jumbotron the navbar those are
partials and you can see the markup for
those here layouts so we have a default
layout and that wraps around everything
else whatever page we're viewing is
output right here and then we also have
our nav bar and our jumbotron partial
all right so what I want to do is create
a new page here so I'm gonna go to pages
and click add and we're gonna call this
home now the URL I actually want it to
be the index so I'm just gonna change
that to slash even though features
already uses that URL I'm going to
delete the features page okay - layout
we can also create multiple layouts if
we want we're going to use the default
which is the only one there and I'm just
going to put down here an h1 and we'll
say welcome and then we'll just put
we'll put a paragraph and we'll say
lorem 30 tab and we'll just put some
sample text all right so let's go ahead
and save that you can also create
metadata so meta title and description
if you want to do that but now what
we're gonna do is just delete the
features and author pages so we're gonna
just check those and click delete and
now we just have our home page all right
now I'm going to create another page
called a vote
we'll have that go to slash about we'll
choose the default template or layout
and then we'll put an h1 and say about
us and we'll just put some more sample
text will say LARM
50 tab and we'll go ahead and put
another paragraph as well okay and we'll
save that so now we have two pages now
if we go to the front end and we can do
that by clicking this this button right
here I've been open in a new tab you'll
see that the home page now has our
welcome on it ok whatever we put for the
home page now these links up here are
still here features an author to change
these we need to go into the partials
and go into the nav bar alright so in
the nav bar what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to change the branding which is
just as bootstrap for I'm going to
change that to traversing media and then
these two list items are the two pages
the features in the author page and it
even uses a little logic here to have
the active class if we're on that page
so that the link lights up alright so if
we run features you can see it's light
if we go to author welt like idiot I
just deleted those pages but anyways
that would work so let's change this to
home and we'll change this right here to
home and this here to home alright and
then we want the about page for this one
so we'll change that to a bow we'll
change this to about and change this
okay so let's go ahead and save this and
now we'll go to our front-end and reload
and now we have home if I click on about
that takes us Thea to the about page
now notice the booed the jumbotron is on
both pages now we can use the twig
template engine to do conditionals so
let's make it so that the boot the with
the hell is this the jumbotron shows up
on only the home page so we'll go to our
layout and not layout yeah layout
default and we're gonna wrap this right
here see the partial Jumbotron
we're gonna wrap this in a conditional
using the twig template engine so we're
gonna say if sorry about the banging
guys so we'll say if this dot page dot
file name is equal to home dot HTM okay
uses an HTM extension I don't think HTML
will work and then we just want to do an
end if actually going to do an else
first
so we'll say else then I just want a
couple line breaks just to push
everything down and then we'll do our
end if okay we'll just go ahead and tab
that over all right so let's save that
see if that works so home page has the
jumbotron the about doesn't have it
alright so any internet page we create
now won't have the update jumbotron now
we can also create our own partials so
let's say we wanted to have a sidebar
over here so what we'll do is we'll go
to partials we'll say add we'll call it
sidebar and let's just put an h3 will
just say sigh yeah we'll just say
sidebar and then we'll put a paragraph
and I'll say lorem xxx tab alright so it
doesn't really matter you can put
whatever you want here and then we'll
save and then if we want to insert that
we can go to our layout our default
layout and I want to put that down here
on the side of the page now I'm going to
use the bootstrap grid system so we're
going to put a road class here and then
we're going to have to
columns so call m.d. 8 will have an 8
column div and then underneath that will
say call m.d. 4 for a four column div
and then we're going to take this page
okay so this is where the page the
actual page is displayed put that in the
8th column and then in the 4 column
we're gonna put our sidebar so to do
that we can say partial and then the
name which is sidebar so let's go ahead
and save that and let's go to our
front-end and reload and now we have a
sidebar so it's as easy as that to put
partials around your site now this will
be on every page if you wanted it on a
specific page again you could do that
conditional that we just did for the
Jumbotron all right now I'm just going
to change the text in the Jumbotron real
quick so I'm just gonna go to the
partial and I'm gonna change this h1
right here to traversÃ©e media and save
that alright and we'll reload and it's
as easy as that to change content so you
could actually have your clients come in
and change up their content now it is a
little I would say less user-friendly
than WordPress because you do have
actual code here but you just have to be
very specific to tell them to just
change the text do not touch any of the
tags or anything like that all right I
don't know if there's a way that you can
make it to not have the code here that
probably is but I'm just not sure about
how to do that now if you want to
include images inline images you could
go to media not just images video audio
and you can manage all of your media for
your website here
alright you also have your settings you
have quite a bit of settings you want to
configure your mail server if you're
gonna make your contact form work but
what we're gonna do is install the
contact form plug-in just so you can see
how that works so if we go to system and
then updates and plugins and we click
install plugins and we search for a
contact we'll get a couple options I'm
going to choose this second one here
this free simple complete modular
contact
and that's going to download it and
install it once that's done you can go
to contact us settings right here under
marketing and you can add in your
whatever your info your recipient name
subject will just say hello and then
confirmation will just say thank you so
you can do that you can also enable the
CAPTCHA but you'll need to get a site
key and a secret key from Google we're
not going to do that and we're just
gonna save and close all right now we
can go to our CMS and we can create a
new page called contact and then the way
that we implement let's choose a default
the way that we implement plugins or
components is click on components and
now you'll see contact us so if we click
on that it brings it in to this page
okay so this page is now associated with
this plug-in now to actually embed it
you need to look at whatever is right
here you see contact form and we just
want to go down here and put in our
percent syntax and then say component
and then whatever that shortcode is
which is a contact form like that
alright and we can put other markup here
as well if we want to put a heading and
put an h1 we'll say contact us and that
should be good let's save and now we'll
go to our partials and go to navbar and
just add that as a link I'll just copy
this will change about to contact here
as well
and here and let's save and now we'll go
to our front end and reload and now we
have a contact link if I click that we
now have a form
okay it has validation and everything
now it's not gonna work if I send it
because I don't have an email server
setup or anything yeah see we get this
error here Swift mail are not found but
you can look at that you can set that up
on your real web server and you can look
at the documentation on how to do that I
just wanted to show you how to install
the plugin now I also want to install a
blog plug-in and show you how to do that
so let me just close these up so let's
go back to settings and then go to
updates and plugins install plugins
we're going to search for blog and we're
gonna choose the first one here it's by
rain lab let that install and then we'll
go back to CMS and we're gonna create
two pages here one is going to be for
the single post so I'm just going to
call this post and choose the default
layout now we need to go back over here
to components and click on blog and
you'll see there's four options so we
have the category list the the post
which is what we're doing here the
single post the list of posts and then
an RSS feed if you want we're not going
to use the RSS feed or the category list
we're going to use the post list and the
single post so make us make sure we
choose a single post and again just like
we did before we want to include this
little shortcode down here so let's do
let's say what are we doing here do our
percent signs and then component and
it's gonna be blog post like that
alright and then we'll go ahead
click on this box here and you see how
it says post slug which is : slug we
need to add that to the URL so we need
to say / : slug so it knows which
opposed to actually go to so let's go
ahead and save this alright so now that
we did that we want to go back to pages
and create our main blog page so let's
say add we'll call it blog choose the
default layout and then components and
we want to choose post list this time
add our shortcode by the way I don't
know if it's called shortcode I don't
know what it is but it's this little
identifier here and this is blog posts
plural actually we need to do component
blog posts alright so if we click this
box we need to go to links and see how
it says post page about that's not
correct we need to change it to the post
page that we just created alright so
we'll go ahead and do that and save now
we want to add blog to our menu so we'll
go to partials nav bar and let's copy
this list item here and let's go ahead
and change this to blog blog and this
right here also blog and save let's go
to our front-end and reload now we have
a blog link if I click that we get first
blog post now we haven't created a blog
post but this one is here by default and
if we click that it takes us to the
actual post now to create a post in our
backend you probably noticed that we
have this blog link so we can click that
and there's our first blog post but we
can create another one let's call this
second post we'll say this is the second
post and you have a little editor here
where you can format things with
headings code you can make things bold
you can create lists items stuff like
that then you have a little preview over
here so let's go ahead and save this
post and let's go to our front-end and
reload and there's our second post so
pretty easy now you can edit this stuff
like how this looks inside of your files
so if I were to go to let's see I want
to go to plugins rain lab blog and
components and this is the the posts so
this folder here and then this this HT
HTM file if I were to open that and take
a look you'll see that we have all the
mark-up with the dynamic content so for
instance if you wanted to not use a UL
here you could change this to a div you
could make these your post showing like
bootstrap cards or something like that
if you wanted to change up the look but
I'm not going to get into that into
actually editing the design I just
wanted to show you how to kind of set up
a simple website using the CMS now is
this as attractive as creating your own
platform your own CMS of course not but
look we did this in what a little over
20 minutes so this is very practical
you could easily edit the design here
edit the template add a nice background
image and change the colors up make it a
you know your own your company's brand
or whatever company you're building the
site for so it's something that's very
practical and I think it is worth is
worth making a video on so hopefully you
guys enjoyed this and maybe you'll use
it maybe you won't my job my goal for
this channel is to just give you options
and show you how to use those options
and then you make the decision if you
want to actually use it in in your
career or your whatever your life and by
the way I do want to mention that this
is really easy to deploy you should be
able to upload this on to a shared host
no problem as long as you have long as
it has PHP 7 and you have a database
either MySQL or one of the other ones
that you saw that it
it uses all right so thanks guys thanks
for watching if you like this video
please leave it a like please leave a
comment talk about a little bit about
what you think about content management
systems and and using pre-made ones or
building them from scratch and and
whatever you feel like you feel like
sharing so thanks guys and I will see
you next time
hey guys I've just created a new discord
server that's open to the public the
goal is to have a place where people can
go to help each other out for
programming issues as well as just a
place to discuss new ideas and get
feedback I also check in daily there's a
channel to request videos on YouTube and
much more so if you want to check it out
just go to discord GG slash traversÃ©e
