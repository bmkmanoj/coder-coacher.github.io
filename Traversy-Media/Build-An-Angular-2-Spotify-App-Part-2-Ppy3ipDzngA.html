on the Spotify application first thing
we're going to do is set up our
QuickStart and then we're going to
implement bootstrap and I just want to
get the navigation and the router done
first before we move on to working with
the API
all right so angular dot IO we're going
to click the get started button and then
go to the QuickStart github page and
grab this command right here and then
what we'll do is open up let's see let's
go to our projects folder our C Drive
projects I'm going to open up with git
bash and then we're going to paste this
in and I'm just going to rename this to
we're going to call this ng Spotify okay
let's go into that folder and we're
going to run NPM install
and we might as well go ahead and add
that to our editor here
all right so we're going to have a
couple different components here are a
few different components but we're going
to just create two of them for now and
that's going to be the navbar and then
the about component because I want to
work on the router and I want to have
the about page so we can use the
navigation to go back and forth all
right so let's go ahead and create a
folder called components and in that
folder we'll create another folder
called navbar and let's create a file in
there called nav bar dot component dot
TS and then it's also going to have an
HTML file so we'll say nav bar dot
component dot HTML and let's see let's
go to app component es and just copy
that paste that in there and we're going
to change this to nav bar and for now
actually you know what let's make this
template URL and this is going to be nav
bar dot component dot HTML and we have
to add the module ID right here which is
going to be a module dot ID and then
we'll just change this app component to
nav bar component ok let's save that and
in the HTML file for now let's just say
nav bar and then we're going to go to
app component TS and import it
okay let's see why is that red now bar
component from let's see component Oh
slash the navbar okay and then we're
going to add that as a directive all
right and let's see this app component
TS I want that to have its own file as
well its own template so let's say app
dot component dot HTML we'll change this
to template URL module ID save that and
then we'll create that file all right
and let's go ahead and put the navbar
save that and now we can run NPM start
and there we go now bars being inserted
now we're going to go ahead and create
the about component so we're going to
have a folder here called the boat same
thing we did with the nav bar alright
and let's just copy what we have in the
nav bar file paste that in and we're
going to change this to about change
this to about and this okay and then
here we're just going to say about save
that alright so what I want to do now is
grab bootstrap now I'm going to do
something different here we're going to
use boot swatch which is basically just
a customized theme version of bootstrap
so we're going to grab let's see which
one did I want here cyborg
so if you click download we could bring
this into our application as a file but
I'm just going to grab the link right
here and I'm going to put that we're
going to go in index.html and I'm going
to go right here
face that in alright save that and now
there's a style.css file in the root
here we're just going to get rid of
everything there okay if we go back to
our app you can see now it's a dark
color so now we're going to work on the
navbar so let's go to get bootstrap calm
and then we're going to go to get
started examples and then the starter
template where we can do control you and
grab the navbar okay then we'll go to
our navbar HTML file paste that in okay
we're going to get rid of the class
right here navbar fix top change the
project name to ng Spotify and we can
get rid of this contact we don't need
that and we'll change these links up
later we'll leave them for now and just
save and now if we look at our app you
can see we have a nav bar so now we want
to work on the router first thing to do
is to go into index.html and go right
after the first right after the
beginning body tag and put a base tag
which with an href to just slash alright
then we'll save that and then we're
going to create a file in the root here
and not in the root in the app folder
and let's call it app dot route dot TS
okay we're going to import the provide
router a provider router notes provide
and then router config angular slash
router
okay we're also going to bring in our
components now we probably should have
created the search first but we're going
to have the home page is basically going
to be our search component okay so we
can search Spotify for music so let's go
let's create that before we actually do
this so in components let's create a
folder called search and create our two
files here okay so this will be search
dot component tot TS and search dark
component dot HTML all right and then
here let's just put search in search
component we can copy what we have in
the navbar and then just change up that
and that all right so now back to app
tot routes and we're going to import the
search component
okay and we also want to import the
about component
all right and then we're going to have a
constant called route set that to router
config and we'll put our paths in here
so let's say path and then this will be
blank that is that represents the home
page and then we'll say component is
going to be search component and then
we'll have another path that's going to
be about component will be about
component all right and then down here
six port Const
app router providers and here we're
going to say provide router and then
just wrap that routes variable okay
we'll save that now we're going to go to
let's see we're going to go to main dot
TS and set up our provider here so let's
say let's import app router providers
and that's going to be from the app dot
routes file
and then down here we're going to add a
second parameter and put in that app
router providers all right save that now
we're going to go to our route app
component ts file and we need our router
directives so say import router
directives and then down here we'll put
that in the directives array save it
okay now you can see down here we have
no can't find primary outlet so that we
need to go to our app component HTML and
we're going to just go right under the
navbar here and put in router outlet
okay we'll save that and now you can see
it's loading the search alright I'm just
going to wrap some stuff around this
we're going to take div class container
okay that moves it over a little bit and
then I actually want a class called main
as well wrapped around everything here
all right so that's setup now we need to
make it so that this goes to the about
component so what we need to do is go to
our nav bar component TS and we also
need our router directives here
and that needs to be wrapped with curly
braces and then we'll just add that here
and then we should be able to go to our
navbar HTML and we're going to add the
links okay so we're going to get rid of
the H ref and we're going to say router
link equals slash about nope just slash
and then another attribute router link
active and let's set that to active okay
and then we'll copy that and then do the
same thing here except this is going to
be slash about okay you'll save that go
back to localhost 3000 and now when I
click about it brings us to the about
page alright now we're just going to
want to add these two components in the
main app component in the pre-compile
array so we'll say pre-compile and where
we got search component and about
component okay we're going to bring both
of those in here
all right that should do it
all right so we now have our navbar set
up along with the router so in the next
video we're going to start to work on
the Spotify service and the search bar
okay so I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
