we made it so that we could go ahead and
just add some to dues through the input
the data is not persistent it's just
going to be low it's just gonna be
stored in memory for now but what I want
to do is show you how we can actually
get rid of some of these if we want so
we'll just have a little delete button
so let's actually just put an X next to
the to do text so we're going to go down
to to-do list and let's go after this to
do text and we'll put blank okay we'll
just put in an X and let's give this a
class name of delete and I just want to
make that red so I'm gonna go up to
where I have these style tags and I'll
say delete color is red all right so
let's check that out
okay so now we have these little red X's
next to each to do so what I want to do
now is go back to that a tag and we're
gonna have to add an on-click attribute
and we're gonna set that to this will
save this dot now I don't want to do on
click let's say on delete now we have to
somehow pass the ID of the one that we
want to delete so what we need to do is
say dot bind and we're gonna pass in
this and then the second parameter we're
gonna pass the ID all right actually
we'll pass the whole to do alright that
way we can access it inside of on delete
so let's go ahead and create that
okay so on delete and that's gonna take
in to do and let's just console dot log
to do okay so I'll go and click one of
these and you can see it's giving us
that particular to do the ID and the
text all right open it whatever when we
click so that's what we want now we
can't like like in the last video when
we had to from the form we had to create
a property function to pass up to the
app component alright so we're gonna
have to do the same thing here so we'll
say this dot props if I can spell this
dot props dot
delete to do and we'll pass in to do
alright and then we're going to go up
since we're in to-do list we have to go
up to the where we're actually including
that component which is right here and
we're gonna say on actually no I'm sorry
we have to we have to put whatever we
had down here what was it on delete
alright so on delete and then we'll set
that to this dot handle to do delete
okay and then we'll go and create that
so handle to do delete
and that should take in eight to do so
let's test that out so far we'll say
console dot log to do and we should be
able to see them again when we click it
delete to do is not a function this dot
props dot delete to do
oh this stuff props thoughts lead to do
oh okay
why does it say on delete was it oh I
was I was putting an S we actually need
this one here so let's go back and put
that in like that I believe there we go
okay
so we know that that's working this
handle to do delete now what we want to
do is we're gonna set to do is equal to
the two dues in the states of this dot
state dot two dues and what we're gonna
do is just do a for loop and we want to
say var I is equal to zero and then as
long as I is less than two dues dot
length all right and what we're gonna do
is check to see if the current iteration
is equal to the ID that's being passed
with the to do that we passed in alright
so we'll say if two dues i dot ID is
equal to to do ID then we know that's
the one that we want to delete so i'll
say to do is dot splice
passing the index and one alright and
then what we want to do is set the state
back to two whatever we have here into
dues after the delete all right so we'll
go right here and say this dot set state
to dues and to dues all right
now the reason that I had to do this and
put it in a new variable as opposed to
using the state to dues like down here
is because it wouldn't update when we do
the actual delete because we need to
actually call set state and reset the to
do state in order for the application or
the component rather to re-render
alright so hopefully that makes sense
okay so if I click one of these what
happened
did I not I didn't save it okay so now
we can delete these okay obviously if we
reload they're gonna come back because
it's just in memory but we're able to
delete the delete data from the state
okay so in the next video we're gonna
try and make it so that we can update
these okay so I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
