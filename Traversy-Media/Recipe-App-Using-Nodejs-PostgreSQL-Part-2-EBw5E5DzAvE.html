be building an application to manage
recipes alright so we'll be able to
store recipes we'll be able to update
them delete them and so forth so as far
as the technology we're going to use
PostgreSQL which is something we haven't
used yet in this course it's a
relational database that's much like
MySQL the syntax the query language is
pretty much the exact same it's it's
based on SQL we'll be using something
called node postgrads and if we quickly
just look down here you can see that we
can connect to our database using a
connection string and then we can call
queries with client query all right we
can call select update insert delete so
we'll be using that we're also going to
be using dust GIS for our templates and
there's a module called Express dust
that integrates pretty well with Express
so we'll be using that for our layouts
alright so first thing I want to do is
get postgrads installed on our system
you can install it in Windows like I am
or you could use Mac or Linux but what
we're going to do is click on the
download link here and I'm on Windows so
that's what I'm going to choose and
there's actually a graphical installer
that includes Postgres and also PG admin
now if you've never used this before PG
admin is pretty similar to PHP myadmin
for MySQL it'll it's a graphical user
interface that allows you to create
databases and tables and all that
alright so we'll just grab that alright
now let's see we want the latest version
so that would be this one and I'm on a
64-bit system so I'm going to choose
this button
all right so that should start
downloading it's only 61 megabytes not
too bad all right so let's open that up
okay so here's the Installer let's just
go through it I'm going to leave it in
the default directory default data
directory okay you're going to have to
provide a password for your super user
please select the port number we're
going to leave it at the default which
is 54 32 and default locale that's fine
all right
alright so that's all set now you're
going to get this this prompt for a
stack builder but we're going to uncheck
that we don't need that and then just
click finish so now what we want to do
is we want to open up PG admin so I'm
going to go to my little search bar down
here and go to PG admin 3 and run as
administrator alright and you should see
something like this and then right here
where we have servers one you want to
click on that and then just click
connect
alright then it's going to prompt you
for the password that you had to enter
when we installed it alright now I have
a database here called recipe book you
shouldn't you should only have postgrads
I was using this for development also if
you go to login roles you should only
have postgrads there as well alright so
what we're going to do is create a new
login role first
okay so role name we'll just say I'm
just going to say add you onyx you can
call it whatever you'd like and I think
that's all we need all the password
okay and then also roll privileges we're
going to click can create databases can
create roles and super user alright so
click OK and now what we're going to do
is go to the databases right here and
click new database alright and you can
call this what you whatever you like I'm
going to call it recipe book dB
alright and then for owner I'm going to
choose the user that we just created ok
so that should be good so now we can
click OK and that should create your
database alright now if we open this up
and we click in schemas public and then
we have this tables item down here this
is where we can create a table so let's
do that will click new table and you
should see a form like this so name
let's call it recipes owner will be the
user we created and I think that's good
ok so let's click OK and then what we'll
do is click on the plus sign next to the
recipes table and where it says columns
we're going to create a new column ok so
this is going to be the ID the data type
is going to be serial ok so you want to
look for serial all right here ok and
this is going to auto increment by
default for us and then what we want to
do is go to SQL and we want this to be
our primary key I'm going to uncheck
this read-only and then down here we're
just going to add on to this and say
primary key just like that and then
we'll click OK and that creates the ID
for us and it also made it the primary
key you can see that now in constraints
we have this recipes P key ok let's
create another field or another column
rather
so columns new column okay this one is
going to be named and let's choose
character and length will be 255 all
right let's create another one new
column this one here is going to be
ingredients and for the data type we're
going to choose text oops that's not the
one I want we don't want the brackets
just text all right and then we'll
create one more new column and this one
is going to be directions data type is
also going to be text okay so now we
have our database so we're going to go
ahead and stop it here and in the next
video we'll start to create our
application and we'll implement the
postgrads module that we can use with
node and go from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
