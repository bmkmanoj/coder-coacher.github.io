joomla extension called faux gallery and
what it is it's a it's a really great
image gallery plugin
excuse me component for a joomla it's my
personal favorite it has a lot of
options as a lot of it has a lot of
third-party plugins as well as
slideshows download plugins all types of
stuff so you want to go to focus each
and go to components and focal gallery
and you just want to click download and
you want to download we are going to be
using a 2.5 Joomla site so you want to
download that
and then we're going to go over to our
Joomla site which is a brand new
installation hasn't been touched at all
and this is the back end and we're going
to install it just like any other
extension and go to extension manager
choose file and we want to just upload
that component zip file
okay and now you want to click install
and we get it we have a bunch of
warnings here you reload I'm not sure
why we're having those we are using a
local installation this is an on an
actual web server it's on a zamp server
they just look like warnings so I'm just
going to ignore these for now because
I'm not sure why it's happening but
anyways we're just going to ignore that
so we want to go to we want to create a
category actually you know what
see if that helps at all
all right yeah so this is I just got rid
of the warnings that change the error
reporting setting so one of the
categories and we want to create a new
category and I'm just gonna say my pics
and you can choose a parent category if
you want it um access rights I'm going
to choose all upload rights super user
delete rights super user and the owner
we can just leave now
another the last required thing for us
to do in this in creating a category is
to create a folder so we want to click
select folder and we want to create a
new folder fur for every category that
we create we should create a folder and
you just want to click this little arrow
okay and that inserts it here so every
category needs its own folder and that's
all we could put a description but we're
not going to do that so I'm just going
to click Save and close
alright so now we have a a category
all right so images we have a couple
options you can upload single images or
multiple I'm gonna first do a single
image so I'm just gonna click new and
the title will just be my image category
my pics file name this is where we
upload the actual image so we want to
use this uploader right here by clicking
choose file and I'm gonna let's see I'm
just gonna do
just gonna upload a stock photo 3d
figures use this guy and then click
start upload so now it's uploaded this
is our image we want to click this arrow
here to insert it into the file name
field and that's really all we need
that's all we need but we could add more
stuff here titles and zoom a whole bunch
of stuff description but we're just
going to keep it as is and click Save
and close and it'll generate it just
generated a thumbnail on that the screen
you just saw so now we have my image in
the my pics category now I'm going to
show you how to actually display it so
you want to go you want to create a new
menu item I'm gonna use my top menu
click menu item and you want to select
Foca gallery and I'm gonna do a I'm just
going to choose this list of images
category whew what that will do is show
all the images in a certain category and
they're going to choose my pics over
here and I'll just give it a name of
images and then you could edit certain
options here I'm just gonna leave it as
is save and close
oh we can't use images as an alias so
we're just going to say my images
because images is an actual folder in a
Joomla installation so we can't have
that as the link name so my images well
the category wasn't selected one second
where would
the top menu images I just didn't didn't
selecting my pics category so save and
close let's go to our front-end and
reload now we have an images link and
here's our gallery any other images we
add will be displayed here you got a
nice full image here if you have more
you can have like a little slideshow
type deal and we have downloads enabled
so the user can actually download this
image but we can of course we can you
know take that away if we want so that's
it i mean its installed and actually you
know what i'm going to show you one more
thing i'm going to show you how to
upload multiple images so we want to go
back to images and we're going to click
this multiple add okay now what we want
to do is we want to use this multiple
upload tab and what it's selecting my
fixed category from here in here add
images now let's just
choose three images okay now we just
click start upload
and take a couple seconds
okay and I'm just gonna select the my
pics again I don't know why it clears it
out but it does oh you know what these
here we're supposed to go in this folder
I guess I was supposed to go into that
folder before the upload but I'm pretty
sure I can do this by checking these and
choosing the category here so let's see
it generates the thumbnails okay yep so
they're all in the my pics category so
if we go back to the front-end reload
and there's our images so of course you
can customize the gallery we can make
these bigger or smaller or change the
background all types of things but this
is the basic the basic way you would
create a photo gallery on Joomla using
Foca</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
