project in this video we're going to be
building an html5 and css3 website or
website template with flexbox grid now
fluxbox grid is a very light flex box
base grid system very similar to what
you'd find in bootstrap 4 okay without
the rest of the framework if you want to
keep things light I'm also using it
because I don't want to use a full
framework because I want this to be
geared towards beginners that are just
getting into learning html5 and CSS this
is actually a really good video to
follow up after the html5 responsive
website video that that that's pretty
popular so we're going to look at the
project we're going to talk a little bit
about flexbox grid and then we'll get
into it this video is sponsored by dev
Mountain if you're interested in
learning web development iOS or UX
design dev Mountain is a 12-week design
and development bootcamp intended to get
you a full time job in the industry to

click the link in the description below
alright guys so let's take a look at
what we'll be building now I'm not a
professional designer I mean I think
it's alright but it's just a basic
template it's not made to be something
that you know is going to go into
production but very basic very clean so
up at the top we have our header with
just an h1 for the logo and then we have
our basic navigation on the side here
alright we're going to have a home page
which is the main focus of this project
and then in about services and contact
page so here we have a giant showcase
image very high quality this is a free
stock image so you're free to use this
it's going to be included in the files
and then we just have an h1 and some sub
text here with a clear background or a
background that has some transparency
okay we also made the the radius the
border is really rounded and then down
here we have some icons we're going to
be using font awesome which is gives us
a whole bunch of different icons to work
with and pretty customisable we can we
change the colors we can make them
bigger or smaller and these are just
some basic core features all right and
then right over to that we have this
section here with this
background which i think looks pretty
nice and then we just have a stock image
of an iPhone and then just some core
features and an unordered list with some
checkbox icons or check marks and then
for the footer we have this area with
three separate columns with one with the
contact the about and then just a simple
newsletter form okay no functionality in
the forms this is just strictly
front-end and then just a simple copy
right so that'll be this is this is
where the meat of the project will be
now for the inner pages they're very
simple for the about page we just have
this who we are section and that's what
we do and then we have the footer all
right we also have this sub header area
on the inner pages so this is the
services it's basically just a UL it's
an unordered list with some some
background color we're using css3 so we
can color every odd or even list item
and then the contact is just a very very
simple form with name email and message
alright so we're going to try to squeeze
this into one video I may have to do two
or three but I'm pretty sure we can do
it one I just like to keep it under an
hour so all right now flexbox grid is
the reason I'm using this is because I
want to keep this very light I don't
want to use a full framework the main
focus of this is going to be learning
html5 and CSS and building a UI building
a website but this this this is just
like the bootstrap for grid system it
uses flexbox obviously and it even has
the same class names if we look at this
we have a div with the class of row so
anytime we want to row we're going to
wrap that now a row could be anything
this could be a row this and this could
be a row with 2 to column divs and if we
look at here it has some examples with
these blue boxes and the class names are
the exact same as bootstrap I think it's
missing one
I think bootstrap has an extra large as
well but basically call excess is extra
small small medium and large and this
pertains to how big the screen is so if
we go here this is this is large so this
particular div would
span four columns if if it was viewed in
this screen size if we go down to about
here that would be medium so that would
be six if we go down what's if we go
down to around here that would be small
so that would be eight columns this div
would stretch and if we went really
small extra small it would be twelve
columns which would be the entire width
of that element so for instance this
right here would be a twelve column this
would be two six column divs all right
this would be it looks like a ten and
then a two column and just has to add up
to 12 okay because it's a twelve twelve
column based grid you can also do fluid
lengths so this would be percentages you
can see it works with flex flex styling
behind the scenes simple syntax see
offsets just like with bootstrap you can
do call and then the sides and then the
offset for instance this one here looks
like it's a one column that's offset ten
are offset eleven this looks like a
Levin column offset by one you can also
do auto width which is really nice so if
you want your all your columns in that
row to be the same size you don't even
have to specify the size you could just
do call XS or call MD or LG or whatever
nested grids you can also put grids
inside of other grids or columns inside
of other columns and then this here
alignment is really nice this is what's
really nice about flexbox is that we can
easily align it by saying for instance
this row we would want all of the
columns to be aligned to the left which
would be start if we wanted them aligned
centered we could do Center and then the
size and if we wanted them aligned to
the right we could do end so end excess
or end MD and then you can also align
them vertically so you can do top middle
and bottom all right and then you can
also you can control the the the padding
and margin and all that so you can apply
distribution you can do around between
all the stuff that you can do with Flex
blocks you can do with this framework
it's just easier alright I would suggest
after doing this looking at the Flex box
in 20 minutes video and that will give
you some some good insight into how to
actually use just flex box so enough of
the explanation let's go ahead and get
started we already we already go through
quite a few minutes here so we're going
to do everything basically the easiest
way possible we're going to just
download this we're not going to use
Bower or any package managers we're not
going to use SAS this is geared towards
beginners just getting into HTML and CSS
alright so I'm going to create a new
project folder let me just go into my
projects folder you can create this
wherever you want and we're going to
call this app theme okay let me actually
get my other keyboard it's a little
quieter non-mechanical
alright and we're going to create an
index.html file which will be our home
page and let's create some as well
create the folders here so CSS and
images okay no JavaScript maybe we can
do that in another video but this is
just strictly HTML and CSS
alright so let's let's open this up I'm
going to be using Adam for my text
editor which is really nice it's built
on top of electron which is a framework
that allows you to build desktop
applications with JavaScript so it's
really nice and then we're just going to
open that folder and add it as a project
so I want to go to my projects app theme
and select that folder
alright so now we're going to add some
basic HTML tags so if you're an atom you
can do HTML tab and it'll give you this
base structure of a document and then
let's put in app bean for our title and
then we're going to need to include our
CSS files so we're going to download
flexbox grid so let's go to download
we're going to do it the easiest way
possible which is just grabbing the zip
file and we'll go into that now this has
all the source code
as the the production code it has the
documentation all kinds of stuff but all
we need is in the CSS folder we want
this flexbox grid dot CSS so let's bring
that over to our CSS folder
all right well close that up and then
we're also going to create a custom
style sheet called style dot CSS all
right so now let's go back to our HTML
and let's add will say CSS slash flexbox
grid dot CSS and then we'll copy this
and then we want our custom style sheet
just like that
alright so we're going to start off with
with the head with the header so let's
take a look at the finished project here
so we have this header and if I open up
chrome tools and click inspect it'll
highlight the divs the element so this
is a ten column div you can see it
stretches ten columns wide and then this
is a two column okay so what we need to
do is create a row this is this whole
thing's is a row and then we have a two
column and a ten column all right now
the only time it's not ten and two is if
we go down to extra small and then you
can see each one is twelve columns width
which reaches across the entire thing so
we need to specify that as well just
remember that so let's go into our HTML
here and I'm just going to add in a
comment here so to say this is going to
be the header and this is going to be
we're going to use the header tag which
is an html5 tag now when we style this
we could just grab on to the header
element but if you have multiple header
elements like let's say you have an
article or a blog and you have a header
at the top of each article we don't want
it to style that so let's give this an
ID of main header all right now the
difference between IDs and classes a lot
of people get confused when they're just
starting out you want to use an ID for
something that's unique so for instance
we're not going to have a main header
anywhere else in the website
so that's something that you would put
in an ID a class however is something
that you'll probably reuse throughout
the site and I'll show you an example of
that in a minute so in the header we're
going to put a div with the class of
container and what that does is it
consolidates everything into a certain a
certain percentage of the screen now for
some reason flex blocks grid doesn't add
a margin to it so it doesn't push it
into the middle but so we'll have to add
that but I'll show you what I mean in a
few minutes so in the container we then
need a row all right so let's say div
class row and in here we're going to
have two divs which are going to be our
columns this is where the logo will go
and I'll add the classes in a minute
which is going to be an h1 it'll say app
theme and then we'll have another column
or another div which will have the
navigation so let's put in a nav tag
here and again I'm going to give this
nav an ID so that we can specify this
particular menu and then in here we'll
have a ul an unordered list and then
some Li tags with some links inside so
this is going to go to index dot HTML so
that'll be a link to home and then we're
going to have a couple other ones so
this will be a boat this will be
services and this will be contact
okay so let's let's go ahead and take a
look at this so we'll open it up I'm
just going to use the file system I'm
not using a server or anything and
notice how the the menu is aligned to
the right okay if we didn't specify that
this was a row it wouldn't be so if I
were to change if I were to just get rid
of the row class and reload then you can
see it just goes on one out one under
each other but since we added a row it's
going to float everything now we you
know you only don't want to specify a
column if they're all if they're always
going to be equal and they're not we're
going to have a two column and then a
ten column it's not going to be for
instance you know three three three so
we have to specify in here that we want
this to be will say call MD for medium
size medium size screens and this will
be two okay it's also going to be call
SM actually no let's do I want to put it
in order I want to have extra small
small medium large I sound like the more
water in McDonald so call SM to call MD
to call LG - okay and remember when it's
when it's extra small when it's the
mobile version we don't want this to be
a two column we want to go all the way
across which will be a twelve column so
this will be called XS twelve all right
hopefully that makes sense and then I'm
just going to copy this and go here and
then this is going to be ten columns
except for when it's extra small it'll
be twelve columns all right so now let's
go back and reload and let's open up the
chrome tools and inspect and you'll see
that this is ten columns this is two
columns but when we go to extra small it
goes to twelve columns each okay which
goes across the whole page now I want
this to be aligned to the middle like I
said for some reason flexbox grid
doesn't add the margin it does add the
boundaries you'll see that it ends
so what we'll do is just open up our
style sheet and say dot container this
is the only CSS I'm going to add for
right now and we're just going to do
margin Auto which should bring
everything into the middle because what
it does is it gives the same amount of
margin on all sides so on the left on
the right and it pushes it into the
middle all right so if we reload now
you'll see that it's pushed in the
middle which is what we want all right
so let's go back to our index.html and
see another thing we want to do is align
we want to align both of these to be to
the right okay because the navigation we
want it to be over here let me shut that
off
we want the navigation over here now if
we go to our documentation and we look
at alignments we want this ok the menu
should be over here so we need to add
the alignments to the row class so we're
going to do end - and then whatever the
size we want okay which is going to be
everything except excess excess remember
it's a 12 column div when it's mobile
version so it doesn't matter we don't
need to align it so for the row let's
say we want align to the end for small
for medium and for large so now let's go
back and reload and now you'll see that
they're they're both aligned to the
right okay nevermind this these bullet
points will remove those later so that
should be it for the header as far as
the mark-up as far as the HTML so let's
move on to the showcase we're going to
go under the header looks mean to do
that and put a comment here this is
going to be the showcase okay so let's
say we're going to actually going to use
a section and a section is also an html5
tag we're going to give it an ID of
showcase and then in here we're going to
do the same thing at a container now the
reason I don't put container before
showcase is because if we look at the
final template here the container keeps
everything in here okay from here to
here and the image we want it to span
across the entire thing if we added the
container around the showcase where
we're going to put the image it would
end right here and I don't want that all
right so in here let's put our row and
we're going to have this is actually
going to be it's going to go across the
whole page and so let's put another div
here and this is where we'll have our h1
which will say welcome to I want to say
welcome to app theme and I'm also going
to wrap this in a span with class of
primary text I think I need to do that
to the logo as well let me see that I do
that yet no I didn't so we just want to
go right here and put a span class
equals primary text okay and that's like
I said it's a good example of when to
use a class because we're using this
throughout the whole site now the reason
we use a span instead of a div is
because a span is inline it's an inline
element while a div is block-level
element and what that means is if it's a
block level after the tag ends right
here would put this on another line on a
new line all right we don't want that we
want this all in the same line so a span
will actually let us do that all right
so back down here let's put in a
paragraph and we'll just say a template
template built with html5 css3 and
flexbox grid all right so it's our
showcase now as far as the columns it's
going to be if we look at it it's going
to be one
one long column so it's going to be to
one long dip so it'll be twelve columns
so let's go in here and say call XS
twelve call SM twelve MD and LG and save
that then we'll take a look at it okay
so it's going to look very ugly because
we haven't added added our own CSS but
we want to align it to the middle or to
the center horizontally and to the
middle vertically so we need to remember
we add our alignments to the row class
so this will be Center XS we want it
centered on for all for all screen sizes
so small MD large we also want it middle
which is vertical so middle XS middle SM
middle LG all right and now if we go and
reload it should align to the middle
good so that's the showcase now we want
the feature section so let's go down
here and add a comment features okay
same thing these are all going to have
all the sections will have the same
basic layout the only difference is
going to be the the width of each column
and the alignments so this will have an
idea of features and again we'll have a
container and we'll have our row and
then we have our columns so let's take a
look at what feature this is going to
look like all right so this is an
example of nesting grids because the
whole thing together this whole area is
going to be a 12 column div that goes
across the whole thing and then inside
that we're going to have two rows of
three column dibs I'm so yeah three four
column dips because three times four is
12 so
if we set them to four there's going to
be three of them so let's start off with
the twelve column so we'll say call so
you call XS twelve call SM twelve all
right and then in here we're going to
have our h2 which will say core features
and then we'll have a paragraph which
will just say what's included and then
we're going to start the first row which
will have three four column divs so this
will have a row and then we'll do call
XS all right now that the extra small
isn't going to have three four column
divs it's going to be just one across
which will be twelve columns so call XS
twelve and then the rest of them we want
them to float so this will be four MD
for LG four all right and then each
one's going to have an icon which I'll
get to in a second we need to use font
awesome for that let's put an H for
we'll stay fully optimized and then
paragraph no this is just going to be
some dummy text with atom we can type in
larom tab and it's going to just put in
some sample text here but I want this
really short so I'm going to end it
right here all right now remember each
row will have three of these so we need
to copy this paste it in two more times
and let's change the change this to free
support and change this to free upgrades
okay now remember we need two of these
rows so look at a comment here we'll
just say icon row one and that ends
right here so I'm going to copy this
whole thing and then this will be icon
row two so let's change these this one's
going to be uptime guarantee this one's
going to be multi-user and this one's
going to be plug-and-play all right so
let's go ahead and save and take a look
at it okay good now we want everything
aligned to the middle if we look here we
want the whole 12 column row which is
everything aligned to the middle as well
as each one of these
so remember alignments go in the row so
let's go right here and we'll say Center
XS Center MD Center LG and then we'll
just copy this and put that on these two
as well all right and it's reload now
everything's aligned to the middle so
now for the icon so you can see each one
of these has an icon so let's go to font
awesome and we're going to download the
package and open that up and again this
comes with everything SAS files less
files all we want is in the CSS folder
we want this file right here so we're
going to bring that over to our CSS file
and then we also want to bring over the
fonts folder to the root of our website
all right and that should be good to go
so let's go ahead and close that up and
now let's go to where we have fully
optimized and we're going to put in an
eye tag with a class of FA on awesome
and then also the specific image we want
which is called FA dashboard and you can
find all the class names at the font
awesome website
all right that should be all we need to
put right there actually it's put a
blind break all right and then we'll
copy this and then let's go above free
support this one is going to be let's
see what is its f a question circle o so
question - circle - oh all right and
then three upgrades is going to be f a
rocket and then let's see uptime
guarantee is going to be F a - line -
chart and C multi-user will be FA users
and plug and play is going to be FA plug
all right so let's see if those is the
icons actually you know what they're not
going to work because we didn't bring in
the style sheet yet so let's go ahead
and copy that and then we're just going
to add here font - awesome so let's go
back where the hell is my nav bar all
right so let's reload and now you can
see this icons they're very small but
we'll fix that later on when we add our
CSS so the next thing we want is the
info section which is this right here
which is going to be two six column divs
okay split right down the middle aligned
to the middle aligned to the center so
let's do that features so under the
feature section we'll have info section
okay and it's going to be a section tag
with an ID of info div class container
div class row and then our columns so
remember they're going to be two six
column divs so we can say call XS except
for when it's extra small when it's a
mobile version it'll be twelve columns
because we don't want to float the two
if the screen is really small
but the rest will be six okay there's
going to be two of them this one's going
to have the image of the iPhone so let's
say image source is going to be images /
iPhone dot PNG and you'll have all these
files for download in the description
let me just add them to my folder I have
the finished product in my sandbox here
so I'm just going to grab all three of
these images and paste those in alright
so the iPhone on one side then we have
the core features on the other so this
will be an H it's an h4 I know it's an
h2 will say core features and then we're
going to have an unordered list I'm just
going to paste this in okay so we just
have some Czech icons and then the same
features that we had above so let's save
that and see what it looks like all
right now the image is absolutely huge
what we need to do is we need to say
that we want that width to be a hundred
percent of its container which is its
container is over here so again this is
going to be CSS that I add right now so
let's say image so all images I'm going
to set to 100 percent of the container
by default so now if we go back and
reload it's actually contained in its
container so we want these align to the
middle and center so let's go back to
the row that's where we do our alignment
and we're going to do Center XS
send our medium Center LG we also want
to align to the middle vertically for
all sizes middle SM little MD and middle
large let's take a look okay that's good
now we're going to do the footer the
company area and then the footer so
under here let's say company so notice
how every section has basically the same
kind of formatting that's what you want
to do when you're building you eyes is
you want kind of like components you can
look at each of these sections as a
component that takes in certain
attributes so section ID will be company
and then let's say one our container
will be row then we'll have our columns
let's see what we got here I think it's
three four column dudes yeah so this
will be four columns four columns for
columns except for when it's extra small
then we'll be on top of each other so
let's do div class dick it did div class
did dick class and this lovely s Lex
will be called ash XS and what are we
doing they're doing three four column
divs except XS will be twelve all right
so call SM will be four md4 and lg4 and
let's see each one is going to have an H
for so let's say for this we'll say
about us now this will be what's this
one contact us
which is going to have a ul let's know
on hell I sew a phone number we're going
to put we're going to use font awesome
here as well so let's say I collapse FA
and FA - phone ok space there and then
let's put a fake phone number and then
I'll just copy that
ok so fallen this one's going to be
envelope can't spell
sorry guys hold on my alarm is going off
alright so envelope and then this is
going to be the email address so let's
say support will say support it app
theme dot test and then we'll have the
address this will have an icon of FA map
and we'll just put in a fake address
here alright so let's look at that make
sure the icons show up all right good
so next one will be about us I'm going
to copy this whole div right here and
then this will be a boat and then as far
as this I'm going to get rid of the UL
and just put a paragraph and say larum
tab and then I want this to be a little
shorter I'm going to bring it let's see
let's go up to here so that's the about
and then we'll paste in again and this
one will be the newsletter so put that
and then let's just grab this and then
we'll have a forum we're not going to
need these attributes it's not going to
actually submit so let's put an input
type of text we'll just give it a name
of email and let's see let's put a
button we'll give it a type of submit
and give it some text will just say
submit and yeah that should be good for
the the input let's actually put a
placeholder that will just say enter
email all right let's check that out
there we go
and then we just need the simple footer
at the bottom so let's go under the
section
okay so we'll use a footer tag here and
it's a good idea to give this its own ID
yeah so put our ID we'll call it main
footer just in case you have a footer
tag somewhere else and then inside here
let's do a container and we'll do our
row and then this is just going to be a
twelve column div so we can do call XS
twelve
okay we'll put a paragraph in here that
will say copyrights and % copy semicolon
will give us the little symbol 2017 and
then we'll say app theme all right now
we want this to be aligned to the center
so let's go to the row class and we'll
say XS or our Center XS Center all right
let's check it out
reload and there we go so our HTML is
pretty much done pretty much done for
the home page let's finish the inner
pages before we get to our CSS so we're
going to create a couple more pages here
it's a new file about HTML say new file
services dot HTML oops not HTML and then
contact HTML all right and then we'll
copy what we have in index copy
everything actually one one thing I want
to check in the navigation here I want
to add a class to the current page
you're on called current so we'll add it
to the Li so let's again copy everything
here go to about paste it in and then
we're going to go to the top and in the
title I'm just going to add a pipe
character and then the page name and
we're going to remove the class current
from home to about and then there's no
showcase so we can get rid of that we
can get rid of features we can get rid
of info let's keep company and footer
all right and in this section here is
going to be the sub header all right
because if we look at if we look at our
site here and we go to a bow you'll see
this this right here with the title this
is the sub header
okay and then we just want the main page
area so two sections that we need to add
here so section ID will be sub header
and we're going to put a container you
know the drill
container row content this will be a
twelve column div it's going to go all
the way across no matter what so we can
do call XS 12 now when it goes all the
way across you don't even have to
specify these but I think it's clean
just to have it anyways just in case you
want to change it later or something all
right and let's see we're going to put I
think it's in H 1 and H 1 and we'll say
about us so that's the sub header let's
go ahead and check that so we'll go to
our about page and it should look like
that so under the sub header we'll have
our main page so let's give it a section
so we're going to give it an ID of page
but we're also going to give it a class
of above so we can specifically target
this page if we need to which we
probably will and then same thing
container row content okay so this will
also be a 12 column we're just going to
copy this alright and as far as
alignment I want it to align to the
center for all sizes
what did I forget small okay and then
for the content let's put an h2 and
we're going to say who we are so who we
are and I'm going to make the who the
word who green so we'll give that a span
with a class of primary text just
wrapping the hoop and then let's put a
paragraph with some dummy text and I'll
just copy that I'm going to put two
paragraphs okay and now I'm going to
copy the h2 and both paragraphs and
paste that in right underneath and then
this is going to be what we do okay
let's check it out all right
actually let's put an HR between the two
horizontal rule which we'll just put a
line there good so now services let's
copy about everything in about and go to
services and then let's go up to the top
and we're going to change this and let's
change the the current class we're going
to remove that to services change it in
the sub header and then for the main
page let's change the class to services
and we'll get rid of everything that's
in the 12 column div here get rid of
that and we're going to put
actually I want one of those h2s so
let's get rid of everything but one h2
alright and then this is going to be see
what we offer see what we offer and this
is going to be a ul and then each list
item is going to have an h3 with a
service so let's say web design and
development and then we put a paragraph
and let's just larum tab again if you're
not using atom you can just put whatever
you want just copy so you can go to lips
um calm and you can generate this sample
text alright so paste that in twice this
one will change the title to software
development and programming and then
this one here will change to graphic
design and save and that should be fine
all right look it's long at that span
span class
so now let's go to context copy
everything here and go to contact paste
it in and then this is the last page so
it's changed that let's change the class
of current we're going to put that on to
this one change the subhead ER change
the class of the page and then every
time you want to add a page you can just
use this this basically this template
alright let's see we're going to get rid
of the h2 in the UL and we see here
actually no I want the h2 just the UL so
this one will say get in touch okay and
then we'll just put a paragraph here and
we'll say please use this form to
contact us all right and then in the
form I'm going to wrap the label and the
input in a div let's say label will say
label for name and then have an input
we'll give it a name of name no value
copy that
let's actually let's put a line break
right here after the label and then
we'll paste this in two more times this
one will be for email this one will be
for message and this is not going to be
an input it's going to be a text area
give it a name message
remember text areas have a closing tag
inputs don't have to and then finally
just need a submit button so let's do
button type submit there we go so that
should be that should be all the mock-up
okay so now it looks like so you
have to add all our custom CSS so let's
go to style dot CSS and we're going to
basically work to stay in the same
direction that we did the HTML so let's
start with the body this will wrap
around everything obviously we're going
to change the font or we're going to add
a font family and let's say we want to
use open sans alright and then as a
fallback will do sans
Seraph all right I'm going to change the
font size to 17 pixels make it a little
bigger set the line height which is the
height in between each line which will
set to 1.5 m TIG HT and let's see what
else I'm going to set margin and padding
to zero on the body just so there's no
space around the website okay that
should be good let's check it out reload
now our fonts have changed ah let's see
so let's add let's add our common
classes I guess which we don't have much
I think we just have primary text so
primary text is going to have color
which is going to be a hexadecimal value
okay so it's going to be this right here
five six a seven nine a it's kind of a
green color and then I'm also good at we
didn't use it but I'm also going to add
a primary background and then set that
to background of that color just in case
you want to use that as a background
alright so after that let's do the
header okay so remember we gave it an ID
of main header and the only thing I want
to do here is put a board our bottom
which will be one pixels
it'll be solid and it'll be this color
here alright so let's take a look at
that pretty load there we go so now we
want to do the nav bar we don't we want
this to be in line so it goes you know
horizontally so what's out a comment
here will say now bar and see that had
an ID I believe of navbar rank so for
the actual core nav bar all I want to do
is set text transform
to uppercase
all right now obviously you could have
just typed in uppercase letters but you
want to keep it so that if you wanted to
change that you don't have to edit the
mock-up you could simply change this all
right now for the navbar Li tags for
those we want to display in line meaning
side by side all right and then we'll
set up padding right set of padding
right of 20 pixels and then we'll set
list style none so that there's no
bullet points so let's check that out
pretty load there we go
now for the links we want to change the
color we also want to remove that
underline so let's say navbar a we're
going to say text decorate or none temp
set the color of them to 888 which is a
light gray actually this should be text
decoration not decorator all right now
for the hover state and the current
state those are going to have the same
styling so we're going to say now Li dot
current and we want to make sure we
style the link that's inside that and
then we also want now to our links that
are hovered all right so we're going to
change the color to the green color
which is this right here this is where
staff comes in handy we could just put
that color on a variable and and not
have to repeat it here but that's more I
want I want this to be very very
beginner friendly hopefully it is
hopefully you guys are understanding Oh
see we're also going to put a border
bottom which will be three pixels pretty
pixels
solid and it's going to be that green
color all right and then I just want to
add a little padding to the bottom to
kind of push the border down a little
and that'll be three pixels all right
let's check it out reload good
so our header is done right yeah I think
so let me just check something in the
HTML oh yeah you see how this here looks
like it's not quite in the middle it
needs to be pushed down so I want to set
the row to to align to the middle so in
the header where we have the row with
these ends we're also going to add
middle alright let's see if that works
so index page reload and it pushed it
down now we're going to have to add that
to all the pages so let's copy that
let's go to a boat and put that right
here go to contact put that right here
I already did index and services where
is it the hell is it right here alright
so let's get up to you on all pages good
all right so we're always showcase now
we're going to move on to this which is
the showcase so let's see style.css
all right so I D showcase so for the
showcase itself we want a background
image all right so it's a background
it's going to be from a URL and it's
going to be dot dot slash images meaning
that we need to go out of the CSS folder
that we're currently in and then into
images all right and then it's going to
be a file called showcase dot jpg okay
now we're going to set that to no-repeat
because by default it'll just keep
repeating all right and then we want to
Center the image top and horizontally
and vertically all right and then let's
set a border bottom to the showcase it's
going to be the same as the header just
like this okay and then let's also set a
margin bottom to push everything under
it down 30 pixels now remember we
aligned the showcase stuff to the middle
so we want to apply a height to the row
because that's where the middle
alignment was applied so let's say
showcase row and we're going to set the
height to 600 pixels all right so let's
go reload and there we go 600 pixels it
now has a background image now let's do
this stuff here so let's see so we have
an h1 so showcase h1 and we're going to
set the font size to be pretty big it's
going to be 50 pixels and then we're
going to set margin to zero because by
default each one's will have margin and
then padding bottom because we want to
move we want to push the text under it
down 20 pixels all right let's look at
that okay and then for the paragraph
under it
patting on pipe power graphs by default
have a margin of 10 pixels on top and
bottom so we're going to remove that and
make this lighter so let's say showcase
paragraph and we'll set the color the
color of it will be set to CCC which is
like grey and let's remove the margin
all right now we wrapped the heading and
the paragraph in a class called showcase
content at least we should have let me
just double check oh no I didn't so I'm
just going to add on to this class here
showcase - content because we need to
add that background now the dark
background color so down here we'll say
showcase class showcase content and C
we're going to add a background of 333
we're going to set the color to white
we're going to set the border radius to
90 pixels make it very rounded and we're
going to set the padding inside of it to
40 pixels and then we're going to set
the opacity which will make it
transparent to 0.9 so that way it'll be
a little bit see-through so let's reload
and there we go now the background the
section content has the same class as
the row right so we want I want this to
be a little so I don't want so much
space on the sides so let's go to our
index and instead of using 12 for all of
these let's do one second let's do for
the large seven for the medium we'll do
10 actually we'll do 10 for the rest
because right now it's set to 12
all right so let's go reload and now
that's shorter and if we resize this
you'll see it looks pretty good now
where we start to get issues is here
which is extra small and why is this
that shouldn't be like that
let me just check the header real quick
so we have a row main header just see
what's going on here middle LG and o XS
when it's in its mobile view should be
centered so we just want to add on to
this right here we'll say centre XS
there we go
perfect now we're going to have to add
that to the rest of the temp the rest of
the files as well that contact and
services all right
so let's see so far the for this right
here I think obviously I don't like that
what I'm going to do is add in a media
query so media queries allow us to set
specific styles for specific screen
sizes so let's go to our style sheet and
go down to the bottom that's where I
usually put these so media queries so
the way that we define this is by saying
at media and then in here takes a
parameter of let's say max width and
we'll say 800 pixels
all right so anything styles we put in
here will only apply if it's under 800
pixels so I'm going to say showcase each
one and I'm going to make the font size
smaller so font size will be 30 pixels
if it's under 800 pixels wide so let's
check it out okay so that made it
smaller now I also want to make the
padding less if it's below 500 pixels so
that would be something like this okay
so that looks good up until it gets to
about 500 pixels and then the padding
forces it to be on double on two lines
so let's just copy this and this will be
for 500 pixels or less and we're going
to set the showcase showcase content and
we're going to set that to padding still
going to have 40 pixels on the top and
bottom but only ten on the left and
right as opposed to 40 all around and
now if we reload now it looks good
alright so it's very responsive up to
this point so let's move on to the core
features so go back to our style sheet
and go right here and I'll say features
okay and just check this out real quick
sorry about that this video is getting
really long
see features all right so let's start
off with the h2 at the top features h2
and we're going to set the font size set
the font size to 35 pixels we're going
to set the margin to 0 and we're going
to simply padding-bottom to 10 pixels
all right so that pertains to this right
here now for the paragraph underneath
let's do that okay so we're going to say
color is going to be 880 which is a
light gray we also want to remove the
margin and we want to set margin bottom
to 40 pixels all right now for the icons
they're way too small so we're going to
say features I are actually nodes be
more specific and say dot fa so the font
awesome classes and we'll set the font
size to 60 pixels and we'll also set the
color of them to that green color which
is this right here whoops all right
going right here all right
let's take a look at that there we go so
that's it for the feature section now
for the info let's go down let's go
there
so we'll say info and see you'll say ID
info we're actually going to set a
background image for that okay so it's
going to go outside of images I mean
outside of CSS into images and then it's
called info dash B G dot jpg all right
we're going to set that to no-repeat and
let's just make the color
white and actually know what the let's
let's also add a color to the background
so we want to do three three three so
let's check that out alright so that
looks good now four five see if we want
to do the h2 and then we want to do the
list here the unordered list so let's
say info h2 and all we're going to do
for this is we're going to change the
font size to 35 pixels and we're going
to set margin zero and padding bottom 10
pixels all right then we're going to do
the UL trying to speed it up here a
little bit so the UL is going to have a
line height I mean I'm sorry I list
style of none because we don't want to
show the bullets and we're answer the
padding to zero because by default the
UL has a padding of 10 pixels all right
and then we'll do the Allies which will
have a line height want those to be a
little further apart so we'll say to em
and let's say font size 20 pixels and
that should be it for the info so let's
reload and good so now the company area
right here remember it has an ID of
company okay so company we're going to
set the background to 333 which is dark
grey and we're going to set the color to
white and we're going to set the padding
to 10 pixels zero alright and then the
h4 so company h4 and that's going to be
we're going to make that uppercase so
text transform uppercase and we're going
to set the margin bottom to zero
and then for the UL which is under the
contact C Company ul and will set the
padding to zero we're going to set the
lift style to none
you can put list-style on either ul or
Li and then we'll set the line height -
what - M alright so let's check out the
company area all we need to set the
color to white I didn't do that
oh all right you know what let's also do
this text area and the button I want
them to be kind of just higher increase
the height or the padding so let's do
company and then we can target a
specific type of input we want the text
so we can actually do brackets and then
type equals text and for that let's do
padding seven pixels and then we'll do
the button and for the button we're
going to say background - - - color
white padding 10 pixels and water zero
here we go so that looks a little
cleaner and then the footer let's see
the footer is actually going to be that
green color so let's say what I call it
main footer I think main footer let's
set the background to where is it right
here again this is where staff comes in
handy also we could nest our styles with
sass all right so that's the background
that means we need to make the color
white all right so now all we have to do
is the inner page styles if we go to
about about looks pretty good one thing
I want to do is the pay all of these
have IDs of pages I just want to add a
margin bottom to push the footer down a
little more so let's go over here and
let's say ID page margin bottom forty
pixels all right now for the services
page which remember is basically just a
UL we're going to say dot services
because remember the page had a class of
services so we could target that page
and then I want to get the UL allies and
I'm going to add I'm going to get rid of
the bullets and then I'm going to add
padding of ten pixels all right and then
every odd one I want to have a
background of dark grey and then every
even should have the green background so
we can use css3 for that saying oops so
the services class
ull eyes and then we can use this end
child all right and then we can grab on
to all the odd ones okay and then let's
say background will be dark gray color
white and then let's copy that and then
this one's going to be four even and
that's going to have the green color so
let's check that out go to services and
there we go
so now every EF even if we add more it's
going to stay in that pattern which is
cool alright so last thing is the
contact page we just want to kind of add
a dark background to that so let's say
contact and see ID contact now we want
to target the form and that's what we're
going to add the background to color
should be white and let's see padding
will say 20 pixels alright then we want
to target the inputs the text inputs of
the contact form this should actually be
a class contact so form inputs that have
the type of text and we want to make
these wider so we'll say with 50 percent
of its at the container and let's give
it a height of 30 pixels and let's give
it margin bottom of 10 pixels all right
then we want to do the text area I'm
going to copy that and we'll change this
to text area with 50 percent and then
for the height we can do 100 pixels all
right and then finally the button say
form button
and see we're going to do with 50%
padding is going to be ten on the top
and bottom zero on the sides border will
be zero background will be two two two
and color will be white alright and then
finally the labels so contact form label
I just want those to the upper case so
text transform proper case whoops that's
funny I actually hit the upper case key
when I was typing upper case alright so
we should be all set let's take a look
BAM we can't see the labels though what
did I not put the text in let's see
what's where is it labeled i hain't put
any text in here it sucks when you mess
up but it's such a stupid like small
mess up that I'm not going to go back
and take that out of the video it's sane
alright so reload and there we go
there's our form alright so like I said
this isn't the best looking template but
I don't think it's horrible and it's you
know hopefully it taught you a little
something about html5 syntax and CSS I
mean I want I wanted this to be a good
tutorial for beginners that are just
learning how to build websites and you
eyes in flexbox grid take it or leave it
some people might not like it you may
just want to use just flex box or just
bootstrap and use that grid system but I
think it's a it's a pretty good
alternative it's much easier to use than
you know natural flexbox but hopefully
you guys like this I'm going to be
coming out I'm going to start on a udemy
course for front-end development it's
going to be like a mega course gonna
have all kinds of technologies in it I'm
going to make a video about it soon but
hopefully you guys like this if you did
please leave the like please subscribe
whatever you can do is fine and thanks
