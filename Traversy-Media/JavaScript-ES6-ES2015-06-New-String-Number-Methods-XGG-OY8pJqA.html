some of the new string features our
string methods that are available with
es6 alright and these are used to target
expressions inside of the string so
first thing we'll do is create a string
call this the string and let's do hello
my name is Brad and I love JavaScript
alright so we have a string now this
three methods that I want to show you
the first one is starts with second one
is ends with third one is includes and
you may know what these do just by
reading the names but let's say console
dot log and we're going to use the
string variable and from there we're
going to say dot starts with and let's
pass in hello okay we save that reload
and we get true because it starts with
hello if I take off this e I'm sorry
this H and save it we get false if I
take it off here save it obviously we
get true okay so very simple can just
give you a true or false
to see depending on what if the string
starts with okay n with also is pretty
much the same thing just on the other
side all right so let's say the string
dot ends with let's see what it ends
with javascript if we say javascript
save it reload we get true take off the
T reload we get false take it off up
here we get true again all right so
that's ends with now we have includes
okay so let's change ends with 2includes
if we leave JavaScript and there we get
true if we put the word love in there
which isn't at the beginning or end it's
in the middle with that still true okay
because includes we'll get it from
anywhere if we put loves and we reload
we get false because the word loves is
not anywhere in there all right so
that's how these three methods work now
I wasn't going to stick it in here but
this video was really short so we're
also going to go over some of the number
methods that are available all right so
are nothing just the number of methods
but just different features for numbers
so for instance if we want hexadecimal
value JavaScript es5 supported that so
for instance if we want to say 0 x FF
okay if we go run that we get 255 all
right this is hexadecimal with es6 now
we can also use binary alright so if we
say console dot log and let's do 0 B 1 0
1 0 1 1 that gives us 43 in addition to
binary we can also use octal so let's do
0 and then the letter O and then 5 4 3
preload and we get 355 all right so we
can use hexadecimal binary and octal
notation next thing we have some number
methods so let's say console dot log
number dot is finite alright we want to
pass something in here let's say 3 I'm
actually going to just comment these out
ok so if we go ahead and reload we get
true ok 3 obviously is finite if we do
negative 3 it's true still finite if we
put in infinity and reload we get false
obviously infinity is not finite if we
put n a n or not a number reload we get
false ok because that's also not finite
alright so that's 1 we also have one
called is NaN which is pretty
self-explanatory you can probably guess
what this is of course it's true we're
checking to see if nan is nan if we put
a number in here ok that's going to be
false we could put string in here that's
going to be false the only thing that's
going to be true is nan alright and then
the last one I want to show you is is
integer ok so that checks to see if
something is an integer let's go ahead
and run nan that's false if we run two
that should give us true even if we do a
negative two that should also be true
okay if we do let's say infinity that's
false alright so those are some of the
new number methods in the next video
we're going to take a look at how to use
default parameters in es6 as well as the
spread operator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
