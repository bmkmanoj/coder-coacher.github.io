going to build a mobile first responsive
contact form now we're going to be using
some CSS 3 techniques we're going to use
a little bit of grid CSS now we're just
building the UI we're not going to build
a back-end what I'm going to do is I'm
going to save that for another video
we'll implement this probably in PHP or
some kind of back-end server side
language but we're going to build the
front-end now this is what it's going to
look like and when I say mobile first
what I mean is just that we start off
with designing it for a mobile screen
for small screens and then we'll
gradually add in media queries to to
change it for larger screens so this is
what it's going to look like on mobile
screens and as I go up you'll see when I
hit around 700 pixels it's going to
change and the grids going to change so
that we have one fractional and two
fractional okay a fractional is just a
unit in in the CSS grid layout so that's
what it'll look like on desktops as the
max width of I think 1170 I think all
right so that's we'll be building in
this video guys like I said we will
later on do a back end so that it'll
actually send an email or maybe we won't
blend like firebase or something like
that I don't know you guys can leave
some suggestions in the comments but
that's what we doing so let's get
started so if you guys really like my
videos and you learn a lot from them and
maybe have a couple extra dollars to
spare check out my patreon page I'm
working on creating special content for
patrons you also get special deals on
future courses and there's even an email
support here for all YouTube videos and
projects to learn more visit patreon.com
slash traversée media alright guys so
we're going to get started here now
usually in these types of videos
front-end HTML CSS I use the atom text
editor if you guys follow my channel you
probably know that I usually use vyas
code for more backend stuff or even like
angular CLI stuff where I use the
command line a lot but I've been using
vyas code more lately and I'm leaning
towards that over atom I think it's
faster and there's a couple other perks
that I like about it
now usually I'll use atom live server so
that it opens up my
project on my localhost I'm now using
four BS codes something called live
server if you go down to this icon here
this is the this will show you all your
extensions or plugins you'll see I have
one called live server if you want this
you just search for a live server and it
will pop up and it will have a little
green install just click that and that
will install it now one thing I thought
was really cool is when I looked at the
documentation here this little image
they have this Acme web design this is
actually my project they took this from
my YouTube YouTube HTML responsive
website tutorial which is absolutely
fine I'm not complaining or anything
it's actually kind of flattering there's
no license on it or anything so they're
free to use it but I thought that was
pretty cool
and really surprising but anyway so we
have that installed so I'm just going to
go back to my folder here now what I
have is an empty folder called
responsive form so just create that
somewhere on your computer and we're
going to create an index.html file all
right so we're going to need that and
then we're also going to need a CSS file
so we'll create a file called style dot
CSS okay those are the only two files
were going to need here and we're going
to start off with the HTML now I'm also
using Emmet which is actually installed
by default on Visual Studio code if
you're using atom or sublime text or
something if you want to use Emmet
you'll have to install it as a plug-in
or an extension alright now once you
have that you can just do exclamation
and tab actually mine is set to control
tab but that'll give you just a basic
HTML layout and also give you a viewport
meta tag which is very important when it
comes to responsiveness and we're just
going to go ahead and just change the
title here to just say Acme web design
alright and then we're going to need to
link to our CSS files so we're going to
go ahead and put a link tag in here to
style dot CSS alright now to start the
server all we have to do is right click
and say open live server and that should
open up automatically the default port
is going to be fifty fifty-five hundred
and there's obviously there's nothing
here because we don't have anything in
our body yet so we're going to start
with the HTML which is going to be
actually very simple so
we're going to create a container so it
did with the class of container and then
inside that we're going to have an h1
with the class of brand so this will be
like the logo look what's going on here
this control tab is kind of messing with
me lately and inside the h1 let's say
Acme web design and a lot of you guys
probably notice that I uploaded this
video earlier I did some some pretty
crazy misspellings
I put Ames web design instead of acne I
also did some other little flops that
that a lot of you guys probably wouldn't
have even noticed but they bothered me
so I'm redoing the video plus I wanted
to mention that we're going to be doing
a back end later on alright so let's go
ahead and create another div with the
class of wrapper this is actually going
to be what we're going to apply the grid
to and in this wrapper we're going to
have basically two divs one is going to
be for the the company info and let me
just grab we grab the finished product
real quick just so I can I can show you
so this here pot this is going to be
company info and this is going to be
contact okay those are going to be the
two divs so let's say company
- info and then under that we'll have
contact and if you guys hear my son
upstairs I apologize for that he's being
kind of loud so in the company info
we're going to have another a we're
gonna have an h3 and again we're going
to say Acme web design make sure I
spelled it right this time
and under that we're going to have a ul
and inside look inside the UL we're
going to have three allies with Emmet we
can actually do Li asterisk 3 and then
tab and it'll give us 3 allies so we're
going to have the address the street
address which I'm going to say 44
something Street then we'll have the
we're going to have the phone number I'm
just going to do all fives here
and then we'll have the email so we'll
just say test and test stock will so
test at Acme dot test all right so let's
go ahead and save that and this will
auto auto load if using the dev server
it'll auto load and that's pretty much
all we need in the company info all
right now in the contact we're going to
have our form but we're first going to
have an h3 so let's go ahead and say h3
we'll say email us and then under that
we're going to have our form okay we're
not going to need an action because
again we're just doing the front end
we're not actually going to be
submitting it yet and then each label
and input combination is going to be
wrapped in a paragraph so let's put a
paragraph and then a label we don't
really need a for attribute inside the
label this is going to be for the name
and then under that we'll have an input
with the type of text and we'll give our
inputs a name attribute this one is
going to be name and then what I'm going
to do is copy that and then we're going
to do C 2 3 4 5 I believe we're going to
do 1 2 3 4 5 yeah
so after name we're going to have the
company so this will be the company name
and then we'll have the email and for
email we can change the type from text
to email and next we'll have the phone
or most a phone number and we'll change
the name to phone let's actually change
email to email address and then right
here is going to be the message okay
message is going to be a text area not
an input so we'll go ahead and say text
area name is going to be message and
text areas need to have a closing tag so
we're going to do that let's also give
it a rose attribute to make it a little
bigger a little higher all right and
then we're also going to need a submit
button I'm also going to put that in a
paragraph so this is going to have a
we'll just do button so button and we'll
just say submit all right so that's our
form would save it and it looks
absolutely horrible because forms look
atrocious without any CSS pretty much
all HTML does so that's it for the HTML
now we're going to style the CSS so
let's go to style dot CSS and we're
going to start basically from top to
bottom now what I want to do is is I
want to take the asterisk which means
everything okay so this this is
basically going to apply to all elements
and I'm just going to apply a box sizing
property so box
- sizing and we're going to set it to
border box alright and what that's going
to do is it's going to take when
whenever there's any width it's going to
factor in the margin and the padding
into that with okay instead of adding it
on to it so we want to make sure we do
that for everything and then we're going
to say for the body we want a background
of blue now the blue we're doing is
actually going to be a hexadecimal it's
going to be nine to be so nine to be de
seven it's de seven and with vs code
you'll see it actually shows us the
color which is really cool if you're
using atom you can use a plugin called
pigments which will do the same thing
look what the heck so let's see what
else we're doing for the body let's set
the color the color is going to be a
dark blue that's also going to be a
hexadecimal value of four eight five e
74 okay and you can see that that is a
dark blue let's also set the line height
to be a little bigger so line height is
basically the space in between the text
so it's going to be one point six we're
also going to set the font family so
font family and I'm actually going to
use this right here I don't know how to
pronounce this see Goose say go you eye
and then with a backup of two whole my
geneva verdana and then sans-serif so
that's what our font is going to be so
if I save this you'll see that it'll
update all right so we have our blue
background we have our font
last thing that I want to do in the body
is just add a little bit of padding
we're going to set it to 1m and save all
right so that's the body next we're
going to move on to the container which
wraps around everything we're going to
set a width for the container or I'm
sorry a max width because we want this
to be responsive max width of 11 70
pixels okay and then we're going to set
just Auto margin on the left and right
so set that to auto and then we're also
going to set padding:1em as well all
right so there's our container now if I
were to make this bigger you'll see that
it'll stay in the middle okay so it's
going to have a max width of 1 170 all
right so next thing we're going to work
on is let's jump to the UL so all the
unordered lists we're going to set the
list style to none we don't want any
bullets okay that will get rid of the
bullets we also want to get rid of the
default padding that a ul has and that
should be it so notice that I just did
ul now this is going to pertain to any
unordered list that's on this page so
even if we add another ul later on to
the page this will pertain to it okay
but a lot of the Styles we're going to
we're going to you know make them only
for for instance the contact form so
we'll do like if we wanted to do the UL
specifically inside company info we do
dot company info ul all right hopefully
that makes sense now for the brand
the Acme web design what I want to do
for that is just Center it
yeah just text-align:center okay move
that over and then one thing I forgot to
do is for the the other word Acme in the
H not the h3 the h1 in the branding I
want to wrap that in a span because I
want to make that white
make that a different color than the
rest so we'll wrap a span around that
and then what we'll do is we'll say
brand span and we'll say color white
okay just gives it a little bit of I
don't know a better look I think so next
thing we're going to do is the wrapper
so the wrapper it goes around everything
okay so let's go ahead and say dot
wrapper and the wrapper we're going to
add a box shadow so we want a box shadow
to go all the way around and we're going
to set this to zero zero twenty pixels
zero and then we're going to do for the
color an RGB a value okay now the RGB a
we're going to do the same color as the
dark blue like this dark blue except
we're going to add a little bit of
opacity so the RGB value is going to be
72 for red it's going to be 94 for green
and it's going to be 116 for blue and
then for the opacity we're going to do
0.7 all right so let's go ahead and save
that and now you can see we have this
border shadow around the whole wrapper
now as far as padding what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take the wrapper and
I'm going to say all the direct elements
everything inside the wrapper I'm going
to give a pat I'm going to give a
padding of 1m so we'll save that and you
can see it's added padding to everything
inside directly inside the wrapper all
right so now we're going to work on the
company info which is this area right
here so let's say dot company info and
we're going to give this a light blue
background so the hexadecimal for that
is going to be C 9 e 6 FF okay we'll
save that you can see now it has a light
blue background let's see I also want to
add a little bit of style to the h3 and
the UL right here so it's a dot company
info h3 and also
company info ul okay so I want both to
be aligned to the center say that and
also for the margin I wanted to be zero
everywhere except the bottom I want to
do one ramp and that's it so that's it
for the company info so for the contact
area this right here I want to add a a
white color or a light grey light bluish
kind of color so it's a contact and
we're going to say background and the
value for this is going to be f9f e FF
okay so I think there's a tint of blue
in there looks like it save that or
maybe not but I know it looks alright so
that's going to be the background now
the rest of this stuff here is going to
be part of the form so I'm going to put
a comment here just a form styles so
this will be like the inputs and stuff
let's do the form itself so contact form
what we're saying here is we're taking
the div that has the the class of
contact and then we're targeting the
form tag okay right here so for this we
want to actually make it a grid I'm
going to say display grid and we're
going to say we want the grid template
columns grid template columns we're
going to do one fractional and one
fractional and if I save that it'll
split it up into one and one all right
and if you want to know more about the
grid CSS I'd suggest watching the crash
course that I did I just did it like I
don't know a week and a half ago we're
also going to add a little bit of grid
gap mostly 20 pixels save that and that
should be good for the form itself now
for the label say contact form label
we're just going to display as a block
make sure it's displayed as a block and
let's see now see how there's so much
space in between these inputs that's
from the power
our margin so what we're going to do is
say contact form paragraphs and we want
to set the margin to zero and save okay
I think it's a default
I think paragraphs have it either a five
or ten pixel top and bottom I can't
remember now
we have an issue here and that's that
the message in the submit I want those
two to both be on the same you know to
have their own row here with the grid so
what we can do is we can use a property
called grid column so let's say contact
we're going to say contact form and
we're going to have a class of full okay
now we haven't applied that class yet so
let's go back to our HTML and the
paragraph with the message we're going
to give a class of full and the
paragraph with the submit button we're
going to give a class of full and then
what we'll do is we'll say grid column
and we're going to say one two three
so we basically wanted to stretch out
one two three so if I save it you'll see
now they're on their own line and
they're actually going to stretch out
all the way now the reason they're not
stretched out is because we need to
actually set the width of the text area
and the input or though I'm sorry the
button to 100% alright so yeah let's go
ahead and do that so we'll say dot
contact form button okay so we want the
button we also want contact both contact
form
let's do inputs because I also want the
inputs to be a hundred percent and also
contact form text area okay so all of
these should have a width of 100% save
and now it goes all the way across all
right so let's now take care of let's
see actually know what we're going to
give that a padding to so all of these
will have a padding of 1m there we go
and now we want to take care of the
button because that button doesn't look
very good
so let's say contact target the forum
and then the button inside that forum so
we're going to give it a background okay
the background is going to be a
hexadecimal of c9e so c 9 e 6 FF save
that you can see that colors change now
with buttons you need to set the etudes
deal with the border because that
doesn't look very good so we're just
going to set the border to 0 all right
and then let's see we also want to do I
want to make the the text I want to make
it uppercase so I'm going to use the
text transform property and say
uppercase okay so now let's take care of
the hover and the focus state of the
button I want it to be a different color
so I'll say contact form button colon
hover comma and then let's also do the
focus so call :
and let's see we're going to change the
background to the same color let's see
it's going to be wait a minute c9e yeah
so the focus we're going to change it to
the same color as the B the background
I'm sorry the background text like this
is that right it doesn't look right no
no same color is the background so this
is this hexadecimal value right here
this 9 to be de 7 so let's go ahead and
paste that in alright we'll save it and
now when we hover over it you can see
that it changes color so I also want to
change the color of the text to white
when we hover over it okay so change the
text changes to white let's also set the
outline to zero and then I want to add a
transition instead of just changing like
quickly like that I wanted to slowly
fade in so we're going to use the CSS
transition prop
so we want to say transition the
background-color transition the
background color and then the length
we'll say two seconds and then we'll say
ease out so I'll save and now when I
hover over it you'll see that in two
seconds it slowly fades into the color
alright just a an added effect I guess
alright so looking pretty good let's do
let's take care of the border so the
border for the actually all of them yeah
so we can go right here where we have
the button the input in the text area
and we'll add a border of one pixel
solid and for the color we're going to
use that that's C 9e c 9e 6ff or and
save and now we have a light blue border
okay let's see so just about done with
the mobile version yeah that looks good
now if I if I were to make this bigger
it's going to it's not going to change
it's just it this is we've done what
we've done is mobile first we've we've
dealt with the small screen size first
so now what we'll do is we'll add a
media query for bigger sizes so let's go
down to the bottom here and I'll just
put a comment will say large screens and
we're going to add a media query so
we'll say add media and we're going to
say inside here is a parameter we're
going to do a min width so men - width
of 700 pixels and what now what this
means is that any styles we put within
this these curly braces they're only
going to be in effect if that's if the
window if the screen size is bigger than
700 pixels so just to test it out let's
just say body display:none and save and
you'll see everything just went away
because the screen size is bigger than
700 pixels
but if I make it smaller once it hits
below 700 it comes back okay the body is
no longer display:none so that we know
that the media query works now what
we're going to do is take the wrapper
and we're going to just we're going to
say display grid and we're going to set
we're going to change the grid template
column we're going to set it to one
fractional and then to fractional and
save and now if we look what it's done
is it's taken the the info the company
info area and moved it to the side okay
so this is the one fractional and this
is the two now I also want to increase
the padding a little bit on bigger
screens so we're going to say dot
wrapper and then all elements inside the
wrapper we're going to set the padding
to 2m instead of one okay and then the
last thing I want to do is I don't want
this stuff to be centered that or the
branding so we're going to say company
company info and we want the h3 also the
company info ul and also the brand what
I'm going to do is text a line to the
left and save and now you'll see those
are no longer centered okay so this is
going to be the desktop view and if we
go back down to mobile everything goes
back to how we had it all right so
that's going to be it for the basic
design now just for an added bonus we're
going to add some icons we're also going
to add animate CSS so let's go ahead and
grab the yeah oh that confuse me so this
is the finished one you see we have the
icons I'm just going to close that so we
don't get confused so let's just search
for the font awesome CDN and it's going
to be the first link here so we'll grab
the link tag and copy we're going to go
up to the top of the HTML file and we'll
put it in right above our style
CSS let me just wrap this so you guys
can see everything all right so now that
we have font awesome we can now add our
icon so I'm going to go right where we
have the street name inside the Li we're
going to have an eye tag with a class of
FA and also a class of FA - Road look
we're going to put a space after it like
that all right so that will give us a
little street icon I'm going to copy
this paste it in here this one is going
to be FA phone and then for this one
here this is going to be FA - envelope
and we'll save it let's go back and now
we have our icons alright so last thing
I'm going to do is the animate CSS so
I'm going to say animate CSS CDN and
we're going to grab this right here
we'll say copy link tag put it in right
under font awesome and all we're going
to do is need to be just going to add
two classes to the wrapper so we're
going to add animated which just tells
it that we want it to use animate CSS
and then whatever the type of animation
we want the one we want is actually let
me check bounce in left so bounce in
left and save and let's reload and
you'll see it just comes in from the
left so that's going to be it for this
video like I said I will look into doing
a back-end setup for this I think the
most practical thing would be PHP
especially if you wanted to send an
actual email another thing we could do
is we could set it we could link it to
some kind of database whether it you
know is through PHP to MySQL or we could
hook up some JavaScript and we could
make it go to firebase or to MongoDB M
lab has a really good data API which is
a remote MongoDB database so if you guys
want to leave some suggestions that's
alright but I think PHP would probably
be the most practical and especially
when it comes to deploying you could
just throw it right up on a you know
Hostgator shared hosting or what
so that's going to be it guys now I do
realize that my content has been very
diverse lately I hope you guys can
appreciate that I know some of you are
you know really hardcore programmers
that might may be saying you know I want
to be able to build a fucking contact
form you know I want to get into you
know graph QL and MongoDB and Redis and
back-end stuff but realize that you know
half of my subscribers are pretty new to
web development they're front-end
developers and you know I want to tend
to them as well so I'm trying to be very
diverse hopefully I'm doing a pretty
good job with that and keeping you guys
happy so that's it thanks for watching
