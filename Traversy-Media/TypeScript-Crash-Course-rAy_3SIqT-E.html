right reversing media this is going to
be a video and tutorial on typescript
all right so what is typescript
it was created by Microsoft and it's a
superset of JavaScript so if you don't
know what it's superset is it's
basically anything you can do in
JavaScript you can also do in typescript
so it inherits all the functionality of
JavaScript and then add some extra
features and syntax which we'll go over
in a minute another example of superset
is objective-c which is a superset of
the C language so typescript compiles or
trans compiles into standard JavaScript
because the browser can't read a
typescript file it can only read
JavaScript there's a program called TS c
that we can use to compile it easily
typescript can be integrated into
JavaScript products quite products
projects quite easily and it was
designed for larger applications now of
course you could use it with small apps
but if you have a very small codebase it
might just be a waste extra step to add
typescript all right so we know what
typescript is but what does it do what
does it offer us so first of all it
gives us static type checking by default
javascript is an untyped language
meaning that we don't have to specify
variable or type or function types and
what I mean by types is a string or
number array and so on high level
languages like Java they require you to
specify your types and although it's an
extra step it does have a lot of
advantages all right and the great thing
about typescript is that it static
typing is completely optional so you
don't have to do it all right we also
get class-based objects with typescript
if you have any experience with PHP or
Python or Java you've probably worked
with classes in object-oriented
programming with standard JavaScript es5
you had these prototypes which is kind
of confusing and annoying with the new
es6 standard we can use classes and
typescript is
compatible with es6 as well now
typescript also makes JavaScript more
modular so we can do things like import
other files and other modules and
components also we get all the es6
features like arrow functions and we can
use wet and Const for declaring
variables things like that
alright so overall it gives us a syntax
that's closer to higher-level languages
like Java and Scala
alright so static type checking one of
the main features hence the word
typescript we can check and assign types
for variables parameters and functions
so like I said this is completely
optional it's not going to throw an
error if you don't use it the only time
it's going to throw an error that you do
assign a certain type to a variable and
then you try to fill it with the wrong
type so if you say if you typecast it as
a string and then you put a number in it
static types also will they'll find and
prevent bugs and stop future issues from
happening
not only that but it makes our code much
more readable and descriptive especially
if we're sharing that code with others
so here are the types we can use in
typescript so we have basic types such
as strings numbers boolean's which are
true/false values and arrays and then we
also have to be any type which is just
that it can be anything and any kind of
type void which is no type returned
we have null or undefined a tuple which
is an array with a fixed number of
elements enum which are enumerated
values and then generics which specify
the type of constraint ok this is great
for a reusable code it's a little more
advanced and we might get into it later
I'm not exactly sure all right so
another huge advantage to typescript is
the use of classes so this gives us the
ability to use true object-oriented
programming in our JavaScript
applications we can define classes
properties methods we can stop using
prototype based objects
it provides us with encapsulation and
keeps all the functionality of certain
resources in one place so if we have a
blog on our website we can we can have a
blog or a post class and we can keep all
that functionality inside of that class
and then use it when needed let's see so
inheritance we can inherit classes and
have subclasses and we can even use
access modifiers like public protected
and private and this using classes is is
alone is a great reason to use
typescript all right so as I mentioned
typescript files need to be compiled
that the browser doesn't read typescript
this is done with the typescript
compiler which is called TFC so
basically it takes to the dot ts files
and transpile them into dot j s files
and then we can just include those files
in our HTML
all right so TS c can be installed with
npm which is the node package modules so
you'll just need to install nodejs on
your system you can follow along with
this tutorial even if you don't know
anything about node so don't worry about
that
and if you do want to learn more about
nodejs I have plenty of videos on my
channel on it it also sports es6 or the
es2015 syntax so we can use let and
const arrow functions and all that good
stuff alright so that's it for the slide
introduction let's go ahead and jump in
and get started with typescript
alright guys we're going to go ahead and
get started with typescript now before
we do anything you need to have no js'
installed so if you don't just go to
node.js org go ahead and download and
install it or if you're on Linux or a
Mac you can install it using your
package managers just make sure you get
that set up alright now as far as code
for a text editor I'm using Visual
Studio code which is really nice for
typescript it is really good
highlighting and error checking so I
would recommend it but of course you can
use whatever you'd like for your text
editor all right so we're going to go
ahead and get started now first thing I
want to do
is I'm going to open up a command line
or your Mac or Linux terminal and we
need to install typescript with NPM okay
so I'm going to say NPM where it doesn't
matter what path you're in because we're
installing it globally just make sure
you do NPM installed - gee that will
install it globally so that you can
access it from anywhere and then you
just want to say typescript
okay I already have installed so that's
why it went so quick now what I'm going
to do is go into a folder where I want
to create my files I'm going to go into
projects and I'm going to create a
directory I'm going to call it TS
sandbox ok and then we'll go into that
okay so we have typescript installed and
what we want to do is I'm going to open
up the folder in my editor and I'm going
to create a file called types dot PS
okay
ts not Jas I would see I'm just going to
close that and from here what we're
going to do is let's just say
console.log hello from TS and we'll save
that and then what we want to do is
compile this typescript file into
JavaScript so we can say over here T SC
and then the name of the file which is
type dot TS okay and now if you look
over here it can see it created a j/s
file which has the same exact thing in
it it's the same thing because we didn't
put any typescript in the TS file so
it's just it's identical but the j/s is
what you're going to want to include in
your in your application or your website
so if we have an index
dot HTML file here and just paste this
in so just simple HTML and you would
want to say script source and you want
the type dot JS file okay so if we were
to save that and then open it up okay we
get our hello world all right and if we
open up the console we get hello from TS
so all of our work is going to be in the
TS file we don't want to touch the GS
that's just what gets compiled and
what's included in our HTML all right so
let's go ahead and write some typescript
so let's create a variable and we're
going to use wet so let's say let my
string and we're going to give that a
type of string okay and then down here
let's say my strength equals hello world
and then we'll simply console.log my
string all right so if we save that and
we need to compile it so let's go TSC
types TS enter and now if we look at
types J s you'll see this and it doesn't
have that type script in it can I this
right here which is typescript it
compiles it down to standard JavaScript
all right now it can be a pain in the
ass to have to do this every time you
update so what we can do is we can run
the compiler and watch mode so if we do
TF c type dot TS - W that will run it in
watch mode so every time we save this
will this will update and compile it all
right now let's see what happens if we
change my string to
let's say a one okay now notice right
away vias code gives us this error says
type 1 is not assignable to type string
so this editor is really nice for
typescript and I know that there's
there's plugins you can add to sublime
text and add them to do this kind of
thing but I think that this is pretty
cool that it does it off right off the
bat but let's save that and then down
here notice that it says the same thing
we get that error in our console and if
we reload it's going to give us that one
it's not going to give us any browser
hours because we don't want that anyways
this is for the developer not for the
user but that's going to throw an error
so if we do let let's say let mine um
and we'll set that to number say my num
equals 22 let's make this back to a
string okay then we'll console.log my
num save it we get 22 and let's look in
the console and we get no errors I'm
just going to move this up
look okay but if we were to change my
num to a string so we already get the
error there and we get it down here
okay next type we'll look at is boolean
so we'll say let my bool set that to
boolean set it to true save that true we
have no errors if we see if we set this
to false again no errors if we set it to
one we get an error because one is not
assignable to a boolean alright so with
these with let's let's say with numbers
there's quite a few things that we can
use as a number so that an integer
obviously positive or negative we save
that that's fine if we do an expression
so if we can say 5 plus 5 save that
that's ok we can do a decimal please say
5.5 that's fine what else we can do a
hexadecimal so if we do 0x f 0 0 D
that's fine all right
and then for string we can do
concatenated strings so if we were to
concatenate catenate in here a space we
can do that and what's console.log that
okay so that gives us hello world we
could even do a function return as a
string so for instance if we take this
hello
and let's do we'll say hello dot slice
and let's say 0 3 save that you can see
that works that gives us H EA L because
what it's doing is it's just taking the
first three characters of the string
okay but that works that's that's fine
for a string next one we have is any so
if we say let I'm just going to call it
my bar and we'll set it to any and then
we'll say my bar equals five console.log
that okay we get five no errors we can
say hello that's fine we can say true
that's fine so it can be absolutely
anything all right so those are the
simple data types string number boolean
any let's take a look at or raise all
right now there's actually two ways to
define an array type so let's start with
this one we'll say let STR array and
we're going to set that to string but
look but we're going to put these
brackets on the end of it okay so let's
let's call that right STR ing that what
is this error cannot find the name
string oh I put an equal sign okay so
what this is saying is that this has to
be an array of strings so let's go down
here and say STR array equals
hello world and console.log that okay we
get hello world no errors everything's
fine if I were to add in a1 here you'll
see that we get an error we get it down
here as well okay we can also do let num
array and we'll set that to number array
okay we'll set that to say one two three
num array okay everything's fine if I
put string in here we get an error okay
it still works up here but we still are
still getting an error okay we can also
do a an array of boolean so if they let
bool array key putting that equal sign
there and we can do true true false true
okay and that's fine now the other way
that we can define these let me just
comment these out the other way that we
can define arrays is we can say let
string array and we can do array and
then put in our angle bracket angle
brackets and say we want this array to
be a string or strings okay I notice
that we're not getting an error here we
can do the same thing for the other ones
so this will be num array so number and
we can do bool array set that to boolean
okay no errors there everything is good
so let's now look at a tuple which is
basically an array with a defined number
of elements so let's say let will say
string num tuple and we're going to set
that with some brackets and then we'll
say string number so basically what this
has to match is an array with a string
and then a number so down here let's say
string num tuple let's set that to out
see we'll say hello and four okay notice
that ever went away save it everything's
good
if we were to change this to a three we
still get an error and if we change this
to a string we get an error because it
has to match this exactly okay now what
happens if we do match it like like that
and then we add on to it notice that
we're not we're now not getting
any errors this is fine the reason for
that is once you pass that initial
string number pattern you can put
whatever you want it's done a union okay
which is a little weird but that's how
it works okay so that's a tuple let's
see let's look at void undefined and no
okay so if we say my void or not let my
void and we'll set that to void and
let's sit and we can set it here as well
whoops
and then let's log my boys what I need
to change the batteries in this keyboard
all right so log that and we get no so
void can be now let's see let's try
undefined that work yeah it looks like
that works too but if we set it to let's
say 1 we get an error
okay there's also no and undefined types
so let's say my no and my undefined okay
so it looks like undefined is okay for
all of these let's see oh wait we didn't
change this now undefined okay so it is
okay if we change this to null that's
good let's try changing this one to know
and that works as well okay so that's
going to be it for ten types of variable
types I now want to look at functions so
I'm actually going to create a new file
for this so let's create a file called
not types function dot TX
okay and we'll close up types and I'm
going to stop the compiler because we
want to change it now to TS functions
TSW all right and let's include that in
our HTML there's not a lot of purpose to
having this eight this browser opening
and including it in the HTML but what
the hell
all right so functions so let's create a
function here something very simple
we'll say get some okay so this is a
function that's going to take two
numbers and add them so it'll take a num
1 num2 and then we just want to return
num1 plus num2
ok so let's use that little console log
get some and let's say 1 &amp;amp; 4 ok save
that gives us 5 up here we have no
errors obviously because there's no type
script yet
so with functions we can we can add a
type to the parameters as well as the
functions return type so let's say for
the parameter num1 has to be a number
num2 has to be a number okay and then
the function itself the return value
also has to be a number okay so if we
save that everything's fine but let's go
ahead and let's try and return a string
so we'll get rid of that and we'll
return hello and you can see the error
hello is not assignable to type number
if we save it we get that our down here
as well okay so if we try to go right
here and enter a string we get an error
okay assignment argument of type hello
is not assignable to parameter of type
number save it gives us the same error
here okay so you can see that this is
this is making our code much more strict
and just much cleaner in general
now let's uh let's comment this out and
let's create a variable called mice some
and just going to set this variable to a
function okay so function same thing
it's going to take in num1 num2 and
let's same thing return num1 num2 and
then we could simply console dot log my
sum and we'll pass in three whoops three
and five okay we reload we get eight so
let's add to this number I could have
just copied and pasted what I had up
there but whatever
alright actually no you know what I want
to do is I want to say any because what
I want to happen is I want to be able to
put in this a number or the number as a
string type with quotes around it so I
wanted to accept any but I want it to
return a number like this okay so what
we can do here is we can test to see
what type what type of values these are
so let's do an if statement and we'll
say if type of num1 is equal to a string
then what do we want to do we want to
parse it as a number as an integer so
we'll say num1 is then equal to parse
int which is a function that's going to
parse a string as a number
and we'll say num1 okay and then we'll
do the same thing for num2 - copy that
we'll see if num2 is a string then we
want to set num2 to parse int num2 and
then we can return that so now if we
save that everything's okay
and even if I go when I change this
three to a string of three you'll see
there's no error here and everything's
fine
okay so this now accepts strings and
numbers but still returns the number all
right so let's create another function
here I'm going to just comment out the
the log and let's create a function
called get name so this is going to take
in a first name and a last name and
we're going to set these to the string
type and we want this function to also
return string all right and notice that
there's an error because it's not
returning anything which obviously isn't
a string so let's say return first-name
and then what we'll do is just
concatenate a face and then last name
and let's call it down here we'll say
console dot log get name
and we'll say John Doe save that we get
John Doe we get no errors everything's
okay now if you want you can make these
optional so for this last name if we put
a question mark right here that makes
this optional so if we get rid of this
now we're going to get an error while
not an error but we're getting it John
undefined so what we can do is we can
check for to see if last name is
undefined it'll say if last name is
equal to undefined then let's just
return first name okay so then we just
get John all right let's see what else
does I want to do we can also make a
function return void which is basically
not returning anything at all so let's
say function my void and let's say :
void and that's okay because it's not
returning anything no errors if we say
return 3 we're going to get an error
saying 3 is not assignable to the type
of void all right but if we just do
return that's okay as well all right so
those are functions so you can you can
add types to your parameters as well as
your return value
okay so let's save that and close that
up ok I'm going to create another file
here and we're going to look at
interfaces
okay whoops I said Jaya such BTS TF and
we're going to stop this and we just
want to run this on interfaces TF hello
running okay and must be running all
right and then in the index will change
functions to interfaces all right
so what we're going to do here is create
a basic function we're going to call
this show to do and we're going to pass
in here to do and say that this has to
have a title that's a string and then
have to have text which is a string okay
then we'll just console dot log and
let's log to do dot title and we will
concatenate that and say to do dot txt
okay and then let's say show to do and
we'll go we'll create a variable here
called my to do and set that to an
object say title trash and text take out
trash okay and then we'll pass that in
here like that
save it a three load and we get trash
take out trash so what we can do to
clean this up is create an interface all
right now I'm going to copy this I want
the reason I don't delete this stuff is
I want you guys to be able to have it
for reference so I know that I repeat
myself sometimes here but what we're
going to do is create an interface and
we're going to call it to do and we're
going to say that this has to have a
title likho string
a text that's a string and then down
here let's paste in that show to do and
instead of doing this messy crap we can
say to do set that to the interface of
to do okay and then we'll just grab that
let's grab that and this save it reload
and there we go okay no errors if we
were to change this title to let's say a
1 a number we get an error see here it
says the types property title are not
incompatible or are incompatible type
number is not assignable to the string
what else is a is not assignable to
parameter type of to do okay so this is
how you can create an interface so this
looks a lot better than this crap up
here okay it's basically creating your
own type okay so instead of saying you
know to do being a string or an array or
whatever you're saying that you want it
to be a custom type of to do open let's
change that back okay so that's an
interface now the last thing I want to
look at is classes okay so let's go over
here and create a new file called
classes dot TS close that up and then
we'll change this to classes
stop this and we'll say TSC classes
alright so if you know Java PHP Python
any object-oriented programming language
and you've worked with classes this
should be pretty easy to you basically
the same syntax okay so we're going to
say class we'll create a class called
user so a class can have properties and
it can have methods okay a property is
basically just a value a key value pair
and then you have some methods which are
just functions inside the class so let's
give this this give this class of
property of name and we're going to say
this name has to be a string email which
has to be a string and then age which
has to be a number okay those are the
properties of our user now inside of a
class you have something called a
constructor okay this is a special kind
of function or method that runs when you
instantiate an object with this class so
when you create a user this is going to
run and what we want to be able to do is
create a user and pass in this stuff
here and have it added to these
properties so the constructor will take
in a name which will be a string
email which will be a string age which
will be a number and then what we want
to do is assign these to these
properties so we do that with this name
when we use this it pertains to this
class so we want this class name
property and we want to set it to the
name being passed in same thing with the
email same thing with the age
all right and then let's just do a
message here we'll just say console dot
log and we'll say user created and then
we can just concatenate this dot name so
that's a class and what we want to do is
create a user object so to do that we
can create a variable let's say let
we'll call it John so let John equals
new user all right now I'm going to pass
in those three things it's name is email
and his age okay notice the error thing
went right away so that's going to
create a new user let's go ahead and
save that and if we reload here you'll
see user created John Doe alright so we
have a class with our static typing
something you definitely can't do with
regular JavaScript now with es6 with the
newer standard you can have you can do
classes but you can't do the static
typing as far as I know now if we wanted
to get let's say John's age we could say
console console dot log john dot age so
if we save that reload you'll see we get
34 now we can make it so that these
can't be accessed from outside of the
class by adding an access modifier so if
we say private what kept will stay
private to all of them
and we save that if you look down here
property age is private and only
accessible within class user so we can't
do this and you'll see we get the error
here as well now if we say for age
public then it works okay we also have
protected which means that we can't
access it from outside the class but we
can access it from any class that
inherits this one okay because you can
use class inheritance so let's take a
look at inheritance I'm going to remove
these and what we're going to do comment
that out for now we're going to create
oh a keynote before we do that let's
look at methods okay I want to create a
method in this user class called
register ok and all this is going to do
is just console log and it's just going
to say we'll say this dot name and then
we'll concatenate is now registered so
to call that let's make this live again
and then we can say john dot register
save it and now you can see John Doe is
now registered we can also make these
private save that you can see we get the
error saying register is private and
only accessible within the class so we
could only call register from within
this class all right so now let's do a
little inheritance
so down here I'm gonna I'm gonna create
another class called member and then
we're going to say extend user okay so
this is a it's inheriting the user class
and I'm going to give this a property of
ID which will be a number okay so a
member ID and let's create a constructor
now we want to pass in here the ID which
will be a number along with the the
fields of the class it's inheriting so
let's grab these and place those in the
Constructors must contain a super call
okay so the constructor of this class
has to have a super function and that's
going to take in the properties of the
class it's inheriting which is named
female and age okay so now those errors
go away and then what we'll do is set
this dot ID to ID we don't have to do
this dot name equals name and all that
stuff because we did that up here and
then we use the super so this is
essentially doing this for us
all right now if we want to let's say
have a pay invoice function down here
what we could do is we can say super dot
pay invoice and then we can put that up
here and in the classes inherits so okay
notice that now that error is gone and
up here we'll just console.log and let's
say this dot name
wait that shouldn't be in quotes so this
dot name and the mole concatenate paid
invoice all right so now down here let's
create a member so we're going to say
let Mike and we're going to give them a
type of user and we'll say new member
and then we want to pass in the ID which
will say one his name which will say
Mike Smith email and age all right so
let's save that and now we get user
created Mike Smith because he is a user
but he is also a member so we can call
pay invoice will say Mike dot pay
invoice save that and now we get Mike
Smith paid invoice alright so I know
this might be a little confusing but I
just wanted to make sure I go over all
of it the last thing I want to do is
create an interface for our class
alright so let's say interface we call
it user interface and we know that it
needs a name which is a string email
which is a string age number we also
need to include our functions so we have
a register function and we have a pay
invoice phone
okay so now we can say class user
implement user interface okay and let's
save that and everything works out okay
all right so that's going to do it now
there are some things that I didn't
cover but we covered all this all the
static all the types functions using
types and parameters and return values
interfaces classes inheritance if you
want to keep going and you want to learn
more and you want it we want to go a
little slower
I do have an edge ilanics course on
typescript which I'll put a link in the
description all right so hopefully you
