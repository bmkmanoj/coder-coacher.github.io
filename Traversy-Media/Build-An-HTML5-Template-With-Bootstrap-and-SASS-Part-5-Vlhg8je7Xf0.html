part 5 of bootstrap and sass so in the
last video we did the services page
alright so what we have left is the blog
page and the contact page HTML and then
we can finally move on to our CSS and
using sass ok so I'm going to go to our
blog we basically have the the the base
structure down we have our columns
alright so we have a main column a
column div and then a sidebar which is a
four column div alright so I'm going to
start in the 8th and basically we're
just going to have a heading so we'll
have h2 with a class a class of page
header
and I apologize it and know that this is
going to take this long to do all the
HTML I know I could have copy and pasted
but I really want you to see what I'm
doing and how I'm structuring the
website so page header this is just
going to say read our blog and then
we'll have a blog post which will have
its own div so div class blog post
and in the blog post we'll have another
page header
and I'm just going to give this a just a
sample text for our name here and then
we'll have the blog the blog image so
IMG / I think it was blog 1
and
actually we want to give this image some
classes when I give it a class of image
small which will just shrink it to the
correct size going to give it a class of
image ordered because we want to have an
image and also blog feature all right
now we just have our intro text let me
just grab that text
all right and then underneath let's see
underneath the blog post ending div
we're going to have our metadata so that
the the date the author categories so
div class and T post meta alright so
we're going to have an icon and the icon
F a F a clock
actually it's clock Oh all right so
that'll be the icon for the time of the
date and the time I'm just going to put
autist 31st 2014
all right and then we'll put another
icon
and this one will be a user sol-fa user
and that'll be the author name and then
we want the category so we'll say folder
for the icon and it'll put graphic
design web development
all right so that is a post all right so
we get the blog post and blog and post
meta okay so we just want to copy this
and this okay and then we'll go right
under here put a couple of these in
and that's pretty much it for the list
of posts so if we save that
okay so we have our post the images
aren't showing let me just see why image
blog one jpg let me just check that
also it's a PNG file
so we need to change those to PNG
okay so for the sidebar let's check out
the blog sidebar e of tabs and we have
this featured video and then we have
this recent comments okay so we want to
go to the the four column sidebar so
we're going to have a heading here
and I'm going to paste in the tab code
okay so we'll start here or tab Widgit
whatever you want to call it we have a
class of tab and tab light because we
wanted to have that light background we
get a ul then we have the tab panes okay
you want to make sure that your href for
the tab matches the ID of your div down
here all right and then we have the
featured video so we want to go under
the tab div which starts here and ends
here okay so we want to go right here
and this is going to be a block we're
going to have block primary and we want
notepad here as well so we're going to
give it the class no pad no padding
and then we have an h3 and we'll have an
icon here
okay so FA F a place circle
cute video
and then we need a block content
and then inside here I'm going to just
paste in a YouTube iframe embed code
all right so whatever if we have no
padding we usually use this when we want
there to be actually you know what this
should be block primary it should be
block primary head whenever we use this
block primary head we should have no
padding because if you look at it you
don't want the head in this this blue
header to have padding on the sides and
the top so you want no padding and then
you want to set the padding to the block
content div which is this because you
don't want this up against the edges all
right so let's see next we have the
recent comments again it's going to be a
block primary head so I'm just actually
going to copy this
and recently
okay so we'll change this here to recent
comments and change the icon
to F a comic alright then block contents
get rid of the video and for the block
content we're going to have an unordered
list and this will have a class
of list comments
and then we'll have allies and inside
the Li we want an image
and we want our headshots headshot one
dot jpg and we want to make sure we give
this a class and we want it to pull left
because we want the image to float to
the left and we also want to give it a
class of image circle which will turn it
into a circle all right now we want
paragraph and I'm just going to grab
some text okay so that's that's good so
we'll just copy this a couple more times
change the headshot image
all right
and there we go let's take a look
where are we blog
or is it
they're not safe or didn't save
all right so you can see the images are
very big okay so we're going to fix all
that so that's it for the blog now we
want the contact page okay so we'll go
to contact we already have our columns
okay we have our eighth column div and
our four column div let's see we'll have
a heading chatting contact us alright so
we're going to have a form and I'm going
to paste that in just to save a little
time so we have a form and then we wrap
our fields in a class called form group
which is standard bootstrap mock-up we
have a name a phone number and email
address and a message basically the same
that we have on that little form that we
created on the services page alright and
then the sidebar we're going to put an
address and this is going to be a block
so you want div class
block and again this is going to be
block primary head and no pad alright
and then we're just going to have some
address info I'm going to paste that in
okay so we have an h3 on location which
has an Home icon then we have our block
content unordered list as the company
name and the address info okay so the
contact form we also want a Google map
so we want a section above the main
section section class
and this is going to have a section I
mean a class called section map and I'm
just going to paste in my eye frame for
my map okay basically it's going to be
widths I want it to take up the whole
page so I did 1600 height 400 okay so if
we save that
and there's our map in our form
all right so that is the HTML okay we
have absolutely no CSS right now so
that's what we'll do in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
