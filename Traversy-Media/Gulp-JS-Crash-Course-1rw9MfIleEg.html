going to be talking about gulp or gulp J
s so gulp is an invaluable tool when
building JavaScript applications and I
know it can be a little confusing to new
developers and I think that's mostly
because it's used for so many different
things it has so many different plugins
so in this video we're going to start
from scratch and just talk about what
gulp is and some of the tasks that it's
used for so first we're going to take a
look at a couple slides and then we'll
see it in action by creating a few tasks
all right so technically gulp is an open
source JavaScript toolkit also called a
task runner it's not a framework or a
library it's not like react J s or
angular or anything like that it's just
a tool for building JavaScript
applications now this may be pure
JavaScript or es6 code it could be a
react application or view Jas it really
doesn't matter what other technologies
you're using gulp works and is installed
with NPM which is the node package
manager so to install gulp you're going
to want to have no js' installed and
that's really simple just go to node.js
org and go ahead and download it install
it all right what's great about gulp is
that you can you can take care of those
annoying repetitive and time-consuming
tasks gulp has its own ecosystem with
hundreds of plugins for taking care of
these tasks alright so let's take a look
at a couple of those tasks so
unification of scripts and styles so if
you don't know what minification means
basically it'll take a file either
javascript or css it will condense it it
will remove all the whitespace it will
remove all the comments and this makes
it much lighter which in turn makes your
application faster so gulp can take care
of that really easily it can also
concatenate multiple files together into
one big file which again optimizes your
app cache busing which has to do with
letting the browser know if there's a
new version of a cached file testing
linting error checking all those helpful
debugging tasks gulp can handle that
all right there's even a webserver
plugin so that we can run our
hold on a development server all right
so these are just a few of very many
tasks and plugins that are available all
right so we're going to get a little
nerdy for a second and just talk about
how gulp works exactly
all right so gulp is built on top of
what are called node streams and a node
stream is a continuous flow of data that
can be manipulated asynchronously all
right now these streams facilitate the
connection of file operations through
something called a pipeline and the
pipeline is basically a chain of
processing elements and they're arranged
so that the output of one element is
actually the input of the next element
all right so we can essentially set up
single purpose gulp plugins to run task
after task and this is all done using
the pipe operator or pipe function so
basically one plug-in could be used to
minify the JavaScript files and then it
will be piped to the next one which
could let's say compile SAS files down
to regular CSS and so on alright and the
original files aren't affected at all
until the plug all the plugins are
processed all right and I think this
will be it'll become a little more clear
when you actually see the code and see
it in action
all right so gulp isn't the only task
runner out there one of the other big
ones is grunt which you may or may not
have used or heard of now I'm not here
to bash grunt it's a great tool I just
prefer gulp and I think gulp seems to be
a bit more popular in the JavaScript
community all right so one big
difference is gulp is code over
configuration and gulp tasks are coded
using node style syntax while grunt is
configuration over code meaning that all
the tasks are configured inside of a
configuration object inside of the grunt
file alright so you'll have to figure
out which method you like better but
overall I prefer gulp I think gulp is
much easier to read you can easily
define the task and the pipe operator
gulp is also based on streams which we
talked about and grunt is based on files
all right and configure a
so that's enough for the slides guys
let's go ahead and jump in and take a
look at how golf works all right guys so
we're going to jump in and get started
with a gulp now as I said before you're
going to need nodejs and this video is
going to be completely cross-platform
whether you're using Windows Mac or
Linux and you just need to install node
which you can get at nodejs org just
download it install it and you should be
good now as far as a command-line I'm on
Windows and I'm using something called
commander I actually did a video on it
if you want to check that out but it
just gives us some extra options and it
looks a lot better but you can if you're
on Windows just use your you know your
standard command line all right and of
course your Mac or Linux terminal all
right so first thing we want to do is
install gulp globally so we're going to
do NPM install ok NPM is node package
manager make sure you have that and
nodejs they both come together and we're
just going to say - g4 global and then
gulp ok so this will install gulp
globally which means that you'll have
access to it from anywhere on your
system all right so now what we want to
do is create a folder for our project so
I'm just going to do make dirt and let's
call this I'll call it Gump gulp X app
for gulp example app and then let's CD
into that ok and then what I'll do is
open this up in atom which is the text
editor I'm using so I can just say atom
dot and that should open up in the
directory ok you don't have to use atom
you can use whatever you like sublime
text is really good Visual Studio code
or even something like notepad plus plus
is all fine now we want to create a
package.json file in this directory
which is kind of like a manifest file
it'll hold all our application metadata
as well as the dependencies and all that
so to create that easily we can just do
NPM in it for initialize and then it's
going to ask us some questions I'm going
to keep the default folder name is the
the app name version that's fine
description we'll say
example app using gulp and entry point
that's fine we'll just enter through the
rest all right now you can see it
created this package Jason file with
that info now we install gulp globally
but we also want to install it locally
so to do that we're going to say npm
install and this isn't something gulp
isn't something we use in production so
i'm going to save it as a dev dependency
a development dependency to do that we
do - - save - dev alright and then we
want to say gulp and then that should
show up over here in this package dot
jacent file once it's installed okay
there it is
alright so now we're going to start
getting into our file structure so right
now we just have our package Jason and
our node modules folder which is created
automatically what I'm going to do is
create a new folder called source or SRC
and this is all of our our application
source code this is before it gets
compiled what we'll do is we'll put
everything in here and then all of our
tasks that we run in gulp it's going to
go through and it's going to compile it
and then put it in a directory called
dist
you don't have to call it dist you can
call it build or public or something
like that it's basically your production
application that you would actually up
deploy to your server all right so we're
also going to need a file in the root
directory called gulp file dot J s and
this is where this is the only file we
need for gulp for what we're doing this
is where we describe all of our tasks ok
everything we want gulp to do so very
first thing we're going to do is bring
in gulp okay so I'm going to use es6 and
tax and use cons but you can use VAR or
let but let's say gulp and we're going
to require that we just want to say
require gulp and since we installed it
locally as a module it's going to know
exactly where to look which is the node
modules all right so that's all we're
going to bring in for now we will be
bringing in gulp plugins but we're just
going to leave that from now
okay now before we move any further
there's a couple of things that I want
to mention okay so these are going to be
the gulp top-level functions okay and
you should know what these four things
are so first we have gulp dot task and
what that does is it allows us to define
tasks all right
we're also going to have gulp dot SRC
and this is going to be or this is going
to point to the files to use all right
then we have gulp dot desk okay or
destination and this is going to point
to the folder to output and then we have
gulp dot watch which will watch files or
yeah watch files and folders for changes
ok so we don't have to keep running the
Gulf command these are the four basic
functions that we're going to use in
this file all right so let's do
something really easy and let's create a
task that will just log out a message
all right so let's put a call in here
we'll say logs message good to put a
comment to tell the user what it does if
someone else is using your code all
right so remember we use gulp task to
define a task and you can call it
anything you want I'm just going to call
it message and then it's going to have a
callback function right here and then
what we want it to do so we want to
return a console dot log and let's just
say gulp is running all right
so simple as that to create a task so
let's go ahead and save this and then we
can go to our project directory in the
command line here and we can say dult
message and right here you can see it
says gulp is running it gives us kind of
a timeline so using the gulp file
starting the message task it runs it and
then finished the message task alright
and you can have it do apps
anything that you want all right now if
you don't want to specify the actual
task you know how we did gulp message
then you could put it in the default
task so let's say gulp dot task I shall
just copy this and then change this to
default and now if we go over here we
just run gulp you'll see it runs that
the console log all right so let's go
ahead and create an easy task to to copy
HTML files so in the source folder we're
going to create a new file called
index.html alright and then let's just
put some basic tags in here we'll just
say my example app let's just put an h1
let's say my example app alright and
then I'm going to create one more HTML
file we'll just call this about HTML and
let's copy everything in here and paste
that in it'll just change the heading
here to about us ok it doesn't really
matter what's in these files now for the
most part you're not really going to
want to do any do much with your HTML
files because they're just static it's
just static markup so we do want to copy
it to the desk the dist folder so we're
going to set up a task that will do just
that it's just going to take those HTML
files and copy them over so let's put a
comment here we'll say copy all HTML
files and let's say golf dot task and we
can call this whatever we want let's
just say copy HTML and then we'll put
our function and then what we can do is
we can say gulp dot source okay so
remember source point to the files that
we want to use so the files that we want
to use are all the HTML file in the
source folder so let's say source slash
and then star dot HTML so that's going
to look at any file that has an HTML
extension all right and then what we
want to do is pipe it so we're going to
do dot pipe
and then we want to in here put gulp
desk for the destination and it's going
to be into a folder called dist ok and
you can call it whatever you want it
doesn't have to be dist so let's go
ahead and save that and then if we go
over here and we run gulp copy HTML okay
you can see that it ran and then if we
look over here in our folder structure
there's a dist folder we didn't even
have to create it it does that on its
own and it brought over index and about
alright so this is our basically our
production application this is our
source code now in some cases you might
see the HTML files outside of the source
and outside of dist and then what
they'll do is for instance if they have
tasks to minify the JavaScript
they'll put the minified javascript in
here and then just point to the dist
folder from their HTML hey you might see
something like that but I like this how
we just have the entire thing in dist
and we can just simply upload it to a
server or whatever we're going to do
with it
alright so let's let's find some stuff
that's a little more useful ok so let's
uh let's optimize images so there's
actually a plug-in we can use let me
just go over here and it's called gulp -
image min and this will take your image
and optimize it automatically all right
so if we go on here we need to install
this so we're going to save it as a dev
dependency and then this gives us a
basic example that we'll use so let's go
over here and to the NPM install we want
to do save dev and then gulp - image min
okay and then what we'll do is go over
to our gulp file and we need to bring
that in as well so say image min and set
that to require gulp - image men all
right and then we can get a simple
example from the website here I'm just
going to grab this okay let's put this
right here we'll say
optimize images paste that and I don't
want it to be called default though
let's just call it image min like that
alright and then you'll see we're doing
the gulp dot source we want to look in a
folder called images in our source so
let's create that folder called images
and then it's going to pipe it it's
going to run the image min function
which is going to take care of you know
all the stuff behind the scenes making
the image smaller and so on and then
it's going to pipe it to dist slash
images okay and we don't have to create
it it'll be created automatically so
let's save this and then we're going to
going to actually need an image so let's
go over here and let's look for will say
gulp logo alright and then let's grab
yes let's grab this here and we'll just
go view image and let's save it oh
that's an SVG I don't want that you know
what let's just say gulp J s PNG all
right so let's grab this so we'll save
it and we want to go to projects and
then or is it right here and source
images and we'll save it as a gulp dot
PNG alright so let's take a look and see
how big that image is so source images
and if we say properties you'll see that
it's nineteen point one kilobytes which
is not big but let's go ahead and let's
run over here gulp image min okay and
now over here you exit Scott let's go to
it over here and in the disk folder it
now has an images folder and let's take
a look at this properties and now look
it's two point six seven kilobytes so it
shrunk it crook that optimizes it quite
a bit alright and there's a bunch of
different options if you look at the
documentation for image Minh there's a
bunch of options you can use as far as
how much to optimize it and so on
alright but we're not going to get into
the details of the particular plugin
alright so now what I want to do is I
want something to minify our JavaScript
with so first of all let's create some
JavaScript so we'll go in the source
folder I remember you shouldn't be
touching anything in the dist folder so
in here we'll create a new folder called
Jas and let's create a new file called
file 1j s alright and then here let's
put some comments we'll just say
console.log one console dot log and
let's say this is file one and then I'll
grab this we'll put some white space
I'll just enter down and then let's say
- this is file - alright so we'll save
that and then we want to minify this and
there's a few different plugins you can
use we're going to use one called uglify
so let's go over here and say npm
install save dev and it's going to be
gulp - uglify alright and then we'll go
over to our gulp file and of course we
need to bring that in just like we did
with these so let's say uglify set that
to require gulp - uglify alright and
then we'll go down here and create a new
task
so you minify j s and let's do gulp dot
task and we'll just call this minify
alright and then what we want to do is
say gulp thoughts source and define
files we want to look for and that's
going to be in our source folder /gs
slash and then any javascript file so
star j s alright and then get rid of
that we want to pipe it so let's say Tod
and we need to call the uglify function
like that and then we want to set the
destination so pipe and then in here
we'll do
gulp test and we want that to go to our
disk folder and then into a GIS folder
all right so let's save that and
remember what our file 1 looks like in
the source code and then we'll go over
here and run gulp minify and then let's
look at our disk for GIS and then file 1
and all the comments are removed all the
whitespace is removed and now it's a
lighter file ok it is ugly but it is
lighter and it's optimized so that's how
we can easily minify javascript all
right so let's keep it going and now i'm
going to do is add a plug-in called gulp
sass
now if you don't know what sass is it's
a CSS pre-compiled err I have a couple
videos on it and it's similar to less
and it gives us functionality like it
lets us use variables in our CSS it lets
us use mix-ins which are kind of like
functions nesting is there's a lot of
different things and a lot of reasons to
use something like sass so let's install
the plug-in NPM install save dev and
it's going to be Gulf - sass ok notice
all the plugins are prefixed with gulp -
and then let's go over to our gulp gulp
file and let's say compile staffs and
we'll do a gulp dot task ok and we'll
just call it let's just call this sass
ok we need to do our gulp source source
and let's see in here we want to put the
location which will be source slash sass
slash and then star dot F CSS ok sass
files are they use an S CSS extension so
we're basically saying any sass files in
this folder okay and then we're just
going to pipe
and in here see actually you know what I
actually want to do yeah we'll do sass
and then we can also do a dot on here
and we can say on error because
sometimes we'll get an error for
instance if we define a variable wrong
or something like that and then we can
just do sass dot log error okay and all
this stuff is on the documentation for
that plugin and then we just want to do
our destination so here we'll say gulp
desc
and that's going to be in the dist
folder and then in a CSS folder because
it's not going to be sass anymore it's
going to get compiled to regular CSS so
let's go ahead and save that and then in
our source folder we'll create a folder
called staff and in here we'll create a
new file called say style dot F CSS
alright and then I'm just going to
define a variable
alright so let's say I will call this a
BG color and let's set that to gray all
right and then let's just put in a body
and what will add a background and let's
say we want that to be that BG color
variable alright so we'll save that and
then let's go over here and run gulp
sass and looks like something is wrong
sass is not defined did I not save this
gulp task
let's try that again
that's not oh I didn't bring it in up
here that's right so we need to do const
sass and let's set that to choir and
that's going to be gulp - assess alright
let's try it again okay now if we look
in our disk folder sorry about that
there's a CSS file and style dot CSS and
look at that compiled the sass there's
no more variable because obviously
that's not allowed in regular CSS but it
put the gray for the background alright
so this is starting to come together now
what I want to do is edit the index.html
file in the source and we're going to
add a link here to go to that compiled
stylesheet so it's going to be CSS slash
style dot CSS and then down here let's
put our script tag and let's point to J
s slash file one dot J s alright so
we'll save that and let's also do that
in the about file I'll just copy all
this paste that in and I'll change this
okay now I want to copy these over to
our distil door again
so let's go over here and let's run gulp
what was it copy HTML all right so now
if we look in our dist
and we look at index you can see it has
those it's pointing to those files so
let's go ahead and open that ok make
sure you're in the dist
and we take a look and you can see if we
look at the source code it's bringing in
those files so that's good what I want
to do now is show you how we can have
all of our tasks run with one command so
let's go back to say I hope this all
these files I'm confusing you guys but
let's go back to our gulp file which is
the most important and what we'll do is
go down to the default and instead of
putting a function here with with a
single task we can actually put in a
ray with the tasks we want to run so
let's do all them let's do message let's
do copy HTML let's do let's see image
min and what else minify and let's do
staffs alright so now if we save this
and I'm going to delete everything and
I'm going to delete the whole dist
folder and completely and then let's go
over here and then let's just run gulp
and look it did all of those tasks and
it also recreated the dist folder with
all that stuff so we can now go back to
our file and reload and it should be
good alright so last thing I want to do
is I want to create one more task to
concatenate all of our JavaScript files
together so let's go to our source
folder and go to j/s and we're going to
create a new file called file to dot j s
and here let's just say console.log and
we'll just do we'll say this is file to
and you know what let's do an alert to
just file to alright so we'll save that
now we need one more plugin for this and
it's a gulp concat so let's do npm
install save dev we're going to do gulp
- and cat ok and let's go over to our
gulp file make sure we bring it in up
here so it's what is this again this is
cat require go - canned cat all right so
what we want to do is we want to take
file on file - and anything else isn't
that's in here combine it into a file
called main
is okay and that's what we'll get
compiled so I'm going to create a
function here let's just say scripts and
then we'll just do go dot tasks call it
scripts oops
all right so in here what we want to do
is a gulp dot source okay and the
location is going to be in the source
folder /j s and then we want all
javascript files in there so star j s
and then let's see let's do dot pipe and
in here we want to run
oops it's the other one I want to do can
cat and then let's do our gulp dot desk
and then the destination is going to be
the distal dur and then J s all right
now if we were to just let's go down
here and add scripts now if we go ahead
and run this what it's going to do is
it's going to see minify and it's going
to minify file1 and file2 and then bring
it over to the disk folder and then
it'll go down here and then it will
concatenate file1 and file2 into a file
called alright here we need to define
that into a file called main j s but it
won't be minified because that already
happened all right
and we we don't want both of the files
to go over we just want the main J s so
what we're going to do is grab this
which is the part that actually does the
minifying and we're going to put it
right under the concat and then we don't
want to run this because this file will
actually concatenate and then minify
main j s so we just want to take minify
out of the array down here
want to run it alright you could even
delete it if you want so let's save that
and I'm going to delete the whole dist
folder and then let's go over here and
just run gulp okay and then let's look
at our disk folder if we look in Jay s
now there's only mange a s and it's all
concatenated ok file1 and file2 is all
in there so let's go back to actually
let's go back to our HTML because now we
don't want file one included we want
named Jay s same thing with about
alright and then we'll run gulp one more
time to copy those HTML files and then
let's open up this and reload and we get
that alert that says this is file - all
right if we look at the console it runs
the logs from both files alright guys so
that's pretty much it the last thing I
want to show you is how we can just
constantly watch instead of having to
type gulp every time we change something
so we'll go down to the very bottom here
and say gulp dot task ok this is going
to be called watch and then we're going
to have a function and then I'm going to
paste this in just to save a little time
ok so what this will do is it's going to
run all of these watch commands and what
this takes as a parameter is the
location to watch or and the file type
and also the name of the task so for
this scripts and we have our imagem and
our staffs copy HTML all that stuff and
then just the files that it's supposed
to be watching so if we save this now we
go over here and we run gulp watch see
why to do that I'm just saying what they
do
I don't have a caller there should be a
comma all right let's do that again Gulf
Watch and now you'll see it's watching
it so if we go and change let's say in
the index and we say my awesome app save
it you'll see over here
it ran copy HTML if I go and I change
let's say file one two this is file and
we'll do one spell it out save it and
you can see it ran scripts and if we go
over to our app reload and my awesome
app and then you can see that's changed
as well alright so that's going to be it
guys hopefully you learn something from
this we went over quite a few different
common tasks and hopefully you'll use
gulp in your upcoming projects thanks
for watching if you're not subscribed
