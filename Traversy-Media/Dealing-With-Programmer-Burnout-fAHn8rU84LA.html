below hey guys in this video we're gonna
talk about something that is very real
and can be pretty serious for
programmers and developers and that's
burning out so this is something that
I've had experience with myself and I'd
like to try and help some people out so
the main things I want to address is
what burnout is what causes it what can
prevent it and then ways to try to get
out of it if you're already burnt out
alright so let's go ahead and get
started
alright so I guess it would make sense
to first go over what program our burn
out our developer burnout actually is
and what some of the symptoms are now
it's important to note that you may get
some of all of or none of these symptoms
it manifests itself in different ways
for different people and that's
something that's really important to
remember you may have two developers
that are both burnt out but how are
having completely different experiences
now everything that I'm gonna say in
this video is from both my own personal
experience and doing research on the
subject all right so a serious lack of
motivation and passion is probably the
most common and probably the the first
sign chances are you got into
programming and development because you
really enjoy it and you have a passion
for it if you start feeling that passion
going away then that can be a sign that
you might start you might start
beginning to burn out now if you have
feelings of dread every time you open
your text editor your IDE then chances
are you're already there or you're just
about there and to be clear I don't mean
if this happens one or two days where
you're just not feeling into it I'm
talking about if this is happening every
day for weeks or months or even years
alright another sign of burnout is
feeling fatigued mentally and physically
if you
no energy or drive to code or even do
other things in your life then you may
be burning out all right also feelings
of isolation
now programming is or like I shouldn't
say is but can be a very lonely career
now I know a lot of people work in teams
but even then usually have meetings
you'll discuss your project create some
wireframes or whatever and then you'll
retreat to your computer by yourself
so you know maybe in some situations in
some jobs people do actually code
together but I know for me I can't I
can't talk to someone while I'm
programming at the same time not only is
it difficult but it's just very annoying
so naturally you're gonna feel a little
isolated depending on who you are
alright now this can contribute a lot or
a little to burnout I know that for me I
actually like being alone so it's not
too bad but if you're someone that
always needs people around you someone
that is you know an extrovert then it
might burn you out a little quicker than
someone like me all right now feelings
of depression and anxiety and I don't
mean just with coding or just with your
job but just a general feeling of
depression and this can vary you know it
can go from being very very mild where
you just have a sense of you know
feeling down a little bit all the way to
you know severe depression and anxiety
where you actually need mental help and
medication there's a huge range and if
you already have issues with depression
and anxiety as I do then this makes you
much more prone to this as a burnout
symptom alright now even though it's
called programmer or developer burnout
it can severely affect other parts of
your life okay especially your
relationships with your spouse or your
kids your friends you may go through
mood swings and lash out at people now
these are extreme cases but it is
important to mention them okay I've
actually gone through all of these at
one point or another alright so let's
talk about some of the causes of
or burnout what that looks like so
sitting in front of a computer screen
or in my case six computer screens for
you know eight ten twelve plus hours per
day is not the healthiest thing in the
world you're literally staring at one
spot for most of the day your mind and
your vision isn't getting any other
input and stimulation okay and this can
definitely be a factor in burning out
the next one is a huge factor and that's
the fact that our minds are being pushed
to the limit for hours on end every day
a lot of times with no breaks so try to
compare your mind to a muscle when
lifting weights you might be really
strong and you can workout for you know
one to two hours really well but then
you start to get really tired and your
arms start to feel like jello and you
can barely move never mind you know lift
more weights so we do this with our
minds every day so brakes are really
important and I'm gonna get to that soon
all right now doing the same type of
work day in and day out even if you love
programming you might end up at a job
where you're doing very mundane tasks
and writing you know similar code every
day using the same technologies nothing
new this can suck the passion right out
of you it can make you feel trapped or
stuck at your job feel like you're never
gonna progress in your career this can
also lead to burnout because it just
basically just stops that passion and
that motivation and again I'm going to
talk about things you can do to help
this stuff in a few minutes so again as
we saw on the last slide feelings of
isolation is actually a symptom of being
burnt out
but it's also a cause so not having that
human interaction can really push
someone over the edge and make them
question if this is really what they
want to do of course that depends on who
you are and how much you care about
being around other people
I'm actually fine being in a room all
day by myself as long as I can you know
be with my family after work so without
them to hang out with before and after
work I'd probably go insane so your life
outside of work really matters in this
case if you live alone in your pro
grammar I can imagine that that can get
pretty damn lonely and that can cause
issues for you all right so the last one
is lack of exercise and sleep so
basically just being unhealthy not
eating right could also fit in here your
mind needs rest and your body needs
exercise without those things you're not
gonna be at your best and it makes you
much more vulnerable to burnout the
healthy mind and body ISM is much less
prone to being burnt out all right so
what can we do to prevent this burnout
from happening okay like I said it's
different for everyone this is my
personal perspective mixed with some
research so let's talk about some of
these things now you want to keep things
fresh okay to hold on to that passion
and drive if you work with the same old
technologies every day and you're not
you're not feeding your brain things
tend to get stale now I'm fully aware
that you you know you may have a job
where your responsibilities don't really
permit this they don't really permit you
know changing things up you may have to
do the same thing every day maybe you
work for a firm that builds the exact
same WordPress website for every client
but remember you can do things on your
own as well you can create your own
projects you may not be getting paid for
them but it can pay off in the long run
because learning new things can get you
a better job or a promotion and maybe
you could start your own business so you
want to always keep things fresh all
right another tip is to take breaks
through the day this is something that I
did not do for years I would sit in
front of my screen for you know up to 10
hours straight just taking a couple
minutes here and there just to go to the
bathroom or eat something now I try to
stretch every hour to take a lunch break
go for a quick walk anything anything
not to be in the same position for eight
to ten hours straight and it may it
might seem like a small step to take but
it does wonders so you should be able to
stretch you know and take a little one
to two minute break at any job you have
if not then I would say start looking
for a new job because they don't want
creative and passionate developers they
want slave workers
all right that's justice my opinion now
this one is also tough if you work for a
company where you don't have much
flexibility but if you can take a break
from coding every few months I would say
you know about a week or so if you have
the money and time go on a vacation
that's the best thing that's the most
refreshing thing to do but I realize
that's not viable for everybody if not
just find something else you that you
enjoy spend some time with your family
and you know if you don't want to take a
complete 100 percent break from coding
then you know spend an hour in the
morning for just just messing around
maybe learning some new technologies
just for an hour or two in the morning
nothing serious
all right so exercise and get enough
sleep this is very important like I said
a health a healthy mind and body is much
tougher to burn out if you eat ramen
noodles for breakfast lunch and dinner
and you take a hundred steps a day and
sleep three hours a night you're you're
gonna be completely burnt out within a
month and this goes way beyond just this
topic it's it's more but it's more than
just programming and burnout it's about
your life and your health and your body
all right be around other people we've
already stressed that this is an
isolated job for the most part so you
know if you're single try and hang out
with your friends more go out to bars
have some fun enjoy your life if you are
not single if you have a significant
other spend some time with them work on
your relationship and of course if you
have kids spend as much time with them
as you can my kids are my antidepressant
many of you know that I have an autistic
nonverbal eight-year-old son and even
though he can't talk he's the most
inspiring person in my life he's always
happy and smiling regardless of all the
issues that he has and he's just a
lovable little guy so he's he's helped
me become Who I am today all right so
what about the people that are already
burnt out so here's some things that I
can suggest to you so take some time off
now you really can't fix this without
taking any time
and it sucks because you probably do
this for work and it's what puts food on
your family's table
hopefully you work for a good company
where you get benefits and vacation time
if so then use that that vacation time
ASAP the amount of time to take off
varies dramatically from person to
person I've heard of people needing to
take years off doing something else I
don't think that's the norm for me it
was about two weeks or so to get out of
my biggest slump that I had if you're
taking a fun vacation and you're not
coding at all then you know a week and
can do wonders you should also find
something else that you really like I
actually just got a new DJ set up with a
pioneer controller some of you guys may
have seen it on Instagram I used to spin
records back in the day house music hip
hop music I'm getting back into that
although now it's all digital and I used
to use vinyls so that's that's something
that I need to learn but that's
something that really interests me and
then I like to do you know you might
want to do something more physical like
a sport maybe you're into cars or
something like that whatever it is that
interest you
I'd suggest getting into you know doing
something else for a little while now
when you do come back make sure that you
start off very slow don't jump into you
know eight ten hour days do one to two
hours here and there and work your way
back up I'd also suggest trying
something new if you if you were burnt
out writing JavaScript maybe you should
try Python or maybe something less
common like rust or assembly you can
find a new love for a different language
or stack work with other databases if
you are a PHP MySQL developer maybe try
node in MongoDB another thing you can do
is change your environment and I say
outer and inner environment because
changing your physical location your
your outer environment may be good for
you maybe a different room maybe even
code outside on a laptop which I find
very relaxing and then your inner
environment I mean the tools you use so
if you're a Windows guy maybe try to
move to a Mac or Linux maybe use a
different text editor start to get that
passion
for learning new things alright guys so
that's gonna do it I really hope that
this video helped at least some of you
whether it helps you prevent burnout and
for the future or it helps you get out
of a slump that you're in now I hope to
cover more about this in the future
because it is something that's really
important it's something that is very
very common but not really talked about
alright so thanks guys thanks for
