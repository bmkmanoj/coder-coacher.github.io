solutions I'm gonna make a quick video
showing you how to link your totally
Dreamweaver to your you know live
website you know through a hosting
provider or whatever hosting provider
you use we're going to do this with an
FTP account because dream leave it has a
built-in ftp client that we can use to
automatically upload files to our site
and you could use your root hosting
login you know to your root cPanel but
we're actually just going to create an
FTP account real quick so just log in to
your cPanel you know whether your
provider is and just create a new FTP
account it's pretty self-explanatory I
do have a video on on how to create FTP
accounts but I'm sure you already know
how to do that so we're just gonna say
test to use right and the domain I'm
using is tech guy staging comm I'm not
gonna use the root I'm not going to use
I'm gonna use tech guy staging comm
slash my site so we use an SS as the
website so
password we're going to take this test
user off because we want it to go to the
root directory and create alright so now
we have test user a tech guy staging
comm we have that FTP account created so
it's called Dreamweaver oh you need to
have a local folder on your on your on
on your computer where you want the
files to be locally so I'm just going to
create a new folder on the desktop and
I'm just going to call it my site and
it's just an empty directory so now we
want to go into Dreamweaver and go to
site new site and just call it my site
and here is where you want to specify
the local folder that we just created so
it's desktop my site and now you want to
go down to servers and you want to
create a new server I just named it my
slaves and you want to put the FTP
address which is your domain name
and your username where we do test user
and you want to put the username along
with the domain name and the password
and you want to test
okay so we're connected successfully but
right now it's it's it's going to the
root of tech guys staging we don't want
that we want to we want to put it in the
the my site subdirectory so right here
you want to put public HTML or your host
might use something like WWI htdocs but
public HTML is the most common so and
you want to do slash my site and you got
to have that this folder on your web
host I'll actually show you right here
this I get FileZilla open in my
publication mail you'll see the folder
is right here under my site it's a blank
directory so now you want to actually
before you see if go to advanced and
click automatically upload files to
server on save that way when you save
the file it will automatically go up to
your web host your website it won't you
won't have to do it manually and after
you do that just again
a problem West
I say
we hang me the backslash
oh you know what
might not need that all right so yeah we
didn't mean that we didn't need the
public HTML so it's just a subfolder I'm
safe now almost done you just want to go
to oh I like to go to advanced settings
and turn off the cache that way you know
everything's in real time there's no
cash after you do that just click Save
and then you'll see over here it says my
site and this is this is your website
right here I mean right now there's
nothing in it so we'll just create a
quick file new a new HTML file and we'll
just well just yeah we'll just set up a
quick
no I couldn't save it as HTML
want to save his index.html
all right so
I'm just going to create a quick page
right here I'm not going to give you a
HTML tutorial right now
okay so just
all right I like to put a title now
all right so we'll save that and you'll
see it's right over here onto my site
I'm gonna bring the F FileZilla over to
see if it uploaded or you just refresh
and you'll see it right there now we'll
go to the browser and reload and what is
it was
what is going on here
oh sorry I have it in design view I was
wondering why it wasn't completing my
tags everything all right save reload
and there you go check I staged in.com
slash my site so you can create any
other you know you CSS folders you just
put a new folder CSS and then you'd want
to create images directory not in CSS
you know so you get the yeah so that's
pretty easy and thanks for watching this
