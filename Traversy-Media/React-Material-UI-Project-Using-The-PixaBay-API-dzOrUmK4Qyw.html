we're gonna be building a react app
location that reaches out to the pixabay
API and brings in images by search okay
so it's basically an image searching app
and we're also going to be using
material UI which is a library it's
basically it allows us to use the
material design Google's material design
through react components instead of
bringing in let's say materialized CSS
and just manually putting in the classes
and stuff like that we can actually have
pre-made components for things like the
app bar for things like the grid buttons
and all that and there's some pretty
good documentation here as well if you
go down just like any other framework it
has all the all the documentation it has
examples and if you look at the code for
instance if we want the app bar we would
bring that in as a component and we
would use that as a component passing
some properties down here you have all
the available properties alright so
we'll be doing that lets let's give a
quick example or a quick demo of this
let's say we wanted to search for images
of dogs I'll go ahead and just start
typing and immediately as I start typing
it's gonna reach out to the API and
bring back anything that matches that
query so I'll just say do G and now you
can see we have a list of dogs alright
and we can also change the amount let's
say we wanted only 5 pictures let's
search for computer and you'll see that
we'll get 5 images of computers and
another thing that we're gonna implement
is the dialog for material UI so if I
click on this this zoom icon it's gonna
open up a dialogue with that image ok
now these these actually don't have
titles so I just use the tags right here
and then also the user that uploaded it
and if we look at the documentation real
quick for pixabay the API is actually
really nice there's a lot of options and
then you get all this data back ok you
get the hit the total hits and then the
hits is the
- array of images of objects and has the
URLs it has preview URLs it has the
height and width the views that
downloads the user the comments all that
stuff so you can extend this application
if you want if you want to bring in some
more of this data you can do that and
that's a great way to learn but this is
what we'll be building in this project
so let's get started alright so the
first thing that you're gonna want to do
if you want to follow along here is
create your own pixabay account so that
you can get an API key so if you go if
you go to pixabay.com and just register
you know confirm your email or whatever
login you can see I'm already logged in
here and then go to this URL which is
pixabay.com slash API slash Doc's and if
you scroll down your API key will
automatically be shown here in green
okay so make sure you use your own API
key and not mine and we'll be will be
adding that to our appellate ur so let's
go ahead and create a react application
now if you don't already have create
react app install just go ahead and do
an NPM install - G create - react - app
and that will install the CLI alright
once you do that you just want to go
ahead and run create - react - app and
then name your application I'm gonna
call this let's call it pixabay
underscore image underscore or finder
okay and that's going to generate a new
application for us or a boilerplate app
all right so now that's done I'm just
going to CD into pixabay underscore
image finder and I'm gonna open up the
visual studio code okay and that's the
text editor I'm using you don't have to
use it but what you you know use
whatever you want so from here I'm gonna
open up my integrated terminal now I'm
no longer gonna use git bash well I am
I'm gonna use it down here and it's not
letting me clear I hate when it does
this I don't know why it does this
alright so now what we want to do is
just install a couple dependencies we're
gonna need material UI and then we're
also gonna be using Axios to make our
request so let's go ahead and say npm
install or i
Axio s-- and also material - UI and
those will get added to our package JSON
file
all right Oh looks like I need to update
and PM real quick let me do that get rid
of that so if you ever need to update
NPM you just do NPM I or install - gee
and PM and that will update you to the
latest version all right so now what I
want to do not clear this so now what I
want to do is let's start our server so
we'll go ahead and we'll just run NPM
start and that'll start up our react
server and application and we get our
boilerplate good so let's let's head
into let's change the title first of all
before I forget so public index.html I'm
just gonna go down here and change this
title from react app to pixabay image
finder and save alright and then let's
clean this up a little we basically we
don't want any of this this layout here
so I'm gonna keep the app dot CSS but
just delete everything in it and save
that and then let's delete the logo dot
SVG we don't want that okay and let's
delete or let's go into app dot J s get
rid of this line where it's bringing in
the logo and then as far as our main app
goes we can get rid of everything inside
the main div and for now we'll just say
hello and we'll save that and we should
just get hello all right so let's start
with creating our components so in the
source folder I'll create a folder
called components and we're just gonna
have a couple components here one is
going to be the navbar so we'll create a
lip so I want to create a folder
actually called navbar
and then inside here we'll have a file
called navbar dot J s and I'm using
Pascal case here cats start with a
capital and every other every word will
begin with a capital in addition to nav
bar let's create another folder called
search so this would be our search
component we'll create a file called
search dot J s and then we're gonna have
one more so folder and we're gonna call
this image - results for the folder name
and then for the file name image results
dot J s alright we're not using redux
you could but it's kind of overkill for
what we're doing what we're gonna do is
we'll have the search component and then
we're going to embed the image results
component in the search component and
that's where all the results will show
with the grid and all that stuff
alright I mean there's a there's a lot
of different ways you could do it so
let's start with our navbar that's
actually going to be really really
simple so I'm gonna head to navbar J s
and we're going to create a functional
component now if you're using react in
vs code I would highly recommend this
extension it's called es7 react Redux
graph QL react native snippets for this
one right here and it allows you to just
really quickly create react components
and just all kinds of stuff stuff to do
with graph QL so I can just say RFC tab
and it'll give me a functional component
ok I kind I do want to clean this up a
little bit for example I want to take
the export default and just cut that out
and let's put this let's create a
variable called navbar and set that to
our functional component and then we'll
export navbar down here and then since
all we're doing is we're gonna just use
an app bar for material UI we don't even
need like the curly braces and the
return and stuff so for now I'm gonna
get rid of all that and I'm going to
bring in
app bar from material UI / app bar and
then right here in our arrow function
we'll just go ahead and call that
component whoops so we want app bar and
we're just going to put in a title okay
so for our title will say pixabay image
finder and we'll save this component
alright very very simple and then we'll
go to our app dot j s and of course we
need to bring this in so we'll go up
here and we'll say import navbar from
and we want to go inside of our
components folder inside navbar and we
want our navbar component and then I'm
just gonna stick that let's see in this
return we'll just go ahead and say
navbar like that okay and I'm using
prettier so when I save you'll see that
it automatically formats
now we're getting an error here because
we actually need to bring in the mui or
the material UI theme provider which you
can kind of think of as like they're the
redux provider we have to wrap it around
the rest of everything in our app in
order to use the the correct components
so we need to bring this in let's go
right here and let's say import mui
theme provide our from and it's gonna be
from material UI oops
material UI / styles /m Eli theme
provider and then what we have to do is
wrap around everything in our render or
in our return so I'm actually going to
just let's replace this with some
parentheses and we want to put in our
Mui theme provider beginning tag and
then the ending tag
okay and then inside here we're gonna
put a div and then inside here is where
we'll put our navbar all right so let's
save that and there we go so now we have
our navbar with the material UI app bar
so now let's move on to our search okay
so I'm at what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually going to bring in our search
component so right under the navbar
let's bring in search and of course
that'll be from search slash search and
then we just want to stick that right
under the navbar
like that all right so that actually
should be it for the apps the app j/s
it's gonna break because it doesn't we
haven't created anything in our search
file but that's it for the app j/s so we
can close that up and now we can close
the navbar up and let's head into our
search js5 okay I'm just gonna make this
less and I'm also going to close the
sidebar up now I'm gonna make this a
class-based component so I'm gonna say
RCC tab and again if you want this
functionality in vs code then you want
to use the es7 what the hell is a ts7
react Redux graph QL extension so I'm
going to change the class name to search
and let's bring the export default down
to the bottom
and we also want to bring in a couple
things up here so the textfield is going
to come from material UI as well as the
select field so I'm going to import
those two things so we'll say import
text field from and that's gonna be from
material - UI slash text field like that
okay and then we also want the Select
field I'm going to just change this to
select field and change this to select
field as well okay we'll need some other
stuff as well but we'll just stick with
this for now now in our component we're
gonna have some state okay so we could
create a constructor and put our state
there but I'm just gonna just define it
like this just as a single object and
our single variable and we're gonna put
in our search text and set that to
nothing by default this is going to be
the state for our text field we'll also
have the amount which will be the state
for the select I'm gonna put 15 as the
default let's also put in our API URL
here which is going to be the pixabay
URL so HTTP pixabay.com slash api and
then you also want your api key here
which I'm going to grab from the
documentation and of course you want to
use your own so let's paste that and and
then lastly we're just gonna have images
which is going to be an empty array to
begin with and then once we make our
request and we fetch our images we'll
fill this array okay so now let's go
down to our render and inside the render
let's go or inside the div I should say
let's put our text field so we're using
the text field component from material
UI and we're going to add some
properties here so I'm going to add a
name
search text and whoops I don't want to
comment there we want a value of this
dot state dot search text okay so it's
going to be directly connected to that
state value and then on change so
basically when it changes when we type
anything in I want to run a function
called on text change okay and then the
next two properties are gonna be from
material UI we want one called floating
label text which is basically just the
label and it's just gonna say search for
images and then the next one is gonna be
full width because I want the input to
go all the way across and we're gonna
set that to true all right so if we save
this it should actually show up okay so
there's our input good and underneath
that we're gonna put our select field
all right now there's one more thing we
need to bring in to use a select I'll
actually show you in the documentation
if we go to select field and we look at
the code here we need to bring in this
menu item because for each OTT we
basically don't use option like an
option tag in standard HTML we use these
menu items so we need to bring that in
as well so I'll just copy that line and
bring that in all right and then what
I'll do is I'm copy let's see we'll go
ahead and just copy this select field
here alright and we'll go let's just add
a line break and paste that in and then
I'm just gonna add another line break
under it so for this select field it's
gonna have a name of amount
okay floating label texts we're going to
change that to amount value is gonna be
this dot state dot amount okay remember
we put that in the state it's 15 by
default and then unchanged so when
someone selects something we wanted to
call on amount change all right and then
for the menu items here we're gonna have
five ten okay these are the values so
five ten fifteen will do 30 and then 50
will be the most and then we'll do the
same here five and these will just be
strings so ten fifteen this is basically
what is displayed to the user same thing
is option in value fifty all right so
that's our select if we save that and
now you can see we have our select here
with all the different options good now
when we start to type here and I can't I
can't type anything because we haven't
created the on text change and we
haven't we basically haven't linked our
value to the search text state every
time we type it should update that state
so let's go ahead and create a function
called on text change and we're going to
use an arrow function so as a parameter
we'll take in the event and then we'll
set that to our function alright and
we're using arrows here so that we don't
have to do dot bind this because we
would have to do that if we didn't use
arrows so from here we want to say this
dot set state and basically in here we
want to set I'm gonna put some brackets
and we're gonna say e dot target dot
name so it's basically gonna look at
whatever the name is so in this case
search text and then we want to set the
search text in the state to whatever the
value is and we can get that with a dot
target dot
value okay so it's important that your
name here matches the state name because
that's where this comes in and this is
very helpful when you have multiple
fields so we want to do that and just
doing that we should now be able to at
least type okay so we can now type in
that field good now when we type we
actually want to send out a request to
our API so for that we're going to bring
in Axio so remember we installed that in
the beginning so we're gonna say import
Axios from Axios okay you can use fetch
as well if you wanted to and then when
we could when we set the state here so
we set the target the name to the value
we can actually pass in a callback so
we're gonna go right after this this
curly brace and put a comma and then
we're gonna put in arrow function here
whoops alright so this will run
immediately after and this is where we
want to make our request so we're gonna
say Axios dot get okay because we want
to make a get request and actually don't
want that in here we're going to use
back ticks because it's gonna be a
template literal so we want the URL
which we have in our state so we can
actually use this syntax and say this
dot state dots API URL alright and then
we want to do slash and then a parameter
of key equals and this is where we put
our API key so we can say whoops I want
to put that here
and we want to say this dot state dot
API key let me make this bigger you know
we'll just make this wolf make this
fullscreen
and let's make this fullscreen and we'll
just switch like this instead now in
addition to the URL and the key we need
to pass in our query it needs to know
what we're searching for so to put
another parameter we'll use the
ampersand and then we want the Q
parameter okay we want to set that equal
to our query or our search text which is
in this dot state dot search text okay
and then after that we actually want to
put the image type so we're gonna put
another ampersand I'm going to say image
underscore type and we want to set that
to photo all right then we want to put
another parameter of per underscore page
and then this is where we want to put
the amount so we're gonna say this dot
state dot amount all right and then one
more parameter we're gonna say amber
samp SafeSearch and we're gonna set that
equal to true and honestly I don't
really don't know what safesearch is I
guess we can look at that real quick
let's see Save Search a flag indicating
that only image is suitable for all ages
be returned that's what I figured it was
but I wasn't sure so no I guess
inappropriate images alright so now that
we have that inside our Axios yet it's
going to give us a promise so we will of
course we want to eight dot then and in
our dot then it's going to give us a
response and then what we want to do is
we want to set the state we want to say
this dot set state and we want to set
the basically we're gonna get the
response in res dot data now remember in
the API if we look at the response what
we want is the this array here and it's
in hits okay so we want res dot data dot
hits that's where the images will be
located or the image array the array of
objects so let's say we want to
set images which is an empty array to
begin with we want to set it to res data
dot hits just like that okay and then
we'll go ahead and we'll add on a dot
catch here in case something goes wrong
and let's just console dot log the error
all right so now if we save this let's
before before we test it out let's go to
our render and let's just console dot
log this dot state okay so now we'll go
back to our application and let's open
up our console here and you can see it's
odd it's it's logging our state and what
we want to look at is images okay
actually let's log this dot state dot
images because we don't really care
about anything else at this point all
right so do that and you can see it's an
empty array now if I go when I type
something in here like addy we get this
fifteen results of different images okay
so to give us all the image URL and all
that that good stuff and every time I
type so do G that'll give us another one
so it'll keep giving us these results
and that's what we want now the results
the images themselves I don't want to
show in this particular component I want
those to show in the image results
component okay so what we'll do here is
actually you know what before we do that
let's implement our select functionality
so we want to be able to limit the
amount and that's pretty easy all we
really have to do is go and create our
on amount change remember we linked the
on change to that function so we're
gonna go right here and say on amount
change and we're gonna use an arrow here
that'll say a vent
it also takes in an index and then the
value
okay whatever the selected value and
then we just want to set the state so
this dot sets state and we want to set
of course the amount and we want to set
that to whatever that value is and save
all right
and then if we go and do what we just
did let's change this to let's say five
and let's put in something here and now
you'll see we only get five results okay
so that's that's what we want so now for
the image results we're gonna bring that
component in even though we didn't
create it yet we're gonna just bring it
in here and say image results from and
we want to go outside of the current
folder into image - results and then we
want to load image results did I call it
image result I did let's add an S on to
that alright so we bring in an image
results in and then we're gonna go down
let's see we're gonna go right under
this line break and we basically we want
to put a conditional so I'm going to use
it a ternary operator we're gonna see if
this thoughts state dot images dot
length so this is an array of images if
the length is greater than zero then we
want to show the image results component
okay and then we obviously that needs to
that needs to know the images images to
load so we're gonna pass those in as a
property so we'll say images equals this
dot state dot images all right
else then I'm just gonna say no okay so
yeah that looks good we'll go ahead and
save and we'll get some error here if we
try to search for something because
there's nothing inside of our image
results okay it's basically saying that
nothing's exported which is true so
let's go back and let's go into our
image results and let's create a
class-based component called image
results okay I'm going to export it down
at the bottom here and usually do this
if you if you're adding like prop types
and stuff like that but I do it either I
do it anyways it's just the format that
I like I don't like to export it up here
and speaking of that we should add a
prop type here for images so let's let's
import
prop types from prop types
oops it should be prop - types and then
down here we'll go ahead and say image
results dot prop types and we want to
set the what is it images
- prop types dot and it's going to be an
array and it's gonna be is required all
right so we need to we're gonna have the
images in a grid so we need to bring
that in from material UI we actually
have quite a few things we want to bring
in from material UI so let's say imports
and we're gonna bring in two things from
the grid list we want the grid list
itself and we also want the grid title
okay so that's gonna be from material -
UI / grid list okay
now we're also gonna have like a little
icon that we want to be able to click
and that will open up the dialog so we
need to bring an icon button so let's
say imports icon button
so it's gonna be material UI slash icon
button alright
now the icon I want to use is is called
zoom in and instead of just importing an
entire library we import this this
single icons we want to use so we're
going to pour it zoom in from material
UI slash and it's gonna be an SVG icon
so it's an SVG icons slash action slash
zoom in okay and then we're also going
to use the dialog so we might as well
bring that in now so we'll say import
dialog from material UI slash dialog and
we're gonna use the flat button as the
close button so we're gonna bring that
and that'll be the last thing we bring
in so flat button from material UI slash
flat button so that's everything we need
to bring in now in our render here we
basically want to check to see if
there's any images in our properties
okay because as you saw when we log the
state it basically rendered and it had
an empty array at first and then we make
our request and then that array gets
filled so we don't want we want this to
run if that if if it actually has images
so what we're gonna do is above the
above the return inside the render we're
going to initialize a variable called
image list content okay we're gonna use
let here because we're not defining it
if you use kant's you're gonna get an
error and then in the are not in the
return but under the the initialization
here we're gonna check for the images
okay remember it's in props we can
actually do some d structuring here and
just
a Const images curly-braces
images equals this dot props and this is
the same as saying Const images without
the curly braces equals this dot props
dot images you can think of this as like
pulling it out of the this dot props
okay so now we can just test for images
and we're gonna put an else here so if
there's images then we'll do what we're
gonna do if not then let's set the image
list content let's just set that to no
and you could put a spinner here if you
want as well but if there are images
then what we want to do here is set the
image list content and we're gonna put
all of our markup here so let's put our
grid list so we're gonna say grid list
and with grid lists you can define your
columns so I'm going to define it as a
three column grid oops that should not
be a good question mark so great list
and inside the grid list here we need to
map through the images okay the images
are coming through as a prop and it's an
array so we need to map through these
and then do what we want to do for each
one so we're gonna put a set of curly
braces and we're gonna say images dot
map and for each one will say IMG and
then for each one of these we want to
output a grid tile so we're gonna say
grid tile so we want an opening and a
closing like that
oh you know what I brought this I
brought this in this grid tight title
this should actually be tile not title
sorry about that
alright so each grid tile is going to
have a bunch of properties so we want to
go to the start tag here we're gonna add
in a title and this is gonna be the tags
because there is actually no title to
the with our response from the API so
we're gonna use tags and let's see we
want to pass in a key a unique key for
each one so we use the ID so IMG ID we
want a subtitle so for that we're gonna
add some curly braces here and we can
actually put an element in here we're
gonna put a span and in here we're gonna
put we're gonna say bye and then the
user's name and I'm going to wrap that
in strong tags
alright so in here we can say I am G dot
and then user so under the subtitle we
want an action icon because remember we
want to be able to click on the icon and
then open up the dialog and we're not
going to do the dialog just yet we'll do
that after but I want at least the icon
to show so this is where we use icon
button okay and inside the icon button
we actually want the icon itself which
is zoom in remember we brought that in
so zoom in and we can add a property of
color and we're gonna say white alright
and this should actually have a slash
alright now underneath the grid tile so
the for it ends right here we will
actually want to go in between the grid
tile tags and this is where we want to
put our image and for the source we want
to take from the image object we want to
take the large I believe it's a large
image URL and that's it so yeah I think
that's good now the last thing we want
to do for this to actually work is down
in the return we just have just an empty
div so of course we want to put here our
image list content okay and depending on
if there's actually images coming in
it'll be either our grid of images or
it'll just be null so let's save this
let me just check down here real quick
don't worry about these are defined but
never used warnings those are fine so
let's check it out we'll go back to our
application and let's search you'll
start to type in dog and we get our
results and they show up so we have the
tags and then we have by and then the
username we have our little icon which
doesn't do anything yet we'll add that
after and then if we want to change this
to 5 and we search for something else
cats it'll take it'll get five cats good
so now notice that when I clear out the
the input we still have five images here
and I don't want that I want these to
clear out so we're just gonna do a minor
change to search dot J s inside of the
event or inside this function this on
text change basically what I want to do
is say if if search text is empty then
let's make the images array empty so I
want to work with this e dot target dot
value but I want to work with it in here
and it's not going to work if I just use
a target value down there so I'm going
to create a variable called Val and set
it to e dot target dot value and then we
can replace this right here with Val and
then we can use that down here so I'm
going to just do an if statement here or
an if else so I'm gonna say if val is
equal to nothing then i want to set the
state i want to set images to an empty
array else then we want to do this so
I'm just gonna grab all this stuff here
let's see this ends here or no we just
want this yeah okay so we'll cut that
out and we'll put that inside of the
else and that should do it that should
give us the effect that I want let's try
it out so if I search for dog we get our
images now if I clear it completely then
all the images go away so that's that's
how I want it to work good so now we
want to implement our dialogues so let's
go back to image results and for this
we're gonna have to add a little bit of
state so up here let's say States equals
and we just want one for open which will
be false basically if the dialogue is
open or not and then we also want one
for current image because we need to
know what image to load inside of the
dialog all right and if we if you look
at the documentation for material UI and
you look at the dialogue let's look at
the code you can see we're doing the
same thing open false and then what
we'll do is we'll have two functions
will have handle open which will set the
open to true and handle closed which
will set it to false and then in the
dialogue itself you have an open
property and you just set it to that
state value okay and then for actions
for let's say a close button or a cancel
button we would create an array of
buttons we're only going to have a close
so we'll just have one flat button and
then you put that in a variable called
actions and you pass that into the
actions property okay so let's go ahead
and implement that so let's go into our
render and we want to go under this if
statement here right above the return
actually we're going to go and we want
to create our actions so let's say Const
actions equals an array and we want to
put our flat button this is going to
take in a label of close all right let's
make that uppercase C close and then
let's say primary true it's gonna be the
primary button and then we need an on
click and that's gonna call this dot
handle close like that
okay and that's it for the actions now
we can create our dialogue so the
dialogue is gonna go right below our
image list content and it's only gonna
show if it's ignited if it's initialized
so don't worry about it just displaying
for the hell of it so we're gonna say
dialog and then pass in our properties
here so let's say actions which is going
to be the actions we just created
let's pass in modal and we're gonna set
that to false and let's set open to the
state so this dot state dot open
whatever that value is true or false and
then we also want on request close and
we're gonna set that to this dot handle
close all right and inside the dialog
this again this should be just an
opening tag alright so inside the dialog
we want the image so we're gonna say
image and the source is going to be set
to whatever the current image is so this
thoughts state dot current image and I'm
gonna set a style here so we're going to
use some standard react inline styling
so you want to use two curly braces and
then let's say with we want to set that
to 100% of the the modal of the dialog
alright and so that should be it for
that now we have to create our handle
open and handle close so we'll go up
here above render let's say handle open
and this is actually going to take in an
image which I didn't do down here
oh yeah we'll do that after I guess so
handle open is actually going to take in
an image parameter and we're gonna then
set the state so set state and of course
we want to set open now to true all
right want to set open to true and then
we also want to set the current image to
the image that's passed in all right and
then what I'm gonna do is just copy this
and we're gonna have handle closed which
is not going to take in anything so
we're going to just replace that with an
empty set up parenthesis and then we
just want to set open to false okay
that's all this does and we can get rid
of this okay so it's going to open and
close our dialog except except handle
open is going to pass in the image that
it wants to set as the current image now
where do we implement this handle open
we'll remember the icon the icon button
that's where we want to call this so
where we have this icon button we're
gonna pass in and on click okay so we're
gonna say on click and instead of just
doing this dot handle open which would
be fine if we were just calling it
without a parameter but since we're
adding a parameter what we're gonna do
is make this into an arrow function so
we're gonna go like that and then we're
gonna pass in here image dot large image
URL okay remember we're mapping through
the images here we can get all those
properties including image large URL
which is what we show on the grid but we
also want to pass it into this function
so that it gets caught up here and then
we set the current image to that image
all right so it knows what to display
and then down in the dialogue it's gonna
go ahead and it's gonna display that the
current in whatever the current image is
alright so hopefully that makes sense so
we'll save this
and hopefully everything works so let's
try it out oops let's go back here and
let's say dog let's click this icon here
and there we go so we have our dialog
and here's our flat button with the
clothes let's try that out that works
awesome so our application is working
perfectly great so if we want to search
for something else
let's say we want 50 images of I don't
know person oops and 50 might take a
minute to get or a couple seconds and
you can see that it's getting us 50
images of person or people all right and
I think it's a pretty decent looking
application as well I really like how
the grid is and how the
information here the icons stuff like
that so that's it
hopefully you guys enjoyed this little
project a lot of you guys were asking
the requirements to take my myrn course
on udemy which is a full-stack react
Redux nodejs course and i basically said
to know the basics of no job no js' and
and react and this is a nice little
application to kind of get you started
although this also implements material
UI which is separate it's a separate
library that you know you don't need to
know we don't use that in the course or
anything but if you're interested check
that course out you can find it in on my
website which there's a link in the
description I'll also have a link to
this code on github and that's it please
