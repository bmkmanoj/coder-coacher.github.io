released a crash course on the
materialized CSS framework and I got a
lot of good feedback you guys really
liked it and I did mention that I might
do a part two and go over the JavaScript
widgets because I didn't have time to
cram that into the first video so that's
what I'm going to do now we're going to
go through we're going to look at things
like carousels sliders modal's
although all the different JavaScript
widgets that you can use and materialize
alright now this is what we've already
done okay so basically look at all the
CSS elements kind of a cheat sheet or a
sandbox whatever you want to call it now
I'm not going to add on to this I want
to leave this file as is what I am going
to do is just create another file in the
materialized sandbox and I'm just going
to call it index - dot HTML and you can
call it whatever you'd like and then
what we'll do is go back to the
documentation and go to get started and
just grab this right here the HTML set
up so let's copy that and let's go and
paste that in and we're going to use the
CDN we're not we don't actually have a
local version of the CSS so let's go
ahead and grab this link right here to
see the end link that's for the CSS so
paste that in here and of course we're
going to need the JavaScript so let's
grab that as well this CDN and we're
going to put that right here okay so now
we should be all set to start using the
widgets so I'm going to create a
container because I want everything to
be kind of pushed into the middle so
let's go right here and we'll say div
container and I'm by the way I'm using
Emmet so that's that's why you see those
shortcuts that I'm using so in the
container first thing I want to look at
is the carousel which is kind of like
kind of like a slider it has the image
and then you can kind
just push it to the side and load the
next one and so on so let's go ahead and
add the markup for that I'm going to put
a comment in here and also an h1 and
then how this works is we have a div
with the class of carousel and inside
div we're going to have some a tags
which are going to have a class of
carousel item so carousel - items ok and
then the far as the href here what I'm
going to do is put in a number sign and
then one like that one with an
exclamation mark and then in here will
be an image so let's put an image tag
and as far as the images I'm just going
to paste this in we're just we're going
to use larom pixel which is a helpful
site that generates images for you for
our sample you know sample images for
projects like this so basically what
this is going to do is it's going to
give us an image that's 250 by 250 and
it's going to be in the nature category
alright so let's go ahead and just copy
this whole thing here and then we're
going to paste this in 2 3 4 5 times and
we're just going to change the IDs here
are the href so this will be 4 - this
will be 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 ok so if we go ahead and
save this and then we go to so we're
going to go to the server that's running
and then I'm going to go slash index dot
dot index - dot HTML and we don't see
anything here because we have to
actually initialize it in the JavaScript
okay so let's go back to Adam and then
we're going to go down here and we're
going to put in some script tags and
we're using jQuery so we're going to put
in our money sign we're going to do
document dot ready
and here we put a function okay so as
soon as the documents ready we want to
just initialize the carousel so we can
do that by using jQuery to grab the
class of carousel and then just call dot
carousel okay it's a jQuery plug-in and
then it should work so let's save let's
go back and there we go
and if I click on the next image well
it'll go over if I click on back now
they're all the same image because we're
using that LARM pixel if we want to
change that we can just kind of we can
change the category so if we go back I'm
not exactly sure what other categories
they have let's check it out if you've
never used Lauren pixel it's very
helpful when you're you know in
development and you just need quick
images so you can see this like sports
animals food business so it's changed
change some of these up so we'll say
sports food animals and fitness okay and
go back and now we have different images
oh it looks like one of these what is
that Fitness that's not an actual
category why did I even put fitness
let's do I don't know cats you know I
freaking hate cats okay
all right so there we go very easy to
implement now we can also take the
carousel and make it into a full width
slider so let me show you what I mean
I'm going to copy let's see I'm going to
copy all of this actually except for the
container let me put a comment here just
so I know this is where the container
ends all right so I'll go ahead and
paste this in and let's change this up
this is stuff will say carousel full
slider and then we just want to add to
this class here in addition to carousel
we want carousel - slider and then these
we can just keep this all the same I'm
just going to change the size of the
images here let's change it to 800 wide
and 400 high all right we'll just change
the rest of these all right let's take a
look and it's not showing up because we
actually we actually need to add a line
of JavaScript for that as well so down
at the bottom here just like we did with
the regular carousel I'm just going to
copy that we'll say a knit carousel
slider and then here we just want to do
dot carousel dot carousel - slider and
it could be dot carousel and then we can
change we can add some options here I'm
going to add an option of full width and
we'll set that to true okay let's see
what that gives us and there we go and
if I click and hold and drag or just
click yeah I guess you do have to drag
it but you can push it forwards or
backwards okay which is really nice so
that's the carousel let's move on let's
see what we're doing next here let's
move
- and there is another slider that I'll
get to in a little bit but let's move on
to collapsible which is kind of like
kind of like an accordion I think that's
what it's called in bootstrap so let's
go ahead and put a comment in here and
we'll say collapsible I think that's how
you spell it on the horrible speller
so collapsible and we're going to put a
ul in here and we're going to give it a
class of collapsible and we're also
going to give it a special attribute
called data collapsible okay just like
that and we're going to set that to
accordion and then inside here we
obviously need our allies and then
inside the Li let's do a div with the
class of collapsible header collapsible
- header all right and then in here I'm
going to put an icon so let's do I with
the class of material - icons and this
icon is going to be filter underscore
drama and let's see we're going to go
outside of actually we're going to put
some text next to the icon so let's say
first and then under the header we're
going to have another div and this one
is going to have the class of
collapsible body okay and then in the
body what we'll do is let's put a span
and then we'll just put some dummy text
I'm going to say LARM 10 so that gives
us 10 dummy text words here and then
that should be it for the first one so
let's copy the li and we'll put two more
in I'll just change this one to second
and let's change this one to third
all right I think that should be good so
let's save that and see what it gives us
and there we go if first second third
click on first you'll see it opens
awesome so if I click on one that's
going to close the previous one now you
may want to have one of these open by
default when the user comes to your page
so what we can do is we can add an
active class let's say we want the
second one open so right here we'll just
add in the class of active and now you
can see it's open you know I'm going to
do is add in a div with a height so this
you guys aren't looking at the very
bottom of the screen so I'm just going
to go under the container here and just
say div and let's give it a style of
height 500 pixels all right that way
guys don't have to look at the very
bottom of the screen so the next thing
I'm going to look at our toast which are
really nice I guess pop-ups you could
call them so let's go back and go under
the collapsible under the accordion I'm
going to put a comment here toasts and
let's put an h1 we'll say toast and then
I'm going to put an a tag in here with
the class of BTN okay so it's going to
be a button and as far as the text in
the button let's just say toast and then
we're going to add an on click here okay
so right here let's do actually let's
get rid of the href and then we'll say
on click and we're going to set this to
materialise dot toast and then we can
pass in a message for instance lips
today post saved let's say after you
submit a post to your database you want
this to show up and then we can do the
time that we want it to show up so I'm
going to do 4,000 meaning 4,000
milliseconds okay so it's 4 seconds and
then actually let's just do that and I'm
not sure if I have to initialize this
let me just check real quick you know we
shouldn't have to initialize it I don't
think so let's go back over here and
let's go ahead and click the toast
button and you'll see we get this post
saved and we can keep clicking it and
they're only going to last for 4 seconds
ok or whatever you specify so I think
that's really cool it says it's really
easy to implement just a simple on click
now you can also initialize I'm not
initialized but you can execute these
toasts from JavaScript as well okay it
doesn't have to be from a button click
so to do that let's go down to our
script here and let's say fire just a
fire off toast and all we have to do is
say materialize dot toast and setup just
like be on click so we could do let's
just say hello world and I'll say we
want it for 3 seconds and now if we go
and you'll see that it fires off right
away if I reload the page it's going to
show again ok and it's going to last for
3 seconds you can also you can also
style them so if we wanted for instance
round corners let's go up here I'm going
to comment that out because I don't want
that firing off every time but let's go
to where we have the button and we can
add in a third parameter and say rounded
all right and now you'll see that it has
rounded corners okay so that's the toast
now let's take a look at tooltips which
are pretty easy to implement so we're
going to go under where we have the
toast and let's say tooltips
okay so for this what I'm going to do is
create an a tag and I'm going to give it
a class of BTN and also a class of
tooltips okay tool tipped and then we're
going to give it a special attribute
called data position so data position
and you can specify where you want the
tooltip to pop up so let's say top and
let's just go I'll say hover me and then
we also need a special attribute called
data tooltip which is going to be the
content of that tooltip so we'll just
say I am tooltip let's take a look at
that so hover me there it is
I am tooltip and as you probably guessed
we can change the positioning so let's
go ahead and just copy this paste ten
three more and then I'm going to change
this one to bottom I'm going to change
this one to left and I'm going to change
this one to right not only that but we
can also add a delay oops I needs a
quote we can also add a spell us how
long we want to delay so for this second
one here let's say data - delay and
we're going to slip that to 50 so let's
go ahead and take a look and now that's
the top that's the bottom that's the
left that's the right let's make the
delay longer I don't know why I put 50 I
believe it's millisecond so let's do
5,000 okay so now we can see I'm
hovering over it five seconds goes by
and there it is okay so you can delay
them really simple next thing we're
going to look at is a drop-down so let's
go ahead and put in
a comment here dropdowns so what we're
going to do is put in an a tag here and
this is going to have a class of
drop-down - button and we're also going
to want the BTN class because it is a
button and then let's see we're going to
have a special attribute called data
activates so data - activates and we'll
set that to let's say drop-down one and
we'll say drop-down so what it's going
to do is it's going to look for an
element with the ID of drop-down one so
I'm actually going to just paste this in
because I don't want to type it out but
you'll see that it's ul with the idea of
drop-down one we actually did this in
the navigation part of the last video
okay class of drop-down content which
will initially hide this alright and
then we'll save it and run it and now if
I go when I click here you'll see we get
our drop-down we have a divider we can
put icons so looks really nice so the
next thing we're going to look at is
something called material boxed and this
is basically like an image modal or
what's that called just you know when
you click on an image and it just makes
it bigger a lightbox that's what it is a
lightbox so it's a materialized or
material box
all right so what we'll do is put in an
image here and let's give it a class of
material boxed okay now for the source
I'm just going to grab a link here this
is actually from the materialized CSS
site and we're going to put in a
actually let's just do that first okay
so there it is and if I hover over it
first of all it gets lighter and then if
we click it it goes into a lightbox it
gets bigger okay we can also add a
caption if we go over here we add data
let's see what is it data caption and
we'll just say here is an image caption
and now if we click on that you'll see
down here we have our caption so very
very easy to implement this stuff and if
you weren't using a framework and you
were using just straight JavaScript or
jQuery it would be a lot more difficult
to do something like that so the next
thing we're going to look at is a slider
not the carousel slider but there's
actually a separate slider that we can
use so for this we're going to have a
div with the class of a slider and
inside here we're going to have a UL and
we're going to give that a class of
slides and then we'll have our Li tags
and an image so it's a image and then
for the source we're going to use alarm
pixel image it's going to be 580 with
250 height and then we can also put
captions so if we go under the image
here and let's do div and let's give
this a class of caption and I also want
to give it a class of center
--eline okay and then in this div let's
put an h3 and we'll just say this is our
tag line and then under that i'm going
to put an h5 and i'm going to give that
a class of light and let's say grey text
actually should be a dot right there I'm
using Emmet okay and if you don't know
what this stuff is light gray text go
back and watch the first video because I
go over all the colors and stuff like
that and we can do text lighten three
okay so we have this h5 and then we'll
say here is our slogan
so then what I'll do is copy that li
let's do three of them and let's see
we'll just let's change this to two
three just we have different images and
see this is our tagline you know what
let's do left aligned for this one and
then for this one here we'll do right
aligned alright now I think we have to
initialize this let me check real quick
yeah we do so let's save and it will not
save let's go down here and go into our
script and we just want to grab the
slider class and we just want to call
dot slider okay save that there we go
our tagline here's our slogan and you
can see that we can click on these here
brings in our tagline this is a left
aligned then we have our right aligned
so nice and clean so the next thing
we're going to look at our modal's
okay so modal's are those are also in
bootstrap basically you know you click
and then you have this this piece of
content that opens up kind of like kind
of like a light box but for content
so say modal okay and first we need some
kind of trigger so let's say modal
triggers and we're just going to have
some buttons so let's do an a and we'll
give it a class of hooks what I do that
I'll give it a class of button let's
also give it a class of waves effect and
then this is going to actually go to an
ID of whatever we want let's call it
modal one all right and then for the
text will also say modal one and then
I'm going to put another button that's
going to go to modal - okay we'll make
this button read so we're going to need
the structure for modal one will have to
see there so let's do a div and this is
actually going to have an ID of modal
one okay and then we're going to give it
a class of just modal and then inside
here we're going to have a div with the
class of modal content and for the
content let's put an h4 and we'll say
modal header alright and then under the
h4 we'll just put a paragraph and we'll
say a bunch of text and then it can also
have a footer so if we go under the
content here and put a div and we'll
give that a class of the modal - footer
alright and then inside the footer let's
put an a tag and I'm going to give it a
class of modal action also modal - close
let's also do
waves effect and let's do I cannot type
and talk waves green all right and then
I'll see we'll just say I don't know
button so let's save that whoops
what'd I do alright let's save that take
a look
so there we go modal one now nothing's
happening when I click it that's because
we need to initialize this as well so
let's go back to the script tags down
here let me just put a comment here say
a knit knit slider and then let's do a
knit modal sorry for that yelling
upstairs and this is this is going to be
dot modal number all of them have a
class of modal and then we're going to
call the modal plug-in so let's try that
out okay we click that there we go
modal header bunch of text we have our
button and then if we wanted to have
another modal okay we have this one
that's going to go to modal too so we
could just create another one of these
so just change that to two and we'll say
modal - header and now we can have
separate modal's okay so the next thing
I want to look at is side nav now you
saw a little bit of this when we did the
navigation bars in the last video if we
you know made it to a smaller size if we
made the screen smaller we'd have this
collapse button look that we could click
and then open a side nav we don't have
to just use that in your navigation you
can do that anywhere so let's go ahead
and do that so let's say side nav
okay so we're going to have a ul with an
idea of slide - out and we're going to
give it a class of side nav all right
and then here let's put an li and then
we'll put we'll put an a tag and then
inside here let's put an icon so I dot
material icons and let's do a cloud icon
and then we'll just put in here
we'll save link one alright so that's
our first link and then I'm just going
to copy the Li alright and then for this
one we'll say link two and we'll leave
out the icon just giving you some
different options then we could have a
divider so if we wanted to do right here
we could say we could do div we could do
a div with the class of divider and
let's see for this one here let's do
this a tag will give a class of sub
header okay and then we'll just say sub
header and then for this last one here
let's give this a tag let's give it a
class of waves effect and we'll get rid
of the icon and we'll say link three now
we need an activator or a trigger
whatever you want to call it so let's
put in an a tag here and let's um let's
give this a special attribute of data
- activates and we're going to set that
to slide - out and let's also give it a
class we're going to give it a class of
button collapse
okay and then we'll put an eye tag in
here with a class of material - icons
and let's make this a menu icon alright
so we have our little menu icon now it's
not working because we actually have to
initialize this as well so let's go to
our script tags let's say and knit side
nav so we're going to take that button
collapse class and then we're just going
to call side nav and we did this we did
this in the last video as well so now if
I click this you'll see we get this
sidebar you have a link with an icon
without an icon a divider we can also
have sub headers if you want to break
your links up into separate groups so
pretty handy so the next thing we're
going to look at our tabs okay so let's
go back and let's see we're going to go
up here and let's say tabs so for the
tabs I'm going to put let's do a div and
let's give it a class of row and then
we're going to do a div with the class
of call and the class of s 12 which will
make it a 12 column depth
okay and again if you haven't watched
the last video go ahead and watch that
and I'll show you about the grid system
so let's put a UL here with the class of
tabs and then we'll have our allies that
are also going to have a class of tab
and then I'm also going to give it a
class of call and then also s3 okay so
these will be three column divs and then
we'll put in a tags and here we'll say
test one
all right and then the href here is
actually going to go to a specific ID
which I'm going to call test one and
then what we can do is go under C we're
going to go under this div here and
let's put a div with the ID of test one
okay and I'm also going to just give it
a class let's give it a class of call
and then s twelve and then in here for
text we'll just say test one and then
what we'll do is create another Li up
here let's create a couple more so this
is test one we'll do test two three four
this will go to two three four and then
we'll just copy this okay so this will
be two three four all right so let's go
ahead and try that so that's what it
looks like and you see I go to test to
this content changes test 3 test 4 very
easy to do now we can also make one of
these active if we want when we come to
the page let's say we want test two to
be active we can just add class active
we can also disable one if we wanted to
let's say for this list item here the
third one we want to disable we can just
give it a class or not
yeah class of disabled so let's look at
that and you'll see that when we enter
the page it starts on test two and we
can't go to test three because it's
disabled all right guys so you can see
there's a lot of cool stuff with the
Java Script widgets now the last thing
I'm going to show you is something that
I think is really cool and really unique
and that's tap target which is part of
the feature discovery widget so let's go
under the tabs and let's say tap target
and what we're going to do here is put
in a div and we're going to give this
this is going to be a fixed action
button okay we went over that in the
last video so it needs a class of fixed
action - button or BTN I'm sorry okay
and then we're going to float this into
the corner of the page okay the lower
right-hand corner so I'm just going to
put a style tag in here and let's say we
want it bottom I will say 45 pixels and
let's say from the right will do 24
pixels all right and then inside this
div we're going to put an a tag with an
ID of menu all right and then we're also
going to give it let's give it a class
as well all right couple classes so a
class will have waves effect will do
waves light it's hard to type today so
that should be waves light and it's also
- BTN this is going to be a floating
button so we want to do BTN - floating I
also want it to be large so BTN - large
and I'm going to make it the color cyan
all right so that's going to be our
floating button and inside here is going
to be an icon so let's say I class
material icons and the icon I want is
the menu icon all right now let's just
look at this so you can see if it gave
us this little icon over here if I click
it it doesn't do anything it just goes
up to the top of the screen so what
we're going to do is add an event to it
so let's go back and let's add an
on-click so we'll go right here and stay
on click
and then what this is going to do is
we're going to throw some jQuery in here
and we're going to say for the class of
tap target so tap target and then we're
going to call the tap target plugin so
dot tap target and we want to pass in
here open okay because we want it to
open now it's going to look for
something with the class of tap target
so we're going to go underneath this div
here and let's say tap target content
okay so we're going to have a div and
we're going to give a class of tap
target let's also give it a class of
cyan because I want to match the color
of the button and then we also want this
to have a special attribute of data
activates all right and that's going to
activate the menu all right and then in
here let's create another div and let's
give this a class of tap target content
okay I'm also going to give it a class
of white text and let's put an H 5 and
for the title we'll just say tap target
content and then under the H 5 we'll put
a paragraph I'll say larom I don't know
30 just give us some sample text to work
with let's give this power graph a class
of white text as well and that's it so
let's go ahead and save this and we're
going to go back and if I click this
nothing happens let's see why is that
not working
oh you know what it is we need to get
rid of the href alright let's try that
so now if I click this look at that that
I think that is really cool looking and
you can see you can obviously make it
different colors just by changing cyan
to a different color now we can we don't
need to just use this to activate it we
could create another button so for
instance if I wanted to go let's see
we'll go right under this and let's
let's just create a regular button so
we'll give it an a tag with the class of
waves effect waves light BTN and cyan
okay and we'll just get rid of the href
here because that screws things up and
then we can just grab that on click this
right here and we'll just paste that
right in here okay and then for the text
will just say open tap target and then
we can also create a separate button to
close it if we want so if I were to copy
this oh you know what I don't have soft
wrap on sorry about that guys you see
how it stuff goes outside of the screen
here I don't like that there we go
alright so for this one all we need to
do is instead of saying open will stay
closed and it's just let's just change
this to close and now we have our two
buttons we can open it this will also
close it it'll kind of just toggle it I
guess but you can also go over here and
close it this one will not open it it'll
just close it alright I just think
that's really cool something unique that
you don't really see in other frameworks
alright guys so I'm going to go ahead
and stop the video here so between this
this file and the other one we created
in the last video you have quite a few
really cool elements and really cool
functionality to work with on the front
end I will be making a video creating
either a website or UI I'm not exactly
sure when that's going to be
so it's not going to be my next video
pretty sure so thanks for watching guys
