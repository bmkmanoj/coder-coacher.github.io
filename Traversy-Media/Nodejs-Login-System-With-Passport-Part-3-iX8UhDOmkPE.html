our login and registration application
using nodejs in the last video we
finished up our registration so we can
now register user now we need to work on
the login all right so we're in the
passport documentation here and in the
authenticate section and you can see
that we're creating a post route to
login and that's what we want to do
alright because the form that the login
form is being submitted to that URL so
let's copy that
and we're going to go into routes users
go down to the bottom here paste that in
alright if you can get rid of this stuff
here so what we're doing we're making a
post request to slash login and then we
also have a second parameter of passport
authenticate all right we want to use
our local strategy because we're using a
local database all right now before we
go on to this we need to actually
include passport so up at the top here
I'm just going to paste this in we're
including passport as well as local
strategy so get that in there and then
down here we're going to add a parameter
to this authenticate and this is going
to be an object these are basically like
options so we want to set our success I
think it's no it's not an underscore its
success redirect okay that's going to be
slash and then we're going to have a
failure redirect that's going to be
slash users slash login and then we also
want to tell it if we want to use flash
messaging so say failure flash we're
going to set that to true alright and
then down here all we're going to do is
redirect
to the dashboard or /alright so
everything is going to come from our
local strategy which we're going to
create now if we look at the
documentation and let's see right here
you see how we have this passport use
local strategy we're going to grab that
and we're going to put that right above
our login post all right so this does
two things it gets the username it
matches what you put in finds if there's
a username that matches and then it
validates the password all right now
we're going to do it a little
differently we're not just going to do
our finds right here we're going to call
functions that are in the model all
right so we can actually get rid of all
this let's put these on the same line
all right so first thing we'll do is
we're going to call a model function
called get user by user name now we
haven't created that yet we'll do that
in a second okay
get user by user name and then that's
going to be passed in obviously a user
name and then a function alright and for
this we're going to pass in an error and
user okay
then we'll check for the error and just
throw if there is one if not then we're
going to check to see if there's not a
user if there's not a match all right so
I'm going to say if not user then we're
going to return done and we want to say
null and the second parameter should be
false
all right and then the third we can
actually include a message
okay so we'll say unknown user all right
now if there is a user match it's going
to keep going so the next thing we want
to do is call user dot compare password
okay so compare password that's going to
get a password user dot password and
then a function will say error and also
is match okay and then let's check for
the error and then we're going to check
for the match
so we'll say if is match then we're
going to return done and we'll pass in
null and we'll also pass in the user
okay that's if there is a match else
then we're still going to return done
but the second parameter is going to be
false and we're also going to pass a
message
all right so that should do it would
save it now we need to create these two
functions in the model all right so
we'll go right under create user exports
dot get user by username
this is going to take in username and
call back all right and then in here all
we're going to do is let's create a
query we want where username matches the
username that's brought in all right and
then we simply want to call user dot
find one pass in the query and call back
now we could have just as well put this
user find one in right inside of the
route right here but I like to keep all
the functions encapsulated in the model
okay it just makes for a cleaner
application so the next one we want is
compare password okay that's going to
take in a candidate password okay so
whatever the user types in this is going
to take in a whoops one why this isn't
right we get to say equal function
okay this will be hash and call back
okay so in here we're going to have to
use bcrypt
so we're going to say actually let's
grab it from here so we want this right
here
alright so bcrypt
dot compare and we want to pass in the
candidate password here and then hash
and then I like to call this is match
all right and then what we can do is
just check for the error and then call
back that will get passed null and is
match and that's it so so let's save
that and then there's one more thing we
have to put in our route file we need a
serialize and deserialize function which
I think we can get here Yeah right here
okay so we'll put this right here
serialize user and then deserialize user
instead of calling fine by ID we're
going to call a model function so we're
going to change this to weight fine by
ID we'll change it to get user by ID all
right and that's going to be a function
we create inside of our model so let's
save that and then go back to the model
and I'm going to copy this okay and this
is going to be called get user by ID
and I'll take in an ID and then we can
get rid of that and then let's change
this to find by ID these are all
Mongoose methods that you see here all
right and then we just have to pass in
the ID and call back and that's it so
let's say we should now be able to log
in hopefully
let's restart app is not defined oh-oh
since we're using router this needs to
be router all right let's try again
all right so let's go try to log in we
know we have a user named Brad put in
the password submit missing credentials
hmm that's weird
let me just check the form okay it's
going to users log in oh I don't have a
name field here this needs to have name
username and then this one should be
name password
all right so if we don't put anything in
we get missing credentials if we put
Brad in which is a valid user but the
wrong password we get invalid password
if we put Brad with the correct password
I think that's it submit okay we still
get invalid password unless I'm not
remembering it right there we go
okay so now we're logged in we need a
way to log out now all right we have a
logout link and it's going to users
slash logout so let's create a route for
that so we'll go to routes users let's
go all the way to the bottom and we're
going to say router dot get slash log Oh
actually we don't need next so what we
want to do here all you have to do to
log out is say req dot log o okay and
then we'll just send a message so let's
say request dot flash this will be a
success message okay and we'll just say
you are logged out all right then we'll
redirect press redirect and we'll want
to go to the login page all right let's
try it so we'll save now since we're
restarting the server we're not going to
be logged in anymore
all right so let's try to log in again
and now since we logged in if I click
logout we get logged out now there's no
way to actually tell if we're logged in
so we want to change this menu around if
we are logged in okay for logs and we
don't want login we don't want register
if we're logged out we don't want to see
logout so what we'll do is let's go to
app J s and I know we said that we
weren't going to edit this file anymore
but it's just one little thing we have
to put in we're going to paste this
right inside here with the rest of the
global variables so creating one called
user and if the user is there then we're
going to be able to access the the user
from anywhere and if it's not then this
will just be null so let's save that and
then what we'll do is go to our layout
handlebars and we'll go right above
login and register and we'll say if user
so this means if the user is logged in
so what I want to do is say if not
user then we want to show these two
links all right and then for logout we
want that to be only if the user is
logged in all right so let's try that
we'll save it
restart okay we're not going to be
logged in now well it's this close raw
block all right you know what it is like
I don't think we can use this so what
we'll do is we'll say if user and then
we'll put an else okay so if user you
want to put this down here all right and
then this will grab and we'll put that
here because if the user is logged in we
want to see the log out if not we want
to see these alright so let's try that
okay so we're not logged in you can see
that the logout button is not here now
let's do the same with dashboard
actually dashboard should only be there
if the user is logged in
there we go okay so now log in register
all right so let's login and now we're
logged in so we can see dashboard we can
also see logout now the last bit of
functionality is that we don't want the
user to be able to see the dashboard
unless they logged in because right now
we can log out and even though it's not
here we can still go to the dashboard
all right so we want to fix that so
let's go to actually let's go to the
index route because that's where we're
loading the index file so what we want
to do is create a function down here and
we're going to call it ensure
authentication or insure off any cated
all right and what we want to do is
we're going to say if req dot is
authenticated then we're going to return
next so basically just keep going else
then we're going to set a message will
say request dot flash and this is going
to be an error message okay and we'll
just say you are not logged in okay and
then let's do res dot redirect to slash
users slash login all right
now to write to use this in a row we can
just use it as a second parameter so up
here
going to say and sure authenticated just
like that alright so let's try it so if
I go and reload we get redirected to the
account login ok so if I try to go to
localhost 3000 it just brings us here
now you might not want to have this just
because if they just go to that URL you
might not want this so if you don't just
go ahead and take that out ok so now I
try to go there we get booted back
alright so I think we're there we have a
full login and registration system and
also authentication and access control
so I hope you guys enjoyed this I will
be putting the code for this project on
github if you like my videos check out
edge wanax comm I have I don't know
something like 25 courses there many of
them in JavaScript with node angular and
all that so check that out please leave
a like subscribe but dislike if you
didn't like it and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
