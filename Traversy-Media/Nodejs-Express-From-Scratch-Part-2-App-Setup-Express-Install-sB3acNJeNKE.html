express application we're going to
create a project folder and we're going
to initialize it with a package.json
file which is a manifest file with all
the application info the name the
version description also the
dependencies that it uses okay because
when you install a node module for an
application it becomes a dependency and
listing them in this file makes it easy
to transfer your application and then
install all the dependencies in just one
command all right so we're also going to
be installing Express which is a web
framework a back-end web framework for
node now it is possible to build web
applications with no js' without
something like Express you could just
use let's say the HTTP client or our
HTTP module but it's much more difficult
because with nodejs it's not like
something like let's say Apache and PHP
where you have an Apache server that
constantly runs and handles all your
requests and all that and then you just
upload your PHP files with nodejs we
actually have to handle we have to
manually handle the requests in the
response
all right we have to you know handle the
get request and then spit out a response
and so on so Express allows us to do
that very very easily and with much much
less code alright and there's a whole
bunch of other features that Express has
as well so this is the website if you
want to read more about Express we're
going to install and all that so you
don't really need that but there is a
guide that explains more about like
routing for instance if we want to
handle a request to the home page we can
do apt-get because that's a get request
to slash which is the home page if we
wanted to handle it to the about page we
could put slash about or something like
that and then once we define that that
route or that request we can put a
function in and we'll have access to
that the request and the response object
and then we can use those in the
function alright and when you submit a
form it's usually a post request and you
can handle that with
post okay but we'll get into that later
so let's go ahead and I'm going to see
how I want to do this I'm going to go to
my C Drive and I'm going to create a new
folder and I'm just going to call it
projects all right and then in the
projects is where we want to create our
application folder alright so this is
going to be a knowledge base or an
article database so let's create a
folder I'm just going to call this let's
call it snowed kb node knowledge base
all right so that's going to be the name
of our app and inside here we want to
open a command line now if you installed
git bash you can just right click and
you can say get bash here if you if
you're on Windows and you're using the
standard Windows command line you can
hold ctrl and then right click I'm sorry
shift and then right click and you can
say open command window here alright so
we're going to open up git bash and I'm
just going to make this a little bigger
alright and then to create the
package.json file I was talking about
you could manually create it but an
easier way is to use NPM and you can do
NPM in it alright and that will actually
ask us some questions about our
application so first thing is the name
whatever is in the parentheses will be
the default if you just click enter so
we're going to go ahead and do that make
this a little bigger
ok the version 1.0.0 is fine description
will say simple knowledgebase app now
the entry point is going to be the main
the main javascript file for node it's
by default index j s but I prefer app J
s and sometimes you might see server J s
alright test command we don't need that
we don't need that keywords author feel
free to put your own name in there and
it's going to ask us if that's ok we'll
say yes
for some reason on Windows this part
hangs so I'm just going to do a ctrl C
alright and then if we look in our
project folder you'll see package Jason
so what we want to do now is open this
node KB folder up inside of our text
editor I'm using Adam and a nice little
trick here is in when you're in the
command line we can do Adam dot and that
will open it up in this folder okay in
the project folder move this over here
okay so it's also going to open up the
welcome guide we're just going to close
this stuff up all right so here's our
package dot JSON file to take a look at
it and it basically just has all the
stuff that we entered when it asked us
asked us the questions the name version
description and so on you can also write
little scripts with NPM to do certain
things they give you this default test
which is just going to echo no test
specified but you can you can put things
here we're actually going to create a
start script which will just start our
application so now that we have this
let's not let's create our main file
here remember the main file we said was
apt j/s so let's say new file fjs and
then in here let's just do just a
console dot log and we'll just say hello
world we save that we go over here we
can say node and then the name of the
file we want to run so app dot j s
alright and it just spits out hello
world you don't have to add the
extension if we do node app that'll do
the same thing all right now when you
build an application you may have a pas
you may have index j s server j s so a
good idea in what you'll often see is a
script okay so in here we can actually
get rid of the test and let's say start
all right and then here we want to
basically just put the command we want
that to run which will be node
app alright so now if we save that we go
over here and we say NPM start you'll
say it'll it'll run the it'll run that
file alright just like is if you said
node app and you can see it actually
does run no doubt so what we want to do
now is we want to install Express which
is a node module okay so to do that
we're going to say npm install and then
we're going to add - - save and what
this does is it'll take whatever we
install on this in this case Express and
it'll add it to dependencies in our
package JSON file
alright so let's say install saved
Express and it's also going to create a
folder called node modules up here and
that's where all your all your packages
all your modules will go and you can see
here now we have Express and we have the
latest version at this time for point
15.3 ok yours may be different depending
on when you're watching this so now
we're going to do is go into app KS and
we want to bring in our Express module
so to do that we're going to say let's
Express and by the way I'm using es6
syntax so i'm using wet but you can also
use bar actually no I'm gonna lose Const
okay because this isn't going to change
and then we need to set it equal to
require and here we're going to pass in
Express okay the name of the module so
next thing we want to do is we want to
assign a variable let's say Const app
and we're going to set that to Express
okay to the Express function and this is
all in the guide here if we go to see
that's just installing right here so
we're bringing in Express we're setting
a variable called app to Express and now
we can create routes okay so let's go
down here and let's say app we're going
to use that app variable and we're going
to say get so this will be a get request
to slash to the home page and then here
we can put a fun
now we can do it like this or we can use
es6 syntax and use an arrow function so
you could go like that put alright but
I'm going to stick to the just a
function way because this is for
beginners and you guys may not be you
know at the es6 level I mean using
constant let is is simple but I don't
want to get I don't want things to be
too confused so this function is going
to take in a parameter of request and
response and we have access to both of
these objects so what we want to do is
let's just say res dot send
okay so we're taking the response and
we're calling a function called send
which will just basically send something
to to the browser so in here let's just
say hello world now this alone isn't
going to do anything we need to actually
we need to call the listen function okay
so down here let's say app dot listen
and then this is going to take in the
port okay if we look over here it's
going to take in the port number usually
it's 3,000 we actually don't want quotes
all right so 3,000 and then this also
takes a callback if we want to run
something after we we listen so it's
just to a console dot log and we'll say
server started on port 3000 alright so
just this code here should run so let's
go over to our command line here and
let's clear this out and then we should
be able to do NPM start and now it's
going to ask for a firewall access we'll
just click allow and then it says
service started on port 3000 okay and
since we have this row we should be able
to go over to localhost port 3000 and
there it is hello world alright so now
that we have Express installed and we
know how to create routes and start our
server up in the next video we're going
to get into templating and I'll show you
how to install pug
which is a template engine and we'll
start to create some views alright so I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
