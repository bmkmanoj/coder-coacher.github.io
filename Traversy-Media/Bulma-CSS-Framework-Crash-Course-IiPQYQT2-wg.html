course for you today today we're going
to be looking at Bulma which is a modern
CSS framework based on flexbox now I
know that there's a lot of frameworks
out there to choose from and me making
this video does not equal me saying that
bulma is is better or worse than
anything else a lot of people don't
understand that when I make these videos
I'm not pushing a certain technology on
anyone I make them so that there's a
reference guide for people that want to
learn it or just check it out and see
what it's about so I'm not doing any
comparison in this video to any other
frameworks we can do that in another
video this is just going to be a
reference guide to just really simplify
and look at the different elements and
features that bulma offers all right so
let's go ahead and get started
this video is sponsored by dev Mountain
if you're interested in learning web
development iOS or UX design dev
Mountain is a 12-week design and
development boot camp intended to get
you a full-time job in the industry to
learn more visit dev mountain comm or
click the link in the description below
alright guys so we're going to go ahead
and get started now I already created a
folder called balm of sandbox and I just
have an index.html file in there and I
have that open in Adam which I'm using
for my editor I'm also using a package
called Adam live server and I have that
running over here you can see it's on my
local host on port 3000 but you don't
need this you can simply open your
index.html file right on your file
system alright I'm also using Emmet
which will allow us to or allow me to
type in you know HTML tags and class
names and stuff faster ok so what I'm
going to do here is just do an
exclamation tab and having Emmet
installed that allows us to just
generate a quick HTML document ok now as
far as using bulma I'm going to take the
easy way out and use the CDN so I'm just
going to search for a boma CDN one
person I want caps lock and see we're
going to get it from CDN J Escom so
we'll grab this link right here and then
we're just going to put that up here to
put a link tag and just paste that in
now as far as icons Bulma doesn't have
its own set of icon
ones it recommends to use font awesome
so let's look for the font awesome is
CBN as well and grab it from here and
we're going to put that right above the
ball in the CDN so I'll just paste that
in alright so and that's all we need to
do to start using ball ma so let's
change the title here we'll say Bulma
sandbox and the reason I create these
sandbox or cheat sheet files or HTML
documents are so that you can have it as
a reference so if you're going to use
Bulma for a website or UI you can have
this to go back and easily see the class
names and how everything is put together
I know you do have the documentation but
you have to switch between pages and
sometimes it can be you know over
complicated when it doesn't have to be
so this gives you a nice little
reference alright so first thing I'm
going to do when the body here is I'm
going to just create a container div
okay so I'm using Emmet so I could just
do dot container tab and that will give
us a div with the class of contain this
works just like it does in bootstrap and
most other frameworks it'll add a margin
auto and just kind of move everything to
the middle okay so let's look at some of
the just some of the typography so let's
look at headings okay I'm just going to
put a comment for each section we do
here all right now each section we do
I'm going to wrap in a class or a div
with the class of block block not lock
and that is that's a bulma class and
what it does is it not only displays it
as a block but it gives it some margin
on the bottom so we can kind of separate
the different areas that we're working
on all right so I'm going to use that to
wrap around every different section we
do so for headings if I do an h1 here
and I'll just say hello world and we
save it I would see that should auto
reload there we go all right so notice
that the h1 is not big like it like it
normally would be that's because boma
removes the standard font size for each
of these tags if I were to do an h2
right under it and save it's the same
size so we use classes to change the
size all right but before we get into to
the size classes let's look at a title
and subtitle okay so basically I have
two types of heading title is going to
make it big like that and then we also
have subtitle and that kind of lightens
the font a little bit and makes it
smaller and if you use these two
together like this it's going to remove
the padding in between okay which is
usually what you want
okay so title and subtitle now let's
take a look at some of the sizes
okay so just put a comment there and let
me just copy this all right so I'm just
going to add some change these to h1
through h6 so it'll be two three four
five and six all right and if I save
that you'll see they're all the same
size so if I want to change if I wanted
to have the sizes for an h1 or the
biggest type of heading we could do a
class called is one okay and then for
the h2 we could do is two three or five
and six
okay and now if I reload now it looks
more like you know there were the h1
through h6 now this doesn't matter the
tag doesn't matter if I wanted the h3 to
look like an h6 I could do is six and
now you can see the size reduces okay
let's put that back so that's how we can
add size to our headings
all right so the next thing I'm going to
look at is the content class all right
let's put a class of block here and
we're going to just create a couple
paragraphs and I'm using Adams so I can
do larom and then ten and that's going
to give us ten sand pods ten words of
dummy text all right I'm just going to
copy that paste it in three more times
and save so notice that by default
patting is removed from the paragraphs
alright but if I add a class of content
you see that it adds it adds the padding
there to the bottom now what I'm going
to do is add a class of is small and
save and it's going to make the text
smaller okay and then if we go down here
we say class content we can also do is
medium and then we can do content and is
large ok so just an easy way to kind of
change up the size of the font alright
so let's move on to buttons so we'll go
under this and let's say buttons and
we'll have a block class here and let's
put in a simple button so we'll do
button and not going to add a class yet
if I save it it's just going to look
like a default HTML button and what we
want to do is add a class of button ok
and that will kind of Balma the button
up okay gives it some padding gives it a
border hover effect now there's a lot of
different styles of buttons that we can
use so what I'll do is just copy this
okay and for this one here I'm going to
add a class of is white for this one I'm
going to add is light two is dark is
black and is linked okay and then it's
going to give us these different shades
so is white obviously is pure white I
hover over it it gives it a gray
background is light is going to give it
a light gray background dark will give
it a really dark gray black is obviously
black and then link just format it to
look like a link okay so we have these
different styles now we can also do
colored buttons for this so I'm just
going to use an a tag because obviously
you can apply these classes to just
regular links as well so let's give it a
class of button and then I'm also going
to give it a class
is primary and then in here let's just
say primary okay and the the context
classes are I think they're identical to
bootstrap except we just have is - so
let's save that and there we go
so it gives us this kind of this light
green alright now I'm going to copy this
and then let's change this this change
these up so this one is going to be info
and I'm going to change the class to his
info
this one will be is success
this one will be warning so is warning
this will be danger and is danger save
that and you can see it gives us kind of
the same colors as are the same you know
same basic colors not the exact exact
shade but very similar to bootstrap all
right now we can also change up the size
of buttons so what I'll do is just copy
this block and I'm just going to add
right here and say is small is medium is
large okay save that and you can see we
can have different sides buttons okay we
can also add an is outlined class so I'm
going to copy this block here and in
addition to these classes we'll add is
aligned copy that and we'll put that on
these as well and save and that gives us
these outlined buttons here so it gives
it the border and then when we hover
over it then it fills in the color
hey we also have a class called is
inverted so let's copy this this whole
block and paste that in and I'm just
going to change is outline to is
inverted
okay and then what that does is it gives
it the text color of that particular
context and then we hover over it as a
gray background
I believe the warning has the black
background by default because it's
yellow and you can't really see it on
white I'm pretty sure that's why that's
why it's like that all right so we also
have some some different different
button States so let's go ahead and put
in our block and I'm going to use an a
tag here let's give it a class of button
and we're not also give this a class of
is - hovered okay and here we'll say
hovered and let's copy that okay and
then we'll do focused so this will be is
focused and we have is active and we
have a loading state so is loading and
then for this one I'm actually going to
remove is hovered and just add in
disabled and let's replace this with
disabled all right so if we look down
here you'll see the different states so
hovered gives it a darker darker border
and texts focus has kind of this green
active because it makes it even darker
with some shadow loading and then
disabled the only going to do is at the
bottom of this I'm going to just add a
margin top just so this gets pushed up
and you guys are looking at the bottom
of the screen so it's put a div and I'm
just going to add a style here real
quick so style margin talked 500 pixels
all right that way it can be in the
middle of the screen alright so I think
that that's that's it for buttons really
now let's move on to box okay so we can
have a box class which is kind of like a
well and bootstrap
or bootstrap three bootstrap four
actually removed the wels so let's
create our block class and then we're
going to have a div with the class of
box and you can put anything you want in
here I'm just going to put an h1 and
let's just say hello world and then I'll
just put in a paragraph with some dummy
text and that's what a box looks like
okay it gives it some padding it gives
it a boarder gives it some shadow and I
believe that's a rounded border as well
by default alright we also have
notifications which are kind of similar
to blocks let's go to Z in there alright
so we'll have a div with the class of
notification and let's just put some
dummy text in here save that and that's
what a notification looks like that's a
gray background by default we can also
put a delete button in there if it was
like some kind of alert that you wanted
to add some JavaScript to so we could
put a button with a class of delete and
you see it adds that little X to it it's
not going to do anything you'd need to
add your own JavaScript now we also have
different colors we can do so I'm going
to copy the notification div and then
for the second one here let's add is
primary and we'll do is info is success
it's warning and then it let's do one
more and for this one we're going to do
is danger save that and now you can see
we have these different colored
notifications alright we can also do
tags
okay so let's do a span and I'm just
going to give it a class of tag and
we'll just say hello all right it gives
us this little thing right here okay you
would use this like maybe on a blog post
where you'd want to have some some tags
and then there's a bunch of different
colors we can use I'm going to actually
paste these in because there's quite a
few and we'll save that you see we have
all these different colors we can also
change up the sizes like let's say for
this one we want it to do is large and
for this one we'll do is
medium we can do as small as well but I
believe it's the same as these all right
you'll see that we have medium and large
tags now we can also add delete buttons
on the tag so for instance this one here
this last one let's put a button with
the class of delete and so what let's
put it after the text actually there we
go so now we have this little X and like
I said you could add your own JavaScript
to close that out another thing you can
use is messages so let's say messages
and we're going to have let's actually
make this an article tag and we're going
to give it a class of message all right
and then inside the message we can have
a message header so let's give this a
class of message - header and in here
I'll just put a paragraph and I'll say
about us and then it's going to have a
message body and let's just put some
dummy text in here and save and that's
what it looks like okay it has this
header with a different color and then
the body and we can use context classes
or color classes on this as well so I'm
just going to copy the whole article
Pisa was in a few times and let's see
we're going to add to the second one
here to the article tag with the class
of message we'll add is primary this one
will do is success info what else
warning and then let's do one more which
will be is danger all right so we have
all these different colors now now let's
take a look at the navbar which is
always an important part of a framework
so we're going to go down here and the
comment will say navbar put our block
class alright so for this we're going to
use a nav tag and it's actually going to
have a class of nav not navbar and then
it's going to have a couple different
sections that will have nav left nav
Center and nav right I actually like the
way they do this so let's do a class of
nav left and here we're going to do an a
tag with the class of nav - item okay
pretty much everything is going to be
looked at as a nav item and this is
going to be the brand or the logo so I'm
just going to do let's do an h1 and
we'll give it a class title and for the
size I'm going to do is four and then
I'll just say Traverse City media all
right so that's the logo or the brand
and that's all I want on the left so
let's go under the left now and we can
actually put stuff in the center so
let's do it did with the collapse of nav
Center
alright and we're going to do another a
tag with a nav items and what I want to
put here are two icons we're going to
put the github icon and the Twitter icon
so inside the a tag let's do a span with
the class of icon and then we're going
to do an eye tag with the class of FA
and then FA - github okay and then
that's using fun awesome these are the
font awesome class names so we're going
to copy this a tag and let's do another
one and this one is going to be for
Twitter so we'll just replace the github
with Twitter okay and that's the center
now let's do the right side so the nav
Center ends right here
so we'll say dot now bright and let's
say this is actually going to be the
menu okay because we want some links so
this is also going to have a class of
nav menu alright and in here we're going
to have our first link so it's going to
be an a tag again with nav item oops
that'll just go nowhere and C in here
we'll just say home and then we'll have
a couple more
so we'll do home we'll do about us oops
and let's do contacts all right so let's
go ahead and save that and if we look
down here it's actually responsive right
now so let's make this bigger actually
know that I did something wrong here
what did I do
oh I put nar now right should be nav
right there we go okay so you can see we
have our left our center and right I
actually like the way that they did this
I think it's really easy to remember
because even with the bootstrap navbar
if you're including like the collapsible
menu and stuff I still I couldn't type
it out for you without looking it you
guys know if whenever I'm using
bootstrap I'll go to the bootstrap Docs
and copy the navbar from the sample
template I still can't remember it so
this is pretty easy to remember now as
far as responsiveness if I go down
you'll see that the menu the nav menu
will automatically disappear and there's
no way for us to see it all you have to
do to make this to make it responsive is
add a class to
nav menu which is right here so we're
going to add a class of is active and
save and now you'll see that it's
responsive and if we make this bigger it
goes back to normal okay no JavaScript
needed there is a way that you can use a
hamburger menu but I'm not going to get
into that we're not using any JavaScript
at all
Bulma by default does not have as far as
I know does not have JavaScript widgets
like bootstrap or materialized there are
other third-party libraries that
implement that that kind of stuff but
not by default as far as I know all
right so now let's look at a vertical
menu or sidebar menu so see it's just
fixed that I'm going to go under just
going to put a comment here because this
is the end of the container
alright so we're going to go under here
and let's do side menu ok we'll do our
block class and let's see we're going to
use an a side tag for this and give it a
class of the menu all right and then
let's do a paragraph with the class of
menu label okay and let's just put in
here we'll just save label one all right
and then under that will have a ul with
the class of menu list and let's put
some allies here and an a tag and we'll
just say link one alright so love two
lengths here and if I save that let's
see why isn't that showing up the hell
a second
oh I think that this is actually
covering it it's strange I don't know
why it's doing that let's remove the is
active actually alright just so we can
see that I don't know why that happens
and shows some way to fix it but I'm not
going to get into it
alright so let's uh so we have the label
of the two links if we wanted to add
another label we could do that so let's
copy this and this okay so this will be
label two and then we could have sub sub
menus as well so let's give this link
right here a class of is active all
right and then let's see go like that
and then under the link will do a ul and
here we'll put some allies with some a
tags and you can do as many levels as
you want and then we'll go outside of C
so link one let's see what that looks
like
alright so label to live link one and
this would be link to link three so you
get the point
these these are the same group but this
one has sub links and you can like I
said do as many levels as you want so
that's a side menu or a vertical menu
alright now let's take a look at hero
banners and these are usually you know
large headings that go across the whole
screen and they have different color
backgrounds or image backgrounds so
let's go right here say hero
all right and these are going to be in
section tags which is an html5 tag and
they're going to have a class of hero
and for the hero it's going to have a
body so let's give it a class of hero
body okay and let's see in the body
usually what you would do is you'd add a
container inside the body because you
want the actual hero to go all the way
across the screen but in our case
everything's wrapped in a container so
it's not going to go across the whole
screen anyway but I will just put it
here anyway because that's what you
would usually do so it's put an h1 with
the class of title and we'll just say
hero title all right and then let's also
give it a subtitle so we'll go directly
under the h1 and do an h2 with the class
of subtitle like that and let's save
that now by default it doesn't have any
background but what we can do is copy
this whole section and just paste it in
a bunch of times and let's go to the
second one here we'll add is primary so
you can so you can use these classes on
just about anything is success info
danger and there we go so we have bunch
of heroes with different backgrounds we
also have cards that we can use which
are kind of like kind of like panels in
a way bootstrap for uses cards they're a
little different though so today we'll
do block and let's do a class of card
and cards are going to have another div
in here called card content and you can
format these in different ways let's see
so we'll put a paragraph here we'll give
it a class of title put some dummy text
in there and see what that looks like
okay so it looks kind of like a box and
then we can have a footer as well so
we'll go under the card content sorry if
you guys can hear that rain out there
this is actually going to be a footer
with a class of card - footer ok and
then let's go ahead and put a paragraph
with the class of card footer item and
these are actually going to be buttons
so let's put a Twitter and a Facebook
button so say span and let's say view on
and this will be Twitter and then I'll
grab that same P tag with the class of
card for our item paste that in and
let's say share on Facebook save that
and you can see it has a footer with
these these two areas here and if you
wanted to put I con here you could do
that so if we put an i' classes of fa
and then the class of fa - Twitter I
think that will work
save that get the little Twitter bird
fa fa facebook and get a little Facebook
icon probably look better without the
view on and share on alright so that's a
card and you can get more intricate with
these I would suggest if you're
interested looking at the documentation
and you can see exactly you know what
you can do but I don't want to do things
that are going to take up too much time
and too much markup so the next thing
I'm going to look at is paginate let's
go down here and put a comment will say
pagination let's put a block div here
sorry about that banging upstairs I
don't know why my kids just can't walk
like normal people they have to run back
and forth run everywhere they go I don't
understand all right so let's put a nav
tag here with a class of pagination and
we're going to do a previous button and
actually like how they how they do this
you'll see in a minute but let's give
this an app we'll do an a tag with the
class of pagination previous pagination
previous and I'm going to set this to
disabled because we're going to be on
the first page so previous and then
right under that a tag we'll put another
one and this one this one's going to
have a class of pagination next okay and
that's going to say next page and then
we need a ul for the numbers so the UL
is going to have a class of pagination
lists and then we'll have our allies
we'll have our a tags and each one is
going to have a class of pagination
linked so this will be one
and then let's copy the whole li and
we'll do we'll just do two more and then
I want the first one to be the one we're
on the active one so that's going to
also have a class of is current so let's
go ahead and save that and that's what
it looks like so if we make this bigger
which I kind of like this they put the
the previous to the next page all day
align and over here which I think looks
pretty cool and just to show you what
all this stuff looks like with a bigger
screen okay it's very everything's very
very responsive which of course it has
to be nowadays if there was a framework
that that wasn't responsive by nature it
would just be garbage now we're almost
there we're going to get into the grid
system in a minute but before we do that
I want to show you the level class which
also has to do with alignment and can be
very helpful when you're building UIs
like you know like a blog a blog system
back-end or something like that so today
it's say level so this is actually going
to be a nav and it's going to have a
class of level and this is going to be
the left side okay so we're going to
have a div here and this is going to
have a class of level - left and we're
going to have a bunch of paragraphs here
and they're going to have a class of
level item so this one will just say all
and then let's copy that alright so this
one just imagine this is like a blog
post and our face type thing so this
will be published actually we should
probably have links around these I'll
just put ah can't type
so published let's just put an a tag
around each one of these
alright so published and this next one
will be draft and say deleted and then
let's make this one into a button so
we'll add a class here of button just to
give you some examples change things up
we'll say is primary and let's say this
is new so this is to create a new post
okay and let's say we're on the all page
or the all view so I'm going to just
wrap that and strong all right so if I
save that now this is the response of
view let's make this bigger and you'll
see it's going to align over to the left
so let's say on the right side we want
like a filter or a search box so what we
would do is go under the level left
class and let's say right side so for
this we'll have a div with the class of
level right okay and let's say another
div with level item okay it works kind
of like the navbar and how you have you
know nav right nav item breaks it down
nice nice and simple as far as the class
names we're just going to do a simple
form field and that's another thing we
need to get to is forms so after this
we'll do forms tables and then the grid
system alright so let's do a div with
the class of field and a paragraph tag
with the class of control this is all
part of forms which we'll get into and
then we'll do an input and the input
we'll give it a class of inputs and
let's also do is success actually no we
don't want to do a success
just that that should be good so let's
save that and then we just have an input
let's put a placeholder and we'll just
say search posts all right and you can
see now it's nicely aligned to the right
okay so I think that's kind of cool and
kind of unique when it comes to you know
other other frameworks all right so
let's let's do forms before we get to
the grid system so go down here okay so
we're going to have a form tag and let's
see we're going to have a div with the
class of field just like we did above
and then let's do a label and the label
will have a class of label I'm not going
to use the for attribute and let's just
say name and then under that we'll have
our input with the class of input and
we'll just put a placeholder sorry about
the noise upstairs what's and we'll just
say enter name I don't I keep hitting
this damn caps lock alright so there's a
simple label and input now we can use
colors for the inputs as well and this
is usually something you would use for
like form validation for instance if you
had an error like if something was
required and you didn't didn't add it
you could add to add the is danger class
and so on so if I just copy this div and
we'll just add on to the input here
where it has the class of input we'll
say is let's do is primary actually you
probably use like is success and then
for this one we'll say is danger alright
you'll see that that just colors up the
the borders and then I'm just going to
paste in a simple select field separate
these up a little bit
and I'll paste that in so did with the
classes field label same thing paragraph
with the class of control and then we
have a span with the class of select
around the actual select tag and then
some options so save that and that's
what a default drop-down or select list
is going to look like all right and then
we'll go under that and let's paste in a
text area okay so pretty much identical
to the standard input we're just using a
text area tag alright and it looks like
that now we can also add attached form
elements for instance sometimes you'll
see an input and you'll see the button
like right to the to the right but kind
of attach to it so let me show you how
to do that so so we'll go right down
here and we'll just stay attached and to
put our block class all right and we're
going to have a div here with the class
of field and then we also want a class
of has - add-ons and in here we'll have
our control class on a paragraph okay
and this will be let's put our input and
this is going to have a class of input
and let's just add a placeholder here so
this will be like a search box so we'll
just say Enter key words key work just
and then right under that paragraph with
the class of control we're going to
create another one and let's put a a tag
in here with the class of button and
then also let's do is info oops what the
hell what I do there I need to put
another you could connect it like that
and then in here we'll just say search
all right so let's save that and now if
we look you'll see that we have kind of
the input in the search are attached
together and we can attach some other
things too so for instance let's say we
wanted to have like an amount you put an
amount of money in and you can choose
the currency on this side and then have
the button so let's let's try that so
again you know what I'll do is just copy
just copy this alright and then let's
see this first one this first controlled
actually we'll just put one right above
it okay so in here we're going to have a
span with the class of select because I
want this to be a select and then the
actual select tag itself we don't need
that stuff and put option and actually
no I'm going to just paste this in
because I want the different currencies
okay so the three different currencies
and then let's see for this one let's
change it to enter amount and then we'll
have the button and we'll save pay okay
and now you can see we have a little
select with the currencies so we have
the input and we have the pay button so
pretty easy alright so I think that's
going to do it for forms now before we
get into the grid I just want to look at
tables all right so for the table I'm
going to paste in just a very simple
table with a name email and phone number
all right and I'm sure a lot of you
recognize these names they're from one
of the best shows in history so let's go
ahead and save that and that's what a
default table looks like without any
classes or anything so what I'm going to
do is add a class to books to the table
called table and that changes it up a
little bit add some some padding add
some borders a hover effect and it makes
it look nice and clean so we have a
bunch of table classes we can we can
and instead of just you know going
through them here I'm going to just copy
this table because again I want you guys
to have this as a reference rather than
just showing you so it's pasted in
another one and I'm going to give this
also a class of is striped and save and
that just makes it so that every other
one is darker okay and this is similar
to to the bootstrap striped class our
table striped class okay let's see we
also have is bordered save that and that
just gives them a border you see we have
these these vertical borders as well and
then we have another one called is
narrow so paste that in and we'll add is
narrow and that just makes them skinnier
okay and you can mix and match the
classes as well for instance I could put
on this is striped and now we have both
both styles okay and if you wanted to if
you wanted to select a certain two row
you could do that as well so let's say
we'll go into the let's just go to this
don't go to the first one we did and
let's say we want to highlight Daryl so
we'll go into the TR here and we'll say
class and there's a class called is
selected save that and now you see Daryl
has a green background alright so those
are tables so the last thing we're going
to look at is the the grid system which
is very important in any framework so
let's go down to the bottom here
all right so let's start off by making
columns that are all that we want all to
be the same width okay and remember this
uses Balma uses flexbox behind the
scenes so what we'll do here is create a
div with the class of columns which is
kind of like a row class in bootstrap
and many other frameworks and then we'll
have a div with the class of just column
and then we can put whatever we want
here I'm going to put a paragraph with a
class of notification and we'll just say
first column okay so if we save that and
we take a look you'll see we have a
single column and that's fine if we
wanted to do just one column that's okay
but let's go ahead and copy this paste
it in again and this will be the second
column and you'll see it splits in half
and this is very easy and there's a very
minimal markup based in another one this
will be third column save that breaks up
into three do another one and this will
be fourth column and we don't even have
to have any kind of special classes or
anything and where this really comes in
handy is if you're working with you know
a programming language like I don't know
PHP or or any programming language
really where you want to loop through
something coming from a database like
blog posts and you want to put them into
a column but you don't have the set
number of posts that are coming in so
you can't really add you know specific
classes for each one and this is very
very I guess scalable so that you know
each piece doesn't matter how many posts
you have it's still going to be
formatted correctly all right you're not
going to have you know weird floated
columns and stuff like that like you
would with you know with bootstrap 3 or
some kind of column grid system that
doesn't use flexbox
now you if you want different sizes
using a 12 column grid that's really
simple as well so what I'll do here is
let's let's just copy this block
and let's see so what I'll do is let's
see I'm going to I want three of these
because I'm going to have two eight two
okay so this first column here is going
to be too wide so I'm going to say is
two second one here will be eight so
let's do is - eight and then we'll do is
- two again all right so this will be
two column a column and two column save
it and it's as easy as that okay if we
wanted to do like a main area and a
sidebar we could do just eight and four
or whatever combination you want it's
really easy now another thing we can do
is we can use class names like is 3/4 or
is 2/3 things like that so let me give
you an example of that I'm just going to
copy this block again all right and
let's see I'm going to do let's take
this first column and let's say is 3/4
and we'll just put in here is 3/4 and
then for these ones we're just going to
leave but I'm going to take off this
last one all right and these are going
to be autosize so I'll just say Auto all
right we'll save that and there we go so
this one is 3/4 and these ones are going
to be Auto we could also do is 2/3 so if
we copy this and let's change this to is
2/3
save that and we get this this lang pair
we could also do is half
okay save that and to say this takes up
half and then the rest are auto sized
and there's there's other ones as well
other class names that you can check out
if you look at the documentation alright
so I think that's going to do it guys
you can see there's a lot of stuff here
that you can use as a reference if you
want to build a website or UI I do plan
on building an actual template using
bulma as well as materialized CSS I just
wanted to get the crash courses out
there first I like to do those first
just to say you have a basic reference
and then later on well you know we'll
make a video actually using the
frameworks alright so thanks for
watching guys I appreciate it if you
watch this whole thing please subscribe
please leave a like and another thing
guys they do I don't like to mention it
too often but I do have a patreon
account where you know you guys can
directly support me and you know even a
dollar a month if I if we get that from

you know completely full-time I've been
doing it quite a bit lately but you know
my goal is to do it full-time
and be able to you know have a
sustainable income that way you know and
keep this stuff free I'm a big supporter
of free education in general so you know
I like to put this stuff out for free in
addition to you know the the couple
courses that I do per year alright
