take a look at es6 arrow functions now
there's two main benefits to using arrow
functions the first is that it's a
shorter syntax it'll save you a few
keystrokes but the more important
benefit is that it they allow you to
bind this lexically so in the past we've
had to do things like rename this to
that or self or something like that
if you've been programming JavaScript
for a long time
chances are you've done this at least a
couple times so if that doesn't make
sense to you let me just give you an
example alright so I'm going to create a
function called prefix er and that's
going to take in a prefix and then what
we'll do is say this dot prefix is equal
to prefix all right and down here we'll
create a prototype will say prefix or
dot prototype dot prefix array and we'll
set that equal to a function and that's
going to take in an array and then what
we'll do is return array dot map and
inside there we'll have a function and
we'll pass in a parameter X and then we
just want to console dot log this dot
prefix and we want to add on X okay
whatever is passed in alright so let's
go ahead and instantiate this we'll say
let pre equals new prefix err and the
prefix we want to use will just say
hello space alright and then down here
we'll say pre dot prefix array
and let's pass in an array with a couple
names okay we'll say Brad and I'll say
Jeff so let's go ahead and save that
reload now you see we're getting an
error that says it cannot read property
prefix of undefined and it's talking
about this line right here so it's
saying this is undefined even though we
have it up here it's still undefined so
we'll work around for this would be to
set this to a new variable so right here
we'll say let that some people use self
and then just set it to this and then go
down here and replace this with that
okay we'll go ahead and run that and now
we get hello Brad hello Jeff so it's
prefixing each array element with
whatever we put here now arrow functions
save us from having to do this so we can
actually get rid of this now and get rid
of the function text keep it like that
and then just use the arrow like that
alright so let's go ahead and look
actually before we do that we have to
rename this back to this alright so you
can see that that's shorter and it also
allows us to use a lexical this reload
and we get the same thing all right so
pretty easy to give you a really easy
example of the syntax we're going to
create a variable called add and set
that to a function okay that function
will take in two values we'll say a B
and then we'll say let sum equals a plus
B and then we'll do console.log sum and
just return false okay so down here
we'll just say add to two okay so
obviously that gives us four now if we
wanted to change this into an air
function let me just comment this out
okay and then I'm just going to copy it
and what we would do is first we're
going to remove the word function and
then we're going to just add right here
the arrow symbol okay save it reload and
we're still getting four foot ten here
we get twelve all right so it saves you
a couple keystrokes but the more
important thing is it uses a lexical
this so we don't need to have we don't
need to rename this to that or whatever
so pretty helpful hopefully you'll see a
need for it in future projects and
that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
