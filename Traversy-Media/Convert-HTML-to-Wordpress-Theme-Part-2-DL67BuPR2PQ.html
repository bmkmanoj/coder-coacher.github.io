HTML template to a wordpress theme where
we left off was we're adding our dynamic
functionality to the index.php file so
so far our title the image and the text
are all dynamic and coming from
WordPress however that this meta info
right here is still static so we're
going to go ahead and change that so if
we go to index dot PHP you can see right
here this paragraph we've posted by and
then we just have the text someone so we
want to get the author's name in it and
that's pretty easy we just want to
replace someone with PHP the author
posts link so what that'll do is it'll
show the the author's name with a little
I also have a link to his page okay so
the date on July 18th we want to change
that
so we'll take that sleep PHP the time
and we want to format that how that
looks so I'm going to say F J s why
I think that's
right
okay so let's just check the out their
name in a date
all right so you can see a change to
Brad and the correct date if I click on
Brad well it's not going to show us
anything because we don't have our page
PHP done so let's see we want to add
this comments thing here so we'll
replace this PHP um
actually we're going to have we're going
to this is going to be a link let me
just
okay so we want this link to go to the
comments what's of a post so and here
we're going to say PHP comments linked
okay and then for the actual text let's
replace this
now what we do here is you can say PHP
comments number and this is going to
take a few parameters let me just put
this on its own line
let's see
okay so the first parameter will be what
we want it to say if there's no comments
so let's just say zero comments and the
next is what we want to say if there's
only one comment
so we'll say one comment and then the
final parameter we want to say responses
let's see if that works
alright so looks like there is one
comment so that's all set now this full
article
I guess that's going to be the read more
link so let's go
okay where it says full article we have
a link going to it so we're going to put
in here
PHP the permalink okay uh and I also
want to link the we'll put that in the
image link so right here in this put the
same thing and also the title I want to
put it in the title as well so replace
that
alright so this looks fully dynamic I
think I got rid of all the static stuff
so let's save that
all right so if I hover over this you
can see in the bottom it's going to pay
post one right down here okay the title
same thing what we don't have single PHP
setup so it's not going to do nothing
yet but that looks like that looks
complete for as far as the main content
area let's make sure that if we put a
read more block it will cut the text off
where we want so after the first
paragraph I'm going to click this read
more icon update and reload okay so it's
only showing us that's good
all right so that that's complete let's
see so I guess next we'll do the single
dot PHP which is going to be basically
the same thing so I'm actually going to
copy everything put it in single dot PHP
and after the n while I want to add some
the comment area so we'll say PHP
comments template
save now if I click on the hello world
post we now have our single post totally
dynamic we got our comment box and we
have our one comment and you could
further style this maybe put on a nice
background or something but we're not
going to get into that all right so
that's single what else do we have our
page ok so now let's do our page dot PHP
file and this is basically going to be
very similar ah we don't want we don't
want to link in the title
because it's going to be just a page we
don't want this metadata so I'm going to
get rid of all this
right that
yeah
so we just want the title the post
I think that's it
so let's see what that does
all right cool
so it's just a standard page
all right now what I want to do is add
some or add a menu like we need a home
link would just stuck on sample page now
by default there is no home link on the
menus so if we go to up wait a minute
actually we don't have menu
functionality we need to add some things
to our functions.php file we don't have
access to widgets or menus so let's go
to functions PHP and
let's just comment this will say that's
thumbnail
so basically you can copy this and
inside of here we just want to put menus
save that if I reload this
we now have menus available
all right so we don't have a menu yet by
default it's just going to take any page
we create and put it on the menu but
let's create one call it main menu all
right so let's see you can choose to
automatically add new top-level pages to
this menu but let's do it manually so
we'll add the sample page we have and
then we need a home a home link so under
links I'm just going to put I'm just
going to put the actual link to the home
page
alright save that you should now have a
home-like
all right
so let's go ahead and add another post
and we'll put a read more
link right there
let's actually add a category
okay
and let's add that other one to that
category as well
what
okay so let's reload the homepage oh we
didn't put our image in wait a minute
all right something's not right
Oh our decade up there
actually I want it right here
okay and now we just want to upload that
the other image
all right
update
and reload and now we have our post our
other post all right so that's that's
done the next thing I want to do is
create the sidebar we want a sidebar
widget and what we want to do is
register our widget in the functions dot
PHP file and I'm actually going to paste
in some content here just because it's
going to take too long to type but it's
really easy to understand so we use the
function called register side by which
we pass in an array in the array we have
the name of the of the sidebar which is
just called right-hand sidebar the ID
the description before title and after
title so what we're saying is every
widget in the right sidebar will have an
h3 tag with the class of sidebar title
and we have before widget and after
widget which is is added before the
entire widget and after it okay so we'll
give it a class of widget and then we
have a dynamic ID and a dynamic class so
we can single them out if we need to all
right so I'll save that
and now we want to go into sidebar PHP
and let's see alright we're going to
need to go to back to the static
template and take a look at that
so his the sidebar
let's grab this
actually we don't need this all we need
is the div because these are going to be
dynamic widgets ok so inside here will
say PHP dynamic sidebar and we want the
name of the book
we want to say right sidebar
all right so that should do it
okay let's see if we have any widgets
or we didn't save functions
what did we
all right so now we have a widgets menu
link menu link and we have our
right-hand sidebar available over here
so let's put some things over here you
can put categories
you really put whatever you want um
let's see we'll put a search bar
recent posts
okay let's check that out
alright so there's our sidebar
actually you know what this isn't styled
correctly we might need to change some
things around let's say I want to go
into the sidebar and want to go into
this sidebar and see what's
okay so there's h2s here so let's go
back into functions dot php' get rid of
the this h3 here and we'll call h2s
instead that should style the titles
all right here we go
and I mean you could create a custom
widget and copy this exactly but we
really don't need to do that and we have
the functionality oh it's good and add a
page at a new page
and we'll want to add that to the menu
as well
so about us add to menu
all right
so we're pretty much done we added all
the dynamic functionality this more you
could do you could add in some
conditionals so that if the sidebar if
there's no active widgets you'd make the
content stretch all the way over you can
do stuff like that create more pages
maybe portfolio galleries things like
that but I don't want to get too
advanced this is really for the beginner
to mid-level developer so I hope you
learned a lot and please subscribe if
you can thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
