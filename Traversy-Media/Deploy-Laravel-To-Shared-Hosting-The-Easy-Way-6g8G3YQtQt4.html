going to show you how to deploy a
laravel application to a shared web
hosting account the absolute easiest way
possible all right now I'm not going to
say that this is the fastest or the best
way but it is definitely the easiest
because we're just going to use FTP
we're not going to use the shell or
anything like that I will probably make
a video separately on using those
methods because we can use the shell in
in many with many shared hosting
accounts now it's important to mention
with shared hosting you basically have
everything set up for you have a cPanel
account where you can you know create
emails and databases and all that you
already have PHP installed Apache MySQL
all that stuff now the hosting company
that I'm using is in motion hosting
which I've used for years I would
definitely recommend them to just about
anybody there's an affiliate link in the
description if you guys do decide to
purchase a package please use that link
you can see they offer I do have a VPS
account they offer dedicated servers but
we're going to be dealing with the
cheapest the business hosting here which
is the cheapest shared hosting account
so like $5.99 per month all right now I
already have an account set up and this
is my cPanel for that account you can
see it's using the domain code skelet
com
so if I go to code skillet com you'll
see that it's just an empty directory
okay but this is where we want our
laravel application to live all right
now the application we're going to be
deploying is the one we built in the
laravel from scratch series on YouTube
if you haven't watched that series I
highly suggest going back and watching
that I think it's 12 videos so we
basically just have a website here with
some pages but we also have a blogging
platform now I've deleted all of the
posts and all of the users from the
database we just have the table set up
but there's full crud functionality for
posters authentication system we can
register we can log in I'm not going to
go through it here because I already
know that it works everything works on
my local machine we'll go ahead and test
it when we upload
to our hosts alright now we're going to
need to create a database on code skill
of comm so this is the cPanel and they
make it very very easy if we go under
databases you'll see MySQL database
wizard so let's click that and by the
way if you're not using in motion and
you're using something like Hostgator
the cPanel interface is pretty much
identical to this all right now it's
going to prefix our database name with
your account name in my case it's going
to be code skill underscore and then I'm
going to call this database LS app
alright and then I'm going to give the
user the same name ok so we're going to
create a user give them a password it
has to be a certain strength or if it
won't let you and then let's say create
user we're going to select all
privileges for this user and now if we
go back to my SQL databases you'll see
we have the database created as well as
the user and they're connected so that's
all set now we're going to have to bring
in our tables from our local machines so
if you've been following along then you
should have PHP myadmin setup and you
can see in our database which is called
LS app we have our tables there's
nothing in the users and posts I cleared
everything out but we do need to export
the whole data structure so what we'll
do is make sure you're looking at the
correct database and then click export
and then go and we're going to download
a file called whatever your database is
called SQL alright and if you look in
the github repository for this
application you'll see that I have a
folder called underscore SQL and that
has this file in it ok if you guys
haven't been following along with the
whole thing so now that we have that
let's go back to our cPanel and we're
going to click on PHP myadmin here which
will take us to the remote version of
our PHP myadmin and we already created
the database it's right here code skill
LS app click on that and then we're
going to import and then click Choose
file and we're going to grab C where did
I put it
I put on my desktop I think I did yeah
Ella's a SQL so I'm going to grab that
and then click go and that's going to
import the database and it shouldn't
take long because it's very small all
right so that's successful so if we look
in our date remote database now you can
see we have all of our tables alright so
that's all set now what we need to do is
bring the files on to our remote servers
so for that I'm going to open up
FileZilla which is an FTP client just
sorry if you don't have it just search
for FileZilla client download alright
and then we can connect to it using the
cPanel details so the host is going to
be code skillet comm username is code
skillet and then my password click OK
and then that's going to bring us into
our account now if if for some reason
your cPanel login doesn't work here you
can actually create more FTP accounts if
you go to right here FTP accounts and
you can create them here and you'll be
able to use those in FileZilla alright
so no matter how you're doing this
whether you're using FTP or your your
cloning to get repository through the
three years shell through your terminal
you need to basically put your whole
application let me just open up the
local version of the app which is in my
htdocs LS app so we want to put
everything here in to not not into the
public HTML but into a separate folder
that we're going to create so I'm going
to call it LS app all right now you want
everything here in there but the public
folder right here all these these need
to go into public HTML ok so what we'll
do is first go into LS app and we're
going to bring everything here and we
don't need the public folder in LS app
so except for that we'll bring
everything over all right now that's
going to take quite a while it could
take you know ten to fifteen minutes
depending on your connection and that's
one thing that really
talks about FTP it's slow it's also not
encrypted but again it is it is the
easiest for beginners and that's what
this tutorial is focused on alright so
what I'm going to do is just pause this
and wait for everything to upload and
then I'll be back alright guys so
everything is uploaded to LS app now we
need the public so we're going to go
into public HTML and we're going to go
over here and grab everything that's in
our public folder and bring that over
here and I will be back when that's done
alright guys so that's all set now we
have all of our public folders now what
I'm going to do is go back to the
browser here and go back to code skillet
comm and reload and you're going to see
these errors here so this is happening
because we need to tell it to look
inside of that LS app folder that we
uploaded so we need to actually edit one
of these files so in the public HTML
folder there is an index.php file so we
need to edit that let me just delete
these real quick so I'm going to bring
the index.php file outside onto my local
machine and we're going to just open
that up I'll just use sublime text and
we need to just change these two lines
okay this one and this one and we want
to go right before boot the bootstrap
and say LS Apps slash same thing right
here and let's app slash so it knows to
look in there and then we'll save it and
let's go ahead and reload it all right
now if we go and we check out code
skillet comm and reload you'll see that
now it works all right now the about
page is going to work services is going
to work blog however is not because it's
actually looking for the database tables
but the credentials for the database are
not correct they're still set to the
local stuff so what we need to do is go
back into our FTP and go to our LS app
folder and then dot ENB I'm going to
bring that out and then we're going to
go ahead and edit that and we need to
add the correct credentials so you can
see I just have a
marked is xxx but we're going to change
this to code skill underscore LS dot
because that's what we call the database
we also called the user that same thing
and then the password put that in here
as well and then we'll save it and then
let's reload it all right so now we'll
go back and reload and now the post page
works and we should be able to register
we should be able to upload posts the
only thing that's left is the image
symlink
because right now if we try to upload an
image it's going to go to the storage
folder but if you remember we actually
created the sim link to the public
storage folder and we need to recreate
that on our host now we could do it
through the shell but since this is for
you know absolute beginners what I'm
going to do is create a new PHP file and
we're going to do it through there so
let's create a file called we'll just
call it sim link create dot PHP alright
and then we're going to open that up
whoops I want to open that with sublime
okay and then we just need to put a line
of code in here which is really simple
so we just need our PHP tag and we're
going to call the sim link function and
we want to put in first the directory we
want to create the sim link from which
is going to be home slash and then
whatever you are cPanel account name
lines code skillet and then LS app
storage slash app slash public okay and
that's where the images get uploaded now
we want to create a sim link to our
public HTML storage folder so that's
going to be home code skillett slash
public underscore HTML slash storage
alright and that's it so let's save it
we're going to upload it now to our
public HTML folder so we can run it in
the browser
here alright and then we'll go to our
browser and let's go to code skillet
comm slash create symlink I think that's
what I called it dot PHP no it's not
what I called it simply create okay so
that ran now if we look in our FTP and
we reload the public HTML folder you'll
see we have a storage symlink so
everything should be all set let's just
make sure we delete to the sim link
create file alright and now let's go
back to code skillet comm and we should
be deployed so let's go ahead and
register a user register okay so now
we're logged in let's go ahead and
create a post so we'll say test post one
this is a test and let's upload an image
so I'll just grab my C I'll grab my
desktop background image click Submit
and there we go
post created you can see the image went
through since we're logged in and this
is our post we have the edit and delete
buttons we can also go to the dashboard
and we can edit let's just test it out
we'll change it to the number one and
submit and you can see that changed and
that should be good alright so we now
have a deployed laravel application and
we didn't even have to touch the
terminal or the ssh alright and if you
guys want me to do another video showing
you a better faster way to do it but
more complicated I can do that as well
up to set up our SSH keys and so on now
the last thing I want to mention to you
guys is I just wrapped up a ten project
laravel course so there's projects that
range in different technologies for
instance in one project we use view j s
on the front end in another we use
postgrads for our database so there's
there's mixed in technologies that
really give you a good
overview of building laravel projects
all right now there's an affiliate link
in the description I would HIGHLY
appreciate if you could use that link
and also use the code traversée if you
want to get 50% off it's only 49 bucks
50% off you're only going to pay around
$25 for a 10 project course so I would
definitely suggest that guys and I would
appreciate it and that's it thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
