stack application for you today so I
have a video on my channel called
something like build a mean app from
scratch and that you may have seen in
it's a long set up from absolutely
nothing so we set up express we built
out a REST API using MongoDB we built
the front-end with angular 2 and we
connected to the API well in this video
we're going to get quite a bit of help
from a little tool called min Jas somene
Jas is something that we can use to
generate a mean stack application from
thin air it gives us client-side and
server-side code alright so one thing
about me and Jas is that it does use
angularjs not angular 2 I'm not sure if
that's something that they plan on
changing but some people do actually
prefer angularjs over angular 2 what I
really like about me and Jas is that it
gives you so much with so little effort
so it's great for prototyping and just
getting something up really quick not
only does it give you boilerplate crud
application but it also gives you full
user authentication using Passport
alright so you can register login edit
your profile and so on I'm actually
using this in an Express course by edge
wanax and I thought it was worth sharing
with you guys alright so we're going to
create a basic blog type application
using mean j/s and it'll also include
user authentication alright so you will
need nodejs installed as well as Luongo
DB if you don't have those installed go
ahead and do that now I do have a crash
course on MongoDB and I do show you
exactly how to install it in Windows
it's pretty easy to install and on Linux
and Mac as well all right I'm also using
a command line tool called git bash for
Windows which gives us a kind of closer
to a Linux environment so you may want
to get that as well but it's not needed
all right so let me close those up now
mean Jayesh zorg is the the website for
this tool and you can download the files
if you want but there's a better way to
do it and that's using the yo generator
alright so this uses the Yeomans
scaffolding tool and you can actually
install a mean j/s generator
either that will generate an application
and you can also use it to generate your
modules and so on alright so before we
get started there's a few things we need
to install with NPM and you need to
install these globally so make sure you
add the dash G all right so we're going
to need Yelp which is the yeoman
generator tool we're going to need the
mean J s generator so that's generating
our mean J s we're also going to need
Bower which is a front-end client
package manager and we also need grunt
which is a task manager or a task runner
and that's what mean J s uses to
actually run the app and do some other
tasks as well all right so we want to
get these things installed alright so
once that's all set I'm going to create
a project to our project folder so I'm
going to say make there and let's call
this mean blog all right and then we'll
CD into that folder and we have to run
this right here yo mean J s ok this will
generate an application
okay so it's going to ask us about
versions I'm just going to use whatever
the default is which is zero four zero
all right so it's asking us what folder
we want to create the project in I
actually want it in this folder so I'm
going to put in a dot okay just a period
and then enter okay so what would you
like to call the application we'll call
it main blog and we're just going to
click enter here full stack application
enter a company name or author name I'll
just put my name
okay put whatever you want would you
like the article example crud module so
this will give us a good example of some
crud functionality so we're going to say
yes to that okay so would you like to
generate the chat example module and I
say no to that just just the articles
fine all right so now it's going to take
a couple minutes to generate your
application alright guys so that is done
took about two or three minutes alright
so what we want to do now to run the
application we get a run grunt okay so
let's go ahead and do that now there are
some issues with means is that are known
in the community that I will go over one
of them is that sometimes angular isn't
included correctly and we may get a
blank page when we open our servers so
let's see that's running so let's go to
localhost 3000 and notice that we have a
completely blank page if we open up the
console we're seeing this angular is not
defined all right so to fix that we just
need to run Bower install so we're going
to just cut ctrl C to get out of this
and we're going to say bower install and
we're going to add this - - oh wow -
root alright now we'll get angular setup
correctly ok so now let's go ahead and
run grunt again
and scho and reload and now we have our
boilerplate application so this is the
the landing page that they give it you
can see that it uses bootstrap by
default now notice that we have the
signup and sign-in links up here so
right from this point we have complete
login functionality registration login
now one thing I want to do before we
create an account is I want to change
the database name alright because by
default it's mean death or something
like that so I'm going to open up the
project and Adam of course you can use
whatever you'd like for your editor and
we want to go to config environment and
we're in our development j/s environment
and then right here is our MongoDB
address and I'm just going to change
mean dev to mean blog okay we'll save
that and then that should auto reload
every time you make a change this will
auto load now you can see we can sign in
with social accounts but these are not
going to work right away
alright the reason for that is in order
for them to work you need to get your
client ID you need to register with
their API and so on and then you want to
go to config default J and on our
default development ya development J s
or production if you're in production
and you just want to enter your client
ID and all that stuff okay but I'm not
going to do that I'm actually going to
show you how to get rid of these ok but
if you want you can do that I do think
that's a really nice feature but I don't
think that they should put these here by
default alright so let's go ahead and
create an account ok so I'm just going
to put a fake email in and username and
password and sign up ok now you can see
it redirects us to the home page and you
can see up here we're logged in alright
now if we click this we can go ahead and
edit the profile which is really nice
this stuff is all set up by default we
can have a profile picture change our
password
and manage our social accounts but that
again that's not going to work because
we don't have our client IDs and all
that
all right so pretty good functionality
right off the bat now you see in two
articles we have list articles which is
basically just a list of the articles we
have there are none right now but we can
go we can say create article and you can
create they give you a title field and
content by default all right now we're
not going to actually use this because I
want to show you how to how to build
your own module from scratch so we're
going to create a post module alright
now before we do that I just want to fix
some things up so let's change this this
logo here this branding so for that
we're going to go into modules and every
time you create a module using a
generator it'll show up here and you'll
get a client and server folder okay so
you have the front end which is all
angular angularjs and then the server
which is expressed in MongoDB alright
notice that if we go in models we look
at the model it actually uses Mongoose
okay for its ORM and this is just a
standard Mongoose model all right so to
change like the homepage things like
that there's this core module alright so
if we go to Cork Lion fuse and then
header dot client view this is where the
nav bar is so we can go ahead and change
this to say mean blog all right now you
if you want menu items and all that you
don't edit this file you actually have a
config file for each module where you
can add menu items from there
okay so let's save that and you can see
that that's now changed
alright let's also go ahead and change
the home page content that's going to be
in this home client view alright so
let's see I'm going to get rid of the
image here this mean j/s image and
replace it with an h1 and let's just say
mean blog
and it's a full-featured blogging system
I don't know just you can put whatever
you like all right and then down here
all this stuff I'm actually going to get
rid of so this div get rid of that this
one this well and then these two lines
all right so let's save that dude it
looks like okay very very simple
now this learn more is this link here
let's go ahead and change that and I
want this to go to just slash posts and
let's say show posts and then we're
going to create another one I'm going to
copy that paste this in and this is
going to be the create post create a
post okay that's going to go to post
slash create now these aren't going to
work right now we still have to generate
the post module but I just want to get
it all set
all right let's change this to button
success okay so like I said that's not
going to work we're going to get a not
found error all right so that's our
homepage very simple let's see now we're
going to do is generate our post module
all right so we're going to go back to
our command line or terminal and ctrl C
to stop and if we go to our
documentation here
this is how we generate a module okay so
we're going to say yellow mean J s : and
we want a crud module and let's say
posts okay so it's asking us the name of
the module I'm not sure why it does that
because I just said I want to be post
but we'll type it in again now for this
so I'm just going to enter I don't
create any of these by default would you
like to add the crud module links to a
menu okay so do we want to add a menu
for this we'll say yes and it's asking
us which menu we want the top bar is the
default top map so we're going to just
click enter and now it's setup so now
you'll see that in modules we have this
post folder which has our client and
server and tests all right so if we go
back to our application it should add
that up we need to restart it or start
it up with grunt
okay so notice that we're getting a
blank page again this is another fall
back with mean J s I don't know why they
haven't fixed it but what we need to do
if we look in the console it says
unknown provider the hell it says
unknown provider menu service provider
so the way that we fix this is we need
to go into our job jobs posts and we
want to go into client config and right
here post client config and then what we
want to do is change this menu service
to menus okay so if we save that and
reload now it works now there's going to
be another issue if we try to go to post
list posts or create posts we get on our
hair now the reason for that is we need
to remove this client right here it
should actually just be post slash views
so the way that we fix that is by going
into post right here post client routes
in the config and just removing right
here client okay there so all of these
we just want to remove client slash it's
such a simple fix I don't know why they
haven't fix this but let's save that and
we'll reload and now if we go to list
post sign create posts fine all right
now by default they're just going to
give us a name field okay and obviously
we want more than that okay so we're
going to fix we're going to add some
fields but before that I just want to
get rid of the articles menu here
because you're not going to use that
anymore so let's go to modules articles
client config and right here articles
client config and this is where we can
add and remove menu items so in this
function right here I'm just going to
clear it out that save okay so now we
just have our posts all right see what
else
now what's nice is that if we log oh you
can see that we can't access I mean we
can go to post to list a post but if we
try to create one we can't we have to
actually register and login all right
now I do want the list post link visible
even if the user isn't logged in so I'm
going to change up the menu a little bit
so let's sign back in and I just want a
list post and a create post link here
alright so what we're going to do is go
to modules posts config and we want this
post client config all right so I'm
going to just comment this stuff out all
right and we're going to add a menu item
I'm actually going to copy this right
here
and we'll paste that in so we want to
add a menu item to the top bar title is
going to be latest toast okay
the state is going to be post dot list
we're not going to need a type of drop
down and then rolls we want everybody to
access it so we're going to keep the
asterisk all right now I'm going to copy
this and we're going to put in another
one and this is going to be create post
okay so this is going to be that the
state is going to be post on create and
then rolls we're going to put in user
because we want it to be logged in users
only all right so let's save that okay
so now we have latest posts and create
post all right so now we want to do is
we want to add X we want to add more
fields than just names so let's go to
our posts and now we're going to have to
go to the server side and go to models
and then our posts server model okay so
this is just a standard Mongoose model
if you've ever worked with Mongoose
before and what we're going to do is
just let's copy this name right here and
paste this in and let's change this to
body say please fill post body and I'm
actually going to change name to title
all right and you can see it has the
type has a default and required along
with the message and then trim which
will trim the field all right so I also
want this to have a tag field so we can
add tags so it's actually copy this and
say tags and I'm not going to make this
required so I'm going to get rid of this
all right and then let's also have a
category field
okay so we'll paste that in say category
all right so that's good for now now you
see it also has the date field it also
has the user associated with the post so
let's save that now it's not going to
update the form we have to do that too
so let's go to it's going to be in our
client so post client and views and then
forum post client view so this is our
form and notice it just has the name
field right here so I'm going to change
this to title and we're going to change
a bunch of stuff before we're going to
change the name of the input to title
and the ng model okay so that has to do
with angular ng model basically
associates a modules scope property with
this form field all right so it's going
to be VM post dot title I'm going to
change the ID and the placeholder okay
now right here just we can put in a
message it just says post name is
required I'm going to delete this all
together okay so now that should be a
title let's save it okay now let's add
our other fields so we also have the
body so I'm going to just copy this this
whole form group
paste that in let's change this to body
now this is going to be a text area so
we'll change input to text area and it
will have to have a closing tag as well
all right and then we're going to change
the name to body change the ng model ID
see the four and placeholder alright so
that that's our body let's go ahead and
save it okay that's good
next we have the tags so I'm going to
copy this form group and go right here
and paste any tags or add tags change
this placeholder okay now we need the
category now the category is going to be
a select list so I'm actually going to
just paste that in okay so if same thing
with just a label it was selected the
name of category ing model is the impost
category and then we just have an empty
select we have business education other
in technology and you can add other ones
if you'd like but let's go ahead and
save that
alright so there's our category
drop-down so we should be able to submit
a post and what's cool is that we don't
even have to add anything to the back
end to the now if we go to modules post
server and go to our controller its
submitting to this create function here
and you can see it's just creating a new
post with the entire body of the form so
we don't have to add each specific field
in the backend and that's something we
did have to do in previous versions of
me and Jas alright
and of course you can change it to do
whatever you like alright so let's go
ahead and give it a shot so
a sample post 1 and for the body I'm
just going to grab some sample content
here from Lipson comm I just generated a
couple power grafts base that in tags
will say tag 1 tag - tag 3 and it's a
business create ok so it created but it
took us to the to the to the details
page but we haven't added our title and
all that in the view so it's only seeing
what was there by default which is the
the date and the user alright now if we
click on our edit button here
you can see that all that stuff was
saved which is good and we can update it
if we want we can also delete it if we
go to latest post you'll see that it is
listed but it's just a date in the user
so let's go ahead and fix that in the
view I'm just going to close all these
out alright so let's start with the list
view here so that's going to be under
post client views and then this list
post file right here so we're just going
to change let's see right here it's
basically binding post name which we
don't have anymore at the title so we'll
say post dot title alright save that and
I can see we get sample post 1 ok so if
we click on that takes us to the details
page that is going to be right here view
post dot client view and we're going to
change right here post dot name to post
dot title save that and now we get the
title so under that we want to put the
body so we'll bind will say div ng bind
okay we want to bind VM dot
post dot body save that and there's our
body alright if we want to put the
category let's see we'll put that let's
put an h1 with the title and category
now what I'm going to do is change this
to a span and we're going to wrap that
in h1 like that okay and then right next
to it let's put in a small tag and we'll
put a span in here and let's do ng bind
actually I want to show you we don't we
don't have to use ng bind we can
actually use interpolation like this and
we can say V MDOT post dot category save
it whoops what happened there oh I
didn't end the h1 okay so now we have
our title let's put a space after it and
now we have our title and our category
actually let's say hosted and okay and
then we'll put our tags at the bottom so
let's go under the body and we put a
line break and then a paragraph and
let's put in V m dot post dot tags
take tags you can do whatever you want
here as far as how it looks all right so
let's see ladies posts I also want to
put a little bit of the body in here so
let's go back to the list posts and
we'll go under the title and put a
paragraph and then now on the list page
we actually don't need that VM we can
just say post post body okay now I want
to cut this down a little bit so what we
can do is we can actually add a what is
it called a filter okay so we're going
to put a pipe character and then we're
going to stay limit two and then the
number of words so let's say 200 save
and now you can see the post is limited
all right I'm just going to put a line
break under the date here which is
posted by so right here
so let's put an HR alright so that's
that let's create another one actually
know what let's slog it let's sign out
and we'll sign up as a different user Oh
before we do that let's get rid of this
alright so if we go to modules users
that's where the authentication the log
and all that stuff is and then client
views and we want to go to
authentication and then this
authentication client view and we're
going to get rid of this h3 and then
everything in this div okay save that
that gets rid of those icons now you
probably want to change this title as
well so if we go to sign up client view
and change this heading we'll just say
sign up and then we'll go to sign in
client view change this heading to sign
in all right so let's sign up as a
different user okay John Doe
shine up okay so now we're John Doe and
notice we can see our other post but we
can't edit it because it's a different
user so let's create a post so so sample
post - this is another X I'll just grab
that tags category create okay so that's
my second post and if we look we can see
both posts once by John Doe once by Brad
and the John Doe one we can edit okay so
if we update that you can see so now we
have a full crud function at with full
credit e for posts we have complete user
authentication we can link social
accounts register with social accounts
we can easily generate other crud
modules with a simple command so it
secretes a pretty nice tool I think so
something you guys may want to check out
and look more into I know obviously I
didn't go through every single file and
all the syntax but you know I just
wanted to make a quick video kind of
introducing you guys to it if you
haven't used it before this actually the
idea of this comes from my express
course which I'm currently redoing and
that the new course will be available
soon I'll put a link in the description
alright so if you guys like this please
subscribe please leave it a like leave a
comment whatever you can do is find and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
