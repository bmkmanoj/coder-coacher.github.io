make a video showing how I create the
thumbnails for my youtube channel and I
don't have any tutorials on photoshop
yet so I figured that this would be kind
of a good introduction so in this quick
video I'm going to show you how we can
create a very simple but decent looking
thumbnail so let's go ahead and get
started this video is sponsored by dev
Mountain if you're interested in
learning web development iOS or UX
design dev Mountain is a 12-week design
and development bootcamp intended to get
you a full-time job in the industry to
learn more visit dev mountain comm or
click the link in the description below
alright guys so we're going to get
started and I just want to stress that
I'm not focusing on the design and how
attractive this thumbnail is it's not
really anything special from a design
perspective but I just want to show you
the process of creating it and then you
guys can create your own stuff with what
I show you all right so we're going to
be creating the thumbnail that I use for
the JavaScript mocha testing video which
is very simple and I thought would be a
good one for to use for this video so
what we're going to do first is go to
file new and we're going to set the
width to 1280 the height to 720 and the
resolution to 72 pixels per inch okay
make sure pixels is chosen not inches or
anything else
okay we'll click OK and that's going to
give us basically a blank canvas to work
with
now if we look over here in the layers
you'll see there's a background layer
okay now you can't edit this directly
you can see this little lock icon but if
we double click on it and then we can
call it whatever we want
whilst a background and now we if we
double click again we'll get the
different options color overlay and all
that stuff okay but we're just going to
leave that as white all right now what I
want to do is bring in a couple images
let me just see right here so one of
them is just kind of a gray background
wallpaper type image and then we also
have the chai and mocha logos okay now
I'm just going to drag the background in
and by default it's not covering the
entire thing so I'm going to hold shift
and just drag it so it covers the
our canvas and we can move it around you
know wherever you want it but that looks
fine you can see it's over here in the
layers now I want to bring in the other
image two logos and I'm going to make
that these a little smaller all right
that's good we'll put that right in the
center there and then for the title I
want to have kind of a just a bar solid
color background now to choose the color
I'm going to go to the eye drop tool
right here and I want this red so I'm
going to just click in here and you can
see the color whatever I click the color
will show up in this box okay you can
see it just keeps changing but we wanted
that color the red reddish brown maroon
whatever that color is and then I'm
going to click on the square tool here
and I'm just going to go just at the top
here and it's okay if you go outside of
the box okay once we do that you just
want to do a right click and then
rasterize layer' and now you can see
it's over here in our layers it's
labeled rectangle one so this is where I
want the text to go so I'm going to
click the text tool type tool whatever
it is and let's just say intro intro to
JavaScript unit testing all right now I
don't want that color so I'm going to
just double click that and let's go up
here this is where you can choose the
text color I'm going to choose white and
you can also change the font I'm using
century gothic that's pretty much what I
use in all my thumbnails and then for
the size let's go to 72 if you want it
bigger than that you can just type type
in there but that looks fine okay just
make sure you place it where you want
now if you hold down control and you
click on something you can see over here
it's going to choose that layer I want
to make this background a little bit
transparent so let's highlight that and
go over here to opacity and we'll just
make it just a little transparent that's
fine so 92% all right and then I just
want so it's not really
that text all right that looks good now
down here I just want another bar where
I can put Travis E Mediacom so the color
for that I'm going to choose like almost
black really dark bright and then we'll
go to the square tool here and just go
like that rasterize I'll wait why did
that change I want this to be white all
right and then let's once again go to
the type tool and click down here and
I'll see Travis C Mediacom now notice
that it's under that black bar if we
want to move it over we can just go over
here to the layers and just click and
drag it up all right I'm going to change
the size of that to let's say 30 whoops
is a comma and then didn't want that all
right so let's just drag it over here
and then I just want to change the color
of traversée media so highlight it
click up here and let's choose the brown
from the mocha label logo okay now if
you wanted to change the color of let's
say this bar right here we'll just
highlight the layer and click on it and
you can go to color overlay by default
it's going to be bright red but you can
just simply change it to whatever you'd
like
okay there's also a gradient overlay you
can choose different come different
colors for your gradient but we're not
going to do that I do want a little
border on the bottom so stroke where is
it stroke right here that's going to
give you a border around the whole thing
however only the bottom is showing here
the bottom border so that's all we can
see which is fine and you can change the
size if you want I'm going to change the
color to this Brown and click OK all
right so we're just about there I want
to also want to bring in my logo so I'm
just going to go to file open actually
I'll just find it
through here so see let's go branding
logo final I'm going to bring in this
white version and I want to make it
really small because it's going to go
down here okay so we'll just put it over
on this side all right and let's just
bring these down a little bit alright so
that looks pretty good
you know it's nothing special but this
is pretty much you know the process that
I follow to create my thumbnails now
what I would do is save as and you want
to save the PSD because that's what's
going to give you the layers over here
excuse me you can see I already have it
here and where I saved everything you
can see it I have my video production
folder this is actually my Synology
server the DiskStation and this I would
put in tutorials and I would put it
let's see I already created the folder
which is right here and then I would put
this in there that's about it it is oh
never mind this would be in the mocha
testing folder I wouldn't see where is
that intro no what the hell is it
alright here an intro to JavaScript
testing so I would put it in the covers
folder and you can see I already have a
PSD saved so we do that and then I would
also save a JPEG and that's what
obviously what I would use to upload to
YouTube as a thumbnail all right you can
see I have the code from each video I do
the captures and I will go over some of
the process that I did I use to actually
make videos for you guys that are
interested but I think that's it for now
hopefully this gave you just a little
introduction to Photoshop for those of
you that that aren't really familiar
with it and gives you a little little
bit of perspective on how I maintain my
channel you know for those of you that
are interested in this kind of stuff
