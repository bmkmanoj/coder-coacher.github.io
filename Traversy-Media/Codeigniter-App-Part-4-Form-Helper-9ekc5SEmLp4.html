create the login form in this box right
here and we're going to do that by just
creating a login view and we're going to
insert that login view into the main
template in this area okay so we want to
go to views and let's go ahead and
create a new folder called users and our
users views will go in here so let's
create a new file and save that as login
dot PHP alright so in here we're going
we're gonna use the form helper and like
I said the documentation is great so if
we say just see iPhone helper that
should give us the documentation page
alright so in and I think the second
video we added all our autoloaders and
one of the helpers we auto loaded as the
form so we don't have to include this if
you didn't ought alowed the form then
you need to put this in somewhere in the
class or somewhere in the view ok so
that'll just load the form helper
alright so what this does is gives us
pretty much a whole new syntax to create
forms with and it's made to kind of
simplify things and just encapsulate
things so this here this echo form open
this is equivalent to having a open form
tag alright so you can see right here
this is the same as this alright what
you want to put as a parameter is the
page that you're sending to which is
usually the controller and then a method
alright so this here would send to an
email controller with a method of send
alright and we can add attributes to our
form if we want to add a class or an ID
we can put those into a variable into an
array and then just pass that to the to
the form open API
all right let's see we have methods for
adding hidden fields if your form is
going to have I in a file upload button
then you need to use this instead of
form open you want to use form open
multi-part form input gives us input
tags all right so we just echo form
input and then add an array in there
with all the attributes so the name ID
value all that stuff you can add in
there all right so this here is
equivalent to this form password text
area upload dropdowns multi-select so
any form element you can think of is on
this page and it will show you how to
implement it all right so what we're
going to do here is first create our
attributes for our form and our
attributes is going to be equal to an
array oh and by the way you don't have
to use this form help but you could just
as well put standard HTML form tags
alright so the array let's give this
form an ID
we'll give it an ID of login form
and we're gonna give it a class we'll
give it a class of form horizontal which
is a bootstrap based class all right so
that's our attributes now we need to
actually let's close that up let's echo
the want to echo form open all right and
in here we want to we want to we want to
say where we want to send this and we're
gonna send this to a controller called
user and a function called login or a
method called login all right and then
we also want to just pass in the
attributes all right
all right so now what we want to do and
let's close this form before we do
anything else we're going to echo form
clothes
and that's equivalent to a closing form
tag so what we want to do here is add in
our first input and we're going to use
labels as well so I want to put this in
a paragraph tag I want to say PHP echo
form label alright so the form label is
going to say user name and now we want
to create a an array of attributes for
the input tag so PHP and we're going to
create a variable called data equal to
an array which will have our attributes
so the first thing will be the form name
and the form I'm sorry not the form name
the input name is going to be username
let's see we want a placeholder
placeholders just you know the text
that's there when you come when you
enter the page so this would just say
user username all right we want a style
I'm just gonna add just an inline style
just for the width so we're gonna say
width is gonna be 90% so basically 90%
of the box that it's in and the last
thing we need is a value now in code
ignitor you can use this set value and
what this does is it makes it so if you
submit the information and you have an
error and you have to change something
what this does is it sets the value that
you already have in there so that you
know you don't submit a form and have
everything go back to blank this will
save your spot I'll save whatever you
typed in username all right so that's
that's really it for the name the
username input it's just
make this look a little bit nicer
all right so that looks a little nicer I
am now what we need to do is a PHP echo
form inputs and we just want to input
that data array all right so the next
thing we need is a password so to make
this go a little quicker I'm just going
to copy this and I'll label the password
the name is going to be password
please holder
and then we'll set the value to password
and this isn't going to be forum input
it's gonna be forum password or else it
would just be a plain text box okay
we're just passing the data so that's it
for that now we just need our submit
button all right so I'm gonna copy this
and we're actually not going to have a
label the name
so the name will be submits let's see
it's not gonna have a placeholder I'm
not gonna have style actually we're
gonna have a class because we're using
bootstrap I want the button to be
formatted so we'll say class is going to
be equal to
BTN BTM primary and for the value the
value will just be login which is what
the button will say and we change this
to submit
all right so that should be our login
form if we go and reload he don't you
don't see it because we have an insert
of the view yet so let's go to our
layouts go to our main view and copy
this right here in sidebar content
we want to say login users slash login
wait a minute user slash login alright
so hopefully that works
yep so there's our login form I do want
to put a heading in there so let's go
back to login and we'll put it in h3
all right so our login form is all set
so I'm going to stop here and in the
next video we'll actually create the
users controller and we'll have this
form submit and we'll look at the form
validation library as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
