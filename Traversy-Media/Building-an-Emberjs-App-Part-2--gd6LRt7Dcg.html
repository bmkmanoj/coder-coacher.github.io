building an ember JSF in the last video
we set everything up we created our
routes for tasks and for new tasks we
created our controllers for tasks and
new tasks now what we're gonna do is set
up the model alright so let's go back to
the command line and stop the server and
you're gonna say member G model and
we're gonna say task ok and you want it
to be singular model should be singular
so we'll go ahead and create that
alright and then we're gonna say Amber
serve and let's go and check the model
file out so under app and then models we
have task J s alright and this is where
we're going to create our schema kind of
I guess it's a schema the fields that we
want and this line here we're importing
ember data ember data is a library that
comes with ember that was really
powerful and gives us the concept of
stores ok so we can say things like this
don't store dot create or delete or
whatever we want to do alright so in
here what we're gonna do is our field so
we want a title and we're gonna say
title is DS dot attribute or adder and
then the type of field that this is
going to be so this is gonna be a string
alright and then we'll do a comma and
we're just gonna fill all these in so
body I'm sorry we're going to do
description and that's gonna be DS
starts patter and that's also gonna be a
string all right and then we're gonna
have a date and that's gonna be d s dot
adder and this is gonna be a datatype
alright and then finally we're gonna
have a created and this is gonna be this
is gonna compute automatically it's just
going to return the current date and
time
alright so to do that I will say DS dots
adder and we're going to format this is
a string but we're going to pass in some
values or pass in a default value and
that's going to be a function and all we
want to do here is return new date ok so
that's going to just put the current
date and time into created
all right so let's go ahead and save
that and then the next thing I want to
do is create not create but install
ember fire all right so we're gonna go
back to our command line and all we have
to do here is say ember install number
fire all right and it knows what to do
from there
not only will install ember fire but
it'll also set up our adapter to connect
and basically just talk to our firebase
database
alright so that is now installed so
let's go around ever serve and now you
should notice if you go a nap and you
know have a folder called adaptive and
if we go to application j/s this is the
firebase adapter that was created for us
we don't have to touch anything in here
I just wanted to show you and you should
also verify that you have that alright
so what we do need to do is go to our
config folder and then environment j/s
and we have to add a couple things here
alright so one is going to be the
content security policy we want to
basically tell our application that it
can deal with firebase io all right so
we're gonna say content security policy
alright and we're going to set that once
that connect - source
then we want to do self in single quotes
and then WSS slash slash anything which
is the asterisk dot firebase io com okay
so any sub domain of firebase IO calm
all right and then the next thing we
have to set up is just fire basic set
itself so I'm gonna say firebase and we
want to set that to our firebase URL
which is mine is right here yours will
be different but this is where you can
get it okay we'll just paste that right
in there and that should be good so
we'll save that alright and we're gonna
have to restart our server
and now we can continue where we left
off in the last video which is in the
what was it as a controller
yeah the new controller all right so
right here so we're gonna say var new
task and let's set it to this dot store
dot create record all right so this is
all utilizing ember data so that this is
gonna be the model we want it's task
model and then we want to specify all
our fields subtitle is gonna be the
title variable description and dates now
date we're gonna say new date and then
pass in the date variable okay so that's
that now to save to firebase we need to
just say new task dot save all right and
then finally we want to clear the form
when we can do that with this dot set
properties
and then we can pass in each property we
want to set so title set to nothing
description and dates all right so let's
save that and let's go back to em tasks
and do a reload
all right so we'll say new tasks and
let's call it my first task and set the
date
okay description this is my first task
submit okay so we submitted it now we're
not going to see it down here yet
because we haven't added anything to the
tasks view or the task template if we go
to firebase you'll now see we have tasks
if we open that up we have this this
record and now we have our title
description the date and then the
created date and time all right so the
create dates December 13th the date we
set is going to be December 15th all
right so that's working perfectly so far
okay but now we want to make it so that
it shows up down here as well
so let's go to routes and then to tasks
and this is going to be very simple
we're just going to provide our model
and that's gonna be a function and we
can just say return this dot store dot
find all
and we're gonna pass in the method which
is tasks so that's gonna get all the
tasks for us
save that let's now go to the view or
the template which is in templates and
then tasks dot HBS and let's go under
this heading and let's do our loop so
we're going to say each each task in
model then down here you want to end the
each alright each task in model so this
model right here is coming from if we go
to the route it's coming from this right
here all right and this is returning all
tasks so what we're gonna do here let's
create a div and give it a class
bootstrap class of panel
I'm sorry not panel well okay and let's
do h4
and this is where we'll put out the
title so for that we should be able to
say task dot title alright and then the
description let's put that in a
paragraph and I'll say tasks dots
description
all right so let's see what happens
there if we go to home let's reload it
okay so there's our task now if we go
ahead and look at our console you should
have an ember tag here do I not have oh
there it is okay so if we click on that
it's going to give us all this
information on our tasks we have the
template that is that's displaying we
have the controller that it's in the
that stuff doesn't really matter and
then we can also see the different
routes that are available so we have
tasks task dot new task dot error if we
click data we're gonna be able to see
all the data that's coming in the tasks
along with its ID now notice that we
didn't we didn't define an ID in the
model this ID is coming from the
firebase API itself alright so we have
an ID a title description date created
okay so this this little ember tool is
really handy alright and let's go ahead
and also include the date all right so
let's do small
and so let's do task dot date and let's
just put in do what does not die do
oh we misspelled this it should be
tasked oddly
all right so there's our date it's it
doesn't look too nice because it's not
formatted at all so what we can do is we
can install something called moment
which is a date formatter so yeah let's
do that real quick all right so we can
actually use Bower to do that as well
so we'll save our install moments
all right now just like we did with
bootstrap we have to include this in
ember CLI build okay so I'm just gonna
copy this okay and then we're just gonna
change from here on so this is gonna be
a moment moment / min / moment dot min
dot J s alright and that should include
it and we should be able to use it now
so let's close that all right and one
thing we're gonna have to do is write a
date formatter so the easiest way to do
that is to put it in a helper alright so
up here you can see we have helpers so
we're going to go ahead and create a new
file and let's save this as format
format date donc je s alright let's say
we have to do our just import ember from
amber J and then export we could have
actually generated a helper just like we
did with the controller and stuff but
this is fine too
so function format date okay we're gonna
pass in Rams and then we're going to
return moment Rams and we want the zero
index and then I'm going to say doc
format and the moment j s documentation
has all different types of formats you
can use I'm just going to do something
really simple and do a year month day
alright and then we just got to export
so that we can use this elsewhere
we'll say export default number dot
helper
dot helper and then pass in format date
and that should do it so let's save it
and that should be available to us now
so right in the tasks template where we
have the date it's due date right here
we should be able to say format whoops
format date
all we get to start the server
all right so I'm getting an error and it
looks like
wait a second
I think that this is format date should
should have the -
yeah something's wrong so let's just
change that
I change that to format - D
all right so it's still blank let me
just check that helper again return
moment params oh this parentheses
shouldn't be back here it should end
right here like that
there we go all right so the date looks
a little better at least it doesn't have
the timezone and all that but you can go
to moment J s org I think and look for
different types of formats alright so
there we get a task now when we create a
new task it should automatically just
show up down there all right so let's
say my second task and you'll set that
4:17 and I'll say this is my second task
submit and there we go shows up right
away if we reload it should still be
there yep all right so that's working
great now the next thing that I'm going
to want to do is we're going to want to
be able to edit our tasks all right so I
want to be able to click one and it
should open a form just like this with
the title and description in there I
don't know if we're going to be able to
get the date in there just because of
the whole formatting issue but we'll
give it a shot so that's what we'll do
in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
