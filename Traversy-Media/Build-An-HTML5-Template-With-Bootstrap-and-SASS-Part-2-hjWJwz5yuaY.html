bootstrap &amp;amp; sass template in this video
I want to implement bootstrap and also
font awesome for our icons
alright so our project directory looks
like this what I'm going to do is go to
get bootstrap calm
and I'm going to go ahead and download
bootstrap
okay so open that up
and we're just going to drag some files
over all right so basically
we want our CSS all I'm going to take
from here is bootstrap CSS that's all we
need
all right so fonts oh we didn't even
create a fonts folder
okay so fonts we'll bring over all these
glyphicon even though we're going to be
using font awesome for our icons but
just in case you want it to use some of
those JavaScript okay we're just going
to bring over bootstrap J s and that's
all we need from that so we also want
jQuery
all right so I'm going to save this in
the project
in the j/s folder
and I'm just going to rename this just
to jQuery dot J s just to simplify
things
alright next we want font awesome
okay so I want to download
okay open that up
and we want to grab from here fonts
excuse me
and the CSS file now you can see there
are we do have s CSS files if you want
to do that but I'm not going to do it
for this for this project it was just
over complicate things so I'm just going
to grab the CSS file
all right so that's our structure now we
need to create an index.html file
all right and just to get some core
bootstrap code I'm going to get
bootstrap and then getting started go to
examples starter template do a control
you and we'll just grab all this
okay now we'll go back to our index
and paste this in and then we'll go
through it okay so we have the html5
doctype HTML tag English language
character set okay we want this we want
the viewport because it's going to be
responsive I'm going to get rid of
description author and icon and then the
title sky app welcome
okay the bootstrap CSS file remember we
we only took the bootstrap dot CSS and
then here we want to change the path we
want to get rid of this because it's
just right enough CSS file all right so
the starter template here we're not
going to need what we want to include is
our font awesome so CSS slash font
awesome dot CSS and then we want our
main CSS file
okay
and then these from here to here we can
just get rid of all right so the navbar
goes from here to here container I'm
going to get rid of this and then down
here for the JavaScript we have a link
to that links to the Google jQuery index
but we could we're just going to include
our own so let me get rid of this and we
want to go to JavaScript slash jQuery
dot side with that jQuery j/s and then
the bootstrap javascript get rid of that
and then we can get rid of this all
right
so if we save that let's see what it
looks like
all right so basically we have an empty
site we have a navbar and that's it but
we have everything included let's check
the console make sure there's no errors
here nope all right good so now we're
ready to start writing our HTML so we'll
start with the navbar basically we want
to keep this we want to keep all these
classes project name sky app for the
links we have a home which will go to
index dot HTML and what else do we want
an about page okay that'll go to a bulk
dot HTML contact we'll go a contact on
HTML and we want a couple more pages
here okay so we want services
in our blog page
all right and then we're going to have
our login and register link so we want
to get out of this unordered list and
then have a new one
all right and we're going to give it a
couple of classes okay first we want nav
you want nav bar
I'm sorry nav bar nav okay these are all
core bootstrap style classes nav bar sub
and we want to pull right we want to
float to the right all right you'll have
to list items and this one will be
registered
and this one will be login
all right so that's it for our navbar
we're going to have a lot of styling to
do okay we need to turn this navbar into
this okay but I just want to get the
HTML done first before we get into that
all right let me see
okay we'll make sure the responsive menu
works all right
so under the navigation we're going to
start our showcase all right which is
this area with the image with this this
copy in here buttons all right so what I
like to do is format my HTML pages in
sections all right so this will be a
section called showcase and they don't
always have to have a class but what I
like to do is create different versions
all right so this here with the search
bar and this light blue background this
will be a section and we'll call it
section slash light because it has a
light color basically we're going to
have a few different color pet color
variables we'll have primary which is
going to be this blue will have
secondary which will be the green will
have light which will be this light blue
and then we'll have dark which will be
like a dark grey all right and then this
here is another section okay this will
be a section this is a section with the
class of section light this will be
another section with the class of
section primary and then we have our
footer all right so that's just my
preference how I like to build html5
sites you may already have kind of a
method that you stick to and that's fine
so we're going to do is add a section so
section class is going to be showcase
and actually know what I want to add
another s CSS file in layouts
actually you know what never mind the
code for this we'll put in our sections
s CSS file so never mind alright so in
our section we're going to have a div
with the class of container and if you
use bootstrap at all then you know what
container is basically it takes
everything and gives it a width and sets
it in the middle so this entire area
here you can see how it's set in the
middle and we have margin auto on each
side all right so that's container and
I'm also going to add another class to
this called showcase content
all right and then in there we'll have
our h1 say bootstrap html5 template
and then we'll have a paragraph and I
want to give it a class of lead which is
a boop bootstrap class and I'm just
going to grab some text
paste it in okay so I just have a strong
around the bootstrap 3 and we have a
line break here to make it two lines so
under that we want our buttons so I'm
going to create a div with the class of
downloads excuse me
all right and we're going to have a link
that goes nowhere and we'll have two
images so this will be around an image
and this will be called ing for our
image folder and then BTN - whoops
download dot PNG yeah we might as well
add some alt text just say download all
right and then we want another one I'm
just going to copy this here
and
this one is going to be called Appstore
all right so we might as well get the
images so in your source files the link
is in the description you should find
the images basically I'm just going to
grab all of them I don't want the PSD
and put them inside the images folder
where are we alright so that's it for
the showcase area next is going to be
where that search box is ok this search
and this is going to be a section it's
going to have a class of section light
all right so we want to go right here
section class section light
and let's see
okay one container and the reason that
the container is on the inside of the
section is because we want the
background of the section to go across
the entire page you know no matter how
how wide you open your browser it should
go all the way across if we put a
container outside of it then it would
only go from here to here all right we
want the content to be in the middle
inside the container but not the actual
section okay so in our container we're
going to use the grid system bootstrap
grid system basically we need to create
a class called row and then our columns
all right so what I'm going to do with
this section is have two six column dibs
okay one here one here and this is empty
but you could put something here if you
want maybe social network icons or
something like that but for now we're
just going to have a search bar in one
of the columns okay so div class
call - MD - six okay and then we want
the same thing and then inside here is
where we want our form or search form
okay so form class search
and what do we want to do we want a div
and then an input type is going to be
searched we're going to use the html5
search type and we'll put a placeholder
that'll say search website and products
all right and then we want a button with
a type of submit
and a value actually going to leave the
value blank and then we want to use an
image as the button alright so here
we're going to say image' SRC is going
to be in the images folder and called
search dot PNG and we'll also have an
alt text that will say search
all right
oh this should be an equal sign all
right so if we save this and take a look
now it's not going to look very pretty
all right so you can see that it's even
under the navigation box so we're going
to have to fix that later this image
isn't being found
button Appstore
oh there's no -
all right there we go
all right so let's just keep going with
the HTML we have our showcase and our
first section our second section next we
want a Hodge section with the three
column layout so this right here it's
going to have three columns with three
blocks alright so I want to go out of
this last section and you don't want to
let me give this a class because there's
no background or anything like that the
blocks are going to be styled
individually okay so we need a container
and then we want to row
and then we're going to want three four
column dips so call m.d.
for
I'm just going to copy this and then in
each column we want our block so div
class okay the first block is going to
be that blue that's going to be a
primary block so class is going to have
block okay all blocks will have the
class of block in addition to this
styling which in this case is block
primary and then inside there we want an
h3 and we want an icon so we're going to
use font awesome so we'll have an eye
tag the class
when you use font awesome you always
need the FA class and then the icon you
want in our case it's going to be FA -
check alright and I can show you real
quick
all the icons are located here there's
just a ton of them and if you click on
one it'll give you the exact code which
is the FA and then the icon name all
right so we want the checkmark okay now
for the h3 text what do I want sleek
and then we want a paragraph and I'm
just going to grab some text real quick
just some dummy lips some text
all right and then we want a read more
so a trap and let's see this
see what this button looks like we're
just going to use the default button
which is a white button so class you
always want to use BTN and then BTN
whatever style default BTN default is a
bootstrap course style and this is going
to say read more okay so what I'm going
to do now is copy the block and paste it
in these two
and then just change the middle one is
going to be block secondary it'll change
sleek to responsive
and we'll change this to clean all right
so if we save that it's going to look
horrible actually it doesn't look too
bad you can see we have our columns I
just want to put a space after the check
box even though we probably will add a
margin all right so that's it for the
three column section now we want the
four column which is this here and I'm
going to stop this video here and we'll
continue in part three I just want to
keep the videos around 2025 minutes so
we'll do this in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
