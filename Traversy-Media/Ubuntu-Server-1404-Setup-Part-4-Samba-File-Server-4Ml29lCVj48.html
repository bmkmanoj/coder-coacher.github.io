server set up with a hostname static IP
address what we want to do now is we
want to be able to share certain folders
with our Windows Network and by default
it can be really tricky but there is
something called Samba or Samba that you
can install and it'll allow your Linux
server to easily communicate with your
Windows machines all right so you'll be
able to go to whatever network
neighborhood and your Linux server will
show up and you'll be able to log in and
create files run files whatever all
right
so the first thing we want to do is just
install samba ok we can do that if we do
any actually let's do an app to get
update first just to make sure
everything's up to date
all right so what we want to do now is
just install it so we'll say sudo
apt-get install Samba ok yes
all right so now summer is installed now
we need to go to the configuration file
so when I say sudo nano etc' slash Samba
/ SMB dots
conf okay so this is the main
configuration file for Samba and it's
just a lot of different things that you
can configure from here and this is also
where you're going to add your shares
shares being files or folders that are
shared with the rest of your network all
right so the first thing we want to do
is I'm going to go down here to this
workgroup and by default it's workgroup
you want to change this to whatever your
Windows workgroup is all right so let's
just uh let me show you where to get
that now I don't have my computer the my
computer icon on my desktop here but
what you want to do is right-click on
computer or vine computer or whatever it
is and go to properties and it's going
to bring up this page and you can see
that my computer name is monster and the
workgroup I'm on is Brad's Network
alright so this is what we want to put
in there obviously you'll put what
whatever you want
okay so Brad's
Network all right and you can just
scroll down and you can just look at
some of the different options support
for winds networking debugging there's
all kinds of authentication rules you
can set and then down here is where it
says share definitions is where you put
your shares and this is basically what
it'll look like the share name will be
in brackets the comment will basically
be the the human readable name you can
set it if you want it to be browsable
and windows or not read only you can set
file permissions there's a whole bunch
of different settings and you can also
share printers you see down here we
basically are going to share our
printers alright and you can also
specify guests ok for files and printers
which means that they'll be able to
access without needing an account on the
server alright so we're just going to
leave it as is uh just for now into a
control X and then Y to save alright and
to restart Samba you want to say sudo we
start SM VD and also sudo restart NM VD
all right now the next thing I want to
do is just add a user to Samba which is
fairly easy we're just going to say sudo
SMB passwd a and then the name of the
user okay and it's going to ask you for
a new password
all right let me actually just restart
sombre again
all right now what I want to do is open
up my network in Windows
okay so if we go to network and let's go
ahead and reload
all right so you can see I've caught a
few machines on the network but right
here is what we want to look at test
server all right so now we're seeing the
linux server and windows okay now the
reason there's nothing here is we
haven't created any shares yet all right
so let's create a share um we're in our
home directory now which if you
installed Windows Server and not that
I'm sorry
Ubuntu server and not the desktop then
you don't really have anything in here
but let's create a folder inside of our
test server
well I create a folder
so we'll use the make der command so
we'll make a directory and let's just
call this shared alright now if we look
we have a folder called shared let's go
into that folder with CD alright and
we'll create a file here let's create a
file using the cat command and it will
say my file dot txt permission denied we
need to use sudo still permission denied
let's go back to the home directory and
I just want to check out the permissions
all right so you can see that this
shared folder it's owned by by the root
user and it's in the root group we want
to change that so I'm going to say CH o
N and use the R option and we want to
change it to the user Brad and the group
Brad okay and then the name of the
folder which is shared and we need to do
a sudo as well okay so now if we look at
it okay so now it's Brad alright so
let's go back into it
and try to create that file
all right so there's our file let's go
ahead and see if we can edit this
this is my file okay we'll save that
alright so obviously this isn't going to
be shared yet if we go back to Windows
and reload there's nothing there we need
to add it to our configuration file our
Samba configuration file so we want to
do sudo nano etc' slash Samba /sm be
calm and then go down and then you go
page down down to I like to put my
shares under the actually yeah under
this last print actually now I'm going
to go up a little bit yeah
right here alright so I'll call this
share you can call it whatever you want
and comments this is basically what it's
going to show what the share is going to
be called so I'm just going to leave
shared alright next we want to put the
path ok so the path for this is home
get home / Brad / shared I'm sorry we
need to put path here path equals
alright so we're going to say browsable
yes read only no guests okay
yes
I think that's really all we need
alright Abel
writeable equals yes
all right so let's um exit this now save
it and we want to restart Samba where is
it
all right so now let's go over to
Windows and now you can see we have a
folder called share and there's a file
ok so we can easily share all your files
on your server with all of your Windows
clients and we can edit this file if we
want ok I'll just save that and we can
edit the file name
all right so we basically have full
permission to do what we want with this
share and things can go wrong when
you're dealing with Samba that actually
went really smooth but sometimes you
have issues with permissions basically
you just want it you want to add your
Samba user and make sure that that the
files that the folders you create belong
to that user and are in that users group
and you should be okay and since we put
guests ok equals yes we don't need a
password to go into this fold into the
share right so that's how you can create
a Samba server on your a bun to machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
