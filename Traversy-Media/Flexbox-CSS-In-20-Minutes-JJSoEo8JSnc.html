on CSS flexbox so many of you probably
know what flexbox is and that's fine
this will help you brush up on your
skills a little bit but this video is
more for beginners that know CSS but
want to get into using flexbox and their
projects I did get a request for this
and I figured it'd be something a bit
different nice break from the JavaScript
and PHP videos alright so before we
begin I just want to mention my website
traversing mediacom where you can find
all of my tutorials videos free courses
premium courses via Juwan --ax source
code and more alright so check that out
alright so what the hell is flexbox
it's also called the flexible box model
it's basically a layout mode or model
that provides an easy and clean way to
arrange items within container so if
you've used CSS for a while you've
probably been using the old block model
where you assign widths whether it's a
percentage or a fixed width and then you
use floats to arrange items on the page
if you want for instance three boxes in
a row and then you'd have to factor in
your margins and your padding and you
have to do all types of math to figure
out how much margin how much width you
should have and it can get kind of it
can be kind of a pain in the ass so
flexbox has basically taken care of all
of this there's no floats at all it's
responsive and mobile-friendly km it
looks good on smaller screens and of
course you can use media queries to to
make that work even better positioning
child elements is much much easier and
flex containers their margins don't
collapse with the margins of their
contents and then another great feature
is that if you want to change the order
of the elements okay so for instance if
you have a main column and then a
sidebar in another sidebar if you want
to change the order of that you don't
have to edit the HTML you don't have to
move the first sidebar over to the to
the other
side if you want the main column in the
middle all right you can simply assign
an order property and we'll get into all
of this as we move along all right so
some of the concepts of the flexible box
model is the ability to alter item width
and height to best fit in its containers
available free space flex box is also
Direction agnostic alright and this is
different than the block model which is
vertically bias and then the inline
which is horizontal horizontally bias
flex box works well for both alright
flex box was created for small-scale
layouts and there's another standard
called grids which is geared more
towards larger scale stuff this will
work similar to the way to Twitter
bootstrap grid system works alright but
that's for another video so this is a
quick diagram of how flex box looks
basically we have a main container
wrapper alright
the Flex container and this is the
element that we assign the display
property we design we assign display
flex and then inside that we have child
elements or flex items so there's
certain properties that go on the
container and certain ones that go on
the items themselves there's also an X
and y axis or in Flex box it's called
the main and the cross access and we can
use certain alignment properties to
position items here and to to change
directions and vertically and
horizontally aligned all kinds of stuff
alright but it's kind of hard to explain
just talking and showing you a diagram
so we will get into the code and I'll
show you how it works so here are the
main Flex properties
okay so we have display flex okay you
can also do in-line flex this goes on
that container element we can assign the
direction so flex direction row which
would be horizontally or we could do
column which would assign it vertically
flex wrap so we can define if we want
the
to rap or not so if we make the browser
window smaller should they go down to
the next line or not flex basis is
basically the same as with okay you can
assign a width to to each of your Flex
items justify content okay so this
basically if we wanted to align to the
left we can say flex start the right
would be flex end we can also do Center
and then we have a bunch of other
alignments to align self this basically
allows the default alignment to be
overridden for individual flex items we
also have aligned items this is the
behavior for how the Flex items are laid
out along the cross access and then we
have aligned content which aligns on the
cross access now flex grow and flex
shrink basically we can we can make
different elements in the row different
sizes so we may want to main column that
takes up let's say three spaces and then
two smaller sidebars to take up one and
flex is basically both of these put
together but we'll get into that as we
move along we also have order so we can
change the order of elements without
actually having to change the HTML all
right so enough of these slides let's go
ahead and jump into some code and I'll
show you how this works all right so
what I have here guys I have the
scratchpad dot IO console where we can
edit our HTML and CSS and this will live
reload and what we have is if we look at
the HTML we have a div with the class of
container 1 and that's wrapped around
three other divs with the class of box 1
box 2 and box 3 and they all have just
an h3 in a paragraph all right and then
up here if we look we have our styles we
have the container one which doesn't
have any styles in it container one div
I did this just so that we can have a
border and some padding around each one
of these boxes and then we have some
empty
our box 1 box 2 in box 3 now let's say
that we want these to be side by side
and take up the whole width so all we
have to do is go to the container
element and say display flex and you can
see that it just automatically puts them
side by side we didn't have to put in
any floats or anything like that and
that may be very well what the only
thing that you want to do and that's
fine
but let's go in a little further and
let's assign flex
oops we'll say flex 1 and we're going to
assign flex 1 to all three of these
elements alright and that basically
gives us the same thing we have 3 even
boxes now if we want to let's say take
box 1 and make that the main column make
that a little wider what we could do is
change that to flex 2 alright you can
see that it pushed these two over and
this is now larger we can go on to flex
3 flex 4 and so on actually I think when
we get to a certain length certain width
it just stops let's keep it at flex 2
all right now if we wanted to take box 3
and say flex 2 we could do that as well
but what I want to do is now show you
how we can change the order of these
let's say that we want this to be the
main column and we want that in the
middle of the two side bars so all we
would have to do is say box one will say
order 2 and to let's say order 1 and
then 3 will say order 3 so now you can
see box 1 is in the middle because we
assigned order - okay - is in 1 and 3 is
in 3 now notice that by default these
are all the same height even though that
this box 1 the text is ending up here
these are still all the same height and
that's by default now if we want to
these two let's say a line to the top
without you know without the automatic
height then we could go to our container
and let's say we can say a line items
and let's set it to flex - start all
right now you can see that box one is
shorter because it has less content if
we want to go the other way and put it
towards the bottom we could say flex end
and that would move it down alright and
I'm actually going to leave these I'm
just going to comment them out just so
you guys can have this for future
reference
ok so that'll be end and I'm just going
to wrap this in a comment alright we can
also do Center so if we were to say a
line items Center you can see that that
moves it to the center alright - by
default it's actually stretch ok that's
that's the default alright let me just
move this up here okay so that's align
items now if you want to change the
direction to go vertically instead of
horizontally horizontally is a row
vertically as a column we could add flex
direction and set that to call or a
column and you can see it goes back to
being column all right but we do want a
row so I'm going to just put that in
there now this is all well and good but
what if you want to have for one you
want to have margins and you also want
to specify the widths all right because
right now we don't have any with
specified so what I'm going to do is go
down here and go under
our container one and I'm going to just
paste this in alright so you can see we
have a div with container - let me just
fix this
so container two and then each div
inside has a class of container - box
they're all the same I don't for what I
want to show you I don't need to have
them with different class names alright
and then let's just go ahead and add our
borders and stuff to that by just saying
container - div alright so what I want
to do now is take the container - box
remember that pertains to all three of
these boxes they all the same class
alright so let's go up here and just put
that in there and let's set a width and
we'll set that to 30% okay so you can
now see that the boxes are 30% wide now
they're not side-by-side because we
haven't attached them to flex box yet so
what we need to do is just like we did
with container 1 up here let's go ahead
and put container 2 and we're going to
set display to flex okay that puts them
side by side and notice that well I
guess you can't really notice it here
let me make these a little let's say 20
all right so now we have 20 20 percent
for each box but it leaves all this room
on the side here now if we want to
basically put margin in the middle of
this so that this can spread all the way
across and also have margins in the
middle then what we can do is go up to
our container - and we can use justify
content
now by default it's going to be flex
start okay notice that that didn't
change anything I'm going to actually
keep this stuff in a comment so let me
just comment that out for you alright so
flex start now let's say we want it to
line over here we could say flex end
okay that pushes it over let's copy that
put that up here now what I would want
to do in this situation is actually
let's see we do Center that puts it in
the center okay but we want margins in
the middle so we want to set it to space
between okay and you can see that that
puts the margins in the middle alright
I'm going to actually change that to
let's say 25 or 27 all right we also can
do space around now notice with space
between there's nothing on the sides
there's no margin on the side it's flush
but if we say space around that's going
to also add some margins on the side all
right but I'm going to keep it at space
between what I mean to save it now using
width is fine it does work but if you
want to make it more I guess flexi then
you want to use flex basis okay which
does the same exact thing it's just a
more flexbox way to do it okay rather
than with use Flex basis now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to just release
this full-screen mode here and I'm going
to drag this oh you know what it's not
ah this isn't a good platform to give
you this example oh yeah it is I can
just go like that
so as I make this smaller let's say
we're looking at this on a smartphone or
tablet these columns are way too small
we don't want to have a three column
layout when you're on a smartphone so to
fix this what we can do is just use a
simple media query around our containers
so up here at the top let's say media I
don't like this editor so media and
let's say min-width and we'll set this
to let's say 7 768 pixels alright and
what we want to do is take the container
1 &amp;amp; 2 and cut that and let's put that in
there alright now when we're at a
certain width now this is a lot this is
zoomed in so this looks like it's a lot
more than 768 pixels wide but it's not
if I actually zoom out yeah that's so
that's about right so when we get to a
certain point our columns go away okay
so on a mobile device it would look more
like this all right so that's an easy
solution to basically make this
responsive let me just make this bigger
again all right
for the time being I'm going to change
this to let's a 468 so what about
wrapping okay we want to have the option
to make our elements wrap so what I'm
going to do is paste in another set down
here this is going to be container 3 and
notice I have what is it six boxes in
here
I'm just going to add the border around
them too so right here let's say
container 3 container 3 div alright and
then what we'll do is go right here and
say container 3 box ok they all have the
same class and let's set the width or
the Flex basis okay so we'll set that to
15% and let's make sure we add the
display flex I'm not going to put it in
the media query this one so container
3 display flex all right so now we have
these boxes side by side and I want them
to wrap so I'm going to go to the
container 3 and we're just going to set
flex - wrap I'm going to set that to
wrap and now you can see that at a
certain point this one gets pushed down
there alright and if I were to make this
smaller you can see that it's going to
wrap up into the point where we actually
have two rows two rows of three boxes
all right so that's wrap and I probably
want to set that with - let's see let's
set it to 10 or 12 yeah
all right and then we may want to add
space between justify content for that
as well all right so that's the gist of
flexbox hopefully it helps some of you
guys out I will make this code available
on my website Travis and Mediacom so
that you guys can kind of use it as a
reference when you want to use it in
your projects but yeah so if you like
