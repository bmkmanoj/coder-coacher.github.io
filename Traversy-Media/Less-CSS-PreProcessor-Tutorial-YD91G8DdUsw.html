another crash course now I've been
getting a few requests for more
front-end web development videos and I
noticed that I don't have any videos on
the less CSS pre compiler I do have a
few on sass which is very similar but I
wanted to do a video on how to get less
installed and start to work with the
features that a CSS pre-compile er
offers alright so if you've never worked
with less or sass and you have no idea
what a CSS pre-compiled er is don't
worry about it it's actually really
simple to learn and just by watching
this video you're going to learn all the
basics and fundamentals alright so
basically a CSS pre-compile er extends
the normal CSS syntax and it adds a
bunch of new features okay which include
for instance the ability to use
variables in your CSS which is really
cool just that alone is a reason to
learn less or sass he also can use
mix-ins which are similar to functions
nested elements and a bunch of other
stuff okay so it gives logic to CSS now
there's a bunch of different ways to get
less up and running there's programs
like win less which is a GUI program
that you can install on windows and run
but we're going to take the the best
route in my opinion and that's to just
install less using NPM our node package
manager okay so you do need to have no
js' installed if you don't just go to
node.js org and download and install it
alright so this video is going to be
completely cross-platform I'm using
Windows but it's all the same on Mac or
Linux just again make sure you have node
installed so this is the the website for
less it's less CSS org and this gives
you kind of an overview of all the
different features it also shows you how
to install s globally which is what
we'll be doing how to work in the
command line you can also use it on the
client side as well now the LES module
that we're going to install this is the
github for it okay so all we have to do
is run NPM less - G and the - G is to
install it globally which means that the
less command or the less C command will
be X
Cybil from anywhere okay anywhere in our
system now this alone doesn't have a
watch option what I mean by that is so
we can run it and then have it just
watch our less files and every time we
make a change and we save it gets Auto
compiled into regular CSS for that we're
going to need this okay so this is a
dead simple less watch compiler and this
is also installed using NPM you can see
less is actually a prerequisite so we
have to do both of these all right so
let's go ahead and get started I'm going
to go over to my command line I'm using
commander for Windows but you know you
can use whatever you'd like even the
basic Windows command line or of course
your terminal in Mac or Linux so let's
go ahead and say NPM install dash G less
and I already have it installed so
mine's going to go really quick or at
least it should alright so we have that
installed now we want the less watch
compiler so let's do the same thing NPM
install dash G and less watch compiler
okay and that will also install globally
all right so let's create a folder to
work in I'm going to say make directory
and we're just going to call this less
sandbox
actually let's do less underscore
sandbox all right and then we'll CD into
that okay so what I'll do here is create
a less file okay so actually you know
I'll just open this an atom which is the
TextEdit are amusing of course you can
use whatever you'd like and you can see
by doing atom dot it opened it up in
this folder so let's go ahead and create
a file and we're going to call this
Styles dot less all right and then let's
just put a simple body in here and we'll
just set the background
to read for now and save it now this is
a less file
we can't just include this in our HTML
we need to compile it down to regular
CSS all right and that's where the two
things that we just installed come in so
let's go back to commander and if we
just run less see which is the the less
compiler and then we say style our
Styles dot less that's basically just
going to it's going to compile and then
just send it to standard output which is
just what we're seeing here in the
command line if we want to create a new
file and compile all the all the less to
CSS then we could do less let's see
styles dot less and then put the file
name we want which will be styles dot
CSS alright so it took this less file
compiled it into this CSS file okay now
these are the exact same because we
didn't use any anything that has to do
with less in this file so what I'll do
is in the less file make sure it's the
last not this regular CSS file I'm going
to add a variable so let's say at you
need this symbol for all your less
variables and then we'll say background
background color and we want to put a
colon here and then let's make it a a
light gray alright and then we can use
that variable anywhere we want so here
we'll say background color and let's
save that and then again let's run less
C styles dot less styles.css alright and
now if we go and look at the CSS file
you'll see that it's just background and
then that light gray okay it's not using
it doesn't show the variable because
well you can't do that in regular CSS
now this is just the less see if you
just have that installed I mean you can
do that but you'll have to run this
command
every time you want to basically
recompile you're less into regular CSS
that's kind of a pain in the ass so
that's where let's watch compiler comes
in alright so let's go to that github
alright and then say we have our the
usage and we can do less watch compiler
and then the folder we want to watch and
then the folder we want to output all
right so let's go ahead and create a new
folder called less and I'm going to
close these up and let's delete the
regular CSS file because we don't need
that and then styles dot less I'm going
to move into the less folder alright and
we'll keep exactly what we have there
and then let's see what happens if we go
and run less what is it less watch
compiler and then the folder that we
want to watch which is the less folder
and then the folder we want to output
which we'll call CSS and it should
automatically create that so let's run
that and you'll see now there's a CSS
folder with styles dot CSS and you can
see that we get the background the gray
background alright so it automatically
names the CSS file whatever you have for
the LES file okay now notice that it's
all online that's because by default
it's minified now if we go and take a
look at the github page there's actually
some configurations that we can set all
right so right here we can create a file
called let's watch compiler config jason
and include some options so let's go
ahead and do that we're going to put it
right in the root folder here so this is
going to be less - watch - compiler dot
config dot jason alright and then let's
go and grab this stuff here and let's
see so we have a loud extension so this
makes it so that it's only going to look
at less files ok extension dot less
minified is now set to false number by
default it is vinified but i'm going to
set it to false sourcemap will be
you want to generate a source map or not
we'll keep that to false and then we can
also specify the watch folder an output
folder so that we don't have to type it
in every time so we want this to be just
less that's the watch folder and then
the output folder is just CSS all right
so let's save that and let's keep what
we have here style is not less and go
back to our command line and now we're
just gonna going to do ctrl C because
it's actually watching the files right
now and let's just type in less - watch
- compiler alright and it's
automatically watching the less folder
okay so if we go ahead and change let's
say we change background color to see
we'll just say red and save that it
automatically gets compiled if we now
look at Styles dot nope that didn't well
I didn't that change oh you know what I
didn't have the right file opened I had
the one that's in the root open style
dot laughs that shouldn't even be there
alright so let's go and change styles
dot less to red and save and then go to
style.css and you can see it's red now
all right and it's not minified anymore
because we specified that in the
configuration file alright so what
you're going to do now is create an HTML
file so we can actually see some output
so let's say new file and call this
index dot HTML we'll just add some basic
HTML tags in here for the title I'll
just say less sandbox now we need a link
to our CSS file all right so let's just
go over here and say styles dot CSS okay
make sure you use CSS and not less and
in the body
I don't split an h1 here we'll say less
sandbox and then we'll put a paragraph
now in Adam you can type in lorem and
then tab
and it'll just put in a bunch of dummy
text here some alarm if some I think you
could do it in sublime as well so we
have a heading in a paragraph let's go
ahead and put a link in here as well so
I'm just going to wrap some of this text
and a link and its end that right here
alright so we'll save that and then I'm
actually going to open it using my atom
live server but of course you can just
open it right on your file system and
then it looks like this which is
horrendous so let's go back to the LES
file and we should be able to change
this variable back to light gray and
save and remember it's watching it so
it's going to automatically update and
since I'm using the atom live server I
don't even have to reload the page now
if you want this atom live server you
can just go to settings and go to
install and just search for atom atom
live server and then enter and it's
right here it's the one by Jaz Chen
alright if you're interested in that so
what I want to do now is just add some
variables here so we just put a comment
in here let's say variables and let's
add an addition to the background color
let's say font family and we'll set that
to let's say two Homa alright and then
let's add a primary color alright like
when you use bootstrap you have the
different classes you're the primary
color which is usually blue by default
you have success which is greeting
default which is gray and so on alright
so let's say the primary color we want
to be it's going to be a blue color it's
actually like the Facebook blue so it's
three B five nine nine eight all right
and then we can also set a secondary
color and we'll set that to a greenish
color which is going to be 2 0 D 2 AAA
all right and let's see let's implement
the font-family into the body so say at
family and that should make it to Houma
and let's see you'll save that okay you
can see it's the fonts changed and so on
now you can also do arithmetic in in
left so let's say we want to set the
line height and I mean this doesn't
really make sense why you would do this
but just to show you you can let's do
one M and we'll do let's just do one M
plus 1 M all right and then we'll set
that to the line height all right save
that now you can see it's 2 if we look
at style.css that's what everything
compiles down to all right so now what I
want to do is work with the primary
color so I'm going to create a class on
this link that we have here so let's
give it a class of primary - text and
then I'm also going to create a button
and so we don't need any of this stuff
we just want a class and I'm going to
give this a class of primary let's do
primary - BTN all right so we have this
link which is primary text the button is
primary button now we'll go to our less
file or let's say dot primary - text and
let's set the color - primary color and
let's say dot primary - BTN and for this
we're going to set the background -
primary color
all right so let's save that and if we
look now we have that Facebook blue for
the link and for the button all right
now imagine that you have you know
twenty thirty of these buttons around
your website instead of going and
changing each one separately you could
just change this one value and it will
iterate throughout your whole
application or your whole website which
is awesome now another thing we can do
is we can extend classes or our sixth
end styles so for this primary button
let's go right above it and create a
class called BTN all right and for this
BTN class we want let's say padding will
do 10 pixels top and bottom 15 left and
right and let's also take the border
away all right now of course you could
go into your HTML and also add button
here but what les allows us to do is
extend this okay so we can go down here
and we can just do : extend and then
pass in the class which is BTN or ID or
whatever it is so let's go ahead and
save that and now you can see those are
applied and let's just make that text
white for now for the primary button and
I'll show you later how we can make that
dynamic now we can also create mix-ins
which are basically like the kind of
like functions what we'll do here is go
to the bottom and let's create a style
call our mixin called border bordered
and we're going to set a border to the
top let's say we want that to be dotted
and one pixel and black and then we'll
also do border bottom and for that we'll
say Solid 2 pixels and black now we can
apply this to anything so let's let's
actually create
let's do h1 and for our h1 we'll do dot
bordered so we'll save that and now you
can see our h1 has the board and let's
actually put another heading in there
we'll put an h3 under the button and
I'll just say hello world okay and then
we'll just apply right here h3 and
that'll also get the bordered alright
I'll see what else let's look at let's
look at mix ins with parameters so I'm
going to create another one down here
and let's call this border - radius all
right and then this can actually take in
a parameter or more more than one if you
want but we're just going to have one
and it's going to be radius okay and it
needs this because it's a variable so
let's say border - radius and set that
to whatever's passed in okay so let's go
to let's say BTN for the button and
we'll say dot border-radius and we can
pass in a parameter let's say 10 pixels
save that and now you'll see the button
is rounded if we wanted to change this
and make it even more rounded we'll
change it to 30 and you can see that
applies all right so your mix-ins can
also have parameters so another thing we
can do is nest elements so what I'm
going to go to the HTML and create a ul
and let's give it a class or X let's
give it an ID of the menu alright and
then in here we'll have our allies and
we'll have we'll have our link and let's
just say link 1
link 2 and Link 3 alright so simple menu
now let's go to our les file and see I'm
going to try to stay away from the
bottom just to make sure you guys can
see this so let's go right here and we
know we have a ul with the ID of menu
all right so let's say for that we want
to say list-style:none we want to get
rid of the bullets and then we want to
style the li now normally what you would
do is ul menu Li so it'll be a whole
different style but with less we can
just we can nest these elements just
like we do in the HTML so in the HTML we
have all the allies are in the UL and
the a tags are in the allies so we can
set up our CSS just like that so let's
say Li and for this let's just do
padding 10 pixels 0 all right now this
is only going to apply to the allies
that are in here okay because it's
nested in there and then let's say for
the a tags those are inside the Li so we
could put that right here and let's just
do color and we'll say secondary color
and it's also get rid of the underlined
decoration and we'll set that to none
and let's say we want the hover what we
can do is we can just use an ampersand
and then a colon and then hover okay
instead of going down here and doing a
hover and all that stuff alright so
hover let's make the color we'll just
make it black all right so let's save
that and now you can see we have the
styling we have the list-style:none on
the UL the padding on the LI the color
and the text decoration on the a the a
tag and then black when we hover over it
okay so you can nest any styles you want
you could actually put for instance the
h1 and h3 you can put it inside the body
if you want it's all up to you on how
you want to struck
your CSS alright so what I want to do
now is I want to look at some functions
so if we look at the documentation here
we go to function reference I'm not
going to go over all of these but you
can see there's functions for Strings
for lists there's math functions all
types of stuff what I want to look at is
the I think it's in color definition or
color channels or is it color operations
right here so in color operations we
have this lighten and darken functions
and these are really cool because you
can take a color for instance the
primary color that we have up here and
if we have a certain style where we want
that to be darker or lighter we can do
that so what I want to do is go down to
the UL menu here and we're going to go
right here and give it a background
color so say background color and we're
going to set it to secondary color
alright now if we say that it's going to
give the secondary color as the
background which is the same color as
the link so we can't even see the text
so what we can do is we can take that
light and function so we'll say lighten
and we can pass in whatever color we
want in this case secondary color which
is that green and then a second
parameter of how much we want to lighten
it let's say 50% and now you can see
that it has that color but it's
lightened so that we can now see the
links alright and you can do the same
thing with darken now you see it's
darker alright so I think that's pretty
cool and then the last thing I want to
show you I'm going to keep that at
lighten the last thing I want to show
you is if we look at this this button
right here we have the primary color as
the background which is a bluish
purplish color and we have the text
manually set to white well if we go and
we change let's change the primary color
to something lighter let's just to three
C's and now it's a lighter color now
this would probably look better with
black text okay especially if this was
even lighter and instead of setting it
manually
we can create a couple mix-ins that will
look at it it'll see how dark our light
the color is and then apply the correct
color of text all right so let's go
right here and we'll say text color
mix-ins all right and then let's call it
will say dot text color and then it's
going to take in a parameter let's say
at a and then we'll say when and then
the condition so we're going to say when
lightness and then TAS in that argument
there when lightness is greater than or
equal to let's say 50% then we want to
set color to black all right and then
we're going to just copy this and put
this right here and then this is going
to be the same thing so it's going to be
less than 50% then the color is going to
be white and then down here where we
manually set the color we're going to
get rid of that so we actually just want
to get rid of that whole thing and then
just say text color we're calling the
mixin and then we want to pass in the
color of the background which is in this
case primary color all right so now
let's save it and reload and you'll see
that the text is black now if I set it
back to the dark blue and we save and go
back I don't see that should be white
what did I do wrong here
I'm an idiot I put quotes around these
shouldn't be quotes all right
let's save it and now the text is white
okay so it's going to see how darker
light the background is and reflect that
what the text should be alright guys so
I think we're going to stop it here
that's pretty much it for the basics if
you want to go deeper of course you
could look out I mean you can look at
every single function that's available
and all that but as far as the features
that are available we covered pretty
much what you need to know to start
using it alright so maybe later on down
the line we can create an actual theme
and implement less so thanks for
watching if you guys like this leave it
