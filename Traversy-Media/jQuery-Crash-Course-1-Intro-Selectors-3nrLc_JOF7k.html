jQuery in this course we're going to be
covering all the fundamentals of the
jquery javascript library now before we
get started I just want to go over a few
things before we jump into some code so
first of all I want to talk about what
jQuery actually is it's a small fast and
feature-rich javascript library and it
makes things a lot easier such as Dom
manipulation event handling Ajax and
much more and it allows us to create
extensive functionality with much less
code than if we were to just use regular
JavaScript alright so what you should
know before attempting this course is
HTML CSS and JavaScript ok you need to
know HTML because we're grabbing HTML
elements and we're using jQuery to
manipulate them to do different things
with them you need to know CSS because
all of the jQuery selectors are the same
as CSS selectors and then of course
JavaScript you need to know at least the
basics just to to know for instance how
to create a variable and what a variable
is an array things like that alright you
don't have to be a JavaScript whiz but
you should know at least the
fundamentals all right so if you don't
know these things I do have plenty of
videos on them if you want to go back
and check those out and then come back
and that would be fine
all right so we'll be breaking this
mini-course up into a few different
parts so we're going to start with
jQuery selectors and this is where
knowing CSS comes in handy as I said
they use the same selectors that CSS
does whether it's the element itself at
an ID class anything like that and then
we'll move on to event handling so Mouse
events form and input events and then
after that we'll talk about Dom
manipulation so we can add remove and
change things in the document object
model and then we'll also discuss some
really helpful methods that jQuery
offers to do various tasks we'll talk a
little bit about effects such as fade in
fade out slide up and slide down and
we'll also look at the animate
function and then finally we'll be
working with Ajax methods that jQuery
offers such as load get post and the
Ajax function itself alright so if you
like this course this mini course I
would suggest checking out my 10 project
JavaScript and jQuery course at edge'
wanax you'll be working with all the
stuff that we go over here and much more
and you get to build 10 different
projects ok right now I think it's only
around 19 bucks so it's well worth it
I'll put a link in the description and
that's it so without further ado let's
get started on selectors alright so
let's get started
on the basics and jQuery selectors now
in my browser I have jQuery comm open
and there's a couple ways you can use
jQuery you can go ahead and download it
from here and the latest version at this
time is three point one point zero you
can also download version two which has
a slightly different API and then
version one is only recommended if you
need compatibility on browsers like ie6
ie7 and eight which you know nobody
really uses anymore
so we're going to be using three point
one point zero all right now you can
download it here and you can include it
in your script you can just you know
download it into your folder but we're
not going to do that we're going to use
the CDN which is just an external link
now if you're building a production
project then you probably want to
include it within your application just
so you can use it without an internet
connection and so on but just for
simplicity we're going to use the CDN
alright so I don't know where is that
available okay so this is actually the
link right here that we need alright now
I have this empty folder jQuery crash
course and when I'm done with the course
I will upload it to github and I'll
include a link to that in the
description but basically what we want
to do is just create our first folder
which is going to be called selectors
and inside there we're going to have our
index.html
okay well go ahead and open that up I'm
using sublime text as my editor but of
course you can use whatever you like so
we're going to put some standard HTML
tags in here and for the title will say
jQuery crash course and this is
selectors now we're going to build kind
of a really simple UI just we're going
to have a header and then just an area
to do all of our output alright so let's
go ahead and include jQuery so we're
going to put a script tag here with a
source and we're going to dot that we
want to grab that and paste it in okay
that's the CDN and that's all we have to
do to be able to use jQuery all right
now what we're going to do is go into
the body and we're just going to build
out the UI real quick we'll have a
header I mean this isn't needed but I
think it just makes things look a little
cleaner so in the header we'll just put
an h1 will say jQuery crash course
alright and then under that let's put a
div give it an ID of container I
apologize for that bang and that's my
son running around upstairs all right
now everything we do is going to go in
this container well as far as our HTML
our JavaScript is going to go down here
we're going to create a custom script
tag there for us to put all of our
jQuery in all right so let's save that
and then we'll open it up in chrome or
whatever browser you want to use and we
just want to style it just a little bit
okay I'm not going to go overboard I
just want to add a little bit of styling
to it and where is it
right there alright so we're just going
to put this right in the header will put
our style tags if you want you can put
it in a separate CSS file
just want to have everything in one file
so let's start with the body so we'll
set I'm going to set the font size to be
slightly bigger than usual so I'm going
to set it to 17 pixels we're going to
set the font family to Arial and let's
set the background to light gray and
then I'm going to set the line height to
1.5 m okay so that's the body now for
the header I'll set a background it's
going to be a dark background
so we'll say the text color will be
white I'm going to give it a padding of
20 pixels and we want everything aligned
to the center okay and then let's set a
border bottom of 4 pixels and we're
going to make that black and solid all
right and then finally we'll add a
margin bottom of 10 pixels okay last
thing is going to be the container
that's where all of our output will go
so I'm going to set a width to 90
percent it's going to be fluid or
responsive and set the margin to auto to
push everything in the middle and then
just a padding of 10 pixels all right so
let's take a look at that okay so
nothing too fancy but you know we have
some padding here and we made the font a
little bigger to make it a little more
readable all right so enough of this CSS
crap let's get into jQuery now we're
going to be talking about selectors so
we need some elements to work with I'm
going to create an h1 here and we're
going to give it an ID of heading 1
okay and in here we'll just say heading
one and then let's put in a paragraph so
we'll say P we'll give it an ID of power
one and I'm just going to grab some
dummy content to put in here so I'll
paste that in and you'll notice that I
do have a span around just a couple
words here okay we're going to work with
that later and then what I'm going to do
is copy that h1 and that paragraph and
then just put paste it in again and I'm
going to change this to h2 and power too
but I'm also going to make them classes
okay we'll change this to heading two
all right now let's go down to our
script tags here and I want to use a
selector to let's say grab the headings
alright so Jake with jQuery we use money
sign that represents jQuery and in here
inside quotes it could be single quotes
or double quotes usually you see double
quotes but with myself I like to work
with single quotes all right so that's
usually what I do by default even if I
try to use double quotes I'll end up
switching over in the middle of the
script to single quotes so I'm just
going to start with single quotes so
let's say we want all the h1 so we can
put an h1 and then we can do something
with it in this case I'm just going to
call dot Hyde which is a jQuery method
alright so if we go ahead and let's
first of all run it without that I'll
comment it out and you'll see we have
our two headings and paragraphs now if
we say h1 hyde and we reload now you can
see that all the H ones are gone even
the one that was in the header so if we
want to target a certain heading we can
use its for instance its ID we have
heading one here
so we can say h1 and then we're going to
use the number sign for an ID and then
heading one so now if we save that and
we
you can see that only the heading one
has been selected and is hidden alright
and I'm just going to comment this out I
want to kind of leave all the code for
you guys to have as a reference so I'm
also going to put that back without the
ID like that and I'll just comment it
out okay now of course we could also use
classes so if we want to grab heading to
that as a class so we'll say H 2 and
then classes are represented with dots
so we're saying H 2 class heading 2 and
we want to hide that
so we reload and that doesn't work oh
it's an H 1 there we go all right now
see how we have H 1 dot heading 2 we
actually don't need this element we
could just say heading 2 and save that
and you'll see it's still hidden all
right so now even if we put a paragraph
with the class of heading 2 that would
still be in effect that would still hide
okay now we can use certain selectors
and then use inner elements as well so
see how we have a paragraph here and
then inside that paragraph we have a
span so what we could do is we could say
paragraph and then span and let's say
let's do something else we'll change the
color we'll use the CSS method alright
and I'm going to go over these types of
methods later on right now I'm just
focusing on the actual selectors but CSS
will take in a value or a property let's
say color and we'll change it to red
okay so if we go ahead and save that
reload now you can see that all the
spans that are within the paragraph are
red if I were to take that span and put
it outside of a paragraph you'll see
that it's not red if we were to remove
the P here and just say span then it
would because now
all fans no matter where they are will
be read alright I'm just going to take
that out all right
now we can even get more specific and
use some of the css3 selectors what I'm
going to do is up here still in the
container just tab that over in the
container we're going to put in a UL and
let's just give this give it an ID of
list and put in a couple L eyes here
I'll say list item copy that
okay so now we have this list to work
with now let's say that we want to grab
this first list item okay so what we
could do is we can say li if we want to
be more specific we could say ul with
the ID of list and then Li and what we
can do is we can put a colon here and
then say first okay and then we'll use
the CSS method here and it'll say color
red whoops
save that reload and now you can see
that the first item of that list is now
red okay at the same time we can do last
which I'm sure you can project what
that's going to do so last and we'll
change this to green and reload and now
you'll see that the last item in the
list is green okay we also have even
even an odd if you want to target those
even in odd elements so let's just copy
that and then we'll change this to even
and instead of the color let's do
background-color okay we'll set that to
let's say yellow save that reload and
now every even element is yellow all
right now of course we can also do odd
so let's change that to odd and for the
background color we can also use
hexadecimal values so we'll put a light
gray all right now what if we want to
choose let's say every third item we
could do that using an nth value or an
enter so let's copy that and we're going
to change this to nth - child and that's
going to take into parameter we're going
to say 3 n now you can put all kinds of
formulas in here but I'm not going to
really get into that that's more css3
stuff so for this one let's change the
property to list style and we'll set
this to none and what that will do is
it'll remove the bullets
okay so we'll save that reload and now
you can see that every third doesn't
have a bullet okay so we can pretty much
target these items however we want so
now what I want to do is move on to
inputs so up here I'm going to put in an
input and this is going to have a type
of button and we'll set a value of just
say fun one what input doesn't need an
ending tag all right and then we'll put
a submit type
and let's put a text type okay that
doesn't need a value all right so if we
reload now we have a button a regular
button of submit button and a text so we
can actually use the type attribute as a
selector so for instance let's say let's
say that we want to grab all of the
button types so what we could do is say
: button and then we'll say dot hide
okay so if we reload that you'll see
that the button is now hidden it could
also take submit which I should probably
change the text will say so we met
reload and now that's gone okay and then
finally if we want the text now the text
is gone so you can use that as a
selector as well now we can also work
with attributes as selectors so what I'm
going to do is up here I'm going to
create a couple links okay so let's say
this goes to google.com and then this
one will go to yahoo.com okay so we got
two simple links throughout reload that
and let's say we want to change all of
the elements that have an href attribute
okay we want to use that as a selector
so what we can do is in here we'll put
in some brackets and we'll say href and
then let's do dot CSS and we'll set
color to red all right so let's see what
that does we reload and now both links
are now red now we can take it a step
further and we can actually talk
get the actual value of an attribute so
let's say we want we want the element
with the href value of yahoo.com so
we'll go in here we're going to put a
and then some brackets and then we'll
say href equals HTTP yahoo.com
and then we'll just use our CSS method
here and we'll say color green so now if
we go and we reload you'll see that the
yahoo link is now green okay so we can
target attributes as well as the
attribute values and then we also have
the asterisk which will grab everything
okay so if we were to say pop that in
there and we'll say dot hide and we
reload everything is gone okay because
this is just a wild-card for anything
all right I'm going to comment that out
all right so hopefully this helps you
with understanding what types of
selectors we can use okay we can use the
element themselves we can use IDs
classes we can nest selectors we can use
the css3 pseudo selectors all right so
plenty of ways to do it to grab certain
elements all right so that's it for
selectors now we're going to move on to
events</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
