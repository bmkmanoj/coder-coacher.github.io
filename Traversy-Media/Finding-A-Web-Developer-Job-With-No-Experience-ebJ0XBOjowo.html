tutorials for today we're going to talk
a little bit about getting a job as a
web developer with no field experience
alright because we all know that
traditionally you need experience to get
a job but you need a job to get
experience which is a little messed up
so I'm going to give you some tips on
things you can do to show an employer
that you do have experience in
programming just not working for someone
else
alright I'm actually a perfect example
of that that type of person because I
had never finished college I never had
an actual job in the industry working
for someone else's company but I had
plenty of experience I could just direct
an employer to my youtube channel and
they could see exactly what I do now
just because I haven't had actual
experience working for another company
doesn't mean that I don't know what I'm
talking about
I've seen things and had experiences in
this industry that I can share and I've
also done a lot of research on the
subject all right not to mention I've
been on the hiring side of this process
alright so let's go ahead and get
started now the first thing I want to
talk about is the question that you
probably ask yourself that I've asked
myself over and over and is that are you
ready so you've been programming for a
while we've watched plenty of travesty
media tutorials and you've created some
stuff but you don't feel completely
secure that you know what you need to
know that to have an actual job and have
some responsibility at another company
well let me tell you that absolutely
everyone feels that way
no matter how much you know there's
always going to be more that you don't
know new technologies are released daily
and everyone has to learn them so if
you're looking for a front-end developer
job and you don't know what's a angular
or react or some other framework that's
absolutely fine even if the company
works with angular you see if you have a
basic understanding of javascript in
HTML you'll learn it pretty quickly
alright so I would say as long as you
know HTML CSS and a bit of JavaScript
and some of the basic programming
fundamentals then you're ready to start
applying as a front-end developer
alright so for back-end stuff I'd
suggest that you learn at least one
stack
so whether it's PHP MySQL on the lamp
stack or nodejs
and the mean stack that's plenty to
start applying alright so one of the
most important things in this whole
process is having confidence so don't
don't use dealt yourself it this is
actually something that I struggled with
a lot wondering if I should even be
programming I didn't grow up in front of
a computer I didn't start programming
until I was in my mid-20s so I realized
that after time I realized that you
don't all you need to know is the basic
fundamentals of web development and you
can quickly learn almost anything all
right and the job that hire you is going
to know that you're at you're at an
entry level and they're going to give
you some leeway for that that learning
timeframe all right so like I said
confidence is important but you should
also know your skillset you should know
what types of jobs to apply for all
right so it's good to know what type of
developer or designer you are and then
you can search for the right jobs
alright so there's basically three types
of web developers so the first is a
front-end web developer or sometimes
calls it a web designer these are people
that build UIs and front-end websites
they usually have a good eye for design
and layout they know HTML CSS and
usually some JavaScript so they can
build websites for small businesses
individuals anyone that wants
informational brochure type websites and
most businesses do then you have
server-side programmers who are the
people that aren't so good with design
and presentation but they're great with
logical programming databases things
like that they use languages like PHP
Python nodejs rails etc usually they
pair up with a designer or front-end
developer and the designer will create
the HTML layout and then they'll create
the logic and the functionality all
right then you have the people that can
do all of the above and that's a full
stack developer so these are the guys or
girls that can do it all they can build
a nice UI and they can also make it work
on the
back end all right this is the most
valuable type of developer because they
can essentially do the job of two people
all right so these are the main three
types of developers and you should
really try to put yourself in one of
these groups all right now that doesn't
mean that you're going to stay there if
you're good with PHP and MySQL but you
can't build a UI it doesn't have to stay
that way just keep at it learn more you
know learn more about design and layout
and you'll get there all right so before
you go and apply to 600 different jobs
make sure that you put some kind of
resume together now you want this in
multiple forms you should have a paper
or physical version but you should also
have a web space where you can direct
employers to see more information about
you and what you've done all right so if
you have a website where you can put
this stuff that's great if not go and
register a domain name and get something
up it can be one landing page with and
make it very simple in fact you do want
to be simple because chances are if you
have ten pages of text they're not going
to take the time to read it they'll
simply move on all right so you want to
have some specific information you want
a brief introduction of yourself who you
are where you're from maybe a little bit
of background but not too much and like
I said you want to keep this simple now
if it's possible I would strongly
suggest that you make some kind of video
and put that at the top of your resume
that way people they're not just going
to read about who you are but they can
actually see it okay they can see a
personality they can see if you're going
to if you're going to mesh well with the
other employees of the job all right so
it makes you a real person rather than
just an application alright so if you
don't like being on video like myself
you can just do a quick PowerPoint
presentation and just do some bullet
points similar to what I'm doing now all
right you also want a you want a list of
all your skills okay most likely all of
you will have HTML and CSS if you have
experience with sass or blasts put those
down any front front or back end
languages and frameworks put those down
anything that you can think anything
that you think you can use in a project
all right I suggest using our including
5 to 10 projects if possible obviously
if you haven't done 5 to 10 projects you
can't but even if you have your own
personal website stuff like that you can
put and I'm going to go through through
that the second things you can put up as
experience alright I'd also suggest
including a link to your github account
if you have one even if you have two or
three repositories or even if you've
just pulled from other people's
repositories it lets the employer know
that you're serious about coding just
having a github account alright and this
is this isn't as true for designers all
right so this is what I would suggest at
a bare minimum if you do have
educational credentials and degrees put
those but I think today employers are
more focused on what you've done and
what you built as opposed to where you
went to school like I said I didn't even
finish Community College and to tell you
the truth I learned more from online
courses in YouTube than I did in school
when it comes to web development
programming alright so just because you
haven't really had any client experience
where someone paid you for a job doesn't
mean that you don't have real experience
alright so if you even just learned HTML
and CSS I'm sure you have stuff that
you've created so you could throw that
up on a sub domain and put that on your
resume alright even if the resume the
one direct resume website that you're
currently having them view you could
even use that okay you can create a
photo gallery of your personal pictures
you could create a simple application
with JavaScript
maybe a slideshow or something how you
could even use one of my tutorial
projects tweak it customize it and put
that up alright so another thing you
could do is build a website for your
family and friends so even if they won't
pay you do it for free if your brother
owns a construction company or something
like that build a site for it if he has
one that's really shitty just redo it
and put that on your resume alright you
could also do some volunteer work for
places in your community so things like
churches mom-and-pop shops homeless
shelters nonprofits not only do you get
great
means but you also get to help help some
people out especially places like
homeless shelters they're offering their
time and work for free so they deserve
it the most another thing you could do
is contribute to open source so most
open source projects allow you to add
some functionality you know submit it
for a review and if you can say that you
added a piece of functionality to a
popular framework or something that's
really impressive to employers all right
so this gives you a huge amount of
experience working with other
individuals and teams which is priceless
all right so find a project that you're
interested in and if you think you have
something to offer even just starting
out if you want to do some bug testing
or improve the documentation something
like that and then work your way up all
right now if you do any of these
volunteer work or for family or friends
make sure that you get a good
testimonial and feedback especially if
they don't pay you it's a really good
reward to give you that feedback that
you can put on your website and also if
if employees can contact them for a
reference now when you build your
website or online resume you want to
choose a look in a field that you can
use across multiple platforms all right
so choose a brand you just choose a
color scheme something that best
represents you and what you do so two or
three colors
well that will go well together blue is
a really popular color because it's a
trusting color there's actually been
experiments on this kind of thing I
guess blue and green are trusting and
then reds and oranges can turn people
off I guess it's like a warning color or
something I don't have a lot of
experience in this kind of stuff
branding coloreds and all that but just
from what I've read also you don't have
to but you might want to create a logo
or have someone else create a logo for
you this isn't required but it shows
people that you care about how you're
perceived and that you're professional
all right next thing is social media you
want to create professional pages on all
the popular social media website
you may already have accounts for
personal your your friends and your
personal life but I suggest creating one
for professional reasons too so even if
you have a regular Facebook account
create a Facebook page a branded page
you can keep your current profile and
just create a new page so you can create
a Twitter account where you can list all
of your new projects stuff like that you
want to create a LinkedIn account for
networking with other developers and
designers create a YouTube account and
upload a couple videos if you put a
video on your resume website put that up
and maybe some basic tutorials something
like that alright now when you create
these social media pages you want to
stay consistent with your brand so if
your website is blue and grey keep that
scheme for your cover art on YouTube and
Facebook okay put your logo as well now
you'll want to choose a username that
you can use across all platforms and if
you can keep that same exact name for
Twitter Facebook YouTube and that's
great there's a really helpful site
called name check comm that will search
across the internet for domain names as
well as social media accounts to see
where the name is taken and where it's
not alright so this next one networking
was actually a really tough one for me
I'm kind of antisocial and I hate Neph
networking I hate meetups and anything
like that social anxiety is something
that I've struggled with and I think a
lot of programmers have as well back in
the day programmers just sat in the
corner by themselves and created simple
things but with the advancement of
technology now we need to work in big
teams and collaborate have online
meetings and so on so you'll have to
network a bit to become successful
alright so the first one is an easy one
for people like me networking online
usually doesn't involve face-to-face
relations you can join a group you know
post some some helpful posts and
questions build up a reputation help
people out even you to by network with
others on YouTube you know you build an
audience and you interact with them as
well as other youtubers so you might
just find someone that works for a
company that's hiring and they can give
you a good recommendation another thing
is that you can do for networking and
hackathons so these are a really fun way
to get to know people with the same
interests as you you can also win prizes
and money and trips which is also a plus
you'll be put on you'll probably be put
on a team to code with others and you'll
network get some good experience excuse
me you can search sites like aim with
Angel hack hack early hackathon IO and
you can find these hackathons near you
all right another one is meetups so
meetups and other communities are a
great great tool for learning and
meeting other programmers so you can
find meetups at websites like meetup
calm as well as all the social media
networks alright another thing you can
do is host your own Meetup
so you could pick a technology that you
know about Planet find a location and
post it online all right even if you get
two or three people as a start and then
we have conventions and conferences
which are another place you can find
developers and employers conferences
like nodejs interactive web stock dev
nexus there's a ton of them and you can
search for the ones the ones near you
alright so you've built up your resume
you have a website a video all your
social media accounts now you've only
prepared to start applying alright so
you can go right to the companies in
your area which may be a good idea but
you could also search online now you
want to make sure you're searching for
the right jobs
anything in the with the word entry or
junior is going to be something you want
to look at okay stay away from senior
and where it's like experienced but
don't be afraid to apply applying isn't
going to hurt you want to put yourself
out there all right so let's take a look
at the different types of job websites
and resources available all right so
first we have standard job boards we've
all
career builder indeed job calm places
like that companies post positions and
people apply so these are not only
directed at tech jobs or web web dev
jobs you can search for any type of jobs
at these sites
alright so employers create accounts
post positions we apply either on-site
or at another site alright so next we
have portfolio or profile based website
these are where you can go and sign up
as a designer or a developer you can
post your profile and portfolio put some
projects up so these are sites where
people looking for work would go to find
you and a lot of the times employers of
companies go to these sites alright so
some examples would be crop comm kr Opie
sort folio calm and Envato Studio all
right then we have startup hire site so
these are where startup companies can go
and they can post a profile for
positions that they need to fill now
these usually aren't high-paying jobs
but really good thing about this is that
you'll be one of the first employees and
that could be extremely beneficial in
the future alright if you are especially
if the company you know really takes off
so some examples of these sites would be
angel list Stoppers and startup hire
calm alright lastly we have freelancing
websites and these are a little
different because you're not usually
applying for a permanent position but
but to do a single project and these are
sites where people and companies go to
post specific projects that they want
done alright it could be a completely
custom e-commerce application from
scratch with a budget of 50 grand or a
$25 WordPress template hack or something
like that
alright so these sites are usually more
in-depth than simple job boards and this
is actually where I got my start from I
used of what was called odesk.com back
then which is now
what is it upwork.com alright so when
you start out you'll be working for
basically crap until you get some
reviews and feedback and then you know
you'll start to get better jobs better
paying jobs and this is really good for
experience that you can put on your
resume you can get simple little jobs
you can put on your resume and show that
to a company that you're you're applying
to
alright so that's going to be it for

everything but hopefully there's
something in there that can help you
