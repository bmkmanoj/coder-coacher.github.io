building an ember app so far we have our
tasks M tasks application where we can
we can read our tasks coming from the
firebase database and we also have a
forum where we can add them alright so
now what I want to do is we want to be
able to edit these as well ok so what we
can do is create an edit view I'm sorry
an edit route and an edit controller
alright so let's go ahead and stop this
okay and I'm going to say ember G routes
and we're gonna say tasks slash edit
all right and then we're also going to
do ember G controller tasks / edit
all right and we'll go back to ember
serve okay now we should have under
controllers you see we have edit under
routes tasks we have edit but we want to
go to our router okay and you can see
that it did include it under tasks now
the edits route is going to also have to
have an ID it's going to have to know
the ID because it needs to know which
which tasks to edit so what we can do is
add in a second parameter here and we're
going to define a path and that path is
gonna be slash edit slash and then we
want to use a colon and then to do
underscore ID underscore ID okay so this
is what the URL should look like slash
edit slash whatever that idea is slash
ID I'm sorry slash to do ID alright so
and you know what let's also change this
to this dart resource ok so we have a
resource of tasks and then we have a
couple routes under it so we'll save
that and that should be all we need to
do in that file
now what I want to do is go to the to
dues template so under template
I'm sorry task template so click that
and what we're going to do is we have
the title here we want to wrap it in a
link okay so we're going to use the link
to helper whoops just a link to and we
want it to go to tasks dots edits
okay and we need to put the end tag back
here I know it's a little confusing
because there's so many curly braces but
link to okay now again we need to have
an ID when we go to the Edit URL or the
edit route so we're going to just go
here and specify a task dot ID save that
or giving we're getting an error because
this ending link to should have a slash
like that
okay so now we have a link on each title
if I click it
you can see where it's gonna go with the
bottom they are task / edit / and then
the ID but nothing's gonna happen
because we don't have anything in that
template remember since it's under tasks
this stuff is also going to show alright
so what we're gonna do is go to we want
to go to our templates and then we want
to go to the Edit Todd HVS alright and
just to test things out let's replace
this with edit tasks and save and reload
okay so now if I click this
you should see at a task
all right know what guys actually made a
mistake in the route I put to do ID and
this ass actually has to match the
resource which is task ID all right so
let's save that
all right so now if we click my first
task we get edit tasks all right okay so
what we want to happen is just like when
we click new task we have this form open
we want that to happen with this as well
so let's go to our edit template and
actually let's go to the new template
and we're going to copy everything
that's in it and then just paste it in
the Edit because it's essentially the
same all we need to do is change the
value attribute okay we actually want to
change it to model dot title okay this
one will be model date and then the
description will be model description
alright so in one more thing the action
here you see we have the button action
add task we're going to change that to
edit task and then we also want to pass
the ID all right so we want to say model
don't ID all right so let's go ahead and
reload that
and now if I click this you can see we
get that form we get the title in the
description prefilled if I click second
we get second so that's exactly what we
want now to take care of actually
updating we have to we have to create
that edit task action in the controller
so if we go to controllers and then
tasks edit j/s and let's actually copy
what we have in the new okay so we have
our actions add tasks let's just copy
that okay you'll put that right here and
we just want to change this to edit
tasks and let's see it's going to take
in our ID and title except this we're
gonna get from model dot title this one
will be model model dot description and
model dot date
all right and then instead of this
actually let's just get rid of that
okay so first thing we need to find the
records so we'll see this dot store this
dot store dot fine record and let's see
we want to put in our task model and
find by the ID and this shouldn't have a
dollar sign okay and then we're going to
tack on to this dot then and this is
where we're going to put our function
alright and it's going to pass in the
task as a attribute our parameter okay
and then we can do task dot set and
we're going to want to set title to
title
description dates and that's gonna be
new date and then we'll pass in the date
variable alright and then same thing
we're gonna save just like we did here
except this time it's just gonna be
actually you know what this needs to go
inside of there so I'm gonna copy and
then just copy that get rid of it and
we're gonna get rid of this okay and
then inside here we're gonna say task
dot save all right and then I want to
just redirect us I want the close to the
close to form I want the form to close
so to do that we're actually going to go
up here and I'm gonna create a variable
called self and set that to this all
right that way down here we can say self
dot transition - which is is it's just a
method to do a redirect and we want to
go to tasks
all right so it looks good let's save it
okay
reload all right so now if we go to my
first task let's change the titles
change the first to one st and it'll
change this as well okay and then the
date
submit
and there it is my first task you can
see that that changed as well so now we
can we have full edit functionality so
the last thing I want to do in this
video is we want to be able to delete
these as well alright so let's go to let
me close all these we just want this our
tasks view or task template and let's
put a delete link let's just we'll say
link
actually no I want to let's do a button
so button and then we're going to give
it an action of delete task and we need
to pass the ID so we're gonna say task
dot ID okay that's our button let's also
give it a class b TN and b TN - danger
which will make it red stay delete
okay so now we need to create the delete
action and that's going to be in the
task CAS controller okay which we
haven't added anything to yet so actions
and this is delete tasks and that's
going to be passed in an ID
and I'm gonna say this dot store dot
line record ask passing the ID and then
we're going to do dot then function will
take in task
and let's see now we're gonna do task
dot delete record and then we need to
save
all right
and yeah I think that's it we don't need
to redirect since we're already on the
task page so let's try that out okay so
I'll go delete and there it goes make
sure it stays gone and it's gone if we
look at the database you can see we only
have one in there all right so we now
have a full crud application we can
create read update and delete now I may
make another video or possibly two so we
can implement so things something like
sorting and search filter things like
that all right so that's it for now and
