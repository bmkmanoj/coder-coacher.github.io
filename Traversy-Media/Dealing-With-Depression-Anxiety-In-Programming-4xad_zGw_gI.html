kind of video so I want to mention
before we start that if any of you guys
just watch for us strictly tech content
educational stuff and you don't really
want to know or you don't really want to
listen to personal development type
stuff or self help please move on to the
next video there's a specific group of
subscribers and viewers that I want to
talk to and that's people not just
programmers but anybody that has any
kind of issues with depression or
anxiety or ADHD or any of the hundreds
of mental health issues out there and
not only that but anyone that's
interested in hearing a little bit about
my life story and some of the struggles
that I've went through alright and this
is at any level you don't have to be
clinically depressed or anything like
that just anyone going through a hard
time in their life and I know that you
know 99.9% of the world of the people in
the world have gone through hard times
I'm almost to a hundred thousand
subscribers which completely blows my
mind but anyway I know that I've helped
a lot of you guys with programming and
web development and even getting a job
in some cases and that's heat that's a
huge reward for me yes I do make money
at this but knowing how many people I've
helped Trump's that big time so I
figured that with this audience that I
have maybe I could also help some some
people with personal issues that I faced
myself and have had experience with some
of them I've overcame and some of them I
still deal with every single day all
right now I give this this video tour
programmers because that's what most of
you guys are or striving to be but not
only that programming and web
development can be a very tough job not
physically but rough on your mental
state and in many cases it can be very
lonely I myself work in a finished
basement every day and I'm all alone
every single day and even though I have
all this cool shit you guys have
probably seen mice my setup tour and all
that and I'm making money it can still
start to feel kind of like a prison or a
dungeon with no social contact until I'm
done and then I can go
upstairs and hang out with my wife and
kids and I'm sure there's a lot of you
that are doing what I'm doing and don't
have a family and I can't even imagine
how tough that could be all right as
many of us are introverts by nature
programming is is it's an attractive job
for people that aren't particularly
social butterflies it can be very
isolated not as much as it was you know
20 years ago because now a lot of us
work in teams you know with the
advancements of technology some of us
work in big teams opposed to being a
solo programmer but some of us still
work alone every day including myself
all right now I'm not only making this
video for you guys but also for myself
you guys know you guys know me as Brad
the instructor on YouTube but that's a
very small part of my life as a whole
and every day you know you guys start to
feel more like real friends or even
family in some cases and I thought you
deserve to know some things about me
that I've been hesitant to talk about
for those of you that are here just for
attack again that's fine it may not be
of interest to you but I do know from
interacting with a lot of you guys that
you you actually do want to know more
about my life and who I am which
completely baffles me because when I
started this I didn't think anyone would
give a shit and give an even give me the
time of day to listen to or even
understand what I'm talking about when I
do these tutorials alright so I do want
to get into some life tips to help you
guys out but before I do that I just
want to say that for myself I've
struggled with depression almost my
whole life I've always had social
anxiety I had trouble making friends
when I was a kid and I finally when I
finally did they were the wrong friends
to make I ended up hanging out with
troubled kids that weren't the best
people for me to be hanging out with but
for some reason that's what I was
attracted to all right years later as a
teenager I started getting into trouble
I started dabbling in drugs weed alcohol
and then I moved on to pain pills I've
had issues issues with opiates for years
and it just beat me down music God
physically mentally and physically and
I'm not going to go into total detail on
that because I've already said enough to
invite the the judgemental trolls to
start posting stupid comments but 15
years ago if he told me that I would be
a programmer and even more unbelievably
unbelievabl a teacher I'd say you were
crazy I mean I've always had a knack for
technology but I never really did
anything with it my friends growing up
didn't even know how to turn on a
computer I didn't hang out with the you
know the quote/unquote smart kids I'm
sure a lot of you are scratching your
heads because you probably thought that
I grew up as some kind of nerd in front
of a computer which is far from the
truth I didn't get into programming
until after I had my daughter about 11
years ago when I was around 25
okay I'm 35 now I completely changed my
life around I met my wife we had a kid
and I stopped hanging out with the wrong
people and I became a totally different
person I grew up basically and like I
said I always had a knack for technology
so I did start exploring that and I
ended up starting a little computer
repair business and at the same time
going to Community College for computer
science I ended up taking an HTML course
and a Java course and while I didn't
really learn anything from school it did
open a door of interest for coding and
creating things so I ended up dropping
out of school and teaching myself web
design and development using tutorials
and online courses blog posts videos
like I do now and that's one of the
reasons I do this is because this is how
I learned so I would like to help other
people just like someone helped me so
once I learned enough about web design
and development I integrated those
services into my computer business I
don't want to spend too much time on
myself but long story short I ended up
having a company asked me to create some
online courses and they really liked
them the students really liked them and
I've been doing that ever since
ok a lot of you know that I do courses
for a company called edge wanax
which is a phenomenal company they've
been really great to me
and I'm very grateful for them so I
stopped doing the computer repair
business because honestly I think it's
kind of a dying industry I also started
growing my youtube channel a couple
years ago which has gained a lot of
traction and I'm eternally grateful for
all of you guys all right without you
guys this you know this would be nothing
so you guys make this channel alright so
let's talk a little bit about impostor
syndrome and if you don't know what that
is I would highly recommend that you
look it up I think those are a really
good TED talk on this basically what it
means is that it's when you kind of feel
like a fraud like you don't belong
somewhere and this plays a huge part in
my experience and it plays a huge part
in depression and anxiety I think it's a
huge issue for anyone like me people
that didn't grow up programming we
weren't progeny kids that had a natural
ability to write full programs if you
are one of those types of people god
bless you that's awesome but with my
background and hell even how I look
sometimes I feel like I don't belong in
this this programming world I'm covered
in tattoos I power lift I swear like a
truck driver
and honestly I'm uncomfortable around a
lot of other programmers I feel like I
don't know that I'm not as smart in some
ways so I also didn't get good grades in
school I'm horrible at math which I
think a lot of people are mistaken and
they think you have to be a math whiz to
be a programmer which is definitely not
the case unless you're you're writing
complex algorithms and you're getting
real you know into the really nerdy
stuff but unless you're doing that it's
not the case at all I suck at math I
have problems helping my my daughter on
it with her homework she's in fourth
grade and I know I blame Common Core for
a lot of that because it absolutely
sucks in my opinion so one thing that I
want you guys to think about is think of
how you think of me all right and I'm
saying
it's because I know a lot of you have
praised me like I'm some kind of genius
that stores all these languages and
frameworks and my infinite brain and I'm
somehow superior to you and that is just
that's complete bullshit so you know if
you're one of those people that thinks
that just understand that I actually
feel this way like like you know the
imposter syndrome way so that should
tell you something that should tell you
that what you think about yourself isn't
always the truth it's your inner critic
trying to beat you down and make you
feel less than you really are
all right all you really need is passion
and I have a ton of passion for this
stuff I could you know I could learn
anything in programming and web
development and be absolutely enthralled
and you know want to learn more and
that's all you need if you have that
then you I mean I know this kind of
sounds like a like a self-help book or
something but you could do anything if
you have that passion for it all right
and don't let anybody tell you anything
different especially your inner critic
so what are some things that you guys
can do to kind of lighten your load and
help combat any kind of depression so
first you want to get out more go
outside even if you have nowhere to go
just go for a walk and get some sunlight
and some fresh air if you're a full-time
web developer or programmer unless
you're actually writing code outside I
can guarantee you that you're not
getting enough sunlight and sunlight has
essential vitamins that can have can
help your mood also be more social for
some people this is easy but for some
such as myself this is very very hard I
often feel like I don't know to talk
about my mind goes blank and I just feel
like an idiot sometimes it's depending
on who you're talking to
it's something that we have to get over
I'm not a therapist so I don't want to
say too much on this stuff and give any
bad advice but I'm just speaking from
experience
all right you also want to try to eat
right eat healthy it's very important
when it comes to your health and how you
feel both physically
and mentally you want to get enough
sleep I struggle with this myself I fall
asleep really late and then I get up
really early I sleep maybe five six
hours a night six to eight is what's
recommended though more towards eight
all right now I'm not going to push
therapy on anyone and everyone that's
something that only you know or
something that only you can figure out
but it doesn't hurt to try it doesn't
mean that you're crazy or you're
clinically depressed it just gives you
someone to talk to and someone to unload
all your issues on and get some really
good feedback okay watching videos like
this or reading books does help a little
but it's not the same as actually you
know going to therapy and talking things
out all right now talking to friends and
family can help but a professional knows
what types of things to work on and how
to better target your specific issues
all right anyone at all can benefit from
counseling and therapy in my opinion so
please don't feel ashamed or that
something's wrong with you all right and
if you're having a difficult time you
may want to explore with medications
anti-depression antidepressants
anti-anxiety ADHD medications and so on
now I know this is starting to sound
like a self-help video which I guess
that is kind of what it is but try to
look at the positives in your life it's
easy to dwell on the negative shit that
we face every day and it can be a kind
of a relief to verbalize it to other
people and complain but overall it's
hurting you you're going to attract more
negative energy into your life so every
time you have a negative thought try and
replace it with something good in your
life if you're down about let's say not
having money think of the stuff that you
do have okay you have a place to live
you have food to eat a bed to sleep on
appreciate those things because not
everyone has that all right and try to
understand that things could always be
worse and they are worse for many other
people I actually do I like to listen to
a little bit of the self-help stuff I
like Wayne Dyer
which he's passed away now but he has a
ton of great content on self-help and
also spirituality not religion but
spirituality alright and there's there's
a lot of quotes and sayings of his that
I like and one of them is to whenever
you get a negative thought in your mind
always ask yourself if that thought is
helpful to you in any way shape or form
if it's not then what's the point of
thinking it all it's going to do is is
bring you down and bring more negative
and negativity into your life now I
should have mentioned this earlier but I
do have an autistic son who's seven
years old and he's nonverbal he doesn't
talk he also has a severe chromosome
issue and we still don't know if he's
going to be able to have any kind of
normal life or if he's always going to
have to have to have someone take care
of them all right and that's a huge
cause of depression and sadness and
worry for me and my wife you know I've
never been the type of person to cry
over anything but when it comes to to
him all bets are off and what I try to
do is just look at the bright side of
everything he's not terminally ill you
know there's kids out there with cancer
that have a year left to live you know
things that are much worse than than
what he has he's happy he's lovable he's
just a friggin awesome kid and I'm lucky
to be his dad so this is an example of
something that is very hard to deal with
but you have to find the good in all
situations no matter how bad they are
alright or else you're just going to let
it drive you crazy
alright so I hope this isn't too long
for you guys this is the last slide I
promise now writing code can actually be
very therapeutic and very healthy and I
know for me when I'm stressed out about
family stuff or money or health issues
and so on programming is kind of an
escape it's a huge relief because I get
to focus all of my mind onto what I'm
doing and programming in general just
come to me down okay and I'm sure a lot
of you feel that way as well but you
can't do nothing else in your life
but write code
and stare at a computer screen and when
I say when I say programming I also mean
design stuff if you're if you do graphic
design anything that where you're
looking at a computer screen all day I'm
sure many of you know that after a while
you can get severely burned out and I
know programming isn't a physical job
and some other people may tell you it's
a cushy job and yes
physically it's not you know it's not
like construction or something like that
but when your brain is running at full
speed for 10 or 12 hours a day and not
thinking about anything else except for
the code in front of you it does
something to you or to many of us and it
kind of disconnects us from the world
and this can this this can be you know
this can lead into a depression
so here's some other things that may
help you expand and enjoy you know other
things aside from programming so for me
what brings me out of that daze or that
funk is starting is spending time with
my family I have a wife and two kids and
those are the people that I want to be
around some of you may not have kids or
may not have a significant other and
that's fine spend some time with your
mother or father siblings or even just
friends all right it really doesn't
matter just be around other people so
you should also find another hobby
outside of technology or at least
outside of looking at a screen building
pcs a gaming pcs is another passion of
mine which i think is much different
from coding because it's more of a
hands-on thing you might also look into
woodworking auto repair and messing with
cars gardening there's there's literally
thousands of things you could do and I'm
sure you can find things find things
that you don't even know that you like
yet all right exercising not only gives
you something to do but it's also very
good for you I have a bit of a weight
issue I've trouble losing weight but I
have gone to the gym for the past eight
years or so a lot of thin guy but I
would be a lot bigger if I didn't go to
the gym and I'd have much more fat than
muscle I don't do much cardio which I
really should but any kind of exercise
is very beneficial
all right meditation is also a really
positive thing to get into I can really
help you clear your mind and get your
brain in order also giving you more
peace in your life all right so that's
going to be it for this video if you're
still watching this I appreciate you
guys till no end you're my hardcore
supporters and I love all of you if you
like this type of this type of video or
this type of content I have other videos
in I think it's the discussion and
topics playlist something like that
there's a video called healthy tips for
programmers and if you haven't watched
that yet you'll probably like that and
it kind of continues on where we leave
off here alright so thanks for your
support guys and your time and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
