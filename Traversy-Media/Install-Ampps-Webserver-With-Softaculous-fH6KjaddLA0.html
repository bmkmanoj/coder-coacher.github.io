install and look at amps alright amps is
a lamp stack that includes Apache PHP
Perl Python MySQL and a bunch of other
software that is extremely useful when
building websites and applications now
I've been using xampp or zamp for the
past I don't know I'd say like five or
six years and I recently switched to
amps for my local development because it
offers a lot more especially where it
offers soft delicious which is a script
installer and you have access to
I think it's 387 scripts basically with
a couple clicks alright you can quickly
install Joomla WordPress and a whole
slew of applications alright so we're
gonna set this up on a Windows machine
but it's also available for Mac and
Linux if we go to amps comm and then go
to downloads you'll see the different
versions here Windows Mac Linux and also
the different versions of the software
Apache MySQL PHP ok so you can easily
choose from different PHP installations
which i think is really cool so you can
test out certain features or certain
functions and you can choose from
version 5.3 all the way up to version
702
alright Perl Python and it even includes
MongoDB which is a no SQL database
alright so we're gonna go ahead and
install the Windows version I already
downloaded the file it's about 180
megabytes so it will take a couple
minutes to download alright so I'm gonna
go ahead and open that up and it's easy
to install just like any other Windows
software you just pretty much click Next
the whole time alright so let's say yes
and another reason why I really like
amps it gives you it gives you the feel
of having a real server ok it gives you
like a little control panel where you
can add domains you can add FTP accounts
you can install software so it's
it's really nice so let's just go
through and click Next
and here's just a sample of some of the
some of the bigger applications that you
can get very easily Joomla WordPress
Magento but we'll look at this in depth
in a few minutes all right so we're
going to install it in the default
directory which is Program Files oh it
already exists you know what I have to
delete that real quick you guys won't
have this problem I just already had it
installed and I deleted it and I am I'm
reinstalling it so I need to delete that
okay all right so let's continue next
all right so yep we'll create a desktop
icon and now it's gonna go ahead and
install all right so our installation is
done now I'm not gonna launch it yet so
I'm gonna uncheck that because we want
to launch it as administrator all right
so let's go ahead and right-click and
click run as administrator all right so
here is our little panel you can see we
have Apache and MySQL and they're both
running and you can easily stop or
restart these services from here if
you've used xampp or zamp in the past
then you know that if this is very
similar to the xampp control panel all
right then on the side here we have some
tabs we have an Apache tab this is where
you can edit your httpd.conf file all
right so this is where you can mess with
Apache extensions and settings and all
that set directories you can also add an
edit virtual hosts down at the bottom
here alright so if you want to add
virtual hosts then we have the access
log file the error log file and you'll
still have the option to restore the
default configuration if you go ahead
and mess things up in the config file
which we've all done before okay we also
have MySQL that's going to give us the
same options we have the config file the
error log also reset configuration PHP
same thing this is going to give us our
PHP any file this is where we can edit
extensions or enable and disable
extensions we can set file upload limits
things like that okay we can easily
change the version which i think is
really cool okay so if we want to use
5.3 we could easily switch back if we
want PHP seven and
want to test out some of the new
features we can do that as well FTP okay
so this allows you to have your own FTP
server
MongoDB if you want to use MongoDB as
your database you can go ahead and do
that you can set the configs and all
that good stuff and then help is just
gonna give you your about your version
numbers things like that
all right so that is the amps panel okay
I'm gonna just woops what did I do
it's X out of that all right now if we
go down here to the taskbar you'll see
that we have the little amps icon if I
right-click that we have a few different
options here let's open up the amps
admin area alright and this is going to
go to localhost / amps admin so you can
access it from there as well you don't
have to use that icon alright so this is
the landing page it just has some info
it shows you the version of PHP that are
using the version of amps settings you
have a bunch of stuff here you can set
your paths okay you can change your
paths you can edit your site name logo
you can have your own logo and your
panel some permissions stuff and then
here you have some theme options you can
go ahead and change the colors and stuff
like that and then these are just n user
panel settings alright so you can turn
certain things on and off I'm not going
to go through all those because there's
a ton of them update settings social
media settings alright so if you want to
look through that there's a bunch of
different things software this is where
you can see where what's what's gonna be
available it looks like this 402 scripts
that are available to use alright so
under blogs we have of course we had
WordPress b2 evolution and there's a
bunch of stuff that I have and I have no
experience with but definitely check it
out
microblogs I'm just gonna quickly go
through the categories CMS so content
management systems like Joomla Drupal 7
concrete 5 typo
pretty much any open source CMS is
listed here look at tons of them ones
that I had no idea exist forums can be
of PHP BB that's a big one SMF some
others image galleries copper mine is a
good is a good one okay these are all
open source and free wiki's so you can
have your own wiki on your site social
networking we have dolphin Al Gore EE
LGG these are social network platforms
that allow you to have user profiles on
your site and you know photo galleries
things like that ad management calendars
gaming mails so email stuff polls and
surveys project management ecommerce
okay so you have a bunch of options for
shopping carts they even have WHMCS
which is what I use for billing you do
have to pay for a license for that
Magento cube cart Zen cart these are all
really good open-source shopping carts
CRM vtiger sugarcrm guestbooks
customer support that's another good
good category you have oh s ticket even
haves live live chat software frameworks
so PHP frameworks like code igniter
laravel front ending where frameworks
like bootstrap fuel PHP Symphony
educational tools we have Moodle which
is a really popular elearning software
so you can create lessons and courses
and all that kind of stuff
database tools of course we have PHP
myadmin music stuff video RSS file
management and then just some
miscellaneous alright so there's a bunch
of stuff that you can install really
easily
all right updates okay we have some
update options and what's as
installations so you can search your
user and
halation Xand and get info on that all
right so that's the admin now if we go
back down and let's go to amps home
that's going to bring us to localhost /
amps and this is basically your cPanel
alright so you can see we have options
to add domains manage domains database
tools so what I'm gonna show you is how
to add a domain alright so if we click
that and let's say let's just call this
my site.com alright now this is the path
to your domain you notice that it's in
the WWF older that's the server folder
actually you know what let's we'll do
that after actually so this option here
add an entry to the host file what this
will do is it'll rewrite your host file
and include this so that you can
actually go to this URL mysite.com
and it'll open up the local version
that's located here alright now this
access denied although it says this
because we open we ran this as an
administrator it should still create the
entry for us even though I think it's a
bug that this is still read like this
alright but we're going to keep that
checked and we're gonna say add domain
ok so it says our domains added and we
can go to the manage page which will
show us all the domains and we can go to
we can go to localhost / mysite.com
alright and that's going to give us the
index and since we rewrote the host file
we should be able to go to my site comm
as well oh no it didn't work and I think
we can actually see the host file
contents oh it did create it
yes it should go to the same place let's
try HTTP oh yeah there we go I just I
guess the HTTP throw it off I don't know
so now - if we want to add pages to this
let's go ahead and open Windows Explorer
and we're gonna go to our c drive
program files 86 amps
ww and then you should have a mysite.com
folder and let's test it out and we'll
create a PHP file alright so I'm going
to rename this to index dot PHP all
right and then we'll open that up and
let's go ahead and just echo out hello
world okay we'll save that let's reload
this and there we go alright so we can
now get to this application to my site
comm and we should also be able to
access PHP myadmin
by going to localhost / PHP myadmin and
there we go we can create databases okay
and you can go ahead and start to add
tables and all that alright so if we go
back to our control panel I'm not going
to go over all this stuff because
there's a lot security actually if you
want to go to the Security Center you
can add a root password for MySQL
because by default it doesn't have a
password or actually yeah it does it's
it's right here at MySQL so I guess if
you want to change it you want to put in
my MySQL right there and then you can
put in your new password alright and
that goes then changes it
let's see what else
features we have alias manager okay FTP
accounts we can go ahead and add FTP
accounts so it's basically just a cPanel
server right on your local machine email
settings if you want to set up an email
server you can do that and then over
here you have all the different software
that you can install if I click on
Joomla that's gonna take us to a page
where we can install it it's gonna give
us all the information I'm not gonna go
through and do that maybe another video
I'll go over some of these scripts but I
just wanted to show you how you could
easily set up a nice environment local
