object orientated PHP alright so if you
do not know any PHP at all I would
suggest that you at least learn the very
basics at least things like variables
arrays functions loops just just the
real fundamentals of PHP alright if you
if you don't know PHP but you have
experience in another language
especially if it is if it's an object
orientated language then you should be
alright alright what we're going to be
doing is going to be pretty simple so if
you already know object orientated PHP
then you probably don't want to continue
because it's probably just stuff you
already know but feel free to watch and
maybe use it as a refresher alright so
what I have is I already have my service
set up a musings amp or xampp and I have
my localhost at local dev and then I
just have an index.php file so the first
thing we're going to go over is classes
ok classes are the basically the
building block of object orientated
programming at least in PHP alright so
to define a class you just want to use
the word class and then whatever you
want to call it in this case I'm going
to call it customer all right and I
haven't already planned out this code
just to let you know I'm just kind of
freestyling it alright so we may have a
couple hours or whatever but it'll be
fine all right so we have a class called
customer and then in a class you have
two core components that's properties
and methods properties are basically
just attributes of the class all right
so we have a customer class so we may
have something like an ID let's say a
name email ID name email and let's say
location
okay now when we're using PHP 5 or newer
which most likely you are you want to
you want to use what's called an access
modifier all right also sometimes called
an access identifier and there's three
different ones you can use okay that's
public which means that and I'm going to
go over this more in depth in a little
bit but public just means that you can
access this this property from outside
of this class alright we also have
private okay that's going to make it so
you can't access this anywhere except
this class okay you can't access it
outside of it you can access it from
another class even if it's extended from
this one all right and then you have
protected which means that you can't
access this from outside but you can
access it from another class that
extends customer alright so for example
if we have let's say class my class
extends customer okay if we do that then
we'll be able to access email from in
that class all right so hopefully that
makes sense
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
settle these the public for now and
we'll get location all right so now we
have some properties for our customer
class actually now instead of location
let's use balance okay since their
customers they probably have some kind
of balance now we're just declaring
these declaring these but you can also
set a default okay if we wanted to say
ID equals one we could certainly do that
okay and next thing is methods methods
are functions so try not to get confused
with methods and functions all a method
is is a function that's inside of a
class all right so you can also use
access modifiers on that as well so
we'll say public function and let's say
I get
tomorrow all right now this most likely
would take in an ID okay so when you
call this you would put the customer ID
in and then most likely what you would
do is you would take the ID that's
passed in and you would assign it to the
property ID so to do that what we would
do is say this ID equals ID all right so
if you ever want to access a property in
your class you could use the keyword
this and then you want that and then ID
all right or whatever the property is
all right that way you can access these
from every method in your class all
right because if we just keep it as ID
and get customer we can't access this
from anywhere else now a method like get
customer what it would probably do in a
real application is it would go and
fetch a customer from the database with
that particular ID all right and then
you would probably just return the
customer so we don't have the database
part but what we can do is just say
return and let's say it grabs a user
called John Doe all right our customer
called John Doe so now I'm going to show
you how we can instantiate this class
inside of our PHP alright so we want to
make sure that we go outside of the
class now all right now to instantiate
it you're going to create a variable
let's say customer and we want to set it
to new and then the name of the class so
new customer all right and that gives us
a new customer object or instance all
right and then we can continue and we
can actually access public properties
and and public methods or functions
all right so for instance let's say that
we want ID to be 1 by default then we
can go and we can echo customer ID save
it reload and we get 1 now just to
demonstrate these the visibility or the
access modifiers here let's make this
private
okay and if we go and reload we're going
to get this cannot access private
property okay if I change it to
protected then it's saying cannot access
protected property all right so let's
make it back to public and get rid of
that okay now if we want to call a
method we can do the same thing we're
going to echo customer and let's say get
customer and then we need to pass in an
ID all right so if we go ahead and
reload we get John Doe because that's
what we're returning here all right if
we want to return the ID we could do
that
okay so let's pass in 11 and reload and
we get 11 all right and then the same
thing if I set this to private we get
the error okay same thing with protected
all right so that takes care of
properties and methods now we also have
a method called construct ok which is a
constructor and there's a lot of
different programming languages that use
constructors what it is is it's a
special function that or method that is
going to run when we instantiate the
object so when we run this if we have a
construct function that's going to go
ahead and run all right so let's create
one we'll say public function and then
you want to use double underscore and
then construct okay just like that and
just to test it out we'll say echo I
will say the
constructor brand alright so now let's
save and all we're doing here is
instantiating the customer object okay
and you can see the constructor ran and
we also have another one and these are
called magic methods okay and there's a
bunch of them I'm going to go over some
more in a little bit but constructing in
d-struct
our magic methods all right so let's say
public function struct and we'll do the
same thing we'll just echo we'll say it
will say destruct destructor ran all
right so if we reload you can see we get
the constructor ran and then the
destructor ran all right and if we go
ahead and spit out the customer again
let's actually just return the name okay
when we run this it should go in between
the construct and destruct functions all
right so let's say customer get customer
and just put in 10 ok now if we reload
oops we got to echo it ok so now you can
see that John Doe is being printed out
in between the two now common practice
would be if we're going to just get a
customer here and we're going to pass in
an attribute or property and then assign
it like this we can do that in the
construct alright so it would take away
the need to have this really all right
so unless you're dealing with the
database and all that you would do it
but if we're just assigning class
properties then you want to do that in
the construct right so in here let's say
ID name
email and balance okay and then let's
let's copy that and we'll just paste
that here okay so we get ID then we'll
do name this will be email and balance
all right
and I like to make these nice and neat
okay and then we can get rid of this all
together okay
and we don't need this destruct either
and we'll get rid of this all right so
what we can do now is when we
instantiate the customer we want to
actually pass in the values here all
right so the ID let's say one then the
name will say my name and then email say
Brad at Gmail and then a balance let's
just say zero okay so if we want to
output any of these we can now just say
echo customer and let's echo out the
name okay and that's going to give us
the name so now we have this customer
that we can work with if we wanted to
create a function called let's say get
email all right and then we can just
return this
email all right and then instead of
doing this well let's get rid of that
say we want the email and that gives us
the email and notice we don't have to
pass anything in here we don't have to
pass in an ID or anything because we
have our customer right here it's an
instance it's just talking about this
one customer all right so we can
continue to run methods on that customer
now the reason that you would want to do
this is because you couldn't keep your
properties all private and then you
could just have a method that gets that
private property okay so let's make all
these private and this is really common
practice okay so if we go ahead and save
that reload we're not getting any error
and it's letting us get the email
address because we're not accessing it
directly okay we're not saying customer
email okay if we do that we're going to
get that error okay because what we're
doing is we're using this method here to
get the private property all right and
this is public I mean if I set this to
let's say protected and reload we're
going to get an error okay so public
methods private properties is is really
good practice so let's put that back all
right so now let's talk a little bit
about inheritance okay so as I said you
can have a class extend another class so
what I'll do is let's let's comment this
out for now and we're going to create
another class so let's say class and
normally you would have these in their
own files okay you'd have a customer for
instance a customer dot PHP and then
whatever else you have for classes in
this case let's call it this subscriber
okay so subscriber is going to extend
customer so we want to say extends K
make sure it's plural extends customer
okay so now we have two classes now in
subscriber let's create its own property
okay so we'll say public and let's say
there's a property called
plan okay this is a subscriber and
they're on a specific plan okay and plan
is not part of customer because not all
customers are subscribers now when we
instantiate a subscriber we want to do
the same thing that we did with customer
it we want to pass these in alright but
we don't want to repeat having to put
all these down here and these so what
we'll do is let's create our construct
I'm going to copy this one alright now
we're going to have to pass in all the
stuff ID name email balance but we don't
want to have to do this again
alright so let's get rid of that and
what we can do here is we can specify
that we want the parent construct to run
okay so do that I'm going to say parent
and then a double colon and then
construct okay just like that and then
we want to pass these in alright now
when we instantiate a subscriber we also
want to put in the plan alright so we
want to make sure we put that here
but we don't want to pass it to the
parent because there is no plan up here
okay it's not um it's not a customer
property it's a subscriber property so
what we'll do is down here we'll say
this plan is going to be equal to the
plan that's passed in alright and
that'll take care of that and now what
we can do is let's take the get email
and cut that out
and paste it in here alright so now we
have subscriber get email and we want to
make sure that the email up here and the
properties is set to protected okay
because that means we won't be able to
access it from outside unless it's a
class that extends customer okay so now
what we can do is copy that make sure
you're outside of both classes and this
is going to be now subscriber it's going
to equal new subscriber and now we can
actually pass in the plan as well okay
so we'll say Pro alright and then we
should be able to call get email so
subscriber and we'll say get email
actually we need to echo it out all
right and now we can get our email okay
through subscriber now if we wanted the
get email to actually stay in the
customer class we can do that because
since subscriber extends customer we
have access to this alright so we can
actually save that and that's going to
do the same thing all right now next
thing we want to talk about is abstract
classes alright and abstract methods now
when you have an abstract class
it can't be instantiated okay so if we
make customer abstract we can't do this
down here we have to just use classes
that extend it alright so let's take a
look at that so we'll say abstract class
customer all right and just to show you
what it does let's comment this stuff
out and then we'll uncomment that and
reload and you get cannot instantiate
abstract class customer
okay so let's comment that back out and
then let's uncomment this and let's try
to call get email all right so that's
going to work but if we want to make
let's I just want to show you if we take
away the abstract in the class and add
it here on to a method and then we try
it's telling us that get email can't be
run and the reason for that is when you
have an abstract method like this it
needs to be in an abstract class okay
so we need to put that back here okay
and then reload wait a minute here echo
gets subscriber email cannot contain
body oh that's because when we have our
function here we can actually include a
body all right so what we'll have to do
is copy that and then this is we're just
going to declare it like that
all right and then down here is where we
want to call it like that alright so you
just want to define your functions in
the abstract class okay it's basically
you can think of it as a base class that
that you don't use directly but you
extend classes from it all right so
hopefully that makes sense in my
experience I haven't really needed to
use abstract classes but it's it's it's
good to know it's a fundamental part of
object orientated program alright so
this is starting to get a little
cluttered so I'm going to just get rid
of all this and what I want to move on
to now is the static keyword all right
so you can set static properties and
methods you don't define the classes
static but the properties and methods in
side of it you can all right so let's
create a class let's call it user and
let's say user has just a regular
property of username and also password
okay now the purpose of using static
classes and properties is that you don't
have to create an instance you don't
have to instantiate when you do that
alright so let me just give you an
example and we're going to say public
static and let's say password length
okay and we're going to set that to a
default of 5
all right so password length would be a
good thing to make static because you
don't need a certain instance it's
always going to be the same the user
name and password are going to be
different depending on the user but
password length is going to be the same
no matter what so that's a good example
to use a static property all right and
then we want to create let's say public
public static function and we'll say get
password length all right and what we
want to do is return now when you're
dealing with static properties you don't
want to use this you don't want to do
that what you want to use is the
keywords self and then you want to use
this double colon and then the property
ok so in this case it's going to be
password length
okay so what we want to do now is let's
go outside of the user outside of the
user class and to call this we don't
need to say you know user equals new
user or anything like that what we can
do is just the name of the class and
actually let's echo out user and then
same thing you want to use this double
colon and then the function which is
going to be get password length okay
just like that let's go ahead and reload
and it's giving us five all right and
you would probably have this private but
if it's public and you want to access it
directly you can do that as well
okay of course if I said private it's
going to give us an error all right so
that's how static static properties and
static methods work all right so that's
going to be it for now those are the
very basic fundamentals that you need to
know when working with object orientated
pH all right I will hopefully create a
part two of this where we can actually
create an application that's going to
that's going to use these concepts
alright so for now thanks for watching
please subscribe leave a like leave a
dislike if you didn't like it and I will
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
