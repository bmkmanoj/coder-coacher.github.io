front-to-back I apologize it's been a
while since I did my last episode I've
just been really busy and I couldn't get
to it so today what we're going to be
doing is we're going to work with
object-oriented programming in PHP
alright so we're going to create a class
we're going to create methods and
properties in the class instantiate
objects and so on alright so I'm trying
out this new FaceTime or face cam
whatever you want to call it it was
recommended to me by a few of my
subscribers they suggested that I should
do it one for copyright issues if you
guys have been following me you know
I've had some issues with copyright with
my videos and then another reason is
just to be a little more interactive and
and have it help explain things or help
me explain things to you alright so
we're just going to give it a shot you
guys can let me know if if you like it
if it helps you or if it distracts you
or from just too damn ugly to look at
either way all right so let's go ahead
and get into it now we have our PHP
sandbox folder here and I'm going to
create a new file and we're going to
just say this is oo P dot PHP okay
object-oriented programming and this is
only this is the only file that we're
going to need for this lesson all right
now you might see me glance over to the
right that's because I have my code over
here that I'm you know my reference code
so that's what I'm doing if I'm looking
to the right alright so let's go ahead
and create a class ok so we put our PHP
tags and this class is going to be
called person ok so it's going to
represent a person object so in the
class you can have properties which are
basically attributes in the form of a
variable and then we also have methods
which are pretty much just functions
inside the class so let's create a
couple properties so let's create name
and email ok we'll keep it really simple
now when you have these properties you
can you could add what's called an
access modifier
and that could be public private or
protected now public means that we can
access this from anywhere at all outside
of the class if we set it to private we
can only access it in this class and if
we set it to protected we can only
access it access it from this class and
then any other classes that extend this
one okay so hopefully that makes sense
so far but I'm just going to make them
public for now and then this small
amount of code here is enough to
actually create a person object so what
we'll do is create a variable it's a
person one and we'll set that to new and
then the class name person and that's
actually in this is called instantiate
okay we're instantiating a person object
so let's save this and then we're going
to go and open up a little host PHP
sandbox and Hopi dot PHP now notice
nothing's happening because all we did
was instantiate the object we're not
doing anything with it so since these
are public we can directly access them
so we could go person one name equals
and we'll set that to John Doe okay so
in PHP when you want to access a
property you want to use this this arrow
this - and and greater than side if you
use the JavaScript it would be like
person dot name okay of a PHP uses that
syntax so that's setting it if we save
and reload we're still not getting
anything because we're just setting a
variable basically if we want to echo it
out we can say echo person one name and
reload and we get John Doe okay so this
isn't very good practice usually what
you want to do when you want to interact
with properties is make them private and
then create a public function to reach
in and mess with them change them and so
on
so that's what we'll do we'll set these
to private
and let's go ahead and try and run it
now
and you'll see cannot access private
property person name okay so we can't
directly access it so what I'll do is
just comment those out and then we're
going to create a couple methods so
these methods are called getters and
setters okay so we're going to create
one it's a public function get name and
that's going to return this arrow name
so this is the keyword we use when we
want to reference something from within
the class so we can access properties
with this as well as other functions so
we could do this get name if we want it
to as well but so that's just going to
return it or get it now to set it we're
going to set public function set name
and then that's going to take in the
name and then we're just going to say
this name is going to be equal to the
name that's passed in so now we can go
down here and take our person one object
and we can do set name and tap in John
Doe okay so that will set it and then to
get it we'll just echo out person or
person one get named okay now if we save
that reload we get John Doe okay so it's
reaching in grabbing the name and we're
echoing it out and then what I want to
do is just create it create a setter and
getter for email as well so this will be
set email
and then this will be get email all
right now you may not want to have to
explicitly call this set set name and
set email and all that especially if
you're working with a lot of different
properties so what we can do is we can
create something called a constructor
that is a method that runs when the
object is created and you can actually
pass things into it and you can do your
sets there so for instance to create a
constructor we want to do public and
public function and double underscore
construct okay as of php5 that's what we
do back in PHP 4 we would have to create
a function that matched the name of the
class but we don't do that anymore so in
the construct this will run when we
instantiate the object so just to show
you let's say echo person created ok and
then let's go down here and I'm just
going to comment out these two so
basically all we're doing is
instantiating this so let's save and
reload and it says person created
because this actually runs when we
create the object all right so hopefully
that makes sense now we can also pass
values in to the constructor so let's
say we want to pass in name and email
and then what we want to do is just set
them just like we did here so I'm just
going to grab that and then email ok and
then down here when we instantiate this
person we want to pass in some values so
we'll pass in John Doe and his email
and then let's go ahead and do the
getname save that reload and we get John
Doe alright let me just put a line break
here
so I should put a line break on the gets
as well so
oops all right so let's reload that and
now they're on separate lines so we
didn't have to do the set name we just
created the object and passed in the
data now we also have what's called a
magic method magic property or something
like that and there's one called class
okay so we can actually get the name of
the class so instead of saying person
created let's go ahead and do double
underscore class double underscore and
then just concatenate space created okay
if we reload we get person created
because this is this is going to give us
the name of the class all right so that
is the basics of creating a class and
properties and methods we also have a
Deconstructor we can do so if I copy
this and then I'm going to just get rid
of this stuff and we don't want to pass
anything in and let's say class
destroyed okay so if we save that reload
cannot read the clear person oh this
needs to be deconstruct okay
and let's say deconstruct what a friggin
idiot destruct
alright so now person created when we
instantiate it we were shooting out the
name right here get name and then when
it's when it's done okay we get person
destroyed all right so now what I want
to get into is inheritance okay because
you can have classes that can inherit
properties and methods from other
classes so let's go down under the
person class I'm just going to comment
all this stuff out and we're going to
create a class called customers and then
we just want to do extends
person okay so it's going to extend the
person class and from here let's say
that we want customers to have an extra
field so they'll have a balance so let's
say public actually will do private
private balance okay and then we can
have a getter and setter for that as
well so I'm just going to grab that and
then this will be set balance and we'll
save this balance and then get balance
all right now as is we should be able to
create a customer if we say let's do
customer 1 equals new customer and we're
going to pass in a name and an email and
let's save that and reload class
customer not found Oh customers wait a
second oh yeah that should be customer
nos ok so we get person created person
destroyed so since it extends person
it's actually taking taking in the name
and email setting it up here we're
getting this created and destroyed now
if I want to pass in the balance of say
300 that well let me just actually just
echo out there's an echo out customer 1
and let's do get
allons okay so you can see we're not
getting it's not giving us 300 the
reason for that is because if we want to
be able to pass it in here then we need
to also create a constructor in the
customer class so public function double
underscore construct okay and we're
going to pass in here the name the email
and balance and then we need to call the
parent constructor okay so to do that we
need to say parents and then this double
colon underscore or double underscore
construct and then pass in these three
things to that as well all right
and then right under that let's just do
an echo and we're going to say a new a
new and then we'll concatenate class
like that has been created all right so
now let's Glen save and reload and we
get a new customer has been created and
see get balance return this balance why
isn't that
oh we didn't set it in there in the
constructor we need to do this just like
we did up here and the constructor with
name and email alright so that should
work save it
reload and you can see we get 300 let's
actually put a line break right here
alright so we have our person class
which has a name and email and then our
customer class extends it and adds a
balance to it so that's pretty much it
when as far as you know the fundamentals
of object-oriented programming in PHP
one other thing that I want to show you
is the ability to use static properties
and Static methods and what that means
is that you don't you don't need to
instantiate the object to use them so
for instance let's say for person we
want to do excellence to public for now
we'll say public static and then let's
do an age limit property
okay so age limit we can actually set it
here so we'll set the age limit to I
don't know 40 I'm not even sure what is
it when it's a limit for but we'll set
it to 40 now we should be able to access
this property without having to
instantiate a person object so let me
show you what I mean I'm going to just
comment this off down here and then I'm
going to go right under the person class
and we're going to say echo and then the
name of the class person and then this
double colon and then the value on the
property which is age limit
so money sign age limit so let's see
what that gives us we reload and we get
40 okay so we're getting the value even
though we didn't even instantiate the
person object it's static so we can just
you can just use it it just works now we
can do the same thing with methods so if
we were to change this to private static
and let's say we wanted to create a
static method to get that value then
down here we'll say public static
function and this will be you'll say get
age limit and then that's just going to
return and when we're using static
properties and static methods we don't
use this so we don't do this age limit
we use self okay so we do self and
instead of an arrow we use the double
the double colon okay so self and then
age limit is what we want to return and
then down here to call it we can just do
person get age limit and that's a
function save that reload and we get 40
okay so this is actually you know what I
want to keep that in there for you guys
so keep that and that's alright so this
is static props and method alright
so that's going to be it guys for this
episode hopefully you enjoyed it and
