explain to you template literals or
template strings in es6 alright so this
is a really easy thing to understand but
it is really helpful as well especially
if you hate concatenating strings two
variables the numbers and so forth so
what we're going to do here is let's
create a variable called template and
I'm going to set that to a string and
this is going to have some stuff we'll
do some HTML let's say hello and then
we'll do a paragraph this is a simple
template in JavaScript okay and the
power graph there all right now usually
if you have a template you'd want to
insert it in your browser somewhere in
your page so what I'm going to do is in
my index file I'm going to replace this
with a div and let's give this an ID of
template
okay then back in our JavaScript we're
going to do document dot get element by
ID and we're going to pass in template
and then let's do dot inner HTML equals
template well sorry about that equals
template alright save it
reload and there's our template okay
very simple now usually it would be a
lot longer than this so you may want to
have multiple lines so what we could do
is let's do that break this up a little
bit now you can see that it's already
broken
okay if I save this and we reload we get
a nasty error so normally what we would
do is we would concatenate we could end
the string here use a plus sign go
what's wrong with my mouse go down here
put a quote here and then that should
work okay now if we don't want to have
to do that we can use backticks instead
of quotes all right so let me get rid of
this one we're going to get rid of this
and then we're just going to have one
back tick here which is the key that's
to the left of your one key and then at
the end all right and now you can see
that we're on multiple lines without
having to concatenate and everything
works alright so I find that really nice
I mean you may not appreciate it with
this just a couple words here but um if
this was a big template this works
really nice now what's even better is
that you can use there are variables in
here as well okay we can bind data so
let's say we want a variable called name
and we'll set that to John alright now
down in our template what we can do is
we can directly use this without
concatenated without any of that using
dollar sign and then some curly braces
and then in here we'll say name save
that reload we get hello John we can
also use functions so for instance let's
take the dollar sign curly brace syntax
and let's see we're going to call a
function will say make uppercase all
right and then we'll just pass in hello
all right and then what we'll do is
create the function that's going to take
in a word and then we'll take or will
return word dot to uppercase save that
reload and now hello is all uppercase so
we can use variables we can use
functions we can use multiple lines very
easily all right so that's it in the
next video I'm going to show you some of
the new string methods methods that are
available with es6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
