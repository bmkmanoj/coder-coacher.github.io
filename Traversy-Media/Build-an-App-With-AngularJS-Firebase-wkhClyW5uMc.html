you how to set up an angularjs
application using angular seed
alright angular seed is basically a
boilerplate for angularjs alright it
gives you some basic structure it also
comes with the ability to run a web
server right off the bat alright so you
want to go to the github repository
which is github.com slash angular slash
angular seed and what we're going to do
is just download the zip file alright
we'll open that up and I'm going to
create a project folder okay so I'm just
going to put this in my C Drive in side
projects and let's create a folder and
we'll call this contact list ok so we
just want to bring everything over and
then what we want to do is open up the
package JSON file ok and we're going to
change the name of the project go change
it to contact list and you can change
the description
all right feel free to change anything
else you want to maybe the repository
I'm just going to get rid of that all
right now there's a lot of dependencies
here we have Bower which is a front-end
package manager HTTP server Jasmine
karma these are for this is for testing
protractor shell Jas which I'm not
really sure what that is and what we're
going to do is just add to this we're
going to add firebase ok so that's what
we'll use as our database and we want
the latest version so we'll just put in
an asterisk all right and that should be
good for now so let's go ahead and save
this and we're going to have to go to a
command line into this folder I'm using
something called git bash which is
basically just the Windows command
prompt with some additional UNIX tools
and if you want that you can go to get -
SCM comm and you can go ahead and
download that for Windows alright but of
course you can use the regular Windows
command shell so what we want to do now
is just say NPM install I want to get
all those dependencies installed all
right so now what we want to do is take
care of the front-end dependencies so
let's say bower install alright and now
what we can do is we can run the server
so we want to say NPM start
you guys in this video I'm going to show
you how to get a simple angularjs app
set up using angular seed
alright angular seed is basically just a
boilerplate for angular all right if we
look at the file structure here we have
our main app folder and that's going to
contain our v1 view too and if we click
on this you'll see we have three things
we have the HTML so the user interface
we have the JavaScript which will
contain things like the controller
dependency injections things like that
and then we have the test file all right
so it's a nice little structure and it
also comes with a pre-built server that
we can use so it's you know there's a
lot of different options to set up an
angular app and this is a really good
one so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to download the zip file here and
open that up alright and I'm going to
create a project folder so I'm going to
go to my C Drive and then projects and
let's create a new folder and I'm going
to call it contact list alright now
we're going to bring everything over
alright and we have to open a command
line into this folder I'm using
something called git bash and as an
option here in the context menu but of
course you can use the standard windows
command prompt if you do want this you
can get it at get - as cm calm and just
download it for windows alright so from
here what we want to do actually the
next thing we want to do is edit the
package.json file alright so let's go
ahead and open that up so from here
let's change the name of the app we'll
call it the contact list ok and I'll
change the description
and get rid of the repository all right
and the dependencies here you can see we
have Bower which is our front-end
package manager we have an HTTP server
and then jasmine karma this is for
testing all right what I do want to do
is add firebase as a dependency all
right because that's what we'll use for
our database solution all right so we
want the latest version so I'm just
going to put in an asterisk all right so
let's save that actually going to change
the version to 1 0 0 and now what we
want to do is go back to our command
line and say npm install all right so
that'll get all those packages set up
for us and it might take a minute or two
so i'm going to pause it and i'll be
back now i also want to run Bower
install because that'll take care of any
front-end packages i believe it runs
it'll run this when we run the server
but just to be sure we'll run it now ok
so now what we want to do is say npm
start alright and ya see it's running
npm install so you don't have to do
those two steps but it's not going to
hurt anything
alright so it says it's running on port
8000 so let's go ahead and go to HTTP
localhost colon 8080 need to do slash
app ok so it's not much it doesn't look
like much but what we have is our two
views so we have view 1 which is just
giving us some text and then view -
alright now I'm going to open up sublime
text in loops alright and we'll go to
contact list app and let's take a look
in view 1 okay so we have an HTML file
which is just the mark up the user
interface we have a J's file which is
going to include things like the module
the
on fig and routes and controller and
then we have a test file which we're not
going to really get into I'm not going
to get into testing I find it very
boring anyway now if we look at the HTML
all we have in here is a paragraph okay
because the main layout is actually in
index.html this is where the head and
the body tags and all that stuff goes
all the inclusion of the style sheets
and JavaScript and you can see we also
have our menu here as well all right
this here is where the views are going
to be output okay in this ng view so
what I want to do now is I want to
implement bootstrap alright so I'm going
to go ahead and do a ctrl C to stop the
server and we're going to say bower
install bootstrap okay and then we'll
run it again with NPM start and now if
we look in let's see I might have to
refresh the folders all right so it's
not showing up here yet I don't know why
it does that but we should have a bower
components folder so if we go to
projects contact list app we have Bower
components and we should have bootstrap
all right so we want to make sure we
include that so let's let's copy this
okay so Bower components
slash bootstrap
and then it's going to be slash dist
slash CSS slash bootstrap dot CSS all
right so now if we save that and reload
now you can see that it's changed quite
a bit as far as the styling of it kay
the padding is gone
the fonts different smaller that's
because bootstrap is now integrated with
our app now I'm going to get rid of this
all together so let's go back to sublime
alright and let's get rid of this menu
all right and then down here o you can
also see that they there's a custom
directive for the version all right if
we look at the application we get
version 0.1 this is coming from a custom
directive you know let me just go like
that okay and if we look in the
components folder and in the version
you'll see there's a version directive
all right so that's where we're creating
that app version directive okay but
we're not really going to get into that
creating custom directives so what I
want to do is let's go to get bootstrap
and I just want to get a simple template
so let's go to getting started and we
want examples and let's just grab this
starter template if we do a ctrl you we
can view the source and I want to grab
from the nav all the way down to the
ending container alright and then we're
going to go put that inside of the HTML
file okay so let's see we don't need
this
all right and I'm going to get rid of
all these comments
okay let's paste it right here all right
now what I want to do is this is where
the view is going to pop out so let's
cut that and let's get rid of this
Stoddard template div all right and
we're going to create a div with a class
of row okay we use the bootstrap grid
system and then I'll say div class
equals call let's say call MD oh sorry
about that column d12 will do for now so
twelve column div alright and let's
paste in that whew so if we save that
and let's go back to our application and
reload now we have a nice navbar what I
do want to do is I want to get rid of
this navbar fix top class all right and
then navbar inverse so I'm going to
change to default to make the navbar a
light color all right so now you can see
we still have our views showing so what
I want to do now is create our database
alright so we're going to be using
firebase so you want to go to firebase
calm and go ahead and sign up it's
completely free for a developer account
so get that done and then we can log in
alright and then you'll see something
like this all right and what we want to
do is create a new database or new app
and let's call it contact list
now the URL has to be unique so you want
to this will be different than mine I'm
just going to say contact list dev oh
one zero one all right and take note of
the URL as well so create new app and if
we go and click on manage app it'll take
us to the interface now we don't have to
do anything yet but this is where our
contacts will show up once we get
everything done in our application now
since we're using angular and Phi
gervase there's a tool we can use called
angularfire which makes things a little
bit easier for us all right so it gives
us a bunch of documentation on it but
I'm not going to really go through that
what we want to do is install it with
Bower
all right you can use Bower and NPM I
believe let's see if we go to Docs yeah
I don't know exactly where it is it's a
there's a lot of documentation but what
we'll do is go ahead and stop the server
and we're going to save our install
angularfire and let's also install
firebase with Bower
so say bower install firebase alright
now let's go to our index.html we need
to make sure we include those files
alright so down at the bottom here let's
copy this and then the placement of
these is really important we're going to
go under the angular route here and this
is where we'll include angular fire so
let's get rid of that it's going to be
Bower components let me just check it
out
okay for some reason it doesn't it
doesn't refresh in here so power
components angularfire and then dist and
then angularfire j s alright okay so
that's that it's that right yeah okay
and then we also want firebase which is
right here all right so let's paste this
underneath that actually we want
firebase to be on top of angularfire all
right so let's save that and now those
should be like the last thing I want to
include is jQuery all right so I'm
actually going to put that at the top
here alright we already have jQuery
inside of bower components okay you can
see right here so let's change that to
jQuery slash dist slash jQuery Jas
alright good so save that and let's also
change the title here change it to
contact list all right now what we're
going to do is we don't want v1 and v2
I'm going to rename v1 okay let's say
rename and we're going to call it
contacts all right for some reason it's
not updating in sublime text all right
if we go to the actual folder going app
okay you can see that it was renamed to
contacts now I also want to rename all
of these files to contacts as well so
contacts HTML
contacts je s and we'll also have
contacts test all right so let's open up
contacts HTML and contacts je s now
there's quite a few things we're going
to have to change alright so this module
will be my app dot contacts and let's
change this contacts this alright and
this will be contacts controller just
like that alright so let's save that now
we're going to have to go into our
index.html and change this right here to
contact slash contacts je s alright and
then we're going to get rid of the view
to okay we don't need that so let's get
rid of that I'm actually going to delete
the whole view to folder okay and it
could give us an error but let's go
ahead and run NPM start
okay oops we want to go just to app all
right
so now what I want to do is go to app J
s and we need to edit this file all
right so let's get rid of my app version
as well as view to and then we'll change
view one two contacts okay and then
right here where it says otherwise then
will redirect to contacts and since
we're using firebase we also want to put
that in there okay so now we want to go
to contacts J s now when we have a
controller we need to include what's
called a scope all right and that's
going to allow us to bind data to and
from the view from the controller now
having it like this will work but it'll
break if this is named something else
alright and for instance if we use the
minified angular script
it'll rename this to something shorter
to save on space and then it will break
so what we need to do is also include it
right here okay in quotes so just going
to include scope just like that
okay now we're also going to want to use
firebase so we want to inject the
firebase array variable just like that
and then we want to also put it in the
parameters
so just to test things out inside of the
controller will say console dot log will
say controller loaded actually let's say
contacts controller loaded okay and then
we'll go and let's open up our console
and reload okay so this is giving us an
error field to instantiate module my app
oh it's still looking for view one
somewhere let's see where is that oh
it's probably in the index
No
oh no where is it being included
contacts
no hmm we might have to restart the
server let's make sure everything's
saved and let's go and oh it's not
running on in mind that's not the right
one I do command lines open so let's
just restart this okay and we'll go
ahead and reload all right so now we're
getting contacts controller loaded so
everything's good up to this point let's
go back to contacts j/s so what we want
to do is we need to bring in a reference
to our firebase all right so let's
create a variable called ref and let's
set that to new oops that should be a
space new firebase and then we want to
put in the URL so in my case it's going
to be this right here yours will be
different
all right and then what we can do is go
right underneath it and let's create a
scope variable so I'm going to say scope
dot contacts all right we're going to
set that to firebase array and we want
to pass in the reference so this will
put all the contacts inside of our scope
variable and we can actually use this in
our view all right but that's not going
to help us right now because we have
nothing here so what I want to do is
create the form to actually create a
contact so let's go into contacts HTML
and we're going to create a div and
let's give it a class of row all right
now this div I'm also going to give a
directive called ng-controller okay
because we want to let them know that we
were working in the contacts controller
so contacts was it ctrl yeah contacts
controller all right so now let's create
a two column layout what I want to do is
have the form on the left side and the
sidebar and then the actual contacts
table on the right
so say div class equals call call MD
let's do five okay that'll be the
sidebar and then we'll do the main area
that'll be called MD seven
okay so in here let's create the form
we'll put an h3 say I'll add contact
alright and then let's see we'll put in
actually let me just grab a form from
get bootstrap forms is it in CSS yeah
let's just grab this okay we'll put that
like that
okay first field
let's put name and we don't need the for
attribute I'll get rid of that type is
going to be text okay ID we shouldn't
need the ID what we do need that's very
important is the ng model okay because
that's going to be what binds it to the
controller
all right so ng model is going to be
named placeholder all right so that's
the name let's just copy that and I'm
going to get rid of everything down to
the button all right and then we'll
paste in another field this will be the
email
type will change to email as well and
then ng model will be email alright and
then we'll do the phone number change ng
model to phone alright let's see what
this looks like
alright so there's our form so we need
to add some stuff to the form tag we
want to use ng submit okay so when this
form is submitted we want to run a
function let's call we'll just say add
contact alright so we'll save that and
let's go back to our contacts J s and
we're going to create that function here
it's going to be a scope function so we
want to say scope dot add contact equals
function and let's say console.log
adding contact okay just to test it out
so let's save it reload and we'll just
type some stuff in here this has to be
an email address alright so click submit
and nothing's happening so let's go back
to the HTML and it looks like in the
form so we forgot to put the parentheses
for add contact so let's see if that
helps alright good so now we're getting
add contact so we know that that's
they're connected so what we want to do
is we want to say scope dot contacts
scoped contacts and then we want to say
dot dollar sign add alright this is how
we can add to firebase and I'm going to
add an object alright and let's say name
is going to be scope
name email scope dot email and phone
will be scope dot phone and then what we
want to do is go right after this
closing parenthesis and we want to say
dot then and inside here we want a
function okay that's going to take a
parameter of ref and what we want to do
is is create a variable called ID and
let's set that to ref dot key all right
and then we'll do a little console log
and it'll say added contact and then we
can actually can cat the ID so we'll say
plus ID all right then we want to clear
the form or clear the scope variables
rather so we'll say scope dot name is
going to be equal to nothing same thing
with email and phone
okay so let's save that and see what
happens
all right so I'm going to just load
refresh the app so name will say John
Doe email phone and submit all right and
then down here you can see added contact
and we get the ID if we go to our
firebase there it is okay we don't even
have to reload firebase you can see we
have John Doe okay if we want to add one
more let's say Steve Smith I'll say s
Smith okay submit and you can see now we
have Steve Smith alright so we can now
add contacts next thing we want to do is
we want to be able to show those
contacts over here alright so to do that
let's go to let's see contacts HTML and
we're going to go to the seven column
div here and let's put in an h3 and
it'll say contacts and what we want to
do is create a table okay so we're going
to say table class table and table
striped
okay and let's do our tea head and tea
body okay in the head we're going to
have a table row with some table
headings
okay so we'll say name email phone
alright and actually let's also have
another one for the buttons all right
now in our tea body we want to have our
table rows but we need them to iterate
for every contact so what we're going to
do is going to say TR and then I'm going
to use the ng repeat directive okay this
will allow us to loop through something
so we want to say contact in contacts
all right now the reason that contacts
is available to us is because in the
JavaScript we set scoped contacts to the
firebase array of contacts so anything
we put in scope we can access from
within here because we're in the same
controller which we provided up here
alright so what we'll do is let's say TD
TD and then we want contact dot name
okay we can use these double curly
braces this one will be the email so
we'll say contact email and also the
phone
okay all right let's just see what
happens okay so now you can see we have
our two contacts all right if we want to
add another one let's say Jeff Williams
we'll say J wills at Gmail submit and
there is K it's instant we don't have to
reload the page or anything what I want
to do before we go and we're going to
make it so that we can delete them I
want to change I want to get rid of
these links in the nav bar
so in our index.html let's just get rid
of this and then home I'm going to have
go to actually you know what instead of
having it slash contacts let's make it
the home page alright so we can do that
by going to contacts j/s and where we
have our route here slash contacts we're
just going to change that to just slash
alright so let's see what that does
alright so now we don't actually have to
go to slash contacts so what I want to
do now is put a delete button over here
so we can delete contacts all right so
let's go to our HTML and we want to go
down here alright and let's give this a
class
of button and I'm sorry BTN and then BTN
danger alright and this is going to have
an ng-click alright and this will be
remove remove contact and we're going to
have to pass in contact okay just like
that and let's see actually I don't
think we need this alright so what we
want to do now is create this remove
contact so we'll go to our je s file and
we'll say scope dot remove contact
alright and that's going to actually no
I did this wrong need to say scope dot
remove contact equals function and pass
in contact and then we're going to do
scope dot contacts dot dollar-sign
remove and then pass in contact okay
just like that let's save it and reload
and then Jeff Williams delete and he's
gone alright so what I want to do now is
make it so that we can edit our contacts
so we need to add a button and what I
want to happen is when we click that
button the add form will disappear and
the edit form will show alright and then
we'll be able to submit that an update
so what we want to do first is create a
button so in contacts HTML I'm going to
copy the delete button ok we'll paste
that in let's change this to edit
and let's change danger to default and
instead of remove contact we're going to
change this to show edit form okay now I
don't want to call this edit contact
because that's not what it's going to do
when we click that it's just going to
show the Edit form and then we submit
that edit form that's when it will call
edit contact all right so let's save
that okay now we have an edit button so
when that clicks it's going to call show
edit form so let's go to our j/s file
and let's say oops say scope dot show
edit form equals function alright and
what we want to do is let's say scope
dot add form show we're going to set to
false all right and then what we'll do
is in our HTML we'll go to our add form
I'm going to go to the div above it and
we're going to say ng-show
so it'll only show if that is true which
what do they call it add form show okay
so this should only load if that is true
so if we save it and reload it's going
to disappear so what we need to do is
make that initially true so that it
shows by default so it'll go right here
and say true okay so now if we reload
alright and if I click Edit it goes away
so in addition to it going away we want
the edit form to show so let's create
that I'm just going to copy this entire
five column div and we'll paste it right
underneath
and instead of ad form show this will be
headed form show and it'll change this
to edit the submit function will be edit
contact all right so let's save that and
then go back to our JavaScript and we
want to make sure that edit form show is
false to begin with all right and then
once we click the edit button it'll then
be true all right so let's try that out
click Edit and it changes to edit all
right so we also want the value to show
up for whatever one we click here so
we're going to go to our show edit form
and we're going to say scope dot ID is
going to be equal to contact dot ID
whatever one we click okay same thing
with name email
and phone all right so let's see if that
does anything all right so I click Edit
John and he shows up here if I click
Edit Steve he shows up all right so
that's exactly what we want now we want
to go to our edit I think what do we
call it edit contact so we need to
create that so we'll go right under add
contact
so first thing we want to do here is
let's create an ID or a variable called
ID and we want to set that to scope ID
all right and then we're going to create
a variable called record and set that to
scope dot contacts dot get record and we
want to pass in that ID all right now we
want to assign our record values so
we're going to say record dot name is
going to equal scope dot name and phone
all right and then finally we'll do our
save all right so let's say sculp dot
contacts dot dollar sign save and then
we want to pass in that record variable
dot then pass in our function function
is going to take that reference and then
let's just do console dot log and we'll
just log r f dot key all right and then
we want to clear the fields just like we
did here
all right so let's save that and let's
go ahead and reload the app okay we'll
say Steve Smith let's edit him and let's
change him to Dave Smith Submit all
right so cannot set property name of
null all right so it looks like it's
talking about record dot name oh okay
and the reason for that is right here we
have contact ID this should actually be
contact dot taller sign ID
all right so edit Steve let's change
them to Dave submit and there we go
Dave Smith awesome so we now have a full
crud application it can create read
update and delete contacts let's go
ahead and get rid of this home link
there's no there's really no need of it
it's the only it's a single page app so
we'll just take that out alright so
there we go we now have a contact list
app so feel free to edit it maybe add
some more fields or add some more
functionality whatever you'd like I'll
post the link in the description to the
github repository and thanks for
watching if you could subscribe or give
us a like that'd be great I do have a
full 10 project course with angular
projects just like this available at EDX
