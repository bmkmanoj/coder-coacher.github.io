mean stack front-to-back series in the
last video we went ahead and set up our
Express server and we connected to our
MongoDB database we also set up all the
middleware for our dependencies for
coolers and body parts or things like
that and we also created our routes file
so in routes users we have our register
authenticate profile and validate now
one thing that I forgot to do is
register is actually a post route so we
just want to change that to router top
post okay and we don't even need to
validate I had that for some testing I
was doing so we're going to get rid of
that as well all right that's the only
thing that we need to change from what
we've already done I believe we also set
up our database config file so now we
want to do is you want to create our
model for our users okay because we're
going to have a model that's going to
hold all the fields and field and types
of fields which will be name password
email and username we're also going to
have our functions that interact with
the database in that file so let's go
ahead and create a folder okay so we're
going to create a folder called models
and we're going to create a file in
there called user dot j/s okay so in
here we want to bring in mongoose so
when i set that to require mongoose
and we also want to bring in bcrypt for
encryption and we want to set that to
require and we're going to require
bcrypt j/s because that's what we're
using and let's also bring in the config
file so click on config ok we're going
to go dot dot slash models slash
database okay so those are our includes
now we want to do is create a schema so
this is going to be a user schema so
we'll create a variable called user
schema and sip that to Mongoose dot
schema okay that's going to take in some
curly braces and then we define our
attributes okay so we want a name name
and that's going to have type string
next we'll have a let's see email type
can be string actually want to set whole
name doesn't have to be required but
email does so it's they required and
I'll set that to true okay then we have
username also a string and we're also
set that to true
okay then password same thing okay so
that's our schema those are the
attributes we want now we can always add
more later so don't worry about that and
then underneath that we want to create a
variable called user uppercase EU and we
want to make it so that we can use this
from outside so we need to do module
exports and then we're going to set it
to Mongoose model which will take in the
name of the model user and then the
schema so user schema all right
now I want to create two basic functions
in this file one to get the user by it
by their ID and want to get it by the
username so when we want to use
functions outside we have to do module
dot exports and then dot the function
name so let's say get user by ID
actually we want to set that equal to
function and that's going to take in the
ID and callback and then down here we're
just going to say user user dot will use
the mongooses function find by ID and
then that's going to take an ID and
callback okay so now we can call this
from outside we're also going to do by
user name
okay that's going to take in username
and then we have to create a query for
this because we're going to use the find
one function which takes a query so
let's do cons query going to be an
object I'll say username by username a
team passed in here okay and then we'll
just change this to find one and change
this to query okay and that should do it
so let's save that so now we want to do
excuse me we want to do our registers so
we're going to go to routes users and
then to our post register again make
sure this is post not yet and actually
let's bring in a couple things first so
we're going to bring in our model so
user dot dot slash model slash user and
that's actually all we need right now
but I might as well bring in the other
stuff that we need so we'll bring in
passport
and we're also going to need the JSON
web token module so mostly comps will
call its JWT and set that to jason web
token okay and then down here on the
register we're going to create a new
user so it's like Const actually fused
let for this so let new user equals and
then I'm going to instantiate a user
object from our model so new user and
then we're going to pass in an object
with a name and then we're going to get
whatever submitted in the form we can
get with questi
dot name email username and password
all right and this is a plaintext
password we're going to run it through a
function called calm decrypt hash that
will hash it before it goes into the
database so we have this user this new
user object and now what we want to do
with it is call a function called add
user which we'll put in our model as
well so let's through user dot add user
okay and then we're going to pass in
here that new user object and then a
callback okay and this callback is going
to have an error there is one and then
user okay and then we're going to do our
response
so we'll say if there is an error then
let's just do respond dot
jason I send some JSON content and it's
going to have a successful u which is
going to be false because the user isn't
registered and then a message and the
message will just say fail to register
user okay and then else so if everything
goes okay we're going to again res Jason
except we're going to say success is
true and our message will say user
registered okay so let's save that and
now let's create the add user inside of
the model
adduser is a function okay and that's
going to take in that new user object
and then our callback callback okay
because we did the actual callback in
the row and then in here now let's see
what we're going to do here we're going
to go ahead and hash the password now we
need to call a function called bcrypt
dot Jen salt so we're going to generate
a salt which is basically like a random
key that's used to hash the password
we'll say it's going to be 10 10 l2
called let me just look this up real
quick so bcrypt jsut may want to look at
the documentation anyways let's see we
need to do Jen salt we're passing in 10
which is rounds 10 rounds and the
default is 10 as well so we want to do
that and then we want to have our
callback which will have the error and
salt and then we can call the hash
function pass in the salt and it will
give us back our hash password all right
so let's go ahead and do that so we'll
put an arrow function here that's going
to be error and salt and then we want to
do the hash so decrypt dot hash it's
going to take in the password so new
user dot maybe use your dot password and
then the salt and then the callback okay
and that callback will give us an error
if there is one and then the hash so now
we want to do is take the password
that's in the new user object which is
whatever they submit the form and then
make that into the hash so we can do
that with new user dot password
equals hash okay and then we can go on
to save it so the user dots
save and just pass in that callback
right there okay
actually let's we didn't check for the
error so we'll say if our bro error all
right so we should now be able to
register and also get our passwords
encrypted so let's test it out now I'm
using postman to do this if you want
just say postman Chrome and using the
Chrome extension so you can go ahead and
download it says watch out for me
because I have it already installed but
you can use anything that makes HTTP
requests you could just use curl if you
want
rest easy is another good utility but
we're just going to use postman so let's
make a post request to http localhost
3000 slash users slash register and then
we want to add for the headers we're
going to have the content type I'm going
to submit it as Jason so application dot
slash Jason and then the body I'm going
to send raw and let's do actually let's
do name John Doe email
and username I'll just say John and
password
okay so we're submitting a plaintext
password but it's going to encrypt it
for us so let's go ahead and try that
could not get any response see what this
says required true unexpected identifier
oh and then put a comma here
and cut fine module models database oh
that's wrong it's conflict database
sorry about that guys hopefully that's
it let's go ahead and try the register
again send true user registered good so
now if we go down here to the Mongo
shell and say show be beads we have a
mean off database so if they use mean
off and let's say show collections so we
have a useless collection and look we
didn't have to even set up this database
we didn't have to create that collection
this is a lot more flexible in something
like MySQL where you would have to go in
create your tables you have to create
every single column you want along with
each field type this is much more
flexible so we can say DB users dot find
and then let's add dots pretty which
will make it look a little cleaner and
there's our guy so we have our ID which
is an object ID kind of like a primary
key in a relational database our name
email username and look at the password
the password is now encrypted okay so
we're not storing those plaintext
passwords all right so we now have a
registration system so I'm going to cut
it here and then in the next video we're
going to setup passport with a local
strat another local strategy a JWT
strategy so that we can authenticate and
get a token back okay so I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
