lerigot from scratch in the last video
we implemented authentication we can
login now we have our dashboard that's
just displaying our posts when we create
a post it's going to automatically put
the logged in users ID in so we did all
that stuff now what I want to do is
implement some access control and some
safeguards there's a few things that we
need to do one is if we if I log out
here and then I go to slash Coast slash
create it's going to work and it
shouldn't because guests shouldn't be
able to create posts so that's the first
thing we're going to tackle now
implementing authentication is pretty
easy basically we just have to include
the middleware so if we for instance if
we look at the dashboard controller we
have in the class we have a constructor
here which is a function that runs when
the class is instantiated it calls this
middleware off and it's as simple as
that to block everything everything in
the dashboard is going to be blocked if
the user isn't authenticated so we can
just mimic this in our post controller
so let's copy this I guess you know I
guess we'll just copy the whole thing
it's good to comment your code like this
when I do tutorials I tend not to do
that just because it takes so much time
but if you're writing a real production
application you definitely want to
include your your comments here and it's
good to say what it returns if it does
return something also if it takes
variables or I'm sorry parameters and so
on so what I'm going to do is go to the
post controller and notice that we don't
have a constructor here so I'm going to
just paste that one and I just copied
and if I go ahead and save this and then
we go back over here and reload it's
going to kick a sell which is what it
should do but it's not going to let us
in any cut any type of post and we don't
want that we want to be able to display
the post and also the individual page
which is the show view so what we can do
is we can add exceptions to the the auth
middleware and it's simple to do all we
have to do is pass in an array and we
can say accept
and then we can set that we can set that
to point to an array of views that we we
want to add an exception for and it's
going to be the index which is the list
of blog post and it's going to be the
show which is that just the displaying
the individual posts so let's save that
and now if we go back here we go to blog
it works if we go to the show page it
works but if we go to post slash create
we get booted out which is what we want
if I go ahead and login we can create a
post
all right so very very simple to
implement and you could just imagine how
difficult this would be if we were just
using straight-up PHP or we were
creating our own framework or something
like that
laravel makes this stuff very easy so
another thing we want to do if we log
out and we go to a blog post to a show
page we can see the edit and delete and
we can't edit or we can't delete but we
don't want these buttons to even show
because it doesn't really make any sense
so that's pretty easy to do all we have
to do is go to the view so we can go to
our resources views and we want to go to
the show template and go down to where
we have these links and let's just put
an if statement here so we can simply
say if not off guess we're going to end
that down here after the delete all
right so if the user is not a guest then
they'll be able to see this okay
so let's save that and go back reload
and now the user can't see it so very
very simple if we log in let's actually
log in as John Doe which I think was
tested test com
all right if we go to our dashboard we
only did post five but if I go to post
four we can still see edit and delete
and we can actually edit and delete we
don't want that because this isn't john
doe's post so this solution is really
easy to hide these and that's just to go
right under this and we're going to do
an if and we're going to say if off user
ID is equal to the post user ID then
this is okay they'll be able to see it
alright so the user has to match the
post the post user ID and now if I go to
post 5 which is john doe's we can see
the buttons now what we what still isn't
right is that if we go to our post 5 and
we just manually go to the URL of edit
we can still edit we don't want that so
we have to go into the controller and
let's go to lets you create i'm sorry
not create edit so if we go to edit and
let's go before we actually do anything
and actually no we have to go after the
post because we have to check the user
ID so right here let's say let's put a
comment will say check will say check
for correct user so we'll say if
remember when we were in the controller
we can access the users ID with off user
ID and we want to match that i want to
say if it's not equal if it's not equal
to the post user ID the current post
that we're viewing then we want to
redirect so let's just copy this we
don't want to show this view the edit
view we just want to redirect actually
this is going to be returned redirect
and then we want to go to slash posts
and then we're going to say with error
and for the message so the message will
just say unauthorized page okay so let's
save that and we'll go back and let's
reload this page and we get unauthorized
page if I go to post five and edit
everything's okay alright so we now have
protection against other people editing
people's posts and then we want to do
the same thing for the delete so we'll
just copy this and go down to destroy
right under the where we get the post
and just paste that in alright so now
the user can't edit or delete anyone
elses stuff all right so I think that's
going to be it guys if you see any
because I just open atom oops if you see
any issues here that I'm missing as far
as security or access control feel free
to let me know in the comments you know
the only time that that that stuff
bothers me if you guys correct me is if
you're an asshole if you say if you're
genuine then that's what I want I don't
want you know things to be wrong so if
you see any errors or you see something
that should be fixed and remember it's
not a production app so it's not going
to be you know as secure as a production
app would be but just basic things like
access control feel free to let me know
all right so I think that's going to be
it guys in the next video probably going
to be the last video as far as you know
what we have for now
is going to be file uploads I want the
blogs to be able to have an image
associated with them so we'll get into
the storage library and that stuff so
thanks for watching guys if you like in
the series please let me know by leaving
a like or a comment or you know whatever
you can do is is great and thanks for
