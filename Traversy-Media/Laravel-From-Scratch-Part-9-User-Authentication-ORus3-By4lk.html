credit application with laravel we're
going to now work on authentication and
access control so if we look in our
database we have a user's table because
laravel ships with this migration if we
go to database migrations and it creates
the users table if now if you wanted to
add extra fields here you could have
added them here before and then ran the
migration or you can even add them now
and run it but this is fine for what
we're going to do name email password ID
so what we're going to do is we're going
to enable authentication and we already
have the users table so to enable
authentication we can just run an
artisan command so let's go ahead and do
let's go to our terminal hair and all
you have to do is PHP artisan make off
okay this one command is going to
basically enable all the the user model
all the controllers the auth controllers
here and we're going to have a login
system that's going to just work right
off the bat which is just friggin
awesome so let's run that now this here
when you create authentication it
creates a layout for you and the layout
is very similar to what we have now
which is just a nav bar it uses
bootstrap and it creates a form for your
registration and all that well actually
those are views but the layout it
extends from so if we go to resources
views it's going to replace this app dot
bleed dot PHP file and I'm actually
going to let it okay but before I do
that I'm just going to copy everything
that's in that file and just go to a new
file and paste it in just so I have that
okay because there is some stuff that
we're going to have to add back and
stuff all right now let's close that up
and let's say yes so now if we go and
let's close this and look at our app
blade file and it added a bunch of stuff
for us and some of this stuff we can
actually use so for
since it added this CSRF token which we
would have had to add later anyways for
security reasons
it gives us a nav bar and if we look
down here it has all kinds of logic so
on the right side of the nav bar it's
going to have a login and register link
alright and it's going to check to see
if we're guests if we're not logged in
it'll display that else then it's going
to display a drop-down with our username
and also a logout function so let's go
ahead and save it and go back reload and
this is the navbar that is included it
has a login and register link and these
pages are going to work just by enabling
the authentication that we did we should
be able to register and all that but
let's fix the nav bar there's some
issues here you don't have our pages our
links here anymore
you also see we have some margin under
it so if we go to our layout file the
new one app PHP the nav bar is right in
the layout and we didn't do that we had
it inside of an include so what I'm
going to do is copy or cut the whole nav
bar out and we're going to go to our nav
bar include and let's just go under all
this and paste it in okay and then we'll
take what we need from our old one which
is this ul here with all the pages so
we'll copy that and we're going to put
it right above this ul that has the nav
bar right okay and then we're also going
to remove the static nav bar static top
now if you want to go back to the black
nav bar over the white one you can
change this to nav bar inverse actually
let yeah let's do that or you can keep
it white with nav bar default okay it's
up to you and let's see what else we
need here let's save that make sure it
looks okay we will just need to go back
to our layout and include it
and also we should have a container
class here all right and then remember
we also had the messages include so
we're going to make sure we put that
back all right excuse me let's try that
all right so we have two nav bars now
because I forgot to remove it from here
so it's just actually one more thing we
need to create post to link so it's just
we'll cut that out and then we'll just
delete the rest of this so the create
post I actually only want that to show
if we're logged in so let's go right
let's see I'll just go right here I
guess no not here not in the drop-down
you know what let's just leave it out
for now so it's safe and now we have our
nav bar that actually makes sense so we
have all of our pages and we have our
login and register links so let's go
ahead and try registering email address
so just do brad at gmail password and
register okay so what it does by default
is it registers us it signs it logs us
in and it brings us to /home and if we
look over here in our controllers it
gives us a home controller now
personally I don't like the name home I
would rather the speed dashboard because
that tells us that it's actually a
back-end you know instead of just home I
think of the index page
our home that the page index so what I
want to do is change all of the
instances of home to dashboard you don't
have to do this but it's just something
that I like to do so first of all is
change it to dashboard controller okay
and then down here it says index we're
going to show a view called dashboard
not home save that and actually we need
to rename it so let's go over here and
change home controller to dashboard
controller now things are going to break
because there's some other places we
need to change things as well so in the
auth controllers if we go to forgot
password actually that's the only one we
don't have to change but if we go to
login controller we're going to change
home slash home to slash dashboard so
that it brings us to the right place
after we log in same with the register
controller will change this save that
and also the reset password controller
okay so change all those now we need to
change the links to two slash home or
the routes I'm sorry so we'll go down to
our routes file which is where is it
routes web dot PHP and notice that it
automatically puts in this author routes
it did that when we ran the artisan
command and it also created a route to
the home ok but we want to change this
to dashboard and change this to
dashboard controller and just going to
get rid of the name here all right so
let's save and now I believe everything
should work I'm going to log out ok
we'll go and login
see something's wrong all the view we
didn't change the view named so we have
to go down here and change home blade to
dashboard blade there we go so now we
have our dashboard now what I want to do
is make it so that when we create a post
actually let's put a link here to create
a post so we'll go to dashboard blade
and let's go right into the body here
and let's see what do I want to do here
we're going to have an area for our
posts so let's just put a heading we'll
say your blog posts we're not going to
do that just yet but I just want to put
it there and then we'll put a link to
slash post slash create and give it a
class of BTN BTN primary and then let's
have that just say create post okay
let's check that out
all right good now when we create a post
I want to insert the user ID as a field
now if we go to our post table we don't
have that here okay we have title body
but we don't have any area for user ID
so what we'll do is create a migration
that's going to add that to this table
so let's go to artists on our command
line or terminal and we're going to do
PHP artisan and we want to do make
migration and you want to give this a
very descriptive name so we'll say add
underscore user ID two posts we'll just
do add user ID two posts
okay so let's go ahead and run that
created migration now if we go over to
database migrations you'll see add user
ID to coast so we're going to open that
up and right now if we if we do PHP
artisan migrate it's going to run this
but nothing's going to happen because
there's nothing in the up or down
function so what we want to do is first
go to the up function and we're going to
say schema table I'm going to do schema
table and then the name of the table we
want to work with which is posts all
right and then it's going to take a
second parameter which will be a closer
which will be a function and that's
going to take in the parameter of table
and then we can put we can add whatever
we want here so let's say table we want
this to be an integer and we want to
call it user underscore ID all right so
when we run the migration it's going to
add this to this table now if we go down
if we want to roll roll it back then we
just want to delete that column you want
to delete user ID so let's copy this and
then instead of doing table into your
user ID we're going to do table drop
column user ID all right and we'll save
that and now we'll go and run it so
let's go to our terminal and we're going
to do PHP artisan migrate okay now let's
go look at our database to reload this
and now you'll see that our posts have a
user ID column okay so we didn't have to
go into PHP myadmin or the SQL shell and
do it ourselves we can just run a
migration and if we wanted to undo that
we could just do PHP artisan PHP artisan
migrate rollback now for right now I'm
just going to manually change these to
the ID of one just so they belong to
someone
all right and if we go to our users
table we have our user here okay with
the idea of one now when we insert or
when we create a pose so let's go over
to our post controller once this we can
close that up now so let's go to post
controller and go to the store okay
because that's where it's going to get
submitted to the forum and we just want
to put right here we want to add post
user underscore ID now we're not setting
that to a request because it's not
coming from the forum but now that we
have authentication enabled we can
access we can use off user and then we
can get any other user fields but we
want the ID okay so this will get the
currently logged in user and put it into
the user ID and then save it so let's
save that and then we want to do the
same thing with the update actually no
the update we don't because it's never
going to change the user won't change so
let's just try this out now so we'll go
back to that oh we don't have a
dashboard link let's we need to do that
so in our nav bar which is right here
and I guess we'll put it we'll put it in
the drop-down so just like we have a
logout here say it's actually let's grab
the L I know we don't need all that
let's just type it in so we'll say Li
and then this is going to be a link to
slash think it's just dashboard
all right let's try that all right so
now if we create a post let's see where
we at we have one two three so let's
create four whoa is the editor wait a
second what happened in the editor
oh the layout we got rid of it shoot so
we got to go back to our app dot layout
or app dot blade I'm sorry and let's see
we just need to put that JavaScript back
so let's go back to the documentation
for a laravel - CK editor and we just
need this okay put that right down here
and save and that should give us the
editor back good so close for submit and
now if we go and look in our database
and go to our post table you can see
that post four got ID user ID one okay
so if we were logged in with someone
with the user ID of two then two would
have got put there so that way we can
track what posts belong to what user all
right and I'm going to show you how to
actually add a relationship in the model
as well okay so we're going to get into
that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
