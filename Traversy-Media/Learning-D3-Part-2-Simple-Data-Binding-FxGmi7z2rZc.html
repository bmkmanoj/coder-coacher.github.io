d3 in the first video I just showed you
how to how to do basic selections how we
can use d3 dot select and d3 dot select
all to target Dom elements and do things
like change styles and/or change the
content in this video I'm going to show
you how we can bind data very simple
data to the Dom alright so what I'm
gonna do is I just have a same list of
items here and I'm gonna create an array
and they call it num array and just put
some random numbers in here we'll say
twelve twenty thirty three forty and
fifty five okay so what I want to do is
bind these values to the Li tags here
alright so we're gonna use d3
dot select all and we want to target the
l eyes so the ul has a class of items
and we want the allies okay just like a
jQuery selector now what we're going to
do is bind the data by using the data
method okay and we're going to pass in
the number a alright and now we can do
different things to each piece of data
here so let's change the text
and what we want to do here is provide a
function that we can pass the data to
and then we can return whatever we want
let's return we'll say this is item so
this is an item item number and then
we'll just concatenate on that D alright
so if we save that and reload now you
can see that the content has changed and
it reflects that particular index of
this array all right so we're binding
this data to these list elements so this
here exactly isn't really useful you
wouldn't really do this for anything
that I can think of but it shows you how
it works at its core how you're binding
the data and there's just a ton of
different things you can do you don't
have to just use it to actually display
the data in its raw form let's take a
look at something else okay so let me
just comment this out
and what I'm gonna do is actually I'll
just I'll just go down here all right so
I'm going to do the same thing let it
stay select all and we want
items a lie and we're gonna find the
data all right and this time I'm going
to use the style style method and we're
going to grab the font size and we're
going to apply function pass in the data
and what I'm going to do is just return
the data and then we're going to add on
pixels okay so what we're doing is we're
taking the data and we're applying it as
a font size so if we save that and we
reload now you can see that each item
here has the font size of whatever that
current index is all right so this here
is going to be the 55 pixels and the top
one is 12 pixels all right so just
another example you can use it in your
styles so I want to actually grab this
back just
uncomment it and Commodus
okay so what I want to show you now is
if I go ahead and I add to this
okay I'm adding more items to the array
and if I reload it's still only going up
to this one here 55 that's because we
only have five list items all right so
how do we deal with the rest of this
data that's not being trimmed that's not
being displayed here well we can use the
enter and exit methods and if we go to
the d3 homepage and go down to enter and
exit it says using d3 s enter in exit
selections you can create new nodes for
incoming data and remove outgoing nodes
that are no longer needed all right so
this is a good example right here
so let's apply this to what we're doing
all right so what we'll do is say d3
actually we need to put this in a
variable
and we're gonna say d3 dot select and we
want to select the body the top level
and we're gonna say select all list
items we're binding the data
same thing and then we're going to
return that's just like we've been doing
all right and then after that we're
going to take that Li and we're going to
apply dot enter and dot append okay
because we want to append more allies
even after the Dom elements run out
alright so down here we'll just do dot
txt and we'll do the same thing I'll
just grab that okay we're just
outputting the string with the the data
on the end all right and then finally we
just have to do the exit so I'm gonna
say exit dot removals all right now if I
save that and we go back and reload now
you can see that we have the rest of the
data okay we have 60 through 90 so no
matter how many numbers we have here if
I go ahead and add a bunch more save and
reload it's going to a pen it's going to
keep on appending it as long as they're
still data there so that everyone gets
displayed or whatever you want to do
with it all right so that's simple data
binding and obviously you don't have to
just use an array we could just if we
want to save our name and set that to
John Doe and then we could go down here
and say D three dots
select and let's actually just add a
paragraph up here actually we'll do it
at the top and we'll say my name is and
then we'll put in a span and we'll give
it a class of name ok nothing nothing in
it just this span and then down here
we'll say that we want to select dot
name so anything with the class of name
and then I'm gonna say dot txt and we'll
pass in we're gonna pass it name
all right so if I reload we get my name
is John Doe okay so you can get buying
any kind of data to any kind of element
all right so hopefully this was helpful
I know this here again isn't something
that you would do but it's just to show
you how it works in the next video we're
going to create a very basic chart using
d3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
