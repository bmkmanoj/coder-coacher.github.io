we have installed node Cassandra and
we've created our application we've
generated a new Express application we
installed our modules including the the
Cassandra driver now what we need to do
is start creating our routes okay so the
index route is used for this for
basically the home page we don't have
any slash and then in the page we're
just using index so if we look at our
file structure here we want to go to
routes and then to index so I'm going to
open that up
okay so there's not much content in the
default index file basically what we're
doing here is just bringing in the
Express module itself and also the
router and then here we're making it so
that when someone makes a get request
well basically when someone visits the
the index page or the home page this is
going to happen all right and what this
is is it's just rendering of you it's
rendering the index view so index dot
Jade alright and then the second
parameter here we're passing an object
with different values in this case we
have one value of title and it's just
labeled Express alright and if I go to
the views and go to index which is where
that's being sent to we're using the
title variable in the heading and also
in this paragraph we're saying welcome
to title which here is set as Express
and that's exactly what we see okay so
we can actually change this
- right subscribers and save now if I go
ahead and reload it you can see it
didn't change and that's because when we
edit a JavaScript file we need to
restart the server so we're going to do
a ctrl C to stop it and then to restock
NPM start
all right and now if we reload now we
have the my subscribers alright so
obviously we don't want to just output
static text so we need to implement and
use the Cassandra driver okay so the
first thing we need to actually include
it up here
okay so Sandra
Kassandra driver okay so now that's
being brought in now we need to
instantiate a client variable so
variable client is equal to a new a new
Cassandra instance alright and in here
we just need to include this is where we
include the options we want and in this
case we just want to define contact
points and that's going to be equal to
our local host or our loopback which is
127.0.0.1 okay and then underneath we're
gonna say client dot connect
okay and that's gonna take in a function
and that function is gonna have a
parameter for error and also result all
right and all we want to do here after
it connects is just give us a console
log
okay so let's say so this is the index
file so we'll say index Cassandra
connected okay now down here for the get
we're just like I said we're just
bringing in the index view but I'm just
gonna get rid of this for now all right
and before we do anything there we need
to create our query so I usually use a
variable that's relative to the query so
this will be get all subscribers and I'm
gonna set that through the query so
select all from subscribers and then
down here we're going to use the client
dot exec exact execute
and we want to execute the query which
is called get all subscribers okay and
then the next parameter is going to be a
set of options that you want to pass you
usually do this when you make a post
request but this isn't we're not going
to pass anything so we'll leave that
blank and then we just need a function
okay and this function will take error
and result okay so what we want to do
when this executes is we want to check
to see if there is an error so I'm gonna
say if power and we also want an else
statement here okay so if there is an
error we want to change the status to
404 which is an error page I'm sure that
you've gotten them plenty of times in
your life and then we're just going to
send the message as well so send and we
need to just throw an object in here
with message okay message and that's
gonna be the error okay so this error
message is coming from here okay which
is ultimately coming from here
now if there isn't an error then we want
to render the index just like it that
was here by default so whereas render
index let's see render index and
we need to also have the options here
that we want to send with it and what we
want to send is the result the rows that
are returned from this query so we can
do that say subscribers and that's going
to be equal to the result dot rows okay
so what we're going to be doing is
sending the rows to the to the index
view and then from there we can loop
through them and then output all of the
subscribers all right so this looks good
let's save it and now we need to go to
the view file ok so index dot Jade and
we're going to change this around I'm
gonna get rid of this title variable and
we're just gonna type in subscribers and
then down here I want to have an
unordered list okay and then inside
there I want a list item notice that I
did the indentation because we want the
list item to be inside the atul tag and
then I should be able to just
actually you know what we need to run
the loop before we do the ally so to run
the loop we're going to use each
subscriber I in subscribers and then for
each subscriber we want to list item and
we want let's say we just want the the
email for now
all right so let's say that and just see
if it works so we need to restart the
server control see
and you've noticed that we're getting
the index Kassandra connected so that
means that we're connected to Cassandra
now if we reload the homepage and we're
getting a message no key space has been
specified all right so that's a very
simple thing to fix inside of the index
view we said select all from subscribers
but we need to actually have the key
space name as well because we could have
a subscribers in a different key space
and it wouldn't know which one to choose
so just make sure you have the name of
the key space okay we should still we're
start the server okay now we'll reload
let's see subscribers invalid
indentation see I don't even know why I
keep using sublime text with this with
with node so this is on what page this
is in the index alright so I'm just
gonna kind of reset everything here
that
okay so that should be good
all right
so looks like it is getting the info
from the database you can see we have
three bullet points here but that your
content itself isn't showing and that's
because we need to have subscriber dot
email alright so there are the emails in
our Cassandra database now I also want
to put a link I want these to be
clickable all right and when we click on
one it should go to slash subscriber
slash and then the ID which will be some
kind of long string like this or
whatever alright so what this means is
that we need to create a subscriber
route all right in view so we'll do that
but before we do that let's go ahead and
make this these emails clickable and go
to the correct place so back in the view
I'm gonna I'm gonna do is put this on a
new line because we now need a link so
from here we want to tab over and we're
gonna have a link when you're using Jade
and you want to add attributes to a tag
you just want to put it in parentheses
so in this case we're going to say href
and basically this what we want it to go
to is slash
subscriber /
subscribe our dots ID I think that's
what we want let's go ahead and save
that okay so they're linkable click on
one and you can see it goes to
subscriber and then the ID so that's
what we want so we need to create a new
route a new route a new view okay so in
views let's go ahead and create a new
text document
and we're gonna call this subscriber dot
Jade okay you know might as well open
that and then we also need to create in
the routes actually I'm gonna just
rename the users route subscriber and
we'll open that and then finally we need
to add to the app dot J s file okay so
here I'm going to change users to
subscriber
and this is going to be routes slash
subscriber and then down here change
this
save that
and then inside of the subscriber j/s
file which was the user dot J's file
we're gonna just actually need to copy a
few things from the index JavaScript
file and then call I want to copy all
this
okay
now what I need to do is create the
query that we want so variable and I'm
going to call this yet let's see we'll
say get
by ID
she'll just say get subscriber by ID
remember we need people dot subscribers
and then we're going to have we're ID is
equal to question mark
alright now down here in this get
request I'm just gonna get rid of this
and then we're not gonna go to just
subscriber we need to go to subscriber
slash and then the ID so we want to what
we need a colon here and ID alright and
then here we're gonna do our client dot
execute and we want to pass in get
subscriber by ID and then for as far as
options we need to we need the request
parameter so I think it's requests
programs dot ID
all right and then our function okay the
function will take an error and result
and then I'm gonna copy from index J s I
just grab this right here
okay paste that in if there is an error
they'll get a 404 page with a message if
not we want to render the subscriber
view and we need a few things with it
we're not going to pass the whole row
set we're just getting one row or value
from one row so we're going to get the
email so that'll be result dot rows zero
because there should only be one result
and we want dot email all right copy
that all right might as well get the ID
as well I guess
so ID
email first name
last name I'm sorry this should be first
name as well and then this will be last
name
all right so now what we need to do is
the view file so subscriber Jade okay we
want to extend layouts lock contents and
let's see we're going to have an
unordered actually let's have a heading
first we'll have an h1 and we'll say
subscriber details and we want an
unordered list okay then indent then a
list item with the first name
last name
email
and let's see actually let's also do
user ID
all right and if we save that restart
the server
okay go ahead and reload this click on a
user we get subscriber details Bob
Johnson get this email also get his user
ID all right so that's exactly what we
wanted what we want to be able to do
next in the next video is to add
subscribers okay so I have a simple form
that will send it to Cassandra through a
Google send it to the application
through a post request and we'll add it
to the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
