is about trying to make you guys a
better program or a web developer web
design or whatever it may be and of
course I do tutorials and training but I
occasionally like to do the self-help
kind of presentation to address issues
that you may or our most likely we'll
run into in this industry whether you
work for a company or you're freelancing
so we're gonna look at some of the
common problems and issues that a
programmer deals with from both a
technical standpoint and just from a
social and life standpoint and I've made
a few similar videos so you may see some
things that are reoccurring but I think
that they're important to address and
talk about even if it's in multiple
videos because I may only talk about
that that one thing for you know three
or four minutes in a video so what we're
gonna do is look at each problem or
issue and then we're gonna talk about
some solutions and suggestions that will
hopefully help some people out alright
so first when you decide to become a
developer whether it's you know web
developer or any kind of programmer at
all you realize the sheer volume of
technology that's out there and it's
completely overwhelming that feeling
never actually completely goes away
because new things are always coming out
even technologies that you've been
working with they're constantly being
updated and changed and you're just
always learning so if you hate learning
I in all honesty my opinion is that this
is the wrong field for you because
you're always gonna be learning no
matter what however in the beginning the
stress of this is really bad and it's
confusing you have a boatload of
languages to choose from what language
is best for what you want to do you have
to learn programming fundamentals in
general like conditionals and loops and
then learn the specific syntax and best
practices for whatever language you're
learning alright you also have
frameworks databases with query
languages tools like IDE
terminals with commands dev tools
workflow practices and version control
then you have DevOps and deploy
how to maintain and update your code and
the list just goes on so what are some
of the things that you can do to you
know make this not have you smash your
monitor and say screw programming well
first of all you probably you're
probably feeling like you have you have
had to start yesterday and you you need
to be studying everything under the Sun
you need to spend 16 hours a day doing
this stuff getting this stuff in your
head but try not to have that mindset
even though it's probably the first one
that you're gonna have what you want to
do is just try to calm yourself down
pace yourself and focus on one thing at
a time now you'll probably be learning
multiple things at a time for instance
let's say you're learning the lamp stack
which is Linux Apache MySQL and PHP once
you learn the basics of PHP you'll most
likely start working with MySQL
alongside of the PHP language which
entails learning SQL or a structured
query language then you might learn a
framework like laravel so you will be
working with multiple technologies at
the same time but try to put most of
your focus on one at a time and what I
mean for example like don't start
learning MySQL and focusing on that
before you even know how to write a for
loop in PHP you want to make sure you
get the fundamentals of PHP down first
focus on that first and then move into
MySQL don't stop learning laravel before
you can even connect to a MySQL database
with vanilla PHP so you know focus on
the fundamentals of each thing before
moving to the next that's my advice
anyways otherwise your brain is just
going to explode now once you've learned
a stack and you can actually program
learning the next language or the next
stack is much easier and you can take on
a little more at once but for if you're
just starting out and you're a new
developer then try to just keep your
focus on one thing at a time all right
also try not to stress yourself out and
realize that you don't need to know
everything spend some time figuring out
what you want to do and what's required
and then make
decisions based on that okay have a plan
and then put some things in a list that
you want to learn all right one of the
best ways to learn is courses and
tutorials especially mine
I'm kidding well kind of but anyway
tutorials tutorials and courses will get
you going but you can't just do
tutorials and courses with other
people's projects you need to take what
you've learned from those courses and
you need to apply it to building your
own stuff okay I'm just going and
copying code from a tutorial it only
does so much for you you have to
actually take what you've learned and
then use that and to think critically to
create your own projects that that's my
that's the best advice that I can give
on how to learn so tutorials are very
necessary but it's not all there is to
it
okay so bugs and issues no matter what
type of programmer you are this is a
huge part of it this is a huge part of
the occupation and it's also a huge
source of frustration when you're seeing
constant error messages and you're
spending hours and sometimes even days
debugging and testing refactoring your
code over and over and then sometimes
you know you think everything is perfect
and you go to deploy to your server and
you get 50 more errors because the
application isn't playing nice with the
server or maybe you even just build your
project out on a Mac where you built it
on Windows or you created it on Windows
and it doesn't work you have to make
sure that your app works in all
environments and that can be very
stressful
these are all very tough and annoying
parts of this profession so what are
some of the things that can help with
this one thing that I see over and over
especially with new programmers is when
they get an error they don't really try
and read and process that error message
being a course instructor I see this
over and over and this is one of the
reasons why my q and A's and my courses
are so backed up because people get one
little error and they flip out and
immediately post a thread and in a lot
of cases it's just a word being
misspelled so one of the best ways to
learn is to try and figure it out on
your own that's real
how the real world works and that's the
best learning experience anyone can copy
a perfect tutorial and have nothing go
wrong but when you run into issues
that's that real-life stuff that you're
gonna be doing every day at a real job
so you need to really read your error
messages look at the line numbers see
exactly where that where where the piece
of code went wrong
search Google search Stack Overflow and
really dive into trying to fix that
error also learn how to test in debug
correctly things like unit testing and
to end testing this is an area that I
really lack in I hate writing tests but
in the long run it's gonna save you some
time and aggravation and this is
actually something that I really plan to
get into soon and start making videos on
so you know tools like jest and mocha
stuff like that all right now when you
run into issues try not to freak out
sometimes you can spend days on one
issue and it's kind of hard to keep it
together because you most likely have
deadlines but freaking out it really
doesn't help the situation sometimes you
just need a break stopping for the day
it may seem like a ridiculous thing to
do when you're strapped for time but
sometimes when you give your mind time
to kind of take a breather and you come
back the solution is as clear as day and
I can't tell you how many times this has
happened to me where I spent hours and
hours just trying to fix an issue find
out what's wrong and I finally just give
up out of frustration and then I come
back the next day after my mind is
rested after you know a good night's
sleep or whatever and the answer is
right in front of me that has happened
over and over again alright and make
sure you utilize sites like Stack
Overflow people are willing to help and
of course if you work with a team
utilize them as well there's a good
chance that a senior developer can help
you in just a few minutes so doggin
don't be scared to ask for help
okay another issue that we run into is
either someone telling us we're doing it
wrong or we just have we just have the
feeling we're doing it wrong and I'm
mostly talking about code that actually
works you just may not be doing it in
the best way
possible all right being an instructor I
run into this a lot because I put so
much of my work out there in public and
I get both constructive and destructive
criticism
okay people like to correct other people
especially developers and I've noticed
two types of criticisms or criticism I
guess as criticisms I don't know a
constructive criticism we all know what
that is it's when someone sees that you
you could do something a little
different and they politely offer a
suggestion to actually help you out then
you have destructive criticism and
you'll you'll see this a lot on on you
know YouTube and other social networks
this usually comes from a programmer
that is disrespectful and and most
likely miserable with their life in
their career and they're rude and
they're basically just trash-talking to
make themselves look or feel smarter it
really has nothing to do with helping
you out and that is destructive
criticism constructive is selfless and
helpful destructive is selfish and
pretty much useless and you will run
into both fortunately most people are
actually just trying to help you out and
they are giving you constructive
criticism alright it's hard because a
lot of the times there's a hundred ways
to do the same thing and everyone thinks
their way is the best it's also hard to
keep up to date with the most current
standards and syntax because things are
constantly changing especially in
JavaScript I love JavaScript it's it's
what I use the most but there's so much
that changes so frequently with both the
core language and and frameworks it's
just really hard to keep up with a lot
of this criticizing can cause low
self-esteem and impostor syndrome even
if it's even if it's polite constructive
criticism you can still kind of take it
harshly I have a video called self-doubt
in programming if you're interested in
you know hearing more about imposter
syndrome in this field so when you do
receive constructive criticism it may be
hard but try not to take offense to it
or let it make you feel stupid or like
you know you should have known this
etc let it actually help you become a
better programmer when I first started
this and people would suggest something
to me that I could have done better I
would get really aggravated and
discouraged but I've learned to now look
at that at those suggestions logically
and see if it actually is a better
solution which sometimes it's not but if
it is and that person is respectful I'll
thank them for it
they helped me become a better
programmer even if it's in a it's a tiny
little way now when it comes to
disrespectful self-righteous trolls that
are just basically making fun of you and
trying to make you feel like you
shouldn't even be doing this just ignore
those dipshits if if someone's rude and
they're being a prick to you are to me I
should say I wouldn't even consider
their solution and I've had quite a few
of these people you know being on
YouTube and so on YouTube can kind of
sometimes be a cesspool for just
negativity and I just blocked those
people those aren't people that I even
want watching my videos I know in a real
work setting you can't simply block them
but just try to ignore them stay away
from them and try to stick with the
right people
also like I said there's there's a lot
of ways to do the same thing and just
because someone gives you an alternate
solution that it doesn't mean that it's
you know quote unquote better maybe it's
a more modern way but maybe it's not
compatible and all in most browsers
people tend to think that because it's
new it's better and that's not always
the case so look at things like is it
compatible with other browsers does it
give you a performance boost does it
save on file size what else does it save
on code space does it make things more
readable if there's no benefit or
there's very little benefit then who
cares just do it your way you don't
always have to be on the cutting edge
but you should try and stay educated
with new standards and when it comes to
imposter syndrome you will get it
everyone does at some point just don't
let it get to you and make your career
decisions based on it because you will
regret it if you love doing this stuff
then do it there's always time there's
always room to
improve so another issue is adapting to
new workspaces and in new developers
that you'll be working with getting a
new job whether it's your first
developer job or your tenth it's very
intimidating and every company is
different with different workflows
different culture you could have two
jobs working with the same exact
technologies doing almost the same thing
in terms of like what you're building
but their culture their workflow and
interaction it could be something that
you don't even recognize so you have to
adapt to the way that they do things
whether you like it or not really and
that can be a very difficult thing to
deal with okay whenever you start a new
job you'll most likely get existing code
bases thrown at you and this can be kind
of terrifying you know starting a
project from scratch is one thing but
when you get existing code that you know
you don't even know who wrote it thrown
in your face and you're told to add to
it or edit it or do anything with it it
can be pretty terrifying
you also can't control who you work with
you could get a team that you love that
boosts your confidence and help they
help you become a better developer or
you can get a team that makes you feel
like crap and is of no help at all and
being under pressure with deadlines is
also very stressful so what are some
things that you can do to kind of help
this this whole situation out there's a
chance when you start a new job you may
have the urge to turn around and walk
right out I've had these urges before
with many jobs not just development jobs
but just remember it usually seems worse
at first because you're the new guy you
have no clue who anyone is or what
you'll be doing you know or even if you
can do the job at all but just try to
keep in mind that you will adapt and you
will learn how the company does things
and don't be ashamed to ask for help
nobody's gonna look down on you if you
ask for help and if they do then that's
just that's just an absolutely horrible
team and maybe you should rethink that
particular job be aware of your
deadlines but don't let that pressure
get to you try and relax
and don't overwork yourself a
stressed-out mind isn't one that is
going to think clearly or solve problems
or learn things so try to keep your mind
in a calm and just common collective
place and you eventually will fit right
in okay in most cases I'm not gonna say
with every single job you'll fit in but
with most cases you'll learn to adapt
and you'll fit in and you'll have
nothing to worry about and you can move
on with your career all right so working
with clients the last slide was was
basically for working with a company and
a team but if you're a freelancer and
you or you have your own company then
chances are you're dealing directly with
clients which is a whole whole nother
can of worms and it can be very
frustrating I have a lot of experience
in this area many of them they don't
know what they want even if they think
they do
most clients that know nothing about
programming or web development they
don't understand what actually goes into
a project they don't know that the
amount of work that it takes and they
want the world for a thousand dollars
like literally want a Facebook for a
thousand dollars so some tips on dealing
with tough clients and I'm not saying
all clients are bad some clients are
great and their understanding they're
smart they have knowledge about the
industry and they're they're great to
work with they're not stingy but there
are some very very tough people to work
with so you want to establish a very
clear agreement on the requirements of
the project that way you both know
exactly what you're doing and what
they're getting okay ask plenty of
questions so that you can get their
vision also offer suggestions and also
some limitations if there's something
you can't do make sure that that you
explain that don't tell them that you
can do something that you're not going
to be able to do all right explain what
goes into the project and establish a
reasonable timeline don't devalue
yourself and your time charge what you
believe your time is worth now if you're
just starting out like you're brand new
and you have no experience that you can
show no portfolio
then you do kind of have to take that
into account with your pricing and
you'll probably have to charge less than
average in the beginning I wouldn't say
that's devaluing yourself but you really
haven't proven yourself yet so I mean
it's only it's only it's understandable
that someone will want to pay less for
someone that has no basically proof of
what they can do all right
and of course try not to strangle them
that that never really works out it may
feel like the right thing to do but but
I don't know I'd suggest not doing that
alright so time management this is an
issue in all occupations but I think it
applies in development a little more
utilizing your time especially if you're
a new developer can be very tough also
leaving time for your family and friends
and hobbies and other things besides
programming it's really important you
don't want to get burnt out and if all
you do is code then you will being
unorganized
I'm not sitting goals that's also a
problem establishing your priorities and
making up for lost time due to bugs and
sometimes you know days of trying to fix
something these are all things that that
that you know they're all issues with
time management
so some solutions for this you want to
set clear project goals and I mean
long-term and short-term what's your
overall plan for the entire project but
also what are you doing today
what are you doing tomorrow the next day
use some kind of software to track your
time and your progress also adjust your
priorities and not only that constantly
rethink them for instance writing
perfect code shouldn't be a first
priority generally get something working
and get it up and running make sure that
you can actually do it and then refactor
it with you know not perfect there's
never perfect code but you know more
efficient code or more readable code
adding comments things like that you
know just prioritize your your project
you may also want to delegate when
feasible so if you're working with a
team and you have someone that can help
with a certain aspect of that project
then take advantage of that you know use
that and then lastly make time for other
things especially if you have a family
and kids you don't want to be at work
all day and then come home and then go
right to the office and keep working
establish clear lines between work and
other things and I've had issues with
this in the past I've worked from home
quite a bit most of my career actually
and it's kind of hard especially if you
work from home to separate that time
because you know you you're you're
technically off the clock but you walk
by your computer and you see you have an
email from a client so you feel like you
have to respond to them at least for me
I felt that way but you should really
establish clear lines and just know that
you know you'll respond to them tomorrow
during your work hours all right so last
slide here guys people that aren't
programmers especially people like
construction workers and people that do
hard labor they may laugh when we say
that this occupation can cause health
issues you know we it's it's a quote
unquote desk job
but sitting in a chair all they can
actually do horrible things to your back
and just a lack of exercise is just very
unhealthy also staring at a screen for
hours on end is bad for your eyes and it
can cause things like severe headaches
you also have mental health concerns
especially if you're freelancer and you
work alone all day and that's another
thing that I know all about not having
social interaction is is definitely not
a healthy thing so some solutions are to
take frequent breaks this is actually
very important I'd recommend around
every hour or so at the most two hours
take a five to ten minute break stretch
your legs maybe walk around for a bit I
myself I like to DJ I like to spin music
and I have my set up in my office so
I'll take a little break and I'll spend
a couple tunes get my mind in a relaxed
place away from coding
and you know go back to it and some
people like to do things like meditate
which is very healthy as well I also
suggest getting a sit-stand desk if you
can afford it that takes care of your
sitting down all day issue definitely
get exercise at least a couple times a
week I would definitely suggest getting
a gym membership if you can you know you
don't have to go crazy and be some
workout freak but even if you just go
and walk on the treadmill a couple times
a week and listen to music or or even
even watch tutorials which I do quite a
bit also make sure that you eat right
and you drink plenty of water a lot of
us programmers we love our coffee we
love our caffeine but you can't live on
coffee you do need to hydrate yourself
alright so I think that's it for now
guys like I said these aren't all of the
issues and hardships that come with with
being a programmer but I think it's
definitely some of the more common ones
and hopefully some of these solutions
you'll you'll work into your life in
your career and they'll help at least
some of you guys alright so thanks for
watching please like share and subscribe
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
