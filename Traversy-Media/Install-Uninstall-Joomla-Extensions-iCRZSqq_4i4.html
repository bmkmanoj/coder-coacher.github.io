simple tutorial I'm just going to show
you how to install an extension to your
joomla site you might already know how
to do this but this is what a very the
real beginners using joomla sorry I just
ate what you want to do is go to joomla
org and you can search for all kinds of
extensions extensions meaning components
modules or plugins there's three
different kinds component is as a it's
the biggest extension you can get for
joomla it actually replaces the whole
the whole article the whole main part of
your site a module is usually the little
blocks you see on the sides you know the
login modules or menu modules and
plugins are just really small really
small programs that just do stuff to put
it in a simple way but anyway that's not
what the story is about this is just to
show you how to install them but I'm
also going to download a new extension
to install so this is joomla org and
these are actually all download
extensions so though what they do is you
put them on your site and you can have
your users download stuff from you you
know you upload it to your site and they
can download it so what we're going to
do is download this Jay downloads so you
click on it it takes you to a nice
little summary and reviews put some good
reviews I actually use this extension
it's pretty great so click you can't you
can usually seek demos of extensions to
like right here you can click demo to
see a demo of it but we're going to
click download and it usually takes you
to the the developers site and you
download it from there
we're going to right here download j
downloads and all extremely extensions
come in a zip file so you save that i'm
going to save it to the desktop so now
we're going to go over to our backend
hope it's just i'm going to go to our
joomla backend i'm sure you know what
this is go up to extensions install
uninstall you can also want install
extensions from here which I'll show you
how to do so we're going to click browse
and find the gain down J downloads
extension i just downloaded it's a
component so it starts c om modules will
be mo d and plugins will be plg so click
that upload so now it's i installed
component success so now jay downloads
is now on the site it's not configured
it's not setup it's just on the site i'm
not going to go through configuring it
because they're all different obviously
they're all different but that's how you
install an extension so you go up to
it's a component like i said so you go
up two components and you'll see it
right here j downloads and you have all
these options control panel downloads
categories this is where you do all all
the j download stuff so that's how we
install it i'll actually show you the
control panel for jaidev for the
component so this is once again will you
do all the stuff to do with j downloads
now let's do an uninstall same thing go
to extensions install uninstall and
you'll see up here you can pick
components modules and plugins and
templates and languages we know that Jay
downloads was a component so click on
components
and this is a list of all the components
on your site some of them call
components that can't be uninstalled
these are the ones that came with joomla
and just have to be there so we're going
to click Jay downloads and click
