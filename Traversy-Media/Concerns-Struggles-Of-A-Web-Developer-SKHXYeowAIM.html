hey what's going on guys in this
presentation I'm going to talk about
some of the common questions and
concerns and struggles that people may
have when they get into programming and
web development and before we start I
just want to say that I do not have all
the answers nobody on the planet does
and many of these answers are completely
different from person to person a great
idea for me may be a horrible idea for
you and vice versa so take all of this
anything I say with a grain of salt the
purpose of this video is just to give
you a little insight and also for you to
know that some of the stuff that you
constantly think about and struggle with
is extremely common in this field and I
like doing these videos once in a while
because they really seem to help people
out and it's stuff that I would have
wanted to hear when I was getting
started so hopefully you enjoy this
alright so first thing we're gonna look
at is education and learning now when
you decide to be a programmer or a web
developer or a designer anything like
that you have a few different options
okay so this is one of the things that
really varies from person to person and
again take everything I say with a grain
of salt and do your own research for
everything never take one person's
advice or views into consideration and
that's it make sure you you do your
research and you talk to other people as
well
so first thing you could do is you could
go to college and you can get a degree
probably as a computer science degree
you could do a two-year degree four-year
you could do full-time part-time so even
if you make this choice you have a bunch
of other choices after that to make and
in my opinion you don't need college to
get a great job but it definitely helps
now when it comes to learning I think
many people not everybody but many
people can learn just as much
or more on their own than with college
and the reason for that is in college
even though you have really good
structure you have your you know your
classes and you have a lot of structure
you have to learn a bunch of crap that
you don't need to know for this field so
you do waste a lot of time I actually
did do a little bit of college and I can
tell you that I learned nothing that I
use today okay I did I was going for a
two-year see I'm computer science degree
and I had psychology statistics writing
a bunch of stuff that helped me in no
way whatsoever and during that time I
could have been studying you know Ruby
on Rails or PHP or whatever was popular
at that time I did have some Java and
basic computer science training but
nothing that was worth thousands of
dollars in all that time so even though
my experience even though that was my
experience and that's my view you may be
someone that needs structure to really
grasp grasp the knowledge and some
people just suck it self teaching and
those are the people that I think school
and think college is a really good thing
for plus you also get the social aspect
of it which is worth more than anything
else and in my opinion unless of course
you're going to like MIT or something
like that but I'm just talking about
just a regular college but that's that
that's something self teaching doesn't
give you is that interaction and that
communication with other people at least
in most cases now another option you
have is boot camp which I think boot
camps are much better than college it's
a much better deal because you do get
that social aspect and you get to skip
all the crap you don't need and focus on
new and useful technology most you know
small colleges they're not teaching like
nodejs
and you know some of the newer
frameworks and are teaching react boot
camps are they're also much shorter and
it gives you some really good experience
now I've never attended a boot camp but
I think they're great from from what
I've heard and what I've seen
I've even had some bootcamp sponsor my
videos I know people that have graduated
and learned a lot and found jobs right
away after boot camp so my personal
opinion is that boot camps are a better
choice than college but again take it
with a grain of salt all right now we
have self-learning or self-directed and
some online courses so sites like you to
me are great plural sites
Udacity you also have like free code
camp and what's the other one code
Academy YouTube tutorials written
tutorials and blog posts documentation I
can't stress how helpful documentation
can be as long as it's well-written it
may be a bit boring to read through but
it really teaches you a lot about that
specific language or framework or
whatever it is you're you're learning
about so this is how I learned and if
you're watching this video and you're a
subscriber then you're basically
learning the same way that I did all
right so again take anything that I say
with a grain of salt and it just really
think about it do some research and
figure out which route you want to take
in terms of Education all right so
that's the education part of it now what
about the learning the technology part
ok the technology itself what is it that
you want to do what do you want to study
I released a video called web
development in 2018 that really goes
into the different options you have as
far as languages and frameworks and all
that so if you really want to see your
options and get a little advice I'd
suggest that video but you want to
factor in a few things when you're
looking for or when you're looking to
learn a language or a framework you want
to look at the jobs so you can see you
know what's popular what's being used
who's hiring for what and sites like
indeed Stack Overflow
I think github there's a bunch of them
you can look up they all show what's
really popular
what's declining what's getting more
popular and you want to learn something
that you can actually find a job with so
that's one important factor another is
you want to learn something that you
enjoy
now PHP may have a few more jobs than
Python but if you despise writing PHP
and you love writing Python then go with
Python
I mean you may love like something like
Perl or something that is you know
there's no demand for so in a case like
that you may want to skip it and move on
to something else
and I'm sure that others would give you
different advice and say go wherever the
money is regardless but I don't agree
with that I think that doing what you
love is is more important than an extra
10 grand per year and if you love what
you do you're you're more apt to succeed
further than then with a language or
with technology that you don't really
enjoy all right so another question that
I see a lot is how many hours per day
should I study or code and this
obviously varies greatly depending on
your life situation if you have kids in
a family and a full-time job doing
something else you're not going to have
much extra time if you don't have a
family or you're not employed or your
current job doesn't give you a lot of
hours then you'll have more time to
study so I would definitely say code
every single day even it's if it's only
for a half hour and whether it's your
own projects or you're following along
with one of my tutorials just kidding
anyone's tutorial but hopefully mine I
don't really think there's a max to the
hours okay I'd say maybe eight because
if you think about it when you're work
when you work as a programmer you work
all day so why not study all day if
that's possible for you so my answer
would be basically as long as you can I
mean you know anything passed maybe
eight eight nine ten hours is overdoing
it you're gonna get burnt out but pretty
much as long as you can alright another
choice you have to make is if you want
to do front and front-end back-end or
full stack development if
someone that loves building user
interfaces and hates back-end logic and
databases and things like that then
you'll probably want to stick to the
front-end and if you hate design and
interface then and you love logic and
building api's and stuff maybe back-end
is your thing but I think most of us
strive to be full stack developers you
want to be able to build things from
start to finish on your own and chances
are you'll work with a team but you
still want to be able to work on both
sides
all right so unless you absolutely hate
one or the other I would suggest full
stack of course you also need to take
you know take what you can get in the
job world but just because you have a
front-end position doesn't mean that you
shouldn't strive to do full stack
someday maybe in that same company and
or maybe somewhere else
alright so hopefully that gives you a
little direction now this next topic is
something that I've talked about quite a
bit in a few other videos because it's
something that I deal with constantly
and yes I do have a channel with almost
250 K subscribers and I still sometimes
feel like maybe I'm not right for this
and I think that feeling for me will
never go away completely go away
sometimes it's worse than others
especially if I put a video out and they
make a stupid mistake or I miss
something simple that a viewer points
out which they should it can be kind of
a blow to my confidence and that's
something that I just have to personally
work on impostor syndrome is something
that is huge in this field and it's
basically when you feel like you've
gotten to a position by either luck or
because you knew one or two things and
you kind of feel like you fooled your
boss into hiring you but you don't
really fit in you don't really belong
there
that's that's kind of the gist of
impostor syndrome you feel like a fraud
in some ways and in most cases that's
that's not reality it's completely in
the person's head of course there's
always more to learn but usually they're
there right where they should be alright
it's just kind of a lack of self
confidence you may ask yourself in your
brain
or ask yourself if your brain is built
for this I'm not the Matthew type I hear
I've heard that a lot well I can tell
you that I absolutely suck at math I've
said this before you only really need
two really good math skills if you're
doing really low-level deep programming
and complex algorithms
you don't need math to be a web
developer that's just a fact
building REST API is and user interfaces
requires no math or maybe very little in
some cases now I've shared this before
but I was kind of a punk teenager I
smoked a lot of weed every single day
drank a lot of alcohol I got into harder
drugs and they did a lot of damage to
myself including my brain but once I
straightened my life out and you know I
had kids and stuff I fell in love with
programming and that passion drove me to
be able to learn things that I never
thought I could learn so passion is a
huge part of success in this field so
you should love to learn this stuff if
you don't you can still have a career
but it's the most passionate people that
really move forward unless you're one of
those people the very few people that
this stuff just comes really easy to and
they only have to put in minimal effort
the there are people like that I
certainly I'm not one of them I bust my
ass to learn everything that I know and
everything I've taught in this channel
but there are some people that it just
comes easy to and and they don't they
don't really have the passion it's just
easy for them alright another feeling
you guys may get in school or in boot
camp is that everyone around you just
seems to get it so they're halfway done
with their coding project and you're
sitting there struggling to even begin
and I had this exact experience in
school in my java class now I could have
quit back then when I had that feeling
and and and I think about that now I
could have just thought you know my
brain is too screwed up by mesta you
know I smoked a lot of pot when I was
younger I don't have the ability to
think like these people do and imagine
if I did that I'd still be working in a
machine shop or putting up insulin
in making crap money and breaking my
back doing it and now I'm making more
than I ever thought I'd make and I'm
also teaching this stuff so this isn't
because I'm a genius but because I love
it and I have the passion for it I look
forward every day to to learning new
things making videos teaching and yes
it's hard but I like hard I like
difficulty because it challenges me and
it keeps me from being bored alright so
once you finally do figure it out it's
almost like a high so about 11 years ago
I literally replaced opiates with code
and I share that stuff with you guys
because I'm not ashamed of where I came
from I'm actually really proud of it and
I dealt many of my viewers where a drug
headaches at one point in their life but
I'm sure you guys have struggled with
something some kind of addiction or
depression or something like that and if
you haven't yet overcome it you can and
you will and you can use coding as a
tool to do that alright so here's an
answer to why a lot of us have impostor
syndrome so this is a list more for web
developers than other types of
programmers but this is the that we
need to learn we don't need to master
everything here nobody has but we're
constantly expected to know at least
some aspects of all of this stuff at one
point or another if someone asks you
about just one part of any of these
things and you don't know it that
feeling kicks in of should I know this
do I even belong here when in reality we
all feel like that because none of us
know all of this stuff or at least every
part of everything here and this is all
stuff that I just thought of in about
five minutes there's probably three more
pages like this that I could come up
with so in many cases you're expected to
know and I'm just going to go through
this list real quick so programming
languages whether it's you know
JavaScript PHP Ruby on Rails Java C
sharp C whatever it may be
markup and styling so HTML CSS
frameworks whether it's JavaScript
frameworks front-end frameworks like
bootstrap whether it's you know PHP
frame
works ruby frameworks text editors and
IDE s so visual studio code atom eclipse
some of the more hardcore IDs
NetBeans things like that version
control get subversion databases whether
it's relational like MySQL or no SQL
like MongoDB Redis cash cash systems
query languages like SQL compilers api's
HTTP REST API is graph QL para de
programa paradigms like object oriented
programming functional programming state
managers like Redux view X flux ng rx
bundlers and packaging like web pack and
and parcel and browserify testing
whether it's unit testing end to end
testing or some other kind of testing
design patterns like MVC mvv see ABCDE
there's just so many dam design patterns
flow control debugging and breakpoints
UI UX design browser compatibility you
know what what features are available in
what browser should I use these features
yet should I wait pre-processors like
sass less stylists package managers npm
yarn
what's the ruby one ruby gems pit for
python namespacing the command line
which is a whole category itself linux
ssl devops and deployment which again is
a whole nother category this job
positions based on just that category
apache nginx servers ssh ftp SCP
different ways to log into servers and
manage your server virtualization and
mobile development and responsiveness so
these are just some of the things that
we're expected to know at least some of
and this is the reason why imposter
syndrome exists because there's no way
for us to know all this and we feel like
we should alright so just a little rant
and and there's a video that i'd like to
recommend
you to bandits I'll put the link in the
description it's by Jeffrey way which is
he's a really good instructor I actually
learned jQuery from him but he did a
conference I think was Larrick on the
laravel conference and he talked about
all the different things that we need to
learn in this industry and what we're
expected and it's just a really good
talk so I'm gonna put that link in the
description I'd suggest you guys check
that out alright so next thing we'll
talk about is employment options so once
you go through school or bootcamp and
you feel that you're ready to get a job
or at least start working for for money
or even an internship then you first
need to figure out what you want to do
so there's a few different options we
have freelancing this is usually what I
suggest for self-taught people that have
they don't have any you know degree or
anything like that and they never
actually coded for money so it's a safe
bet because it's not like you're being
depended on by a company that you're
working for not to say that the quality
of your work isn't important in
freelancing but you get a lot more
freedom and slack now the downside is
you'll basically be working for peanuts
at first I actually started on something
called oDesk a website called oDesk
which is now known as upwork and i
started doing like small wordpress
projects for like 50 bucks each but
after a while I had a bunch of good
reviews so I started to get better jobs
and I remember I got my first
thousand-dollar gig on oDesk which is
now upwork and I thought I just thought
that was so much money and I was so
proud that I was able to make that from
there I progressed and I learned and I
started my own business which I'll talk
about in a few minutes you also have the
option of an internship which I don't
know too much about but I would think
this would be easier than finding a job
even with no experience but of course
you don't get paid for it but in many
cases if you fit in and you do a good
job you'll get an offer for a paid
position at some point all right now if
you have extreme any experience at all
whether it's freelancing
or your own projects stuff you did for
your family and friends or contributing
to open source project stuff you can
show people then you can start looking
for a job and it will probably be an
entry-level position but you can learn
and you can move up from there and you
may get a job with a big corporation
which will be good financially or you
may get a job with a small startup where
you know we won't make as much money but
if you're let's say one of the first ten
employees for that company and it blows
up then you're in a really good position
and then of course you have the option
to start your own company this is
something that I did I learned WordPress
Drupal and Joomla which are all PHP
content management systems and that's
what I use to build client websites now
I did this before I even knew any real
programming language if someone wanted
custom functionality on their WordPress
site I'd stay up all night trying to
either find a plug-in or customize a
plug-in or even create a plug-in myself
which was usually very clunky but I had
the drive to just you know make it work
and I barely knew CSS there was no
bootstrap at the time so I did a lot of
pre-made templates stuff the way that I
did it I really wouldn't suggest I
jumped in a little too soon I think but
it actually did end up working out real
well and I got many clients that really
liked my work and they came back for
more projects even if it wasn't the best
work they saw my drive and saw how much
effort I put into their project and I
charged them cheap money as well which
helped so you don't have to know
everything to start your own company
just be sure you specify what you can
and can't do if you if you can just do
static HTML CSS websites or WordPress
sites make that clear that's it make it
clear that that's what you specialize in
and then over time you can add more
services as you learn more technology
all right so when you start out
programming actually not just not just
starting out but throughout your career
you're gonna get feedback and criticism
for your code and me having a YouTube
channel exposing my own code I get this
a lot but 99% of it is helpful and
positive and I appreciate that
the only time I don't is when it's
something that's so minuscule that it's
it's really just the person wanting to
feel like they corrected me and it makes
them feel like a better programmer or
person or whatever and you'll run into
these people you know you miss a space
in your Jason key-value pair and they
try to make you feel like an idiot just
ignore that small percentage of people
most developers are understanding and
helpful try to follow best practices I
know it can be hard because you get
accustomed to doing things a certain way
and then you find out that you know it's
really not the standard and it's hard to
change how you've been doing it I would
say when you're starting out read the
best practices for whatever language are
using and tried to follow those as you
learn
alright you also want to stay up-to-date
with software and tooling so for
instance if you're a JavaScript
developer make sure you're learning es6
Plus use Latin Const arrow functions
promises etc it'll make you a better and
more relevant developer okay use tools
like web pack over something like
browserify which has lost a lot of
traction and I know it's tough to take
the time and figure out what's what's
the the the most current tools and
technology are but if you work in the
industry you'll probably be told this
stuff all the time by your co-workers
and so on if not you'll need to kind of
do your own research ok we also have
things like design patterns and
paradigms it's hard to figure out you
know for instance should I use
object-oriented programming over
functional programming everyone's
different in their reasoning you just
need to find what works best for you and
best for the project okay then we have
DevOps and deployment and this is a huge
category there's just so much to it
things like docker vagrant cloud hosting
virtualization very difficult
it's not like the the old WordPress days
where you bought a GoDaddy account and
you just f tp'ed your site and that was
it if you want to build large-scale
applications custom applications
deployment can actually be harder than
building the app in some cases luckily
if you're on a team there's usually
someone that's really good with that
stuff and you can focus more and
actually programming and building your
apps alright so this last slide is very
important and it's about time management
so programming is different than most
other jobs the reason that the reason
for that is that you really can't
foresee the time it's gonna take for
something you can spend like two or
three days scouring the web and in sites
like
Stack Overflow trying to find a solution
to fix a problem that you never expected
to have so this can cause turmoil with
your family I can't tell you how many
times that I've said to my wife that I'm
stressed out I'm so behind and she'll
look at me like I'm crazy and say you
know you just worked 10 hours every day
for the past week yet she doesn't
understand that three of those days were
just wasted on research for one issue
that I couldn't figure out you know
she's a hairdresser so people come in
they get their hair done they leave she
gets paid and that's it and that's how
most jobs are so it's difficult to to
juggle you know family life and work
life as a programmer it can also be hard
to find time for hobbies and other
things I really love music and I have a
DJ kit that I like to use but I care Lea
find the time to do that kind of stuff I
also like playing video games but you
know I kind of feel like that's wasting
time I could be doing something
beneficial so it's hard to keep up with
hobbies and stuff you like to do sports
and stuff like that
alright you also don't want to take on
too much especially if it's client work
you never want to give deadlines that
you're not going to make so make your
deadlines two weeks later than you
expect it's much better to give a later
date then
you give them an earlier date to make it
sound good and then not making that date
okay and telling them they have to wait
longer
so obviously everyone's schedule is
different so there's no
one-size-fits-all answer but just be
very aware of your time and use some
kind of planner whether it's digital or
whether it's just like a journal or a
planner that you can write in all right
so that's it guys hopefully this wasn't
too long hopefully I shed some light on
a few things for new developers or even
you guys that have been doing this for a
while I'll say I'll say it for like the
third or fourth time take everything
that I say with a grain of salt I'm just
one person do your own research for
everything that we've talked about and
if you are new or a transitioning
developer or programmer I wish you all
the luck in the world thanks for
watching please give this video a like
if you liked it and subscribe if you
like this type of video and that's it
thanks guys and I will see you next time
