another crash course today's course is
going to be on view j/s now I've had a
lot of requests to do a video on view
especially in my react.js videos a lot
of you guys mentioned it I also just
completed an edge wanax course on view
j/s so you may want to check that out as
well so before I begin I just want to
mention my website traversing mediacom
it's actually not up yet it should be
live within a week or so and it's going
to include all the recent YouTube
courses and videos and maybe some extras
it's also going to include all of my
in-depth premium courses by edge' wanax
alright these free ones are a great
start but I'd suggest going more
in-depth with some of those courses some
of them feature up to 12 different
applications from scratch for something
like 27 bucks so it's well worth it
travesty media will also include all the
course code for all the videos as well
as some coupons deals and some other
stuff so check that out if you get a
chance one more thing before we start
there's a number of ways that you guys
can help out the channel and keep these
free courses and videos coming as I
mentioned premium courses are a great
way to learn all types of technologies
and also help us out at the same time
you could donate a few bucks even $1.00
anything is appreciated and if you don't
have any extra money to spend that's
absolutely fine just subscribe to the
channel leave some likes comments
whatever you can do is fine alright so
let's get started so what is view jas
it's defined as a progressive JavaScript
framework that focuses on building user
interfaces and it's important to know
that view works exclusively in the view
layer of the application so anything to
do with the user interface it doesn't
care about the model or database or
anything else at least on its own it was
designed from the ground up to be
incrementally adoptable and this makes
it very easy to integrate into existing
projects and libraries but at the same
time it's powerful enough to create
advanced single page applications or
spas and these are application
that dynamic the dynamically update the
page as the user reacts to the app
alright there's also a view router that
can be used which we'll get into a
little later so how does view match up
to some of the other many many j/s
technologies out there I know that the
amount of them can be very overwhelming
and I've actually had many comments on
my channels that asked me how do I keep
up with all of these different
frameworks and libraries extensions and
so on this by no means is an extensive
comparison our pros and cons I just want
to show you some of the technologies
that view is often compared to so react
j/s is very close to view they both work
in the UI only on the view layer they're
both they both use a virtual Dom which
is basically a slimmed-down dynamic
version of the document object model and
it updates certain parts depending on
different actions within the app all
right so they're both very reactive
they're both component based they both
have external libraries for routing view
is a little bit easier to use than react
but I think react is a bit more powerful
if I had to pick one I'd probably say
react but that's just my opinion and
probably because I have a lot more
experience with react angular 2 is
another framework that view gets
compared to but angular 2 is is kind of
a different animal altogether it's not a
UI library or framework it's a complete
framework and it offers a lot more it's
made up of many different packages and
modules and this makes angular a lot
harder to learn but obviously more
powerful view however does score higher
in some benchmarks when it comes to
performance but it's also because it's a
lot more lightweight Ember is another
more in-depth framework and it would
make more sense to compare view to just
the template in the object layers of
ember view does provide more reactivity
but ember is also older so that's kind
of to be expected
let's see knockout Jas is
another library and it's based on the
mvvm design pattern our model view
viewmodel view j/s isn't classified as
mvvm but it does work in a similar way
NACO does have superior browser support
than view and most frameworks it
actually works well with ie6 which is
kind of amazing knock-out does lack a
full set of lifecycle hooks though and
it is much older than view the last two
which are polymer and riot i've never
used these so i can't really say too
much about it I do know that polymer was
a source of inspiration for view Jas and
riot has a similar component based model
all right so what does view Jas do what
does it offer it allows us to build
reactive interfaces so if we click a
button or type some text some other part
of the application or the component can
react to it
declarative rendering which allows us to
use dynamic variables we can bind data
including two-way data-binding from
input elements much like angular 2 if
you have experience with that it also
provides a large set of directives okay
and angular 2 is famous for using custom
directives which do a lot of different
things which will go over template logic
ok so we can have if statements we can
have for loops right in our templates
components and nesting components are
obviously good for organizing your
application event handling there's
something called computed properties so
if one thing changes we can have
something else compute some other custom
function CSS transitions and animations
and I apologize that's spelled wrong and
also custom filters so we can create
filters that we can add to variables
inside our templates
alright so installing and using view J s
there's a number of ways to do it
you could just include it right in a
script tag you can use the CDN and you
can just go ahead and use it but that's
not really recommended for production
you can also install it using NPM no
package manager' the way that i would
suggest using view and what we're going
to do is to use the view CLI tool which
is a command-line interface that
implements web pack and it pretty much
does everything for us it comes with a
dev server is a simple command to build
out our app for production so we're
going to look into that could also
install it with Bower which is a
client-side package manager but that's
pretty similar to just including it in a
script tag it's just included on the
client alright so those are some of the
different ways so the view CLI tool this
is basically the commands to get going
so first thing you want to install it
globally so NPM obviously you need
nodejs and NPM install - g4 global and
then view CLI and then to create a
project you just have to do view init
web pack because you want to use the web
pack more excuse me web pack template
and then whatever the name of your app
alright then we CD into that folder and
run npm install which will install the
rest of the dependencies and then we can
simply run the dev server with npm run
dev and then once you're ready to build
for production you can just do npm run
build and that will create a dist folder
with your application alright so pretty
easy workflow here's a very simple
example rendering the data to the dom
and using interpolation so we have a div
with the ID of app and by the way we're
going to jump into code and I'm going to
show you all this I just want to give
you some very very simple examples of
what's to come alright so we have a div
with the idea of app and in here we're
using interpolation which is basically a
dynamic variable so we're using this msg
with the double curly brace all right
over here is where we have our view
instance we create a variable in this
case app and we set it's a new view and
then inside there we we can include an
element that we want to attach it to in
this case it's the ID of app and then we
have this data where we can put
different values so msg we set to the
string of hello world so right here
would output
world alright and it's as simple as that
so directives are special attributes
with the V - prefix that does something
to the Dom okay they're all different
reactively apply side-effects to the Dom
when the value of its expression changes
and this is the format we have our
element could be any kind of HTML
element and then V - and whatever that
directive ID alright that can take in
arguments expressions and filters so
here's some simple directive examples
this is an example of this basic instant
interpolation without a directive and we
just saw that we're just including the
msg variable we could do the same thing
here by using the v-tex directive which
basically would just output whatever's
in that msg vh tml would parse HTML tags
for us if we were just to use v text it
would actually output the HTML tags
themselves which you probably wouldn't
want so you would use v HTML and then
the V once directive is one time
interpolation meaning that it's only
going to output it once if it changes
it's not going to change in this
particular instance we can also have
conditionals and loops so over here we
have our data and we have this show
value set to true and then we have users
which is an array of user objects so
over here we're saying in our paragraph
tag we're using the V if directive we're
saying if show so you can see it's true
then this will be shown we can also have
else so V else this is not so if I set
this value to false then this would show
because it's false alright right here we
also have V Show which you can use
similar to V if so this will be shown if
true if show is true and then down here
where we have a V for directive which
basically is a for loop it's going to
loop through these users and we want to
help with the user name and we're going
to get more in-depth into this stuff
these are just very simple examples now
we can also
find dynamic values two attributes so in
this case we're binding back to the
class attribute and we're actually
saying that if this right here is active
true then we want to apply a class
called active alright if we set this to
false this class won't be applied in
this case here we're binding to the
style so we say active color red over
here and that's going to bind it to the
color style which will be red okay so
when you have a bigger application you
want to be breaking things up into
components to create a component you can
use view dot component name it and then
you can apply different things to it
such as a template this should actually
be a lowercase T in this case the
template is just a string that says this
is my component and then to insert it we
can just put it in this format here
alright components provide organization
and encapsulation they're reusable and
they can be separated into their own
separate view files if needed so some
additional tools and plugins to use with
view there's the view router which I'll
give you an example of this is the
official router deeply integrated with
the view Jas core we also have view
resource which is used for handling HTTP
requests view async data which takes
care of asynchronous data loading view
validator which is a form validation
plug-in view dev tools which is a
extension for Chrome much like the react
extension or the angular extension and
then view touch which handles gestures
using hammer j/s which i've never
actually used but it is available
alright so that's it for the slides
let's go ahead and jump in and take a
look at some code alright guys so we're
going to go ahead and jump in and
install the view CLI and generate an
application so before we get started you
need to have no js' installed if you
don't just go to node.js org go ahead
and download it install it really easy
to get set up I already have it
installed so I'm not going to go
through that alright now if we go to
view Jas org and we click on get started
and let's see click on this installation
right here it gives us the different
ways we can install it we could just use
the CDN and include the script but I
want to do things a little more
professional and I guess realistic so if
you were creating an application you
probably want to use the view CLI
alright which is a really incredible
tool for creating it for developing with
the dev server as well as building it
building it out with just a simple
command alright so we're going to go
ahead and install it okay right here NPM
install global view CLI so I'm going to
open up a command line ok or open your
terminal whatever you're using on
whatever system you're using and I'm
going to go into let's see my projects
folder and this is where we're going to
generate the app but let's go ahead and
install the view CLI tool so npm install
and add the g flag or you could do - -
global and then view - CLI alright and i
already have it installed so mine may be
a little quicker
all right so now that that's all set
we're going to generate an application
by saying view and knit and then webpack
and then the name of the app which I'm
just going to call let's see just view
app I guess
all right so that'll generate an app
it's going to ask us a couple questions
okay so the project name view app that's
fine description I will just say simple
I'll just keep the default of UJS
project author that's fine enter and
then it's going to ask if we want to use
es lint I'm not going to use that so I'm
going to say no same thing with karma
and Moka that's more advanced for
testing and stuff end-to-end tests no
all right so now it should be set up so
we're going to CD into view app alright
and we want to run npm install okay
that'll install the dependencies that we
need now as far as dependencies it's
installing web pack some web pack
plug-ins babel so that it can we can use
es2015 and installs the presets a whole
bunch of stuff alright so now let's go
ahead and add that to our editor I'm
using Adam which is completely free if
you want to check that out or of course
you can use whatever you want I'm going
to add that project to the folder so
let's see one of my n projects and then
view app all right so if we look at
package Jason you can see it installed
web pack web pack dev middleware babel
and a whole bunch of plugins alright
just a bunch of stuff that's going to
help us build out and and test and
produce our application alright so now
that that's done we can run our app so
we can run the dev server by saying raha
npm run dev and i think i'm going to get
an error because it runs it starts it on
port
eighty eighty by default and yeah and
that's being used on my machine you
probably won't get this unless you are
using that port so if you do get this
issue and you want to change the port we
can go to build and then dev server J s
and this right here this port variable
I'm just going to set this to port 8000
and save it alright so then we'll go
ahead and try to run that again and that
should open up on port 8000 all right so
this is kind of the the boilerplate
sample application that they give you
not much just a logo with some text all
right so let's go ahead and open up the
source the SRC folder that's where all
the stuff that we want is and basically
we have a main dot j/s file this is
where we import view and we import our
main app component alright this is where
the view instances we're saying new view
and the element that we're attaching it
to is an element with the ID of app the
template is the app component that we're
bringing in and we also want to list the
app component here alright now if we
look at the app component it actually
has a dot view extension and it uses a
template okay so we wrap this in
template tags down here is where the
Java Script goes basically we're
importing another component called hello
and we're exporting our default object
with the name of the component which is
app and then we want to include any sub
components we're using such as this
hello one that we're importing we want
to put that in here as well and then we
just have some styling down here alright
so if we look at the template we have a
div with the idea of app and we have
this image that we're bringing in which
is this view logo and then the Hello
component okay so let's take a look at
the Hello component okay so in the
template we have all of this which is
all this right here okay that's what
we're seeing right
and same thing we have to export it and
we're giving it a name of hello and we
also have some data okay now when we're
working with components the data has to
be a function that returns an object
with our values in this case we have
this msg which is welcome to your view
app and then that's going up here okay
we're using that interpolation and
putting it in the h1 tag all right and
then we have some styling down here
since we add the scoped to the style
that means that it's only for this
component now I just want to do
basically just some examples and some
testing so I'm going to get rid of this
Hello component and we're going to
create our own all right so let's go
ahead and just delete this okay and then
inside app dot view we're going to just
remove this hello where we bring in that
hello and also this and then get rid of
the Hello component tags up here all
right so if we go ahead and save that it
should auto reload and we want to open
up our console down here make sure
nothing's wrong all right we can also
get rid of the logo all right so to
create a new component let's go ahead
and create a new file in the components
folder and let's see we'll just call
this let's call it test dot view okay
now in here we want to have our template
okay and let's create a div and give it
a class of tests and for now let's just
put an h1 in here and we'll say test all
right
then down here we want to open up our
script
and we want to say export the fault and
let's give this a name of test and yeah
we'll just do that for now and we'll
have some style tags down here and let's
add scoped okay and we'll go ahead and
save that and now we need to bring that
into our main app component so let's go
right here and say import let's say we
want to import test from and it's going
to be dot slash components slash test
okay so that will bring it in and then
we have to add it down here in order to
use it and then let's put it right in
here okay so we'll go ahead and save
that and now we get tests okay
now we're going to be working in this
test component so what we can do is
let's replace this hard disk text here
with let's say title okay and then down
here we can say put a comma there say
data and then we just want to return and
in here it's a title and we'll say hello
world so if we go ahead and save that we
now get hello world and of course we can
put whatever we want down here we could
do in object so let's say if we want
user and I'll set let's set first name
to John and last name to Joe
now I want to I want this my atom editor
to look at this not as a plain text file
but as an HTML file all right now
because we're using script tags and
on alright so we have this user with the
first name and last name if we want to
we could go ahead up here and we could
say user dot first name which I like
that camelcase better okay save that we
get John now we can also use the v-tex
directive if we want so what's for
instance I'll take this P tag and let's
add V dash text and set that to user dot
first-name save that and we get John
again okay so these are both outputting
John now if we have some HTML let's for
this hello world we'll put an h1 here
and let's save that now we're using
actually you know what I want to get rid
of this so if I save that you'll see
that the H ones are actually showing up
okay if I wanted to parse this what I
would have to do is you know we'll do is
we'll say span and let's do V dash HTML
equals title alright and you probably
wouldn't want to do this you'd want to
actually just include the value and then
wrap it in tags up here but just to show
you this is this does work okay if you
want to actually parse HTML that's in
these values all right I'm just going to
actually undo that so how we had it
all right so next thing I want to look
at is conditionals okay so let's put
comma right here and let's say active
and we'll set that to true
all right so if let's go up here
actually know what we'll call it show
name okay so we have this show name and
set to true and what we'll do is let's
get rid of that and wrap this not wrap
it but inside the P here we're going to
say V - if equals show name so we save
that and we get John but if I were to go
and set this to false and save it it
doesn't show all right but at the same
time we can do V else so V else show
name and let's say I don't know we'll
just say nobody save that and we get
nobody and we could also remove this
altogether and just do VLC and that
should also work okay if I change this
back to true save it we get John alright
so now let's take a look at v4 and loops
so let's create down here let's see
we'll say items and let's set that to an
array so have title stay item one
this one will be item two and I
apologize I have a bit of a cold so I
apologize if I sound a little funny in
item three okay so we have this array of
item objects and if we want to loop
through these up here let's put in a ul
and in here we'll put an li and we want
to add here directive v4 and we can say
item in items and then here we'll say
item dot title save that and now we have
a list with our items now we can do
input binding as well much like angular
2 does or and angular 1 so let's say we
want to put an input up here at the top
give it a type of text and then we can
add a directive called v-model which
works like
ng-model and angular and let's say title
okay so and put a line break we'll save
that and you can see it says hello world
and if I change this you can see that
whatever is bound to this title is also
going to change okay which is really
cool and really easy so now let's look
at events all right so I'm going to go
down here and create a button now when
you work with events there's a directive
called Veon okay so we want to say V on
and then whatever the event let's say
click OK and let's set this to say greet
let's say greeting all right so save
that and now we have a button and it's
saying property or method greet is not
defined so we need to go down here we're
going to go after where the data is and
put a comma and then let's say methods
and we called it greet actually will go
like this greet function and let's do
alert will say hello
okay so we'll save that and click that
and we get hello all right we can also
pass along parameters so if we want we
can say hello world and then down here
we'll add greeting and we'll say alert
greeting so now if we go say greeting we
get hello world so let's create another
our text input I want to add some events
to a text input we'll give it a type
text and let's say V dash on and let's
say Key up and we'll set it to press key
okay and then down here and our methods
put a comma right here and let's say
press key and let's do console dot log
pressed alright so I go over here and I
start to type and you see we get pressed
I just want to put a line break right
here
okay now if we want to get what we're
typing into here we can do that let's
say we want to pass along an event right
here and then we'll just console.log e
dot target dot value all right and if
you're familiar with angular 2 or react
and you've seen some of those videos
that I have this works pretty similar
alright so if I start to type you can
see that it captures whatever is in
there alright now we can also test for
certain keys so we in a lot of cases you
want you know if someone if they click
enter while they're in there you want it
to behave differently so if we say V
dash on can say key up
let's see key up and set that to reset
so that's our dot submit not dot
something dot enter and then we'll set
that to enter hit and then down here
we'll create a function called int or
hit a little console dot log and I'll
say you hit enter all right so now let
that reload and start to type and then
when I hit enter you'll see you hit
enter okay and you can do this with
different keys there shift-tab
all the main keys you can use as well
alright now the next thing I want to
look at is calm computed properties okay
so we can use this to basically watch
certain things and have them update
accordingly so for instance we have this
input for or is it for the username well
we don't have it so let's create an
input
or the first name and the last name all
right so I'm going to put just put an HR
here I'm sorry if this is messy I'm just
trying to cover just all the basics I
know it's not really a functioning
application but you know I just want to
give you good examples so let's say we
have an input actually we'll put a label
and I'll say first name and then an
input and we'll give that a type of text
and let's set the v-model and we'll set
that to user dot first name and then
let's put a line break and then I'm just
going to copy that line and then this is
going to be for the last name
okay so we'll save that and you can see
we have John Doe now let's say that I
want to have something for I want the
full name
I want a property for the full name that
will actually take both of these and add
them together but it will also update
when I update one of these so to set
computed methods we need to go down here
let's go underneath this methods and
we're going to say computed okay and
let's say full name
we're going to set that full name to
function and what I want to do here is
return this dot first name and then
we'll concatenate a space and then we'll
add on to that this dot last name okay
and then up here let's put an h3 and
inside here we'll say full name okay so
if we save that let's see property or
method full name is not is not defied on
instance but referenced alright so oh
you know what I know that the problem is
two things one this n right here should
be uppercase to match this and also
since it's in the first name and last
name are inside a user object we need to
say this dot user dot phone first name
and last name alright so let's go ahead
and save that and now you can see we get
this John Doe this is coming from full
name but if I were to edit this first
name and say Jane it also updates the
full name okay so hopefully change first
name or last name it edits the full name
so that is computed properties all right
so now what I want to do is talk about
component properties okay now if we look
in our app dot view we have this our
test component now we can make it so
that we can add properties for instance
say title equals something all right now
to prepare our component to be able to
do that let's go ahead down here and
let's see let's go under name and we're
going to say props then make sure you
put a comma here and let's have a
property called actually still property
called message all right now you can
define a default for for the properties
we say default and let's set that to
we'll just set it to fubar and you also
want to define a type okay so in this
case this is going to be a string you
can define it to a number string a
function object whatever you'd like all
right and then let's go ahead and put
this up here in say an h2 say msg save
it and we get fubar now since it's a
property we should be able to add it
right here we say msg equals just say
hello save that and now it's hello okay
so we can now pass in properties to this
component all right so now that we've
gone over most of the basics of UJS I
want to do something a little more
useful than this because right now we
just have this testing component where
we just have a bunch of just different
functionality mushed together it doesn't
really do anything so what I want to do
is just create
very simple input form we can add users
ok we'll add users to a list and we'll
be able to update the status of the user
with a checkbox and also be able to
delete the user so I'm going to create a
new component for this so in components
let's say new file and we'll call this
users dot view ok and let's see let's
just copy what we have in test paste
that in and I'm just going to get rid of
everything that's in the div inside the
template ok we'll change this to users
and then down here we'll change this
name to users we're going to get rid of
the props okay for the data we're going
to clear everything out of this return
and clear out all the methods and get
rid of this whole computed thing ok and
we'll save that now let's go to app dot
view and we'll pass in here users which
we need to import just like we did with
tests ok and I'm going to get rid of
this instance this test tag right here
and let's put in users
all right so save that and now let's go
back to our users component and just say
put an h1 save that and now we have our
users component alright and our test
component is still available we could go
ahead and put that in right here if we
want it's all encapsulated in there ok
so I'm just going to not going to use
that for now though so what we're going
to do is in the data we're going to set
users to an array
okay and let's see we'll have a name I'm
not going to do a first name and a last
name just a name
and let's see I just want a a true/false
value here let's say registered I guess
so registered and set that set these two
unregistered no you know what let's do
contacted okay so let's say it's a it's
a list of users that we want to contact
and we want to be able to mark them off
if they're contacted or not let's give
them an email okay I'm kind of just
winging this as I go along so we'll have
three whoops three users here say Steve
Smith and let's do I don't know say um
Tom white
okay so we have these users let's print
them out with v4 so we'll say ul do an
Li with a v4 directive and that's going
to be user in users and then let's put
out the user dot name and user dot email
alright and I'm just going to set this
to an HTML file okay so we want to have
an input as well type equals text and
let's set set the model there's a few
different ways we could do this but I'm
just going to set V model to new user
dot name all right and then C will give
it a placeholder I'll just say enter
name okay let's put a line break and
copy that and then this will be the
email oops that's not that's not right
okay so this will be new user dot email
and then let's put a submit button
all right so save that
adduser is not defined so let's go ahead
down here we'll go after the data
actually already have the methods right
here so we'll say add user okay let's
just do console log and okay now it's
saying property a method new user is not
defined on the instance it's talking
about this here so what we'll do is set
in the data let's just set new user to
an empty object and save it okay so now
we have our form and if we were to
submit this we get add now see how it
flashes like that that's because it's
actually submitting the form which we
don't want so we just want to pass along
II write here and then we're going to
say e dot prevent default okay so now if
we submit now it just stays with ad all
right so what we need to do is just push
that new user to our users so we can do
that pretty easily we're just going to
say this dot users dot push and in here
let's pass in an object with the name
we'll set to this dot new username and
then email which will be this dot new
user dot email all right and that should
do it
oh yeah we need contacted as well which
will always be set to false at first so
contacted false all right so now if we
were to say Kevin let's say Kevin
Williams and submit there he is Kevin
Williams all right now if we reload
obviously that
going to go away because we're not
persisting we're just working in the
user interface now let's say we want a
checkbox to mark off if the users been
contacted so what we can do is go back
up here and where we have our list
let's put right here and input I'm going
to give it a type of checkbox and give
it a class toggle and let's give it a V
model of user dot contacted okay and
then what we want to do is let's see
we're going to wrap this in a span what
I want to happen is if we mark it
complete contacted I want to strike
through to go through the text all right
so let's do span and we're going to say
: class we're going to bind to this
contacted contacted and set that to user
dot contacted so basically what we're
saying here is that if it's the user is
contacted then we want to give it a
class of contacted okay so let's save
that all right now in order for us to
tell if it's actually being marked as
contacted we're going to add a line
through for that class so let's go down
here and say dot contacted and set text
decoration to line through okay and
there we go so now it's when I mark them
off they get a line through
now if we were persisting to a database
we would have to add some functionality
for it to actually go to the database as
well and mark that off is true but again
this is just the user interface so last
thing we'll do here is delete we want to
be able to delete the user so let's go
right here and put a button and Savion
click and we'll set that to delete user
and let's just put an X okay so that
gives us a little button there now we
have to create that delete user down
here I'll go right here and say delete
user okay and let's see we're going to
need to just kind of to splice it out so
we're going to say this dot users dot
splice and let's pass in this dot users
dot index of and that's going to
actually take in a user parameter and
then we just want to delete one so we
have to actually pass that in as a
parameter so up here delete user will
pass in see passing user okay that
should work let's save it and click X
and you can see it deletes the user all
right good
so we can now read our users we can
delete them we can update the status
contacted and we can add them all right
so there's two more things that I want
to get to and that's the view router and
the view resource okay now these are
external to the core view j/s system so
we're going to have to install those so
we're going to start off with the view
resource
we're going to control-c to stop this
and then we're going to do npm install
view - resource - - save alright now
let's just do our run dev again okay and
what we're going to do is go into main J
s and we're going to have to bring that
in so right up here we'll say import
view resource from you - resource
alright now in order to use it we have
to run it through the view use
middleware so view dot use and then we
just want to pass in here view resource
okay that's all we have to do in this
file let's save it and then we're going
to go back to users and the api that i
want to work with is i forget the exact
domain name jason place holder this
right here jason placeholder type eco
calm and if you look at right here we
can make a request to this URL and we
can get these users alright so what i
want to do is let's see we're going to
go down here now UJS has a set of
lifecycle hooks where you can kind of
plug into certain points in the
rendering of the component so we're
going to use one called created so we
want to go underneath the methods not
inside of it but right underneath and
we're going to stay created and this
should run automatically so just to test
it out let's say console.log created ran
alright so if we save that and we go
back and look in the console you'll see
created ran so this is where we want to
make our request so since we enabled
you resource we should be able to say
this dot money sign HD excuse me HTTP
GET which works pretty much exactly like
the angular 2 HTTP module alright so
we're going to pass in the URL which is
this and it's going to return a promise
so we're going to say dot then okay and
then we want to pass in here function
that's going to give us a response and
let's just do console dot log response
all right so we'll go back and now you
can see we're getting a response
actually let's do response dot data and
there we go so we're getting all those
users now what we want to do is put that
into this users array so we're going to
clear all this out just make this an
empty array to start to begin with and
then down here we'll say this dot user
is equals that response that's coming in
so let's save it and there we go okay so
we get all those users and we can delete
them they're not going to delete from
their server obviously it's just from
the interface but we can still add them
all right so that's how you use view
resource now the last thing we're going
to look at is view router so let's go
ahead and stop this again ctrl C and
we're going to say NPM install view -
router - - safe okay and then let's run
our server again all right now we're
going to do this in main j/s and what
we're going to do is we're going to kind
of bypass the the main app component all
together we'll create a router then
we'll be able to go - we'll set our
users for the home page and then we'll
set a test route slash test to go to the
test
component alright so let's see we're
going to want to bring this in so import
few actually let's do view router from
vu router and again we're going to have
to add this I'm going to do view dot use
and save you - our view router alright
and then what we'll do is set here Const
set a variable called router set it to
new view router and here we're going to
pass in the mode now I want this to just
I want to be able to just go to our URL
and slash test or about or whatever it
may be
so to be able to do that we want the
mode to be history alright and then
we're going to set the base to be on the
double underscore their name and then we
can create our routes okay which is an
array can't type today all right now
these are going to be it's going to be
an array of objects which will have a
path so let's say slash for the home
page and we'll say component we want to
be not home users okay so we want users
for the home the home page and then
we'll say path and say slash test and we
want that to be the test component so
it's a test now in order to use these
you have to import them just like we did
with the app component which we're not
going to be using so important and
that's going to be in component slash
users and we're going to do the same
thing for the test component so let's a
test test okay so now that should work
and then down here we're going to change
this up a little bit we're going to pass
in router we're not going to use this L
right here we're going to get rid of
that and then for the template we're not
going to use the app component okay we
can get rid of that what we're going to
do here is put in a div with the ID of
app okay and I'm going to change these
quotes to back ticks so that we can use
multiple lines just like that
so now we can put this on a separate
line okay and then here let's put our UL
this will be our navigation and now to
create our links we want to use this
router - link and then we have this -
attribute so router link - and we'll set
that to slash say users and then we'll
close that up
okay let's copy that apologize for that
banging that's my son running around
upstairs and then this one here is going
to be to test change that to test all
right and then we need a place for this
for our content to output so that's what
we put right here this router - view
okay so router view just like that and
then finally we just want to add down to
here dot money sign mount and then pass
in the ID of app
all right so let's go ahead and save
that and let's look at the console all
right let's see view router is not
defined oh you know what this let's see
this should be uppercase right here like
that
all right so save that and now you can
see we have our users component and if I
click test that shows our test component
okay it's a messy looking app but that's
not the point the point is that we go
over all the basics and fundamentals of
UJS and we've done that we do have a
warning telling us about case because we
have our upper case file names but
that's fine I'm just gonna leave that so
hopefully this helped you guys out I
know it was kind of meshed together and
it was really quick but we did cover a
lot so please hit that subscribe button
and hit that like button if you can look
into the course maybe purchase there the
full course I go into everything we went
in through here but in much more detail
along with other some other stuff as
well so you may want to check that out
so thanks for watching and I will see
