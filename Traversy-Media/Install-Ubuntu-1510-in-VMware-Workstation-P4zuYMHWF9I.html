ubuntu on to a virtual machine alright
so 12 is a very popular Linux
distribution this video is going to be
geared towards beginners that just need
help getting something set up we're
going to be using VMware Workstation I
think its version 10 alright so if you
go to ubuntu com / download you'll see a
page like this and we have the desktop
also you can install the just the server
if you'd like which is basically just a
command line there's no windows or
anything like that it's just kind of
like the bare-bones bunch of cloud is
also available you can set up your own
private cloud or you can use the public
cloud we're not going to get into that
but it is an option let's see when to
kailan this is created specifically for
chinese users went to core which is for
developers I don't know too much about
that alternative downloads just gives
you different types you can for instance
you can download as a torrent and that's
pretty much it this is a bunch of
flavors this is I guess you can kind of
pick and choose the default applications
and settings and things like that
alright so we're going to go ahead and
click on a bun to desktop and right now
the latest version is 15 point 10 that's
what we're going to be installing so I'm
on a 64-bit machine so that's what I'm
going to choose and I would click
download but I already got it alright so
you can see it's right here on my
desktop okay so you're also going to
need vmware workstation alright so like
i said i think this is version 10 let's
just check that out Oh version 11 that's
right okay so what I'm going to do here
is we're going to say file and then new
virtual machine and we're going to
choose typical or recommended okay so
we'll choose next now since we have an
iso file here i'm going to choose this
option and i'm going to click browse and
let's go to desktop and then choose that
iso file
okay we'll click next then you just want
to put your name username password okay
you can name it let's say 12 64 bit yeah
I guess that's fine for the location you
want to choose where you want to put it
I actually want to change that but of
course you can put it wherever you like
I'm going to create a new folder it'll
just call it a bun to 64 bit okay then
we'll click Next now it's going to ask
you how much space you want to use for
this from your hard drive k the default
is 20 which is kind of low I'm going to
go ahead and change this to a hundred
okay and you also have the option to
store the virtual disk as a single file
or the default which is splitting it
into multiple files alright so splitting
the disk makes it easier to move the
virtual machine to another computer but
also may reduce performance with very
large disks okay so we're just going to
keep that default all right now we have
a kind of a summary of what's going to
happen here what I'm going to do is
click customize hardware and you can
change a bunch of things here for
instance i'm going to change the memory
up 22 gigs alright i have 16 gigs on my
on my computer so i think two gigs is
fine you can also choose the number of
processors the number of cores if you
have multiple cores I'm going to leave
it at one network adapter I like to put
this to bridge and then replicate
physical Network and what this does is
it makes this this virtual machine look
like it's just another physical machine
on our network alright so if we go into
windows and we go to our network manager
will see this virtual machine and we can
basically treat it like it's like it's a
real like it's a physical machine all
right the rest
this stuff I'm going to leave default so
we'll just say close and you can see now
that this is updated let's go ahead and
click finish okay so that's going to go
ahead and run okay so it's just going to
kind of go through the motions now I
will be pausing here and there if it's
if it's taking a while so don't be
alarmed if it seems like mine is going
really quick and yours is really slow
alright because we just kind of just
kind of wait for everything to get set
up now this process that we're going
through now is going to be identical to
if we were to say having a bunch of
discs and we put it in and we're
installing it on to a physical machine
it's the same exact process all right so
if you're not using a virtual machine
this is still relevant now if you're
looking to make a server out of this and
do things like change it to a static IP
address install a samba server so that
you can see windows files in your
network and stuff like that I do have
four or five videos showing you how to
do that it's with an earlier version of
ubuntu but the process is the exact same
I will be redoing those videos because
I'm not too happy with them but for now
if you want to get a server setup then
they're decent guides to go by but I
will be redoing them soon probably with
this installation all right now we
downloaded a bun to desktop but that's
not to say that we can't create make it
a server the reason that they they
separate the desktop and the server is
that when you install the server it has
much less on it okay obviously it
doesn't have a graphical user interface
so that makes it somewhat faster than if
you were to have a server with
GUI all right I myself prefer to have
the the user interface on my servers it
just can it can make things a little
easier especially for me because i'm not
i mean i can use the terminal the
command line but i'm not a pro at it so
some things are just easier to do with
the interface alright so we went through
that and it just restarted the virtual
machine so now it should be setting up
alright alright so we're getting our
login screen i'm just going to open this
in full screen which it doesn't take up
yet we may have to mess with the
resolution i'm not sure yet so you just
want to log in with whatever you chose
as a password and it's going to get set
up for the first time so it might lag a
little bit all right so it's so small
probably because i think vm VM tools
needs to be installed install VMware
tools it's probably still installing
let's see if we go to system settings
and let's see displays resolution let's
change that to see
try that there we go all right so you
may just have to do that I'm going to
keep this configuration okay so it is
now installed so if we look at what we
have four programs over here by default
we have Firefox we have LibreOffice
writer which is this is kind of like the
Microsoft Office suite you get
spreadsheet impress which i think is a
kind of like a database if you're not
familiar with with the command line with
the terminal and you want to look for
stuff to install you can do it through
the Ubuntu Software Center this is
basically like an app store okay it's
formatted the same way we have
categories if you click on one of these
programs you'll get a description
there's also reviews ratings and reviews
so if you want to look through their
different things I mean there's all
kinds of categories okay developer tools
games office all right so you can check
that out and then of course the settings
we saw a little bit this is just like
windows control panel okay you can
change like the apparent parents
background images themes things like
that power options not suspension and
things like that printers you can set
back up so I'm not going to go through
all this because this video is just to
show you how to get this installed but i
probably will make a couple more
beginner based a bunch of tutorials so
keep an eye out for that if you like
these videos so yeah so that's all
installed okay we can go ahead and shut
it down if we want okay can restart shut
down and it'll just shut down as if it
was a real physical machine alright so
hopefully guys like this and hopefully
it helped you out a little bit if you
like the video please give it a like
subscribe whatever you can is absolutely
fine and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
