be looking at the symphony framework
which is a PHP model-view-controller
framework and it is comparable to in my
opinion the Zend framework it's a little
bit more difficult than let's say
CodeIgniter or CakePHP and it's used
more on an enterprise level than then
those frameworks as well alright so what
we're going to do is we're going to be
using Symphony 3 because I haven't seen
too many tutorials or videos on Symphony
3 they're mostly 2.8 so we're going to
be doing that and we're going to build a
to-do list with crud functionality
alright so we'll be able to create read
update and delete to do so it's going to
be really simple I haven't planned out
the application so we're just going to
kind of wing it just like I do in a lot
of my PHP videos but yeah so let's go
ahead and get started this is the
symphony website this is where you can
find all the documentation we're going
to click on this big download button
here and you can see that we're going to
have to use the symphony installer
alright and first thing we have to do is
is install that all right so there's
commands for Linux and Mac I'm on
Windows so I'm going to grab this PHP
command here alright and I'm going to go
ahead and open up my command line as an
administrator
alright let me make this a little bigger
properties cursor font size 24 all right
so let's go to I'm using zamp or xampp'
which is a local Apache server so I'm
going to go to
zamp and htdocs' alright I'm gonna go
ahead and paste that in okay going to
add PHP to my environment variables
alright so if you're getting this just
go ahead and let's go to a control panel
and system and security system advanced
system settings and then environment
variables and while I don't even have a
path variable okay so if you don't see
path here now if you do see it click it
and edit if not I'm going to say new
path and what we want to put in here is
is the PHP installation so mine is in C
xampp slash PHP that should do it so
let's say okay
and okay
and I don't know if we might have to
restart but let's see if we can do this
okay so I think I'm going to have to
restart my system so I will be right
back
all right guys I went ahead and rebooted
so let's try this again so I'm going to
grab this
and hopefully this works
okay so now let me just check
that folder real quick
let's see she drive sample
htdocs and we have to you have symphony
right there alright so now we can
continue here and say make this a little
smaller
let's do Symphony new and then our
project name let's just call it to do
list Symphony is all okay so we got to
do PHP symphony okay finally so that's
going to go ahead and generate a new
symphony project for us all right so now
symphony should be set up
if you're using an Apache server like I
am you can ignore this port 8000 thing
what you want to do is if we just go to
localhost / what was this to-do list you
should just have a listing of files and
folders here the public URL that you
want to go to is localhost to do list
and then we want to go to web and that
should show you this start page all
right now you could use this if you want
this slash web but what I like to do is
set up a virtual host file so that we
can just you know we can have at our own
domain here so what I'm going to do is
go to my xampp folder than apache conf
and see extra and then the v host file
here
all right and then what I'm going to do
is let's see I'll copy this this is from
the fuel PHP videos and just going to
change this to htdocs to do list slash
web actually you don't we want to do is
slash web slash appdev PHP let me just
make sure that works
yeah okay so that's what we wanted to
work since we're in development you want
to use that and then for the server name
let's just say to-do list all right so
I'm going to save that and make sure
that you have this line right here
uncommented okay get rid of any number
signs you see in front of it
okay so we'll save that and then I'm
just going to open up notepad as an
administrator because we need to edit
the host file and if you don't open as
administrator you won't be able to save
it okay so we're going to say open and
then you want to go to if you're in
Windows C Drive windows system32 drivers
and et Cie then I'm going to view all
files and we want to open hosts
all right and then I'm just going to add
an entry here for our loopback address
and then we just want to put in to-do
lists or whatever you put in in the V
host file
okay so we'll save that now just need to
restart Apache
okay so they stopped
and start
okay so now should just be able to go to
HTTP to do list all right so there we go
so that's why our project will live for
the time being obviously when you are
done and you're ready to deploy you can
upload it to your cPanel host or
whatever you're going to do with it for
production all right so now I'm going to
do is I'm going to add the project to my
text editor
so we're going to want htdocs and
to-do-list okay so this is the structure
over here of a default symphony
application and just to just briefly go
through this we have the app folder and
if you open that up that's where our con
figs are going to go all right so our
database parameters will go in the
parameters file we have our main config
alright and then under that we have a
resources folder that's where the views
folder is alright and you can see we
have a folder called default for
basically what you're looking at here
and that's the index and then we also
have this base dot html' dot twig file
and this is the layout this is what
surrounds your views alright so your
views will pop out right here and then
you have your head tags body tags stuff
like that
now twig is the the template engine that
symphony uses by default it allows us to
use this syntax okay we have the curly
braces and then the percent symbols we
can create blocks and different things
like that and that's how we'll include
our variables as well all right so we
also have we're not going to be working
in the bin directory really the source
or SRC folder if we open that you'll see
a folder called app bundle all right now
symphony has what's called bundles and
they're basically just isolated bits of
code so they can also be looked at as
like plug-ins reusable code things like
that now you could create your own
bundle but what we're going to do since
this is such a small application we're
just going to use this app bundle and
you can see that it already has a
controller folder with the default
controller alright so if we look at this
we have our class default controller
extends controller and our index action
all right so every action is going to be
prefixed with the word action all right
we can pass in a request object and here
all it's doing is rendering the index
template
all right I'm actually going to make
this wider all right so that's what
we'll put out controllers we'll also put
our model entities in here we'll be
creating a folder for those and then
that's pretty much it the web folder
that's the front end part of the of the
application but yeah so that's that's
all I'm going to do for explaining the
structure here that's all we really need
to know
Oh routing that's that's a pretty
important aspect of symfony so if we go
to config and then we go to routing
you'll see there's not much in this file
basically what we're saying is that for
the controllers in the app bundle we're
going to be using annotations for our
routing all right so basically we don't
have to put anything in this file if we
go to our controller which is in source
and default controller this right here
is an annotation and this is what is
going to be looked at by the system to
determine the routes all right so the
slash will go to index action and you
can also give it a name homepage that
way we can access it internally pretty
easily all right so this is what we'll
be using for our routes okay which is a
kind of a change from a lot of the other
frameworks but I actually like this
structure because you can see right away
you know that the slash is going to go
to the index action so from here what I
want to do is just create another
controller for our - duze all right so
let's go to our controller folder say
new file and I'm going to save it
as to do controller dot PHP
all right steaks him second all right so
we're going to copy the entire structure
from the default controller and just
paste it in here and then we're just
doing our inclusions up here things we
need let's change this to to do
controller okay then we'll have our
index and for the route we're going to
have this go to - dues and for the name
let's say to do on a score list all
right and then let's see let's just test
it out so we'll just say die and then
we'll pass in - dues all right so if we
save that and then go to slash to dues
okay so we get our string here that we
passed in all right so creating routes
and controllers and actions is as easy
as that really and we can name this
whatever we want I'm actually going to
change it to the list action alright and
this should still work okay so we can
change that and what we're going to want
to do is load up a view alright so let's
get rid of that die statement
all right and then down here let's
change this to to do /index actually
it's now we'll keep that it's fine and
then we don't need this right here this
is how we can pass in values all right
so we're just passing in the base
directory as a variable here but I'm
going to get rid of that for now okay so
we should that should be fine
all right so now we need to create our
view so let's go to app resources and
let's create a new folder in the views
and we're just going to call this to do
ok and then in there we're going to
create a new file and save it as
index.html dot twig okay
so now in here let's just do to do index
okay save that and now we're loading
that view so I'm just going to create a
couple more files in the to do View
folder okay so this one will be called
create dot HTML dot twig and we'll
create another one
and let's save that as edit dot html'
twig
and then we'll create one called
let's call it details okay so there's
our views and back to the controller
what we'll do is copy this whole thing
here and this one is going to be to
create so it's going to be to do slash
create and we'll call this
actually no let's call it to do create
alright and then we're going to change
that to create action and we want to
render to do slash create just like that
alright we'll do the same for the other
ones we have edit now the edit and the
details are going to take in an ID as
well because we need to know which one
to edit alright so do that you can say
slash I'm going to open up some curly
braces and I'm going to put an ID all
right let's call this to do edit and I'm
going to change that to edit action and
this is going to take in an ID here as
well alright we don't need the request
here and list and then down here this is
going to be to do slash details slash ID
excuse me and we'll call this to do
details and then this will be details
action and let's see we need an ID but
we don't need the request so we're just
going to pass an ID and then here
details
all right so those are our main actions
and then just to make sure that they're
linked to the views let's say to do
create that's the create view and we'll
have edit and details so now if we go to
to do slash create okay that's correct
if we go to edit / one okay and then
whoops women edit to do index
huh
and action
oh I didn't change this
there we go and then we'll do details
slash one alright so we know all of our
actions are now linked to our views so
in the next video what we'll do is we're
going to implement a layout and we're
going to use bootstrap for our layout
just to give us something that's quick
that's clean not really concerned on how
it looks and you know the design of it
you know we're looking at the
functionality so we'll go ahead and do
that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
