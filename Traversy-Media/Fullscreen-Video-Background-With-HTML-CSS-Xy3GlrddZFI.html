ago I created a video showing you how to
create a full-screen landing page you
know where the image takes up the full
screen no matter how you resize the
browser and I've had a few requests
asking how to do that with a video
background and I recently also got a
request from someone giving me this link
to this code Academy page asking if I
could build a layout like this now I'm
not going to go through and build this
exact this layout right now at least
maybe I'll do that in the future but it
did give me a good idea to try and
recreate this this video background here
because I think this looks pretty nice
when they have the video like that
very faint in the background it's not
too you know in-your-face
so what I did is I recreated this and it
looks something like this now the video
is different because I would imagine
that the the video on codecademy is is
copy written in some way so we're using
a different video here and I actually
got this from a site called video or
video net which has some really nice
free stock videos and you can see this
has a 1920 by 1080 resolution it is an
HD video it's not as nice as the one on
code Academy but if you want you can go
to like Shutterstock or something like
that you can actually buy really high
quality videos like the one you see here
but we're just gonna use this one I
think it's it's nice it's pretty good
and it'll do alright and if we scroll
down you'll see we have just some some
other sections here but if I resize the
browser no matter how I resize it you'll
see that the video is gonna take up the
full height and the full width all right
so that's what I'm going to show you
guys how to do today hopefully you enjoy
this video and let's get started I want
to give a huge shout out to today's
sponsor male tag male tag is a Chrome
extension that allows you to track your
emails in real time for free it also
lets you track other cool things like
link clicks email reopens and even the
device that was used to open your email
be sure to check out male tag by
clicking the link in the description
below alright guys so what I have here
is I have vias code open on the left and
then my browser on the right so I have a
folder called video underscore BG that's
where we're gonna be building this
project and the first thing I want to do
is download the video okay and I'm gonna
put the link in the description this is
a free stock video and if you go to that
link you can click on free download and
you can see I already have it here but
I'm gonna bring it into my folder which
I have in here okay right here and I'm
gonna just rename it to something
shorter I'm just gonna call this let's
say we'll call it code dot MOV alright
you can see it popped up over here in my
folder and this is like I said this is a
really good site for stock videos if you
want something more high quality you
might want to look at like Shutterstock
they have some really nice premium
videos that'll run you about a hundred
bucks apiece or something like that
alright so now that we have the video
downloaded let's go ahead and create our
index dot HTML file and then we're also
gonna need a style dot CSS file alright
so let's start in the index.html I'm
using Emmet so I'm just going to do
exclamation tab you'll see me doing some
shortcuts throughout the video that's
because I'm using Emmet Emmet comes with
vs code but if you're using something
like atom or sublime text you'll have to
install it separately if you want to use
it
alright I'm also using a extension
called live server for vyas code which
will allow me to open up my HTML file on
my local host but of course you don't
need this you can just open up your HTML
file anywhere alright so let's go ahead
and change the title here we'll just
call this video background and by the
way you might see a bunch of flies
flying around me that this time of year
is crazy I don't know about where you
guys are but in Massachusetts right now
flies are just insane
I don't stink or anything are not dirty
it's just they're everywhere
they're at my wife's work they're in my
car they're freaking everywhere and
they're really aggravating but anyways
I'm gonna go ahead and start up my live
server here and you'll see that we just
have a blank page because we haven't
actually added anything so let's start
with the mock up now I'm gonna put
everything wrapped inside of a header
tag and this header I'm actually going
to give it a class I'm gonna give it a
class of the - header and I'm also going
to give it a class of container okay
because we want everything to be
contained into the middle rather than
going all the way across and I'm talking
about the content inside now inside the
header we're gonna have another div and
I'm gonna give this a class of video
video - what do they call it hold on
full screen video wrap so full screen -
video - wrap alright and then inside
here is where we're gonna have the
actual video so we'll put a video tag
for the source it's gonna be code dot
MOV because that's why I called it it's
also right in the same folder if it was
inside of a subfolder then I would have
to add that here as well all right but
let's go ahead and save that and you'll
see right away this pops up now that
these these freaking flies
now this isn't playing it's not going to
play by default using the html5 video
tag what you have to do is add in an
extra attribute of autoplay okay we're
going to set that equal to true and then
I'm also going to set an attribute
called loop and we're gonna set that to
true as well because we wanted to keep
playing we don't want it to just play
once and stop so let's save and now
you'll see it'll automatically start
playing when the page reloads all right
now underneath the fullscreen video wrap
we're gonna have the overlay div alright
so let's create a div with the class of
header -
overlay now nothing's going to go in
here this is just we're gonna just style
that with CSS underneath that we're
going to have the content so we're gonna
have a div with the class of header -
content and then in here we'll have an
h1 that'll just say hello everyone and
you can put whatever you want in here
and then underneath that we'll have a
paragraph tag whoops we'll have a
paragraph tag and I'm just gonna say
lorem what do they do LARM 20 tab and
that will give us just 20 20 words of
dummy text and then under that we want a
button okay it's not actually gonna be a
button it's gonna be an a tag and I'm
gonna give it a class of BTN all right
doesn't matter where it goes and then
for the text we'll just say read more
all right so let's save that now we are
gonna have those sections underneath but
I'm not gonna worry about those just yet
I just want to get the the video header
part now notice the content right now is
below everything but we're gonna set it
so that it's actually over the video
okay but all that's gonna be done with
CSS so let's go ahead and link our CSS
file so up in the head we're gonna put a
link rel equals stylesheet and then the
href will equal style dot CSS okay so
now let's go to our CSS and from here
first thing I want to do is put in an
asterisk because I want everything all
elements should have a box sizing of
border-box
okay because I don't want any issues
with margin and padding and width and
height a margin and padding should be
included in the width and height for all
elements all right and then we're gonna
go ahead and add our body stuff so for
body let's say we want margin zero for
the font-family let's choose this I'm
gonna choose a Segoe UI and then to home
a Geneva verdana' sans-serif'
and then let's see we want the font size
look font size is going to be one REM
okay we're gonna use REM units for most
things in this project let's also set
the line height I keep putting a zero
there instead of the space line height
we're gonna set that to 1.5 and then
let's set the color of the text of the
body to triple three and finally let's
set overflow we're gonna say overflow
dash X which is horizontal I'm gonna set
that to hidden okay just to make sure
that there's no horizontal scroll bars
all right so that should be it for the
body now we'll do the V header so class
V dash header and for that we're gonna
set a height of 100 viewport Heights now
I explained this in my if you've watched
my full-screen image landing page video
viewport Heights and viewport widths you
can basically think of like slices so no
matter how big the browser is if it's
resized or
maximized or whatever think of the
height as a hundred slices going this
way okay now we want this header to fill
up all of it so we want all 100 slices
if we were to say 50 VH it would fill it
up halfway okay we would fill up 50 of
the 100 viewport Heights okay or of the
slices so think of it like that if
you've never used VH or VW before
alright now we also want this to display
as a flexbox so we're gonna say display
flex we also want to align everything to
the center vertically so for that we can
say a line items center
and then we're gonna set the color of
everything to white since it's gonna be
over that blue overlay all right now if
I save this you'll notice that the text
down here is gone that's because it's
now up here but it's behind the video
okay but don't worry about that just yet
we're gonna fix that with the z-index
property later on alright so now we want
to deal with the container alright so
the container basically is going to move
everything it's going to move the
content into the middle we're gonna add
margin Auto and so on so for the
container let's give it a max width okay
we don't want to do just a width we want
this to be responsive so we're gonna say
max width is going to be 960 pixels I'm
gonna add padding left of 1 R M padding
right will also be 1 R M and then let's
set margin I will say margin Auto and
I'm also going to set the text align to
the center all right and we'll save now
notice the video got pushed over a
little bit we're gonna fix that in a
second so the video has a wrap and has
this class right here full screen video
wraps so we're gonna take care of that
just move this up a little bit and we'll
say full screen - I keep putting that
zero this I'm trying to find keyboards
that are silent because usually when I'm
doing my regular coding I use a
mechanical keyboard but it's too loud
for most you guys a lot of guys complain
about it so I'm trying to find the
perfect quiet keyboard and they just all
suck I hate them all so that's why you
see a lot of typos and stuff like that
so let's say full screen video - rap
and we're gonna set and this one has
like really small arrow keys which is
kind of screwing me up but anyway for
that we're gonna say position:absolute
excuse me
so position:absolute we wanted to start
at the top left so top:0 left:0 and if i
save that now you'll see that it moved
the video up to the very top left okay
next thing we're gonna do is say is make
sure that the width is going to be 100%
we're gonna make sure that the height is
gonna be a hundred viewport heights so
VH and then we want to set the overflow
to hidden okay we want to make sure that
there's no scroll bars so let's save
that and it doesn't look much different
all right now for the video itself we
want to make sure that that is always
100% height and width so let's say
actually I'll just copy this class here
and we want to say the video element
inside of that we want to set the min
min width to 100% a hundred percent
whatever and then min height to 100% all
right now for the overlay which is the
the blue you know the blue overlay that
goes over the video that has a class of
header overlay all right and for this
we're gonna set the height that's also
going to be a hundred viewport Heights
and we're gonna set this to a position
of absolute okay same as the full screen
video wrap we're going to set top:0
left:0 we're gonna set the width that
shape with the width right here the
width is actually going to be a hundred
viewport widths okay so it's going to
cover the entire thing and then we want
to set
the background color or will just say
background and that's gonna be - a
hexadecimal value which is going to be 2
2 5 4 7 0 which is that blue color all
right now if I go ahead and save this
you'll see that it's actually gonna
cover the video okay it's positioned
absolute and it has height and width
that's going you know all the way across
all the way down but we want to be able
to see the video through it so we need
to add an opacity but before we do that
I'm just gonna add a z-index of 1 just
to make sure that it's always gonna be
on top of the video all right the higher
the z-index the closer to to you it is
the the lower it is and you can do
negative values as well the more far
back it is so let's set the opacity of
this and you can set this to what you
want I'm gonna say 0.85 and save and now
you can see the video playing behind it
now if you wanted the video to be more
clear you could should make this lower
like you just you could say 6 5 and you
can see now the blue is lighter and you
can see the video better but I think
that 85 is good because we want to be
able to clearly see the text that's over
it all right so now let's talk about the
text now the text is in the right spot
it's actually here it's just behind
everything now remember what I was
saying about z-index what we want to do
is say header - content which is what
has the h1 and all that stuff now we
want to set that Z index to two okay
because that's gonna bring it forward so
let's save that and now we can see it
okay it's not behind everything anymore
all right so now let's style it we're
gonna say header content h1 and let's
set the font size for that there we go
with the zero again font size we're
gonna set that to let's say 50 pixels
and then I'm gonna set the margin bottom
let's at the margin bottom to zero and
save and now we have a bigger header now
for the paragraph so we want to say head
our - content P
I forgot the dot so head our content P
we're gonna set - let's say we want the
font size to 1.5 REM and let's set D I'm
just going to set it to display:block
and let's set the padding bottom can I
set that to two REM alright save that
alright now for the button or the link
that has a class of BTN so for that we
want to set the background so the
background is going to be a hexadecimal
which is going to be 3/4 be 300 or not o
zero and then set the color of it to
white okay let's set the font size to
1.2 REM let's set the padding so top and
bottom is going to be one REM left and
right it will be to REM okay and then
let's take away the underline with text
decoration set that to none and save and
there's our button alright so that looks
pretty good now when this gets smaller
you see how there's not much space here
we only have a padding of one REM what
I'm gonna do is put a media query down
here so we'll say media and we're gonna
set this to have a max width of 960
pixels so whenever it's under 960 pixels
I want to take the container
and I just want to say patting rights
set that to three Ram instead of one
same thing with padding-left
we'll set that to three REM excuse me
and save and now you can see there's a
little more room when it's under 960 all
right so I think that's good yeah for
the head or at least so if I resize this
you can see that it's always gonna be a
hundred a hundred percent of the width
and height all right so now let's take
care of the sections underneath so we'll
go back to our markup let's go under the
header and we'll put in a section I'm
gonna give this section a class of
section and also a class of section - eh
okay and then here we'll put an h1 will
just say section a and then underneath
it we'll put a paragraph and I'm gonna
say lorem 50 tab which gives us just 50
dummy text also I just want to wrap this
in a container
alright so container this should be
wrapped around all of this it should be
within the section though all right and
then what I'll do is just copy this
whole section paste it in again and just
change this to Section B the class and
also the text right here the section B
alright we'll save that and now no
matter what this is still going to be a
hundred percent of the the height and
width but if I scroll down we'll see the
sections alright so let's go back to our
CSS we just have a couple more things to
add so for the section class which both
of those have we're just going to add a
padding of what did I do 20 pixels on
the top and bottom zero on the left and
right all right and then for section B I
want that to have a dark background so
we're gonna say
B and we're gonna set the background say
background to triple three and the color
to white and save and there we go
okay now this video you'll you'll notice
has a quick pause I don't know if I
mention that but when it's done before
loops again it has like a two second
pause if you get a better high quality
video it shouldn't do that but again I
didn't want to spend you know 100 bucks
on a video just to make this tutorial so
I think that's gonna be it guys I will
probably create a code pen and put that
in the description so you guys can can
