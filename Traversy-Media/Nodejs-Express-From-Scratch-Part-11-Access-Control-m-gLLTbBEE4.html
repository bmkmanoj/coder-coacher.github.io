and in the last episode we created our
login functionality so we can now log in
but we're not really doing anything else
you know in terms of access control or
functionality so what we're going to do
first is make it so that when we add an
article whatever user we're logged in as
that the ID is going to go into this
author field so we want to remove this
this form field we don't want to
manually type in the author anymore so
let's go to add article and just get rid
of this form group here alright save
that then we're going to go to the route
that we submit this to so let's go to
articles J s and routes and go to this
post request and I'm just going to
comment this out because we don't need
the author validation anymore all right
now we're going to go down here and
instead of specifying the author as
request body author from the form we're
going to say request dot user because
remember when we're logged in we have
the request dot user object and we want
the ID which is going to be dot
underscore ID okay so it will
automatically put that users ID as the
author so let's go ahead and save that
and then if we go over here and reload
let's actually delete these guys here
all right so let's login so say Brad and
let's add an article and we'll say
article 1 this is article number 1 and
submit article added now if we go to
article 1 you'll see it in houses
written by and then our ID okay because
that's what we're storing now so what we
want to do is add an extra query to find
the user and then I'll put the name here
so let's go to the single article route
right here and let's first of all
actually let me put that back let's
bring in the user model just like we did
the article model okay we'll just say
article model and then this is going to
be user and then we're going to change
this to user and then we can access the
model so we'll go back down here and
once we fetch the article here it's
going to give us all the the data so
what we'll do is we'll say user dot find
by ID and pass in article dots author
because that's going to hold the user ID
all right then we want our function and
this is going to have error and user
it's going to give us the user back so
what we need to do is just grab the
render cut it and let's put it inside
here and then we're going to set let's
see we still want the article of course
and then we're going to set author as
user dot name okay because we're getting
the user object here we want the name
we're going to put it in its author so
we can access this inside the template
so we'll save that and go to article dot
pug and instead of doing article Daath
or we do
one author all right let's go back and
reload and now we get the name so now
what I want to do is make it so that we
can't add an article if we're not logged
in alright we're not logged in now we
just got booted out because I reset the
server
let's look we want to hide the link from
people that aren't logged in but we also
don't want people to go to the URL
manually so let's first take care of
hiding the link so we'll go to our
layout and just like we did here we're
just going to go right above the add
article list item and let's say if let's
do if not user know if user that's
correct and then we're just going to tab
this over and now we're not logged in if
we reload it's gone but we can still
access this page so what we can do is we
can create a special function for access
control so let's go into our articles
routes and down at the bottom here say
access control and we're going to create
a function and let's call it ensure
authenticated
alright so ensure authenticated and
that's going to take requests or sponsz
next and we can say if since we're using
passport now we can say if request dot
is authenticated then we want to just
return next so we just want to move on
else okay if they're not authenticated
we want to send a message and redirect
so request dot flash and this is going
to be danger because we want to be read
and then we'll say please login
all right we'll redirect to the login
page
so res dot redirect and it's going to go
to slash users slash login all right now
what we can do is we can add this to any
route that we want to protect so for
instance the ad article page if we go up
here we can add it in as a second
parameter so it's saying sure
authenticated and now if we save and we
go back and reload we get booted out ok
if we log in not only does it show now
but if we click on it we can actually
visit the route alright we also want to
put this into the edit form which is
right here ok any route you want to
protect you can now just add that too
which is really nice so it's save now we
also don't want the this edit and delete
to show if we're not logged in you can
see we're not logged in and it's showing
so let's go to our article dot plug
where we have the edit and delete and we
want to check for two things here one we
want to make sure that the user is
logged in so just if user but we also
want to make sure that the person can
only see these if it's if they own the
article so what we can do is we can say
if user dot ID because remember users an
object and then we want to say equals
article dot author because the author
field has the ID user ID all right then
we'll just tab this over and save and if
we reload it's not there now if we log
in you'll see it is there and now what
I'll do is log out and register a new
account let's say John Doe I'll just say
J Doe at gmail user name we'll say John
and password
let's submit and now we can login as
John and now if we go to article one
you'll see even though we're logged in
we can't see the edit and delete because
we don't own that article alright but if
we were to go to articles slash edit
slash and then the ID we can that we can
go to the edit page and we don't want
that so what we'll have to do is go back
to our articles routes and let's go to
the edit where the Edit form is loaded
ok so we're finding the article by ID
then what we want to do is just put an
if statement right here and we'll say if
article if article dot author is not
equal to request dot user dot underscore
ID then we want to send a message and
redirect okay so this will be danger and
let's say we'll just say not authorized
okay and then we'll redirect and let's
just redirect to the home page all right
so if we go back here and we reload we
get booted out because we're not
actually let's just log back in as John
alright and we still shouldn't be able
to go to articles slash edit / ID not
authorized okay but if we log in as Brad
click on edit and we can edit okay now
for the delete this is going to work a
little differently because we're making
an AJAX request and sending a response
back to the client so if we go down to
our delete right here we're going to
first make sure that though the user is
logged in so we're going to check for
the ID so go above the query here
and let's say if if not request dot user
dot underscore ID then we want to send a
response okay now this is sending a 200
response which is everything's okay
what we'll do is we'll say res dot
status in passing 500 okay we'll send a
500 error and then say dot send oops
all right and then also we don't want to
just make sure the users logged in but
we want to make sure that they that they
own that that articles so let's go see
we'll go right below the query and I'm
going to say article dot find by ID okay
and then we're going to pass in request
stop params ID so that's coming from the
URL and then function so this will have
error and it also give us the article
and then we want to do an if statement
here and we want to say if article dot
author is not equal to request dot user
dot underscore ID then we want to send a
500 our just like we did here okay and
then we'll put an else and then what
I'll do is just grab the remove right
here all this and we'll cut and we'll go
in here and paste it in alright so let's
see should do here the only way that we
can test this is if I put these buttons
back so let's just temporarily go to
article pug and we'll just get rid of
that just for now oops
so that should be on the same level all
right so right now I'm log I'm not
logged in so let's try that delete and
if we look down here we're getting the
500-hour okay so that's not going to
work and if we log in as John and click
delete again we get a 500 down here and
if we logout and log in as Brad and we
click delete it works okay we want to
make sure that we do hide these though
because there's no special error message
for that I mean we could somehow get the
message from the from the error response
and put it in the app but I'm just going
to make sure that these are hidden all
right so let's add another article is
John so let's say article 1 this is
John's article ok and now we can see
edit and delete alright so that works so
we have full crud functionality we have
a complete user registration and login
system with password hashing we have
access control we can add articles
without being logged in we can only edit
and delete the the current users
articles so we've done quite a bit here
and it's it's but it's all been from
scratch so hopefully you guys like the
series now I'm not exactly sure where
I'm going to go from here just like with
a lot of the series that I do because a
lot of it depends on the response from
you guys
I would like to deploy it so I don't
know that might be the next one it might
even be the last one I'm not exactly
sure but I would like to do that I
usually like to deploy apps to
digitalocean I think it's that it's
pretty easy to work with very cheap and
also they give you a lot of
freedom with your server with your VPS
okay so hopefully you guys can use some
of the skills that you learned in this
course to create your own applications
but that's going to be it for now guys
