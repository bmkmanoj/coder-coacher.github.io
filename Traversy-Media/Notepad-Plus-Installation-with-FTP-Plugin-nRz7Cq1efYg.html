tutorial I'm gonna show you how to
install notepad plus plus which is a
fantastic code editor very lightweight
but also full-featured has much more
features than your standard notepad that
comes with Windows so I suggest it for
for most most types of projects PHP HTML
it also has an FTP client plug-in that
will I'll also show you how to install
that so I don't know the exact URL so
just search for notepad plus plus ok and
we just want to go to download
and click we can install we can get a
couple different things if packages but
I'm just going to get the Installer and
I'm on Windows 7 32 bit so I'm going to
open when done
all right so this is my UAC I'm gonna
approve do English next I agree we're
gonna keep it in the C Drive Program
Files and keep all the default options
and I'm gonna create a desktop icon
install all right so if we can finish
and run notepad you can see we have line
numbers we have a bunch of options up
here we have options to plugin and this
where is it NPP FTP is a great plug-in
if we click on show NPP FTP window we
get it over here and we can actually
work on sites that are online so all we
have to do is go to profile settings and
click add new and let's see I'll add
like my staging server and all you got
to do is put a new host name and look
I'm sorry that's the username you want
to put in the host name which is the
domain most of the time and then your
password
and click close and now we should be
able to connect all right throw so now
you can see we can go into our public
HTML folder and so just a bunch of stuff
here you can click on say test and I can
head at the index file and anything any
edits I make I just have to save and
it'll automatically re-upload through
the FTP plug-in so you can basically
develop in real time as opposed to
having to do it all locally and then
manually uploading it to your server so
this is real convenient this all there's
a bunch of other plugins as well the
snippets plug-in works really well if
you want you know pre pre formatted code
to just insert so it's a really great
editor and I'd suggest it on most
projects maybe not I'd say on most web
development projects maybe not on you
know Java or C sharp or anything like
that so I just wanted to throw that out
there and show you how to install that
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
