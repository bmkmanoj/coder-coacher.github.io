solutions and today I'm going to make a
tutorial on how to connect Dreamweaver
to your website so that when you're
editing your website files you don't
have to save and then re-upload or
whatever you'll actually have the site
in Dreamweaver on this in this panel
over here so you can actually just open
your files and and save them and as you
save them they'll go back up to the web
server it's it's pretty easy stuff you
know this is pretty much for the
beginners if you just ah to use
Dreamweaver just getting into web
development in general so I have
Dreamweaver open
I have FileZilla which is in my opinion
the best FTP client available it's free
you can go to files org I believe the
website is and then I have my window
open I have a brick that's a fresh
Joomla install for its site that I'm
going to be building and what I'm doing
is I created a HTML CSS template which I
want to turn into a Joomla template I'm
not going to go through that in this
tutorial I'll probably make another one
for that but this is just so I can get
into the Joomla site from within
Dreamweaver so the first thing I want to
do is I want to create a folder on my
local machine for the the Joomla
template so here I have the project the
project files so I'm going to create a
new folder I'm going to call it live
site
in that I'm going to have my custom
Joomla template that I'll be building
which I will call tech guy Joomla 2 5
this is a joomla 2.5 website so now i
want to create the same file on my
server in the joomla templates folder so
here you can see I'm in my joomla 2.5
root directory i'm going to go down to
templates and these are the available
templates i'm going to create a new
folder and name it the same thing so now
we have the local folder and we have the
remote now I want to connect those from
within Dreamweaver so I want to go to
site I want to go to new site and you
can name it and you want to pick the
local site folder so we're going to
browse to where we just were my projects
folder current projects
um CID
live site and this is the folder that we
created so I'm going to select that now
I like to go to advanced settings and
turn off the cache because it can you
can kind of mess things up and you need
about developing but now we want to
service the second one down servers and
we want to add a server and you want to
name it and here you need to input the
FTP info obviously yours will be
different see and password one second
just going to look up the password for
this
Oh
one second guys
here we go
okay and now you can want to test
and it connected successfully but right
now it's in the root directory we don't
want that we want it to connect to this
folder here the new temp the new
template folder so depending this path
could be different depending on your
server but I know that my linux server
it's going to be public HTML slash now
this is actually hold on one second
all right yeah so public HTML should
bring us to the root structure and I
have the site in a dev subfolder
depending on where your your site is
located this would be different if it's
in the root directory you wouldn't have
this dev but as you can see my site is
at valley.com dev so and then we want to
go to the templates folder and then we
want the template which was tech guy
Joomla two five five now you want to
test it again and it connected
successfully and the last thing I want
to do is go to advanced and I want to
click automatically upload files to
server on save and then click Save
save again and now you'll see it over
here we actually do not have anything in
that folder on the server so I let's
just create it just test file I'm just
this is the test and I'll save it as now
I'm going to save it we in the right
place yeah see we're back in live site
so this is the local drive I'm going to
save this as just index.html save and
now you'll see this pops up which means
it's uploading and now you'll see it's
over here the index.html file now if we
go on the web server and run the learn
of the new directory and we just let's
just refresh you'll see it there it is
eight index.html so every time you edit
this and save it it'll upload so there's
no saving it and then drag going here
and then bring in file over to FileZilla
and none of that so it's just it's
essential if you're going to use
Dreamweaver to develop and if you're
using something else
Nighy de maybe NetBeans or something
like that they they pretty much all the
good ones have the same kind of feature
so and it should be relatively easy if
you know how to deal with Dreamweaver so
that's it for this tutorial
like I said I'll probably make another
one about actually creating a Joomla
template which will be a little more
advanced but thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
