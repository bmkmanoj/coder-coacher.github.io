gonna be looking at PDO or PHP data
objects and I'm doing this tutorial for
a few reasons one because we've been
very very JavaScript heavy lately and
another is because I've had a bunch of
requests to do something with PDO
especially from those of you that have
been following the PHP front-to-back
series and I apologize that that series
kind of ended so abruptly or went out on
hiatus I should say it's not actually
ended it just wasn't getting the views
so you can think of this video as kind
of a continuation of that series if you
want now PDO it can be a very
complicated topic there's a lot to it so
we'll be covering mostly the basics in
this in this crash course so we're gonna
look at some slides and then we're gonna
jump into some code all right so before
we get started I just want to mention
some of my social media links so if you
guys want to follow me on twitter
facebook instagram we also have a
discord chat server at discord GG slash
traversing media i've been extremely
busy lately with courses and stuff so i
haven't been on too much but there are
you know there's a bunch of people that
are on there that are willing to help if
you have any issues or if you just want
to talk about programming in general all
right so what is PDO it stands for PHP
data objects and it's a PHP extension
which is a lean and consistent way to
access a database okay it can be used in
place of MySQL I which is MySQL improved
and that's one of the main ways to
connect to and work with a MySQL
database unlike MySQL I PDO works with
multiple database system so you can use
it with MySQL or PostgreSQL there's a
bunch of different databases you can use
and I'll show you some of those in a
little bit so PDO provides a data access
layer which means that no matter what
database you're using no matter what
type of system you use the same
functions to execute queries and fetch
data PDO doesn't provide a database
abstraction it
re-write sql-like full-blown abstraction
layers like something like PR DB it's an
actual data access layer okay it's also
completely object-oriented with methods
and properties PDO ships with PHP
version 5.1 and later it will not run on
PHP for because it needs the
object-oriented features of PHP 5
alright so what are some benefits of PDO
over something like MySQL I as I said it
works with multiple databases it doesn't
it does not support syntax that's just
specific to a certain database in some
cases you can just switch out the
connection string to change the database
you're working with so for instance to
go from MySQL to postgrads
now many SQL databases do have different
styles and flavors of SQL so you do have
to take that into account as well
alright now security is one of the
biggest benefits of PDO
it uses prepared statements which can
help prevent your database from SQL
injections ok when we get into the code
I'm going to show you how to write
prepared statements in SQL injection in
simple terms is where someone tries to
insert SQL statements and instructions
through some kind of user input like a
form on your website so stuff that could
completely destroy your database if you
have poor if you have a poorly designed
system this is very easy to do alright
so a prepared statement is a pre
compiled SQL statement that separates
the instruction of the data I'm sorry
the instruction of the SQL statement
from the data with prepared statements
the data that comes in from a user is
treated as just data there's no way that
it can be interpreted as in SQL
instruction wicken which can happen when
data is passed into your SQL alright so
I should also mention that MySQL I does
include in prepared statements PDO just
does it better with named parameters and
so on I'll get into that later so in
addition to PDO being very secure it's
also very usable it has a ton of helper
functions
that can automate routine operations and
I'll show you some of the different
options for fetching data also
exceptions and so on it's reusable in a
sense that it has a unified API to
access multiple databases
it also has excellent error handling
options and functionality using
exceptions there's basically three
different ways to handle errors and
that's silent warning and exception
so with PDO you have three main classes
you have the PDO class this basically
represents a connection between PHP in
the database this is where we plug in
the DSN which I'll talk about later the
PDO statement class represents a
prepared statement and after it's
executed the associated result from that
statement and then the PDO exception
class represents errors raised by PDO
and there's many different options and
ways to handle exceptions so here are
some of the databases that can be used
with PDO mysql which is what we'll be
using Postgres Microsoft SQL Oracle and
many others many of which I've never
even touched alright guys so I don't
want to bore you with any more slides so
let's jump in and let's start to work
with PDO alright guys so if you want to
use PDO obviously you're gonna need PHP
installed what I when I do PHP
development I use something called xampp
or zamp however you want to pronounce it
and it basically gives you a complete
local environment with an Apache server
PHP MySQL a tool called PHP myadmin it
gives you a whole bunch of stuff right
on your local machine so I would
definitely suggest that for development
and it's cross-platform it's available
on Windows Mac or Linux and that's
available at Apache friends org but of
course you can use anything else if you
have an if you have a native lamp stack
on a linux server or something you can
use that you can use WAMP which is
another option which i think is just for
Windows just check that real quick so
you have WAMP WAMP server comm which is
kind of the same thing gives you an
Apache server PHP then you have
amp which is used to be for just Mac but
I believe he can get it for Windows now
yeah I think you can get it for ya you
can download for Windows too but I would
suggest xampp or Sam so once if you have
one of those installed or you just have
a regular lamp stack you want to first
just check your PHP dot ini file if
you're using zamp it's going to be in
your zamp folder which is going to be in
your c drive by default and then go to
PHP and then your PHP dot ini' file
which is right here I'm just going to
open that with sublime and then let's
just do a quick search here for PDO and
then there's an extension for each
database okay so you'll see right here
is the PDO mysql extension and you want
to make sure that this is uncommented
you want to make sure there's no
semicolon in front of it okay you'll see
that I also use it with Postgres so I
don't have a semicolon there either
you can use it with SQL Lite and then
there's other databases as well that
aren't even listed here but make sure
that that MySQL one is does not have a
semicolon if it does just remove it save
the file and then just restart your
server okay and if you're using zamp to
restart just go to your panel which is
right here and just stop and start
apache
alright so let's go ahead and get
started now if you're using zamp you'll
have an htdocs folder that's your
localhost and whatever you're using just
go to wherever your server folder is and
I've created a folder called PDO example
and then I just have a single index.php
file in here and that's what's opened
over here in vs code okay so if I go to
localhost / PDO example that's what's
getting loaded it's just a blank file
all right I'm gonna make this smaller
because we're not actually building an
application or anything we're just using
the browser for output all right so now
what we need to do is create a database
actually I'm gonna make this bigger
again because we're going to use the PHP
myadmin to create a database now if you
want to use your -
you all shallow or some other program
you can do that as well but we're going
to just really quickly create a very
very simple database so we'll say create
database I'll just call this let's call
it PDO posts and we'll create we're
gonna create one table called post our
posts I don't know what exactly how many
fields let's say six and go alright so
we're going to go ahead and create an ID
which is going to be an integer it's
going to be auto increment so we want to
check that and it's going to be our
primary key so you want to make sure
that that's as primary then we're gonna
have a title which is going to be a
varchar' a variable character that's
gonna be let's say 255 max length next
one will be the body
that'll be text okay so text actually
doesn't need a length and then we'll
have an author so for author and that'll
be varchar' will say 255 and then we'll
have an is published and we'll set that
to boolean which is right here and let's
set a default for that so under this
default we're gonna say has defined and
we're gonna say true okay and then the
last one here let's just say I don't
know will say create our created at and
we're gonna set this to date/time we
really don't need this one but I'll just
put it in anyway so we'll say date/time
and under default let's say current
timestamp so that'll get inserted by
default alright and that's it let's go
ahead and save and now we have our
database and we have our post tables so
that's what we're gonna be working with
in this crash course alright so back to
our file over here we have an index.php
file inside of PDO example so let's
create a PHP tag and then first thing we
want to do is just create our variables
for our database so we're gonna have our
host which is going to be of course our
localhost we're gonna have a user
all right now I'm using my root user and
password now if you want to manage your
database users you can actually do that
from PHP myadmin if you go to privileges
you'll see I'm using my root user right
here and I'm gonna put the password in
if you want to change the password you
can go right here and you can change it
all right but we're gonna go ahead and
just put that in which is just one
through six and then we want the DB name
and the DB name is P do posts okay or
whatever you put so right here P do
posts alright so those are our variables
now what we need to do is we need to set
the DSN so DSN is data data source name
which is basically a string that has the
Associated data structure to describe a
connection to a data source so this is
where we include the whatever driver
whatever database you want to use in our
case we're using MySQL we want to also
include the host and the database name
and stuff like that so we're gonna go
ahead and format this so let's create a
variable here called DSN and we're gonna
set this to a string and in here we're
gonna pass in the driver we want which
is MySQL then we want to put a colon and
then the host equals and then remember
we have our variables up here so we want
to use those so we're gonna concatenate
in here I'm gonna go ahead and put a dot
and then say host so this is just
bringing in this local host into our
string here for bringing in the variable
alright then we want to concatenate
again and open up a string and we want
to put a semicolon okay after the host
you should have a semicolon and then we
want to specify DV name equals and then
again after this single quote we're
going to concatenate the variable DB
name all right so that's our DSN now
what we want to do is create a PDO
instance
and for that we'll just create a
variable I'm going to call it PDO of
course you can call it whatever you want
a lot of people call it connection and
then I'm going to say new PDO and then
in here we want to pass in that DSN we
also want to pass in the user and we
want to pass in the password okay so
that creates our instance to work with
now as far as making queries there's
basically two ways that we can do this
we can use the query method which is
fine if you're not using any kind of
variables or any kind of user input but
if you are which in a lot of cases
you're going to be if you're using you
know an application with forms and stuff
then you're gonna want to use prepared
statements okay but before we get into
prepared statements let's talk a little
bit about PDO query about the query
method alright so say PDO query and
we're going to create a variable called
s TM T for statement and then we're
gonna take that PDO instance and we're
gonna call the query method or that PDO
object and here we're just gonna put a
simple query we'll say select all from
posts okay we have a post table we just
want to select all from it and then this
will actually get our results now what
we want to do is we want to loop through
the results and then output them on to
the screen so we're gonna create a while
loop here alright and we're gonna say
while row equals and then the statement
s TM T and then we want to just call it
a method called fetch all right so we
want to go like that now inside this
fetch method we need to basically tell
it how we want this formatted so let me
just do a quick search here we'll say
PDO fetch options
okay now you can fetch as an associate
of an array which is what I'm gonna do
right now returns an array indexed by
column name as returned in your result
set you can do fetch object okay so he
can fetch an object which uses this
syntax where is it with the little arrow
here you can fetch a regular array you
can fetch key value pairs there's all
different stuff you can do but what
we're going to be working with is
associative arrays and objects which is
the most common so in here we're gonna
pass in right here PDO double : fetch
Assoc alright and then in here we can do
what we want with the data so I'm just
gonna go an echo and we're gonna say row
and remember it's an associative array
so we need to format it like this with
our brackets and then we can grab
whatever fields we want if we look at
our database let's see it's gonna posts
if we look at the structure we have a
title body author so I'm gonna get the
title alright so we'll say echo row
title and then I'm just going to also
concatenate a line break alright so
we'll just go like that now if I save
and reload we're not gonna see anything
because we don't actually have anything
in the database so what we'll do is go
back to PHP myadmin
or to your MySQL shell or however you
want to do it and insert some data all
right so it's very easy with PHP myadmin
we'll just go to insert will say post 1
this is post 1 and author I'll just say
brad is published 1 and then I'll leave
the current timestamp for this one we'll
say post
- yeah this is post to author we'll say
John
say go alright so now we have two
entries in our database you can see here
so now let's go back to our web page and
reload and we get post one and post two
so we're able to fetch this data now let
me give you an example of using an
object okay formatting this is an object
so I'm going to copy this while
statement and then just go ahead and
comment it out and then we're gonna pass
in here fetch our be G and then instead
of using this format you'll see what
happens if I save and I try to reload
it'll say cannot use of type STD class
as array whenever you see this it
basically means that you're trying to
take an object and use the the syntax of
an array so we're gonna go ahead and say
row and then use this little arrow and
then title alright and then we'll save
and reload and then we get our data now
if you don't want to have to always
specify it like this you'll see if I go
ahead and take that out and reload it's
saying trying to get property of non
objects so if you want to set a default
of let's say an object every time you
fetch data what you can do is you can go
and you can add an attribute so up here
we're gonna say PDO and we're gonna say
set attribute and we're gonna pass in
here PDO double colon attr underscore
default underscore fetch underscore mode
and then we're gonna put a comma and
we're gonna say PDO
double underscore fetch underscore OBG j
sorry alright and that'll set it to the
default of an object so now if I save
and even though I have nothing inside of
here and we reload it's gonna work now
if you want to override that that's fine
so if I were to go ahead and uncomment
this and even though we have it set to
an object we --over we're overriding it
right here as an associative array so if
I save and reload that's still
work okay so that's about as far as I
want to go with the just the PDO query
now we're gonna talk a little bit about
prepared statements so let's go ahead
and just comment all this stuff out and
I'm gonna leave everything I do here for
you guys
this stuff should stay okay all this
stuff should stay so let's say prepared
statements all right so basically we
prepared statements we have two main
methods and that's prepare and execute
okay now first thing I'm gonna do is
show you an unsafe way to do it okay so
you guys have probably seen this a lot
so we'll have an SQL variable and it'll
say like select all from posts where
author equals and then you have the and
this is this is worse if it's an insert
obviously but you'll have like the
variable right in here oops
author okay and then this variable will
come from a form like a submit form or
something or search form and this can
give them the opportunity to actually
insert SQL instructions right into your
query so that's what prepared statements
are good for it separates the
instruction from the actual data okay so
there's no way to kind of mix them so
let's go ahead and comment that out and
let's go ahead and fetch some post just
like we did above but with prepared
statements so let's say fetch
multiple posts and I'm gonna show you
guys how to fetch single post I'm going
to show you how to insert how to update
delete all that stuff how to search with
with with like and I will do some other
stuff as well so to fetch multiple posts
now when you're using what the hell
prepared statements there's basically
two ways to do it you can use positional
parameter
you can use named parameters so
positional parameters are actually
supported by mysqli if you've ever done
prepared statements with mysqli then
you've probably used those so let's
first let me first show you those
so we'll say positional parameter
statement so we'll say SQL equals and
let's do select all from posts where
author equals now instead of just
putting in you know my variable like we
did up there we're gonna put in a
placeholder and that's gonna be a
question mark this is this is a
positional parameter okay when we use
the question mark and then we're gonna
go on to the next line and we're going
to create our statement so we'll say st
mt and we're gonna set that to PDO so
we're taking our PDO instance and we're
gonna call a method called prepare okay
and then we're gonna just put in our SQL
so that's gonna prepare our statement
now we need to execute it so we're gonna
say st mt and we're going to call
execute okay and then inside execute we
need to put we need to put an array and
we're gonna pass in whatever the
variable is now let's say our user input
and we're getting an author and we'll
set that to Brad actually let's put in
one more post in PHP myadmin save post 3
I'll say author Brad I'll put another
one as well those four and this one will
set is publish to zero and go okay so
now we have quite a few posts and we're
going to go ahead and inside this
execute we're gonna put this variable of
author okay so this is the placeholder
here and then we're filling this
placeholder with this now it's important
to know with positional parameters the
order is very sent is sensitive okay so
if you say we're author equals this and
something else equals that the first
variable should be first in this array
and then the next variable okay so it
should be in the same order hopefully
that makes sense and then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna create a
variable called posts we're gonna set it
to s T M T and then we're since we're
fetching more than one we're gonna call
fetch all okay now inside this fetch all
we can put in our fetch absorve fetches
so it's just like we did up here but I'm
just gonna leave it blank since we set
the default of object okay so now what
we can do is we can loop through these
posts actually when we first do we'll do
a var dump okay so if our dump will just
basically show us what's in this post
object or this post variable okay and
you can see that it has all of our posts
in it it has whenever you see this STD
class it relates to an object so what we
can do here is we can loop through with
a for each all right so we'll say for
each posts as and I'm just going to say
posts you can use whatever you want and
we'll just echo out post title all right
and then we'll just cat
a line-break alright so we'll save that
and reload and there we go we get all of
our posts that have the author Brad
notice that post two is not there okay
now I want to show you how to do the
same thing using named parameters so
what I'm gonna do is actually I'll copy
this because it's very similar and I'm
gonna come comment that out and then
here we're going to say named params so
with named parameters instead of using
the question mark we're going to use
colon and then a named parameter so
we'll say author and then down here
instead of just having a regular array
we're gonna have an associative array so
it'll be author whatever the name
parameter and then we'll point to the
variable which is a Pierre Brad okay we
can do the same thing so we'll save
we'll reload and there we go if we
change the author to John and save and
reload we get just post two because
that's John's post now let's say you
wanted to use more than one variable in
the where clause so let's say we wanted
to get all the published posts too so
what I'll do is put a variable for is
published and we'll set that to true and
then down here if we wanted to add more
what we would do we can make this much
smaller could also get rid of this
alright so what we would do we now have
is published equals true so we'll just
go ahead and we'll put in double
ampersand and we'll say where is
published is equal to :
is published
all right and then down here we need to
add it to our named parameters so we'll
say quotes is published equals is
published alright so let's go ahead and
save let's change this back to if we
reload we're gonna still get post too
because that's John's only post and it
is published but let's change this to
Brad and just pretend that this is
coming from a webpage from a forum or
something so we'll save and reload and
we get post one and post three now we
didn't get post what was it
I think four let's see we didn't get
four because is published is set to zero
okay so we have multiple multiple
conditions in our where clause all right
so now let's go ahead and fetch a single
post so well do is just comment this
stuff out by the way to do the the
commenting like that I'm just
highlighting and then doing control
forward slash so we'll go down here and
we'll say fetch single post and it's not
going to be very different than what we
were doing here so what I'll do is just
copy that okay well uncomment this and
we're going to say select all from posts
where and to get rid of this second one
we'll say we're ID is equal to : ID and
again you can use positional parameters
if you want now up here I'm going to add
another variable of ID and we're going
to set that to one okay and then down
here we're going to do our statement
preparer that's gonna be the same and
then with the execute we're just gonna
say ID equals the variable of ID and
we'll get rid of this second one and
then instead of fetch all we're gonna do
just fetch because we're just getting
one record
all right and then we can simply echo
out or do whatever we want with post and
then whatever field we want let's get
the body this time
all right so we'll save that and we'll
reload undefined variable posts that's
because this should be post reload and
we get this is post one okay and you can
put HTML in here if you want for
instance if you wanted to end this and
then you know put an h1 and take this up
to do that and this could be the title
so post one and then if you wanted to
put a paragraph and then take post body
alright and you could do the same thing
up here as well but that's not I mean
that's not very good structure you
should separate your your logic from
your output it's even better to use like
a template engine or something like that
but just to let you know you can do that
alright so I'm just going to go back to
this alright so that's selecting one
item now I'm going to show you how to
get the row count if you ever want to
count the rows of a table say get world
count
all right so get rowcount and we're
going to create our statement and we'll
set that to our PDO and prepare let's
say select all from posts and we'll say
we're author equals author okay then we
just want to do our execute actually
let's use a positional parameter so
we'll just put in our exclamation and
then we can simply say statement execute
and we could just put in an array with
the author okay and that author variable
is still coming from up here and then
all we have to do is create a variable
we'll call it post count and we'll set
it to statement row count like that all
right
and then we'll echo post count and
reload and we get three okay if we were
to change the author to John and reload
we'll get one so that's how we can get a
row count very easy now let's get into
inserting data okay so to insert data
let's go ahead and create some variables
we'll say that this stuff is coming from
a form so the title will say what do we
have for in there let's say post five
and let's say the body this is post five
and then we'll put an author
and for author will say I don't Kevin
okay so let's say that's coming in from
a form so we're gonna want to use
prepared statements to insert this so
let's first create our SQL again you can
use named or positional parameters we're
going to use named so we're going to say
insert into posts and then we want to
put the values which is going to be
title body author and then we want to
say values and that's gonna be coland
title colon body colon author alright
we'll put Us semicolon there and then
we're gonna do our prepare so we'll say
s TM T equals P do prepare and we want
to pass in here the SQL and of course
you could just put this whole string
inside here I just like to put the
string inside SQL and then put the SQL
in there so then we need to execute it
so we'll say s TM t execute so you'll
see it's not much different than doing a
select so inside the execute we need to
put our associative array so we're going
to say title to the variable title body
to body and author
to the variable of author all right so
that's our execute and then let's just
say echo post added and save so let's go
ahead and let's go back to our PDO
example and reload and we get post added
let's look in our database
well reload and there it is post five by
Kevin alright so now let's do an update
so I'm going to just go ahead and
comment this out and let's see actually
know what I'll do is copy that and then
comment it out I'll say update data
paste that and now here I only want to
specify two things one is what I want to
update so let's say we want to update an
ID or not update an ID but the ID of
post one okay so we want to update the
post with the idea of one and we'll
change the body to this is the updated
post all right and we'll go ahead and
get rid of that and then we'll change
this query up here I'm just going to
replace this whole thing so instead of
an insert we're gonna say update posts
and then set let's set the body equal to
: body wear ID is equal to : ID okay
then we're gonna do our prepare and then
inside the execute we're gonna need the
body and we're gonna need to put in the
ID
okay and then we'll say post updated now
I'm not formatting this as an actual
application and you guys probably
figured that out a while ago maybe later
on down the line and we can build an
application with PDO but I'm just going
over just PDO just the basics there's a
lot to what I may make another video
with more advanced stuff but I just want
beginners to to really understand how
this works so let's go ahead and save
that and then we'll go back and reload
we get post updated if we go to our
database and reload you can see post one
now has this is the updated post okay so
that's update now let's do delete so
let's see I'm just gonna copy this and
then comment it out and then we'll do
delete data so for delete I'm just gonna
have the ID that I want to delete let's
say we want to do
let's do post three so we'll say ID
equals three and then we're going to
basically we can say delete from posts
we're ID equals ID and then down here
all we need is the ID and then we'll say
post deleted okay we'll go ahead and
we'll reload post deleted let's check
our database and now there's no more
post three alright so that's how we can
delete data so next thing I want to show
you is how we can search data using the
like operator
so for this let's see what I want to do
let's I'll just type it in so let's
create a variable called search and
let's say that we want to search for the
word post so how the like operator works
is we're gonna put in a percent we're
gonna say it starts with post and ends
so so basically this is gonna look for
the the whole word of post all right and
then we're going to create our statement
so it's uh let's put in our SQL actually
first so we'll say SQL equals and we're
gonna say select all from posts where
and let's search the title so we'll say
we're a title like now let's use
positional parameters so we'll put a
question mark okay you can just as well
use named parameters and then we need to
do our prepare I'll just grab this okay
so there's our prepare now we want to
execute so we'll say st MT execute and
then we're gonna pass in here an array
since we're using positional parameters
it's just gonna we're just gonna put
search okay and then we'll say posts
equals statement fetch all and remember
we set the default to an object so if
you want to pass in a different type you
can but by default it'll be an object so
we can just for each so we'll say for
each posts as post and then we'll say
echo
post title and we'll just concatenate a
line break alright so let's go ahead and
reload we get post one post two now all
of these have the word post in it so
let's change this to let's say five and
save reload and we get post five all
right so let's say let me just so we get
post five one two three four five let's
put in just an F and save and reload and
we get post four and five so this is
this is how searching works so if you
wanted to have a search form to make a
post request to your PHP file and you
wanted to use PDO to use to use the like
operator you can return your search
results all right so I think we're just
about there or one thing I did want to
mention is is with limit if you want to
limit your posts so what I'm gonna do is
just go up here and use our first
example which is this let's see we're
gonna I use my most not working so we're
gonna uncomment this we're gonna select
all the posts all the published posts
from an author and then we're gonna loop
through them and let's change the author
to Brad okay we'll reload oh whoa we
only have one that's published from Brad
all right so let's change this one to
one and all right so now we should have
two that are published from Brad and
let's say we want to limit it to one so
if I were to use actually you know what
let's use the the positional parameters
right here
so we'll say we're author equals that
and is published equals question mark
now like I said this has to be in order
so since author and then is publish you
want to keep that order here okay so
let's save that reload we should get the
same thing now if we want a limit like
we could say limit one and if we wanted
you know not to use a variable for limit
that's fine but let's say we wanted that
to come from some kind of user input
like a like a drop box or something a
select list we'll say limit equals one
and then we'll go ahead and change this
to a question mark and then we'll put
down here limit and save reload and it's
going to not work so the reason for this
is because of emulation okay it's put in
something called emulation mode which is
on by default and it basically has a PDO
substitute placeholder with actual data
instead of sending it separately so when
it does this it's actually doing limit
one one like that so to fix this what we
can do is we can disable the emulation
mode so we'll go up to the top here and
we're gonna add another attribute I'll
just copy this and we're gonna set the
let's see right here so it's going to be
attribute default are not default just
attributes emulate underscore prepares
and we're just going to set that to the
value of false
all right so we'll save that reload and
now the limit works okay so now we can
use prepared statements in it for our
limits or placeholders for our limits
all right guys so I think that that is
going to be it for this video like I
said I may make a more advanced video
later on and I may stymie continue on
with the PHP front to back I'm not sure
if you guys are
interested in me continuing that series
let me know in the comments and you know
if I get enough requests then we'll
continue with that alright thanks for
watching and I will see you next time
hey guys I've just created a new discord
server that's open to the public the
goal is to have a place where people can
go to help each other out for
programming issues as well as just a
place to discuss new ideas and get
feedback I also check in daily there's a
channel to request videos on YouTube and
much more so if you want to check it out
just go to discord GG slash traversing
