we went ahead and got all of our HTML
together our HTML and CSS for our
bootstrap template and now what we're
going to do is take that and create a
wordpress theme from it now what I have
here is just a blank default WordPress
installation I literally just installed
it I haven't changed or added anything
so if you want to get up to speed with
with my environment you just need to get
WordPress installed alright and it's
easy enough to do you should I'm
guessing you know how to do that so just
get that set up and what we're going to
do is I'm going to in my text editor I'm
going to just add that wordpress folder
as a project folder okay so mine I'm
using amps for Windows so my server is
going to be in my C Drive and then amps
and then W W and this is WordPress dev
alright so what I'm going to do is open
up the wp-content folder and then the
themes folder and this is where all of
our wordpress themes go so what we'll do
is create a new folder here and I'm just
going to call this WP bootstrap alright
and there's two files that are
absolutely needed in order for WordPress
to see your theme okay so we're going to
go ahead and create those first one is
going to be an index dot PHP file second
one is going to be a style dot CSS file
alright so we're going to start with the
style CSS this is where we need to put
our theme declaration all right and let
me just show you what I mean hope so
say WordPress style dot CSS alright so
in the documentation if we look at this
right here this is a declaration you can
have things well you need the theme name
I think the theme name is the only thing
that's actually completely required but
you can have all these other things
author the description license you can
have tags all kinds of stuff so what
we're going to do is copy that and paste
that in I'm going to change the theme
name to WP WP bootstrap theme URI I'm
just going to put tech guy Mediacom
authorized the scripts say simple
bootstrap WordPress theme version I'll
keep is 1.0 license GNU that's fine
that's fine I'm going to get rid of the
tags and then text domain will just say
check I media all right and then we'll
get rid of this alright and you don't
need all this you could just have the
theme name and that would be absolutely
fine alright so let's go ahead and save
that and now what we'll do is go to our
WordPress back-end and go to appearance
themes alright so now you can see that
we have WP bootstrap available as a
theme now it doesn't have an image like
these other ones so we can go ahead and
add that all you need is an image that I
believe has to be 1200 by 900 or it
doesn't have to be but that's ideal and
you will have that in the project files
in the github link below in the
description alright so what I'm going to
do is just grab that real quick okay I'm
going to open up my file explorer and go
to my server and we want to go into the
theme folder WP bootstrap and I'm going
to paste in screenshot dot PNG and go
back and reload and now we have a
screenshot alright so let's go ahead and
click
activate now the theme is activated if
we go to the front-end and reload we're
going to get just a blank white page
okay because we have if we have no code
we have nothing for our theme yet okay
so let's start to build that up what
we're going to do is open up the theme
folder and also the HTML folder of the
template that we created in the last
video alright we're going to do a few
things okay so the the J's folder has
the bootstrap JavaScript we can copy
that whole thing and we can bring that
over the CSS has the bootstrap CSS and
our custom style CSS what I'm going to
do is in the theme we're going to create
a CSS folder and we're going to bring
over the bootstrap CSS now I'm not going
to bring over the style dot CSS because
we already have one in the root of the
theme so what I'm going to do is open
that up copy everything that's in there
and then open up our style CSS which is
in the root here and we're just going to
paste that in right here okay and that
will save that okay so with that the
next thing I want to do is open up our
index.html file that we created in the
last video okay and then what I'll do is
copy everything that's in that and bring
it over to our index.php file in the
theme save that okay now if we go back
to our front-end and reload you should
be seeing the HTML that we pasted in the
PHP file now the CSS isn't showing
because we don't have that we don't have
it linked correctly so let's go into our
index.php and go all the way to the top
okay and go to where we have our CSS
files and in order for it to see the
root style CSS where you need to change
this and what we're going to do is just
say PHP blog info
which is a function and then we're going
to pass in stylesheet underscore URL
okay close the PHP tags and then if we
go and reload now that stylesheet is is
in effect now it's just the custom style
the actual bootstrap style sheet isn't
yet so to do that we need to go to where
we have that and we're going to add
right in front right here we're going to
say PHP blog info and then we're going
to pass in template underscore URL
alright and what that's going to do is
it's going to find the location of the
current template and then we're just
going to say slash and keep this CSS
slash bootstrap because we have that
right here alright so let's save that
and reload and now that's in effect okay
so our style sheets are set up now we
have to just take the static template
and start to add dynamic content to it
alright so first thing we're going to
start at the top and work our way down
we have this HTML tag and you can see we
have this Lang attribute well we can
actually make this dynamic by replacing
it with PHP language attributes okay
that's a wordpress function that will
insert that language attribute
dynamically all right next thing we have
the HR set the character set so what we
want to do is put in PHP blog info char
set ok save that now if we go when we
look at the source code you can see that
our Lang is there it's being generated
dynamically same thing with the
character set ok so next thing we have
the viewport we can keep that's fine
description author that stuff that's
optional what we can do here is in the
content we'll say
Blagh info description okay that'll make
it dynamic but if you want you could put
static text in there that would be fine
we're going to get rid of the author and
this icon thing all right now for the
title you don't want to just have some
static text in here we want for one we
want the site name so we can get that
with blog info name okay so if we save
that and we look up here at the title
when I reload we get WordPress website
okay so that's what we have is the name
of the site and you created this
whenever you installed WordPress and you
can change it from within the settings
now I also want in the title the page
name or the page title and we can get
that let's put a pipe character here and
I'm going to say PHP WP underscore title
okay so that gets the current page title
but you'll see if we reload and here
we're on the home page which doesn't
generate a title if we were to go to the
sample page that's included you can see
now it has the title so what I want to
do is test to see if we're on the home
page and if we are then we're going to
put the description in the title so we
can do that let's go ahead and just
separate this a little bit and I'm going
to save PHP I'm going to use something
called is front page okay we're going to
say is front page and if it is then we
want blog info description all right if
it's not then we can put a colon here
then we want the title alright so let's
see what that gives us okay on the home
page we reload and now you can see we
get the description alright so that's
how I take care of the word the title in
a wordpress theme 99% of the time now
we're just about done with this head
section the last thing we want is we
need to put in a wordpress function
called WP head and that's really
important because when you use some kind
of third-party plug-in or widget or
whatever it may be if it has stuff that
needs to go in the head area this is
where it's going to be put all right
even to just give you an example let's
take a look at the source code without
it okay so you can see that in our head
area is just everything that we have in
the theme now if I go and I add that and
we go back and reload you can see that
there's a lot of other stuff that's been
added by other whether it's widgets or
plugins whatever it may be okay so
that's really important now when you do
that you'll also notice that you get
this indent above the theme and that's
because this is where the admin bar is
going to go all right when you're logged
in even in the front-end you have this
admin bar so too for that to be able to
show we're going to go all the way to
the bottom and go right let's go right
below the last footer tag here and we're
going to say PHP WP underscore footer
save that and then if we go back and
reload now you can see we get the admin
bar now the last thing I want to do
before we go is I want to break this the
index file up into a header and a footer
file okay because those should be
separate so what we'll do is from the
very top we're going to go down
we're going to go down to where the the
net this blog masthead where that ends
right here okay so that includes the
head and it also includes the navbar so
we're going to go ahead and cut that and
then we're going to replace it with PHP
get header alright save it and then
we're going to go into our theme folder
and create a new file called header dot
PHP and we're going to paste that in
okay so if we save that we go back and
reload it should look the exact same now
let's go to the very bottom of index and
we're going to go from the very bottom
up to where the footer starts and we're
going to cut that and then replace it
with PHP get footer okay and then we'll
create a file in our theme called footer
dot PHP paste that in save reload and
everything should be good all right and
then in the footer we can make this a
little dynamic what we're going to do is
let's see we have this paragraph let's
replace that okay we'll get that out and
what I want is to we'll do a copy right
and we want the year but we can make
this dynamic instead of just putting the
year we can say PHP echo and we can use
the date function and we can pass in a Y
which will give us the year all right
and then for the site name we can just
say PHP blog info name all right so if
we go and we look at the footer now you
can see we get 2016 WordPress website
all right actually you know what let's
put the actual header in the header file
so if we go to our index page
and so you have this container starts
then we have the blog header so what
we'll do
let's take from this div up cut that and
then we're going to go and include that
in the header as well okay we want to
make sure it's at the very bottom save
it reload okay now we want this to be
dynamic the h1 and the paragraph so what
we'll do is replace this with PHP blog
info name and then this here we're going
to replace with PHP blog info
description okay so now if we go back
and reload now we're getting the system
name and description and we can change
those if we go to the backend and go to
settings you can change those here okay
we'll say WordPress blog say the best
the best website ever save it go back
reload and you can see that that's
changed if we go to the bottom it's also
changed in the footer so in the next
video I'm going to show you how we can
implement a menu so we can have we can
create pages from the backend and we can
create menus and then add add pages to
the menu and then we'll go from there
all right so thanks for watching and
I'll see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
