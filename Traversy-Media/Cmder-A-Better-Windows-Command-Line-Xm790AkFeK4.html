start creating some short videos that
include one or two programming tools
that can help you in your production in
this video we're going to take a look at
and install the commander console for
Windows okay we all know that the CMD
command line for Windows just sucks
PowerShell is a little better but I'd
still prefer something else
PowerShell isn't as customizable as most
of the modern Linux terminals and it's
also really ugly okay there's a few
different alternatives that you can use
I've actually been using git bash for a
while now but I just recently started
using commander and I really like it a
lot you might see it in some of my
Windows based videos so I figured I'd
make a quick video showing you guys it
and maybe if you want you can install it
and work with that
okay we're also going to take a look at
and install the terminal package for the
sublime sublime text editor okay and
then I'm going to show you how to
configure it so that we can just do a
quick keyboard shortcut and it will open
commander right in the project directory
okay which is really valuable to
workflow
all right rather than you know open it
opening up a regular command line and
navigating to that folder and all that
junk all right so that's that's going to
be the goal of these videos is to to
make you guys more productive in your
programming so before we get into it and
install commander let's just take a look
at some of the features now there's a
huge list of features these are only
some of them these are some of the
obvious ones now commander is actually
made up of a few different technologies
it's a fork of Connie mu or Connie mu
which is a console program for Windows
so it's look in its feel it's very
similar to Connie mu so if you've used
that before you should be very
comfortable with commander it also adds
Klink which gives it powerful bass style
command line editing completion and much
more and if you want to look at the
features of each technology I'd suggest
going to the documentation for that
rather than looking at the commander
website because there's honestly not
that much in their documentation they
barely even have any documentation as
far as I can tell
it also implements a git for Windows so
you don't have to install any
third-party get program you can just
just use the git command as you would
you know if you had installed it
separately okay it's also very portable
you can just package it up in a folder
and put it on a USB stick and you can
use it from anywhere on any system all
right
as far as appearance it looks a thousand
times better than the Windows CMD
command line and it looks much better
than PowerShell you have a wide range of
themes you can choose from and it's just
miles ahead of anything else that's
included in default windows ok in
addition to that there's a really
powerful customization option steam
startup tasks keys and macros
integration with other tools like putty
and so on there's also some really
awesome shortcuts and this makes your
life much easier makes you more
productive and we're going to take a
look at some of those in a few minutes
copying and pasting is something that we
do quite a bit in programming and
commander makes it simple with multiple
methods of doing it such as using
control-c and control-v alright the
syntax highlighting is also really great
for things like bash scripts and other
stuff there's a huge range of themes
with all types of colors for color
schemes for highlighting alright and
another great feature is the multiple
tabs consoles ok so you can simply just
say add create new console or whatever
and it'll open up a new tab and this
comes in handy for an example would be
if you're using MongoDB
and you want to run the server you want
to run the database and then you want to
use the shell to you know to enter your
Mongo commands so you would just open up
you know one tab and run the server open
up another one and run your shell ok you
can also create custom tasks and
predefined commands and you can run
those at any time by name or by hotkey
commander also has power
search capabilities with a search box
built right into the interface alright
so these are just some of the features
that commander offers all right guys
we're going to go ahead and get
commanders set up before we do that I
just want to show you a couple websites
here this is the klinke website and
documentation if you want to read over
that Klink is a powerful bash style
command line editing tool okay so it has
different features like code completion
and different shortcuts and so on and
then this is the website for con emu or
con emu and you can see this actually
looks very similar to commander and this
is where you want to look for
documentation on the console so if we go
to documentation you can see there's
quite a bit here all the settings all
the features and so on alright so I just
wanted to show you that and then this is
the terminal package we're going to
install for sublime text and if we
scroll down here you can see we can
actually add commander as our terminal
and then we can just do a simple
shortcut to open that up in the current
directory so if we go to commit CMD er
net and we go down to the download area
you can download the mini version which
is 6 megabytes or the full version with
git and that's 84 megabytes
ok so we're going to use the full
version I actually already have it
downloaded so I'm not going to save it
but you guys should and then go ahead
and open that up so I'm going to go to
see downloads and commander ok we're
going to open up the zip file and this
is the entire application there's no
installer or anything like that you just
want to put this somewhere where you can
access it we're going to put it in the C
Drive C Drive and then in Program Files
with all the other software okay and
then we'll just say new folder and we'll
call this CMD ER and then I'm just going
to drag and drop everything in this zip
file over all right you can see this the
commander executable is right there so
all we have to do is run that
all right so now that we brought that
over we can go ahead and open up
commander so I'm going to run as
administrator and it's opening on a
different monitor because this is this
isn't my main monitor but this popped up
which is telling us that there's a new
stable version so I'm just going to go
ahead and click download all right and
then I got another one that says closed
caii me window and update so i'm going
to click close and update all right let
me just minimize this stuff all right so
it should be all set and this is the
window that opened you can see it opens
it opens in your user directory and this
looks much much nicer in fact let's pull
up the standard windows command line and
if you look at the - this is much nicer
alright and there's not many options
with this we have this one edit where we
can do some copying and pasting and
finding if you look over here there's a
lot of options here and if we look at
the settings there's a ton of stuff okay
so if we want to change the size the
size of the window and position the
appearance background if we go down to
features and then colors from here we
can we can make a custom theme with all
the different colors for foreground and
backgrounds but we can also choose a pre
up predefined scheme I think the default
is this Manik I that's a world viewing
here but if we choose for instance this
base 16 you'll see it has a live update
or a live preview PowerShell which I
don't like what else we going to have
Twilight bun 2 X term so there's a lot
of different themes here to choose from
I'm just going to keep the standard
Manik I all right and see what else we
have here
keyboard shortcuts it looks like I'm
very new to this so there's a lot of
stuff in here that I don't know and if
you guys have any information on this
and some cool stuff to do I'll leave
that in the comments all right we can
customize the status bar
and so on so that's the settings let's
close that up and then let's take a look
at the tabs we'll close that
all right so you can see down here we
have one tab open that's this window and
we can make this bigger with holding
ctrl and then the most wheel but if we
want to have a new tab or a new console
we can just say new console and we can
give it a name if we want but we're just
going to press start okay so you can see
now we have another window open or
another tab open rather okay so that's
very useful let's go to the home page of
commander and we have these different
keyboard shortcuts I think this one's
really cool control all you and you can
traverse up the directory structure so
if we go and let's open this up and
let's say what do we have here we'll say
LS and let's go into I don't know
documents okay now if we want to go back
up the structure we can do control was
it ctrl alt u you'll see it goes back to
users Brad keep going goes up to users
goes up to the C Drive all right so
that's that's pretty cool all right and
let's see what else we have here so ctrl
+ a backticks looks like it'll open it
or summon it from the taskbar so let's
try that so you control and then
backtick oh yeah it goes back down to
the taskbar see when alt P would be
preferences so when all salty quickly
opens the Preferences if we want to
close a tab we can do ctrl W let's try
that so ctrl W closes the tab and if we
want to open a tab we can do ctrl T and
notice that we can also restrict the
current user as well or we can choose
another user and we can say new console
split to the bottom to the right are
layered and we can also open a new
window if we want so let's click tab and
you can also rename these so let's say
rename tab and let's say this was going
to be the Mongo shell or something and
could say mando shell
and save that okay so that's a nice
little feature what else can we do here
we can set priorities for tabs we can
restart or duplicate clothes obviously
and it's the view oh you can change the
the theme for separate tabs as well all
right now let's check out copy and paste
so if I want to just copy some text here
and go over here and I just right click
and it will paste it right in
let's try control ctrl C and control V
okay so we'll do a ctrl C come over here
control V paste it right in so that's
pretty cool all right so we're kind of
running out of time here so what we're
going to do now is install the terminal
package for sublime text and then we're
going to set it to the commander console
so to install packages and sublime text
you have to install package control and
let me just bring that up just to the
people that that don't know this but if
you're using sublime text 3 you just
want to show the console view show
console copy this and paste that in if
you're using sublime text 2 you want to
copy that and paste that in alright or
you can do it manually and you can open
up preferences browse packages and you
can download the package control dot
sublime package and copy it into
installed packages alright so let's go
ahead and go back to the screen here see
installation download package control
where you already have that installed so
I'm going to open up sublime just grab a
new window alright so we're going to
open up we're going to do control shift
T and then we want to go down to package
control install package and we're going
to search for terminals ok it's right
there first one let's click enter and
now that should be installed so if we go
to see preferences package settings
you'll see terminal
now as is by default if we do control I
think it's control shift T no place to
open terminal - oh that's right let's go
ahead and just open up a project folder
here so let's say sandbox and I'll just
open this up alright so now we're in
this directory here and if I do control
shift T it opened on another screen let
me just bring it down by default it's
going to open PowerShell in Windows so I
want to set it to open commander so what
we have to do is go to preferences
package settings terminal and then
settings default and right in here I'm
going to grab it from this page we want
to put this this line okay because
actually I didn't say commander mini
it's in the gist commander so I'm going
to just change that all right so I'll
just change that to commander and for
the parameters we're going to just grab
this right here and put that right in
this array all right so let's go ahead
and save that and then I'm pretty sure
we have to close sublime text so I'm
just going to close that and let me
close my other window as well and then
we'll open it back up let me just grab
it
alright so now if we do control shift
key I did it again we need a project
folder all right control shift T and I
got an error failed to backup con emu
XML to config folder not sure what the
hell that means all right let me try to
put that somewhere else actually so
let's see add it in Program Files let's
cut and put it in program data paste
that in
all right and then I'm going to go back
to here settings and let's change this
to program data and save and now let's
do control shift T there we go so I
guess there's an issue with having it in
Program Files I don't know why because I
could have swore that I put it there
before and it worked but I don't know if
you guys know anything about that
leave it in the comments but now we have
commander setup on Windows and we also
have the terminal package set up to open
commander in the current directory so
this is really nice for workflow instead
of having to go and open a Windows
command line and then navigate to the
current folder and open another one if
you need another one instead of just
opening another tab so and guys and look
the spokesperson for commander or
sublime text so if you think that
something else is better that's fine
share your opinion but please don't be a
dick it seems whenever I introduce a new
tool or a piece of software we get the
angry nerd squad in the comments bashing
it so I don't live and die by any
specific editor or console or operating
system there's pros and cons to
everything and it's all it all comes
down to preference alright so thanks for
watching guys if you're not subscribed
please do so and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
