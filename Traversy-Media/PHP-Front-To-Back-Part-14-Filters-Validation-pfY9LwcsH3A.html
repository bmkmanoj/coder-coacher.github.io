front-to-back video in this video we're
going to take a look at filters and
validation in PHP okay now this is a
last video before we actually do a small
project in the next video we're going to
do a contact form which is very simple
but it's going to include pretty much
all the stuff that we dealt with up to
this point so I think it's a good little
project
now filters are used to validate check
check data types and we can also
sanitize with with filters for instance
if we want an email address to to be
formatted and we don't want any you know
characters that aren't supposed to be in
an email address we can use a filter for
that okay so what I'm going to do here
first is just grab a form in HTML form
and I'm going to paste that in okay we
should probably create the file first
so what's called it filters dot PHP
that's the wrong place cp3 sandbox
alright so let me paste in this form
very simple I don't know if I've showed
you guys this but for the action I'm
using echo el server the server
superglobal and PHP self which is just
going to give us the current page you
could just as well put filters dot PHP
in here but this is a neater way because
even if you change the name of the file
this will still work alright so that's
all that is now the first function that
we're going to look at is filter has box
and what that does is it can check for
posts or get values all right so when we
submit the form instead of saying if is
set you know post data we can use this
filter so
put a comment and say check for posted
data and we're going to put an if
statement or if-else okay and let's put
in here
if filter has devar and we want to put
in input underscore posts for the first
parameter okay now this was method
equals get then you would put input
underscore get and then the second value
is going to be the input field so in
this case we have the name data so
that's what we're going to put here okay
and then let's just say echo so if this
is true this is true we'll just say data
found and if it's not then it will echo
out no data so let's save that and then
we'll go to localhost / PHP and PHP
myadmin HP's sandbox and so they call
this filters dot PHP so we get no data
right away because obviously we haven't
posted that value so it's not finding it
but if we put something in here and
submit see we get data found all right
so it's just a way to test for a certain
poster or get value all right now if I
change this to get and if we go and
reload and submit the form actually so
that the form we get no data because
we're using method yet and it's looking
for post data so if we change this to
get and we enter something and we get
data found okay and we're going to get
data found if that value is in the you
are alright so we're just going to make
that factor post so we can also validate
input data as well with a function
called filter input so what I'm going to
do here is I'm going to copy this
put that here can you get rid of that
and what we're going to do is check for
data okay check to make sure this is
submitted and then we want to validate
it as an email address so for that we're
going to put an if statement in here and
we're going to say if filter underscore
input and we want input on the score of
toast and then the field name which is
data and then we want the validation
which is going to be an email address so
we say filter underscore validate email
and that shouldn't have a quote okay and
then in here let's do echo so if it
validates then we're going to say email
is valid and then we'll do an else and
we'll echo and now is not valid so let's
say actually let's comment this out up
here and we'll save that and let's just
refresh this completely and submit just
anything and we get email is not valid
if we submit test at test comm we get
email is valid so this is a much easier
and cleaner way that are checking for an
email than using something like a some
crazy regular expression now in addition
to these these validates and there's a
lot of these I'll paste them in in a few
minutes but we can also sanitize data so
if we want an email address and we want
to remove any characters in it that
don't belong in an email address we can
do that so what I'll do is keep this and
then
Zig we're going to take the value that
in post data and put it into a variable
called email alright so we'll say post
and data if you haven't watched the the
I think it was part and a much sure what
pot it was but the one will we talk
about getting post if you haven't
watched that cat I suggest doing that
alright so putting it in this value
called email or this variable called
email and then we want to remove illegal
characters so we can do that with
filters sanitize email and we use a
function called filter var for that so
it's the email equals filter bar and in
here we're going to pass in that email
value and then we want to put in our
filter underscore sanitize spell that
sanitize underscore our email and that
will actually strip out any characters
that don't belong there just to show you
I'm going to echo out email okay we'll
do that and we'll also concatenate a
line break okay so when we submit this
it should print out the clean version of
the email and then it'll also tell us if
it's valid or not so let's just refresh
this and let's put in C we'll do a test
put in a couple slashes a couple you
know less than greater than what else
we'll put some parentheses and then we
put an @ symbol and then we'll do test a
couple other back slashes forward
slashes com okay so that's a mess right
there but if I submit it you'll see that
it goes out test a test com it stripped
out all the stuff that shouldn't be
there now notice that it says email is
not valid the reason for that is that
when we ran this right here it took the
value that we submitted what
was the one with all the flashes and the
weird stuff so that doesn't pass this so
in this situation we wouldn't use this
what we would do is we'd use filter var
with filter validate email with this
right here so let's change this to
filter var and then we're going to just
change we're going to get rid of both of
these and replace it with the email
variable which is the you know the clean
value that we sanitized so then let's
save that and reload and now we get
email is valid okay we weren't testing
the the post value directly we cleaned
you know we cleaned it you sanitized it
and then we tested for it now what I'm
going to do is paste in all the
different validations we can do so we
can touch for boolean email flow
integers and IP address a regular
expression and a URL and then for the
sanitize space those done as well we
have email and coded floats integers
special characters strings and URLs okay
so we can basically strip out tags so
that the value is it will pass these
each of these typed okay hopefully that
makes sense I'm going to comment the
rest of the so let's do an integer
validation so we'll have a variable and
I'll set it to 23 and then let's run it
through an if and we'll say if filter
underscore var and then we'll pass in
var and then our validation which will
be filter
validate int and then we'll echo the
echo var is a number L bar is not a
number
okay so 23 is a number now even if we
wrap quotes around this and reload we're
going to get 23 as a number okay good
toy letters in here like this reload we
get that is not a number okay and you
can do this with any of the any of these
validations right here okay so you can
touch for those and it's just a much
easier way than using something like
regular expressions now let me give you
an example for sanitizing sanitizing an
integer or number so what we can do is
set number equals and let's put a bunch
of numbers and letters mixed okay and
that should actually be in quotes and
then what we'll do is we'll do a var
dump which we used before and we're
going to pass in here filter underscore
var and it's a PIN number actually let's
not call this number let's call it bar
and we're going to put filter underscore
sanitized number int alright so let's
run that we'll save it reload and now
you'll see that all of the all of the
letters have been stripped out okay it
sanitized it into an integer alright so
this one here special chars is also very
helpful that'll prevent people from for
instance inserting script tags into a
form that that out put something on the
page so let me give you an example of
that if we were to set this to script
and in here let's just say alert one
something like that and we were to echo
that out
save that reload and that actually runs
the script and if we look in the source
you'll see it right here ok well we can
use the echo filter bar and let's pass
in bar and then we'll add the filter
sanitized target special characters so
let's see what happens when we do that
I'm still echoing out the gist the box
when I comment that up and then if we
reload you'll see that it's not going to
fire it off it's just going to output it
on the screen and if we were to look at
the source code it just turns them into
harmless entities okay so that's a
really handy filter okay so now what I'm
going to show you is filter var array
and filter input array now just filter
var and filter input is great if you're
dealing with one field but usually
you'll have a bunch of different fields
so it's got another one here and we'll
just call this one data two and what we
can do is create an array let's call it
filters
and I'll set this to array and let's go
in here and let's say data set that to
filter validate email okay and we put a
comma and then let's say data to let's
say data to we want it to be an int but
I also want to add some options so we're
actually going to set it to an array
like that and in here we can specify the
filter we want which is going to be
filter validate int r number int I know
that's sanitized we watch validate int
alright and we can actually add some
options with it so for options that's
also going to be an array and we can set
a minimum so let's say min on the score
range actually needs to be can quotes so
min range and I took that to one and
then we'll set a max range Ranger I'll
so the max range of say 100 okay so now
we have this array and it specifies the
validations we want for each field and
also some options so what we're going to
do with this is do a print our and here
let's do the filter underscore input
I'm sorry filter input array and in here
we're going to pass in input underscore
post and then we're going to apply
filters okay
now when we submit this if data isn't a
valid email address it's not going to
it's not going to get through all right
same thing with data too if it's not a
number that's between 1 and 100
get through so let's go ahead and try
this out we'll save it and just refresh
this so we have two inputs and let's see
what happens if we put just anything in
here but that's not an email address and
then something in here that's not in
between 1 and 100 if we submit it
notice that data won't data and data to
are now they're empty ok it didn't get
through if we were to put test at test
comm and we were to put something that
is in the range of 1 and a hundred and
submit now they go through ok so these
are this is really good for working with
multiple fields when you're working with
arrays now we also have filter var array
okay in addition to input array so let's
comment this out so what I'm going to do
here is create an array just call it AR
and set it to array and let's say we
have a name and I'm just going to set
this to my name but I'm going to use all
lowercase and I'll show you why in a
second look and say gauge we'll set that
to 35 and then email we'll set that to
say plus throw that at gmail.com all
right so we have this array and now
we're going to create again we're going
to create a filters array and then we
want to take each of these fields and we
want to apply the the filters that we
want so let's say name and what's at
that now we could just put a filter
right here but I'm going to actually
make it an array because we're going to
have some other stuff with it all right
so this will be let's see all right and
what I'm going to apply is a filter and
we're going to set this to filter
underscore callback and then this allows
us to actually apply a function to to
this value so I put it in all lowercase
because I'm going to use you see words
which will make every word make the
first letter capitalized so to do that
we can say options and set that to a
function and we're going to call it you
see or knock or call it we're going to
use the you see where it's function you
could use your own custom function as
well okay so that's for the name now for
the H for age we're going to also set
that to an array and see what we're
going to do here we're going to set the
filter and let's set that to filter
underscore validate underscore int okay
so it has to be an integer it has to be
a number and then we have options and
we'll set that to an array because we
want to set a min and a max value so
it's a min range okay just like we did
up up with the input array and we'll set
that to 1 and say max range and we'll
flip that to 120 okay so that takes care
of age validation now we have the email
and all I want to apply here is the
email filter so we'll just say filter
underscore validate email and that's it
alright so now we're going to do the
same thing we did up top up above we're
going to do a print R and then here
we're going to select the size filter
bar array
and then we'll pass in puffin our array
which is ARR and then filters
okay so we'll save that and now if we go
and refresh this you'll see that
everything is there because everything
is validated now if I were to change age
to let's say 130 and reload you'll see
that age is not there it's not being
accepted all right and if this wasn't a
valid email address let's say we have
two dots here and we reload that's not
being accepted okay and you can also see
that the name has an uppercase letter
for each word because we applied the you
see words callback alright so I think
that's good enough I mean there's a
little there's a lot more to this but
this is already getting too long for
just this one subject but there's a lot
to it so it definitely suggests that you
go to php.net and take a look at all the
validation examples and the sanitized
examples because there's a lot to it and
it's really helpful when it comes to
validation all right guys so that's
going to be it in the next video we're
going to actually start do a little
project we're going to do a contact form
and I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
