ahead and talked about what Adonis is we
looked at the folder structure set up
set it up with the CL I created a home
page route and view and now what we're
gonna do is we're gonna create a
controller for our posts ok Adonis is an
MVC framework so we want to create that
Model View controller structure so let's
go ahead and generate a controller with
Adonis make : controller and we're gonna
say posts ok now generally you want your
put your controllers to be plural and
your models to be singular now it's
going to ask for if we want this to be
an HTTP type controller or a WebSocket
we're going to use HTTP and now if we
look in our let's see app folder
controllers HTTP we have a post
controller j/s file alright so this is
where we're going to create all of our
controller methods so let's create our
first one which is going to be index now
before all of our methods names we're
gonna say async and the reason for that
is because Adonis j/s 4.0 4.0 utilizes
es7 async await feature which is a
cleaner way to handle asynchronous
operations than callbacks or promises
and I'm not going to get deep into that
that's a whole nother tutorial and it
can get kind of complicated so we just
add async before the function name and
then we add a weight before things like
fetching data from the database so let's
call this index and let's just go ahead
and return a string called posts all
right that's all we'll do for now let's
save and now what we want to do is
create a route to map to this this
method here so we'll go to our routes
file and actually let's go above all
this test stuff and let's say route get
and by the way notice that I'm not using
um try I did there but I'm trying not to
use semicolons because the the
convention for the cord honest code is
not to use semicolons and I'm trying to
stick to that
okay which is very hard because I always
use semicolons now it's up to you what
you want to do I just want to keep it
all consistent so I'm going to try not
to use them so in the get here we want
it we want a route to go to posts and
then we want to map that to posts
I'm sorry post controller dot index so
we'll save that and then we'll go to
slash posts and we get our string posts
okay so it's now calling this method
here now obviously we're not going to
want to just output a string here we're
gonna want a load of view so let's
create a view for the post index so
we'll go down here and we'll say add
honest make view now when you use a
resource like posts and you know you're
gonna have a bunch of views for that
resource you probably want to create a
separate folder for that resource so
we're gonna say post slash index and
what that does is it creates inside the
views folder a folder called posts and
then the index file so in the index file
let's just say actually we'll just put
an h1 here and we'll say posts okay and
then we'll go to our controller and we
want to render a view now when we if we
want to render a view we actually need
to pass in here some curly braces and
pass in view and then we want to say
return view dot render and then whatever
the view is we want to render which in
this case is gonna be post dot index if
it's inside of a folder you want to use
this dot syntax like that okay and we'll
save reload and now we get our rendered
view alright now just like with most MVC
type frameworks you can pass data into a
view so we can put an extra parameter
which will be an object and let's say we
want to put a title and we'll say latest
posts and then we can go into our index
view and right here I'm just going to
put in our double curly braces and say
title
and save reload and we get latest posts
all right so it works just like most
other frameworks like I said this really
reminds me of laravel if you've ever
worked with laravel before I know it's a
different language but the syntax the
just the way that things are set up it's
very similar now what if we want to pass
in an array and loop through it which
ultimately is what we're going to do
it's going to come from the database but
we don't have the database set up yet so
let's just put some hard-coded data in
here so we'll say Const posts we'll set
it to an array and it'll have a title
and body okay so we'll go ahead and just
copy this put in a couple more this will
be post two
three and then we'll just go down here
and we'll say posts and pass in posts so
it's save that now we'll go into our
index view and now to loop through this
using edge is very very easy we just
need to say at each and then we're gonna
say post in posts okay then we need to
end it by saying and each all right and
then here you know what let's wrap this
in a UL so that each one is inside of a
list item so we'll go like that we'll
put our list item here and we'll just to
post dot title and save let's reload and
now you can see that it's going to show
those posts on the screen it's going to
loop through and put each one inside of
a list item
alright so ultimately this stuff this
stuff is going to come from our MySQL
database but before we get into that I
just want to talk a little bit about
templating and layouts now in our
template here we don't have a head and
body tag we don't have a title or
anything like that
same thing with the home page now we
could put it inside the view here but
then we'd have to add it to every single
view and we don't want to do that so
we're gonna create a main layout for all
of our views to get put inside of okay
so let's generate a new view I'm gonna
go down here and say Adonis make view
and we're gonna call this main okay and
then we'll go into main dot edge and put
in our HTML tags I'm going to use Emmet
so I can do exclamation tab and that
will give us just a basic structure here
for the title I'm just gonna say adonis
4.0 blog and what i want to do is
include bootstrap okay we're gonna use
bootstrap for now as you saw in the
Welcome page we can use this syntax here
to include style sheets now
this is a local stylesheet but we can
also use it for remote files so what I'm
gonna do is go to get bootstrap comm get
started and I'm gonna grab just the href
part of this CDN so just the file and
then we'll go back to main put in our
curly braces here and say CSS and then
just pass in that link alright now we
can do the same thing with JavaScript so
for these three links here let's grab
the source
okay we need jQuery it's a dependency
for bootstrap and then we're just going
to do instead of CSS we're gonna say
script and then we'll pass that in
alright we want to do the same thing for
popper J s which is another dependency
so we want this link here base that in
and we also want of course bootstrap CSS
I mean I'm sorry bootstrap J s and we'll
put that in there all right now wherever
we want to output the main or not the
main but the views whatever that
whatever the the page view is we're
gonna go ahead and say at exclamation
section and then pass in the string
content all right and I actually want to
wrap it in the container so that
everything's pushed into the middle it's
just part of bootstrap you guys know
that sure all right so that's our layout
so let's save that and go back to our
posts reload now one thing I forgot to
do is extend this layout okay it doesn't
it's not going to use it by default so
let's go to our index page and up here
we're gonna say at layout and say we
want to use the main layout and you can
have multiple layouts now we also have
to wrap this in
section content like that and then at
the end say n section all right we'll
just tab this over save and now if we
reload now you can see the bootstrap is
kicked in and it has the head it has the
title up here so it's using the layout
now we want to do the same thing in the
home page so I'm going to copy these two
lines go to our home
paste that in and let's not forget to
end the section all right so now if we
go to our home page you can see that's
also using the layout alright so before
we move on to the database and all that
I want to have a nav bar so we can
navigate between these pages so in edge
we can use partials or includes so what
I'm going to do is in the views folder
actually I can generate it down here
with Adonis make view and let's say Inc
okay cuz I want to create an Inc folder
and then slash navbar so now we have
this Inc nav bar dot edge file and then
we're gonna put our nav bar in here
now I'm gonna paste this in because it's
just HTML it's just bootstrap nothing
special I'll go over it real quick so we
have a nav tag a couple of bootstrap
classes we're using BG primary which
will give it a blue background mb3 is
margin bottom three it's just gonna push
stuff down we have a container to push
everything into the middle we have the
branding we have the but the hamburger
button for responsive for mobile sites
or mobile layouts and then we just have
the home link which goes to slash and
posts which goes to slash post so let's
save that now it's not going to show up
yet because we have to include it in our
layout so let's go back to main dot edge
and let's go right above the container
and say @include
Inc / navbar and reload and now we have
our navbar so you have the little drop
down go to posts so now we can navigate
between posts and home one thing I want
to do is remove the active class in the
navbar that's on the home so I'm just
going to get rid of that all right there
we go
so now we have our navbar we have our
two pages or two routes all right so I
think this is a good place to stop in
the next video we're going to we're
gonna first of all install the MySQL
module and then we're going to edit our
dot env file we're gonna create a
database and then we're gonna create our
migrations and then the model all right
so we're going to get into that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
