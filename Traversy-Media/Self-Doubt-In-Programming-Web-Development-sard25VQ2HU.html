video we're gonna talk about something a
little more personal than we usually do
and I've made a few of these types of
videos and they seem to really help
people out and I think that they help
people out because of a lot of us
programmers or developers or web
designers we all struggle with many of
the same things many of the same issues
and I think one of those things is
self-doubt and our self esteem self
confidence whatever you want to call it
I think just about all of us experienced
this at one point or another you know
some more than others
now I know that many of you think to
yourself you know should I even be doing
this am I supposed to be a programmer am
i fraud am i smart enough well many look
at me as a successful program or just a
successful person in general at least
going by some of the comments and
interacting with you guys and you know
stuff like that but I want to go through
just some facts about myself so that you
can see that some of these things that
you may look at as reasons why you
shouldn't be in this field or you don't
deserve to be in this field our absolute
garbage alright so the first thing I
didn't start programming until I was in
my mid to late 20s I'm 36 now and
there's a common misconception that in
order to be a really great programmer
you have to add start when you were
really young so you know people picture
this boy genius that wrote an amazing
program when he was 10 that's just
garbage it's not true in the slightest
you can start programming when you're
you know 40 50 60 years old it doesn't
matter if it's something that you're
really interested in and you have a
passion for there's no age limit to get
started all right also I didn't grow up
as I guess what would what we'd call a
nerd you know back in high school or
hang out with nerds and please don't
take that as a derogatory term I now
consider myself a nerd actually and I'm
pretty proud of it someone that loves
technology and programming and has a
strong passion for it things that you
know the cool kids wouldn't particularly
like so don't you don't take that
they're in the wrong
way now it wasn't always like that when
I was younger when I was a teenager and
a young adult I got into a lot of
trouble I hung out with the wrong types
of people and I got into drugs and
alcohol and I had a big problem with
opiates for years actually
so this consumed my life as a teenager
and as a young adult okay I'm not gonna
go into any more specifics than that
about what I used or anything like that
because I'm not gonna you know I've
already said enough to invite some
trolls so just know up until I was about
25 I struggled a lot in life okay also
financially so I also didn't get a high
school diploma I got a GED and the
reason I didn't get a high school
diploma is because I was actually
expelled from high school I did end up
taking some courses in a community
college but I didn't graduate all right
so as far as formal education goes I
have absolutely none I mean no I
shouldn't say none I do I did take some
Community College courses but I learned
I learned absolutely nothing in those
courses alright so I also struggled with
depression and anxiety and a lot of you
guys know that that have been following
me for a while I've mentioned it you
know social anxiety generalized anxiety
I've dealt with for pretty much my whole
life alright so what I want you guys to
do is look at this list of traits and
ask yourself if you would think that
this person would become a successful
program or successful anything for that
matter so the whole point to all of this
is to show you that you know what I
personally overcome and if I can do it
and I know this for a fact that if I can
do it anyone can do it and as corny as
that sounds doesn't make it any less
true
alright so many of you may feel like you
don't fit in so if you were to go work
at a company with other programmers you
would feel like you don't belong there
or you're not as smart as them and the
reason that I know that is because
that's exactly how I feel alright even
just looks alone I'm covered in tattoos
I like the power lifts so I'm very bulky
I have a thick Boston accident which I
often try to hide when I do these videos
just not your typical program or what
you would think a program
would look and sound like and act like
but that's the thing maybe back in the
80s you know all the programmers were
geeky geniuses that never had a
girlfriend but that's not the case
anymore so if you feel like you look
different from other people don't worry
about that you know walk in show them
you know your and your physical
appearance means nothing
all right you also don't need to be some
kind of genius with some crazy IQ if you
study hard enough almost anyone can do
this okay you just need to have the
passion for it you need to be interested
in it and one misconception end is is
that you need to be great at math and
honestly I suck at math I have problems
helping my ten-year-old daughter
sometimes with their homework which part
of it I blame on Common Core but I just
don't get me started on Common Core but
unless you're doing you know complex
algorithms are working with low-level
languages and CPU calculations stuff
like that all you really need to know is
basic arithmetic algebra maybe some
fractions things like that all right so
some of you may have seen one of my
videos I did a while ago talking about
imposter syndrome which is very
interesting it's it's basically when you
know in your field you feel kind of like
a fraud like you don't really belong
there you know you feel like you're
different from everyone else everyone
else is smarter and I think this is
really common in the world of technology
because one there's just so many
different things to learn and another
because it's just changing so rapidly so
it's impossible for us to grasp
everything so sometimes we may feel like
you know we should know everything but
in reality it's impossible all right I
feel like myself something you know I
feel like this myself sometimes and I've
said this before technology is also
filled with people that love to prove
others wrong all right now I'm gonna get
a little therapeutic here but I think
that the reason for that is because
these guys or girls they have you know a
lot of self-doubt inside and they feel
like if they can examine someone's code
for errors or something that's not
perfect and then they can rub it in the
person's face it helps them feel better
about themselves and helps them feel
smarter so on the surface they might
seem like they're being cocky and like a
know-it-all but inside they're really
feeling like they're not as smart as
they should be so they need a way for
people to think that they're smarter all
right I know that's really getting into
you know the Self Help territory but I
think it's it's something that you know
isn't talked about enough or really
isn't talked about at all in this field
all right and I see this on you know on
my channel I get comments and on my
videos all the time people pointing
stupid little things out that really
don't matter but it makes them feel
better and that's fine as long as
they're not dicks about it I'll just
thank them for pointing it out but
anyway just just know that a lot of us
feel like you know like we're not good
enough at some point or another so it's
not just you and if you're someone that
never thinks that you know never feels
this way and always thinks you're right
and always thinks that you know you'll
know the answer to everything then I
don't know I don't really have much in
common with you anyway so if we probably
shouldn't even be watching this all
right so education now when I talk about
education here I'm not speaking at the
level of getting jobs or positions what
companies are looking for or anything
like that all right what I'm talking
about is what you need to become a great
programmer so the whole job thing that's
another video but if you can turn
yourself into the best programmer or
developer you can be employers will see
that even without a degree okay I
guarantee it I get job offers daily and
I turn them down because I love what I
do but I have no degree you know I found
other ways to show what I can do even
just starting a YouTube channel is one
of the many things that you can do aside
from just getting a college degree now
getting a you know like a computer
science degree is great to have it's a
great accomplishment and those of you
with them I don't want to take anything
away from you you know that's that's
something that's really great and you
should be proud of but in my honest
opinion you can learn more on your own
targeting what you want to learn and
what's best for you rather than
following some curriculum that thousands
of other people follow like sheep
all right most of it being older
technology anyway now I really don't
want to steer people away from college
and traditional education I'm just
sharing my own experience and my point
of view so please remember that also
keep in mind that I've never gone to
like you know an Ivy League school or
anything like that
I went to Community College that's my
experience with with college and it was
just crap I learned nothing okay nothing
that I did I teach you guys in this
channel or my courses I learned from
college it's all self-taught all right
now boot camps I think are great I've
never gone to one but I've done a
significant amount of research on them I
think they're great I even have a couple
boot camps that sponsor me I wouldn't
take sponsors if I didn't believe in
them but they're not needed if you ask
me what's needed or what what helped me
it's basically three things passion
being the most important time and an
internet connection which has all of the
resources that you need to learn pretty
much anything that you want to learn
maybe a book here and there but
documentation blog posts you know
tutorials online courses these are all
things that helped me learn everything
that I know and I realize everyone's
different you know College may be a
better choice for someone else I'm just
giving you my opinion my experience
all right so passion now passion is
something you hear me talk about a lot
in these whatever self-help type videos
because it's needed it's needed in any
field you're in if you go to work every
day and you're constantly looking at the
clock complaining about time dragging
then you're never gonna get higher in
your career or in your life and I
remember having jobs like this you know
when I was younger when I would work in
like a machine shop or for a moving
company mostly labor type jobs just
looking at that clock waiting for you
know 3 o'clock to come and now I do what
I love and the time just flies by
alright so you should wake up excited
every day to learn something or to write
a new piece of code now that may be
taking it to the extreme that's not a
necessity
to be successful I'm not saying you have
to just wake up Andrew start writing
code but that what I like to do is wake
up around 5:00 a.m. and come down and
read some blog posts or watch some some
videos from other channels or whatever
it may be look at documentation to
figure out what what video I'm gonna do
next things like that I enjoy waking up
having my coffee and just doing
something to do with programming so you
should also feel accomplished in
anything that you build even if it's
just you know following following with
one of my tutorials you know you learn
something you put something together and
that should give you a sense of
accomplishment now if you hate learning
then I'm sorry to say you're in the
wrong profession
I actually saw a comment on a YouTube
video recently I think it was engineered
truths channel and it said who the hell
who the hell wants to go to work every
day and have to learn so that comment
just just baffled me because it was a
you know it was a programming based
video and I replied and I just told the
guy you know that you're in the wrong
profession if that's how you feel
developers have to constantly learn
daily things are rapidly evolving
nothing is stagnant in software
development new versions are released
constantly with new syntax to learn new
frameworks languages everything is
changing okay I know there's there's
very few people watching this that do
not like to learn you wouldn't be here
if you didn't you also wouldn't be here
if you had no passion
so people that that don't really care
for this stuff and don't have passion
for technology or programming don't
watch travesty media or Kris Hawks or
dev tips or the new Boston or any of
those channels they watch you know Jake
Paul or PewDiePie or something like that
and it's sad that they have so many more
subscribers than our channels do you
know educational type channels but
that's just the state of the world today
so anyway burning out is is is a serious
thing in programming you know when you
feel like you're starting to lose that
passion and then this happens to all of
us
when you're looking at if statements and
loops all day and you keep getting stuck
it can really get to you and make you
want to smash your monitor in half now
this will always happen once in a while
coding is just frustrating but if you
find it happening daily and you're not
excited anymore you know as you used to
be and you're just not into it then take
a break you know relax your mind for a
bit I don't I wouldn't suggest making it
too long maybe one week two weeks at the
most and just watch TV for two you know
just watch T don't watch TV for just two
weeks if you can go on some kind of
vacation
you know I know that's not feasible for
a lot of us but if not then you know go
go outside go to a park play with your
kids if you have kids and then once you
come back change things up a little bit
you know if you've been working with
JavaScript for years take a look at
Python or Rails or something another
thing you can do is be around other
people with passions so things like
meetups hackathons conferences these
things can help bring you back into that
zone and bring back that passion that
you feel like you lost all right so
that's gonna be it for now guys hope I
hope this helps some of you in one way
or another and please realize when I
talk about myself I do it because I
honestly feel like if I can get to where
I am today then anyone could it's not
from a narcissistic point of view or
anything if you notice most stuff I say
about myself is bad but I am proud of
where I came from and anyone that you
could talk to that grew up with me would
tell you the same thing even my own
mother so people can completely turn
around their lives and become anything
they want
so don't doubt yourself in any way if
you do get into a slump you know pick
yourself back up because if you don't
you're gonna move on from programming to
something else that you don't really
love and you're gonna miss out on a
career that you could have been very
happy with made a lot of money with and
felt really accomplished with so that's
it guys sorry if this was a little too
self helpy but feel free to follow me on
