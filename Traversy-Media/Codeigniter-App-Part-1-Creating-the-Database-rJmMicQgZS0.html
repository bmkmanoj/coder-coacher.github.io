application using code igniter which is
a PHP open-source framework and it's an
MVC framework Model View controller so
we'll have a controller which will be
controlled by the route or by the URL
and it'll use the model to grab data
from the database MySQL database and
then the views will display our
application all right so it's it's
pretty full-featured we're going to have
a login system registration and then
obviously I to do categories and our
lists all right so let's go ahead and
login here just so you can see the whole
app alright so we just have basically a
landing page where we can create new
lists on the fly
all right so I don't know why that
button just said login but anyway here
is a list
all right so we added a list which we
can see right here if we click on that
it will show us the description any open
tasks we have and tests that we have
recently completed and then over here we
can have add tasks edit lists delete
list so if we want to add a task I'll
say my tasks and we can choose a due
date say the 30th all right so now we
have our tasks here so it's a pretty
nice a sample application I guess for a
beginner you can see the list we have
here and we have our latest tasks down
here and we can view them all right so
if we if we view the new list which we
just created and we delete that it's
also going to delete it's also going to
delete the tasks associated with it so
let's get started so the first thing we
want to do is we need to set up a
database and I'm using xampp for windows
which is basically an apache server on a
local machine comes with PHP MySQL comes
with the PHP myadmin
tool so that's what we're going to use
to create the database if you don't have
xampp I do have a video on how to
install it I mean it's pretty easy you
just want to go to Apache friends org
and download it ok so let's log in here
I have quite a few databases over here
including the my to do database so I'm
going to create a new database and I'm
just going to call it new to do all
right so let's click on that and we want
to create some tables
the first thing we'll create is a users
table this will have what is it seven
fields alright so we want to give an ID
which will be an integer 11 for the
length and we want this to be the
primary key and we want it to auto
increment all right next we want a
first-name and I'll do I'll do the types
and stuff after so last name email
address user name
password in the password is going to
eventually be encrypted we're going to
use md5 encryption for that instead of
storing a plaintext password and we're
going to have a registered date alright
so this is going to be vodka 255 we'll
just set all these to 255 email username
password registered date is going to be
a timestamp and we're going to select
for default we're going to select
current timestamp which will be whatever
time it is when the data is inserted
alright so that looks good for the users
table let's save that and the next thing
we want to create is a tasks table and
one second let me just figure out what
we're going to have here actually let's
create the list table first
all right so let's see this is going to
have five columns and we're going to
have an ID of course and we're going to
set that to primary
and auto-increment all right the next
we're going to have is going to be a
list name we're going to have the list
body a user ID list user ID which will
relate to the users table and then we're
going to have a create date okay so
let's see our car
actually this body is going to be text
this is going to be int say 11
createdate is going to be a timestamp
and it's going to have a default of the
current timestamp all right so that
looks good save that and we got one more
table which of course it's tasks and
this is going to have seven fields seven
columns
so ID
and we're going to have a task name
um tasks body pretty much the same
fields of the list and this is going to
have a list ID which will relate to the
list table due date createdate and we're
going to have a boolean for is completed
all right so is complete
okay our car - names house body will be
text list ID will be int due date will
be date create date will be a timestamp
and we'll set that default to current
timestamp is complete is going to be a
tiny int which will have one because
it's going to be there a 1 or 0 and we
want the default to be as defined and we
want it to be 0 so what that means is
that when we enter a task it's going to
automatically be set to 0 for Inc is
complete because obviously if we just
created it it's not complete alright so
that looks good alright so that's all we
need for our database in the next video
we will download and install code
ignitor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
