I'm going to show you how to create some
animated font awesome icons using
JavaScript now if you don't know what
font awesome is you should definitely
check it out it's a huge iconic library
or toolkit where you can add literally
hundreds or maybe even thousands just a
lot of different icons using just CSS
classes alright all you have to do is
import the font awesome style sheet and
you can do that remotely through a CDN
but what we're going to be doing is
we're going I'm going to show you how to
apply icons to an element through
JavaScript and then we're going to set a
time out so that we can make it so that
every whatever two seconds we can
actually switch out the icon and we can
give it an animation effect all right
which is something that I actually just
learned how to do and I think is really
cool so I figured I'd share with you
guys alright and it's not as advanced
it's very easy to do there's not too
much JavaScript we're going to need to
do so that's what we'll be doing in this
video hopefully you enjoy it and let's
get started alright guys so I have a
blank folder or another blank folder I
have a folder called
annum icons and a blank index.html file
inside of that that's where we're going
to be creating our project this is the
only file we're going to need I'm also
using the atom text editor and I'm using
a plug-in called atom live server that
allows us to just open this folder on
our localhost and of course you don't
need this you can just open up
index.html right on your filesystem so
I'm also using a plug-in called Emmet
which will allow me to use HTML
shortcuts for instance if I put an
exclamation and then hit tab it's going
to give us a basic HTML 5 layout alright
now first thing we're going to do here
is we're going to need to import font
awesome now you can download the files
and include it in your file structure if
you want but I'm just going to use a CDN
so I'm going to search for font awesome
CDN and we're going to grab this first
result here and this is from bootstrap
CDN calm slash font awesome
we're just going to grab this link and
go to our HTML head area
and put in a link tag and just paste
that in the href attribute okay so now
we have font awesome linked for the
title I'm just going to say animated
icons alright so there we go let's
reload and you can see in the title it
says animated icon so this is now
showing in the browser now what I'm
going to do first is just show you how
to simply add an icon and most you guys
probably know this but we can have an
element such as a div and we can give it
a class of FA okay now I was able to do
dot FA tab and in what it did was Emmet
this is the plug-in I'm using gave me a
div with the class of FA okay so you'll
have to install Emmet if you want to use
shortcuts like that otherwise just type
this out now what we need to do that by
itself isn't going to do anything you'll
see it's still blank we need to apply a
class for a certain icon if we go to the
font awesome website and we go to icons
it gives you all the different icons and
let's say you like what's the one I want
chain right here so if we click on this
icon it'll show us the class that we
need to use which is FA link so let's go
ahead and add in a class called FA link
and we'll save that and you can see we
get the chain icon or the link icon now
I want to make these bigger so you guys
can see them better so what I'm going to
do is just add a style up here alright
and I'm actually going to give all these
kids that I that I put in here an ID
let's call this chain alright and then
we're just going to say ID chain and
we'll set the font size to let's do 50
pixels alright now what I want to do is
I want to make an animation of this
chain breaking and we can do that
because we have this FA link here which
is the regular chain and then we also
have 4 is it we also have the chain
broken icon so what I want to do is set
an interval through JavaScript that's
going to make it so that every two
seconds the chain breaks
goes back breaks goes back and so on I'm
going to do a couple different
animations with a couple different icons
but this is the first one we're going to
do all right now we're going to
initially take away the f8 link okay
just want to have a div with with the ID
and then a class of just FA okay for fun
awesome and then we're going to create a
JavaScript function so let's go down
here and put in some script tags and
we're going to create a function called
let's call it break chain alright and
first thing we need to do is target this
div so let's create a variable I'll call
it chain and we're going to set it to
document dot get element by ID has an ID
of chain all right and then we're going
to take that chain variable and we're
going to just do dot inner HTML okay now
what this is going to allow us to do is
we can apply the icon class through
through this chain enter HTML and if we
look over here at the icon let's go back
to the regular chain it has where is it
right here this Unicode this Unicode
which is F 0 c1 every icon has this
Unicode and it's going to be unique to
each icon so what we want to do is just
set this inner HTML to we first want to
put an ampersand and then a number sign
and then an X and then we want to put
that Unicode which is f 0 c1 ok so we
want to set it to that I also want to
put our semicolon like that so that's
going to set it to that so let's save
and reload and it's not going to do
anything because we didn't actually run
the function so let's run break chain ok
it's not going to actually break or
anything yet but at least we have it on
the screen we have the initial icon now
what we want to do is we want to set a
timeout and we want to say after 1
again we want to change the icon to the
broken chain so let's go back to chain
broken and notice the Unicode is
different it's f12 7 ok so let's do a
set timeout with JavaScript so set
timeout and what that's going to take in
is going to take callback function or a
self calling function and we're going to
take that chain variable and we're going
to say inner HTML and then we're going
to set it to ampersand number sign X and
then what is it f12 7 and put the
semicolon in okay and we want to set
that to one second okay now set timeout
takes in the parameter of the function
and then the second parameter will be in
milliseconds the the length of time
which we're going to say 1000 because
that's one second so let's save and then
when we reload you'll see after a second
the chain breaks okay now it's not going
to keep breaking it's just going to
happen once what we want to do is now
set an interval for that to happen every
two seconds so let's go under what we
call break chain and we're going to say
set interval okay and we want to set
interval we want to call break chain and
we want to call it every two seconds all
right so let's save that and there we go
so the chain is going to break every two
seconds so we now have an animated icon
let's just add a couple comments in here
we'll just say call or we'll just say
call animation and say this function say
break chain animation and here we'll say
animate every
two seconds all right so I think that's
pretty cool and it's really easy to do
hopefully you guys understand we're just
basically changing the icon through
JavaScript by setting it to the unicode
value we're setting a timeout
initially to one second changing it to
the broken chain and then we're going to
call that function every two seconds so
that it keeps breaking alright now the
next one we're going to do is actually I
think is much cooler and that's the
battery charging effect okay so you have
the battery slowly filling up and for
that if we go over to font awesome and
we go to see me search for it battery
you'll see we have all these different
states of the battery so we can
implement all these different icons so
let's go ahead and do that we're going
to use the same kind of layout just
create a function call the function set
an interval alright so let's go down
here and let's say battery charged
animation and we're going to create a
function well first of all before we do
that let's just add our give up here I'm
actually going to put a line break and
put a couple line breaks paste that in
and then let's change this to battery
alright and then I also want that to be
bigger so let's add it to the CSS
battery all right so back down here to
our function and let's call this charge
battery okay and just like we did up
here we need to grab a variable or
create a variable so we'll say let
battery equals document dot get element
by D and we called it battery alright
and then the next thing we want to do is
set the the initial icon so we'll say
battery dot in our HTML equals and we
want to set it to the unicode value so
we're going to do ampersand number sign
X and let's get the let's see we want
battery zero to start with so it's F
two four four so f 2 4 4 semicolon so if
we save that we go back and reload it's
not going to show because we didn't call
the function okay so there we go
initially we have an empty battery
charge battery let's just say run
animation okay so we initially set that
now we need to do a set timeout just
like we did above which takes in a
function all right and then in this
function we're going to just change the
unicode value so let's copy that and
then let's check out the actual icon we
want which is this next one which is
like a 1 bar and that's F 2 for 3 so
we'll change this to F 2 for 3 which is
just the next one up and let's set this
for so we're going to set this for one
second so right here 1000 milliseconds
which is one second all right and then
what I'll do is copy this set timeout
paste in another one and then the next
icon we want I'm guessing is going to be
2 4 4 let's just make sure oh - 4 - ok
it's going backwards 2 for 2
and then that we're going to set to 2
seconds otherwise it's going to happen
the same time as this one okay so I'm
saying so let's copy this this one will
be 2 4 1 I'm guessing we'll set that for
3 seconds and then we want one more
which will be is that yeah - 4 is 0 and
we'll set that for 4 seconds ok so now
we should have the battery charging
effect if we save it it'll run once ok
so it fills up and it stays there so in
order for it to repeat we need to do the
set interval
so we'll say run every run animation
every what I do five seconds now you
want to do five seconds because the
whole entire thing takes four seconds
okay so we'll say set interval run
charge battery and run it every five
seconds so let's try that out now it
should just repeat when it's done there
we go so that is pretty cool I think
alright the last one we're going to do
is an hourglass hourglass effect so what
I'll do is copy this and paste that in
let's change the ID to hourglass and
we're going to do the same thing we've
been doing we're going to go down and
we're going to create the function so
let's say hourglass tip animation we'll
say function we'll call it hourglass tip
it doesn't actually tip it's just going
to kind of fill up or drop down and
let's go ahead and do same stuff we've
been doing we're going to create the
variable and then we're going to set the
icon so let's say let's hourglass equals
document dot get element by ID okay has
an ID of hourglass and then we're going
to take that hourglass and we're going
to say dot in our HTML and set that
equal to the unicode so ampersand number
sign X and if we go to Sousa called
hourglass yeah all right so we're going
to we're just going to do
think it's this one
f two five one yeah that's what we're
going to set it to initially two five
one and just to make it show up what's
called a function
what the hell is that it doesn't look
like an hourglass did I do that right -
oh so I - five ones f 25.00 hell is that
thing there we go alright let's make it
bigger by just adding the CSS class up
here all right so we have our initial
hourglass which is yeah is that one and
then we'll do our set timeout and let's
see we're going to take the hourglass
and we're going to set in our HTML and
we're going to set it to - five - copy
that and we'll change that to a two and
then we're going to do one more just
copy the set timeout and that's going to
be two five three okay and then we need
to just um so to run that you do it once
wait a minute oh I didn't set the actual
seconds so this first set timeout should
be one second the second one should be
two seconds there we go
so you see it's fallen down now it only
ran one so we need to put our set
interval
the two seconds three seconds I want
three seconds because this goes to to
set interval and we want to run our
glass tip every three seconds all right
so let's save our glass goes down three
starts good so now we have three
animated icons using JavaScript so this
is obviously this as a whole isn't a
project but you could use this in your
project if you had like a website or a
website theme that you are building and
you wanted to have like three boxes with
these icons and some text and you know
stuff like that it's just something to
add something to know how to do to make
it a little cooler rather than just
having the static still icon alright so
that's it guys hopefully you enjoyed
