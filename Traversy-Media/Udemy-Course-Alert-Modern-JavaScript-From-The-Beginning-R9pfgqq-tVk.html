introducing you to my latest udemy
course modern JavaScript from the
beginning so this course is for
absolutely everybody it's it's for
people that you know just know HTML and
CSS and they want to learn JavaScript
the whole second section is all the core
fundamentals of the language it's also
for people that are react and angular
developers that want to learn more about
building things with just vanilla
JavaScript it's also for JavaScript
professionals that want to brush up on
skills or just build some projects or
learn about the the latest features like
a sink away things like that so I just
want to go through the curriculum now
it's a very long course so you spent a
lot of time on this it says 15 point 5
hours right here but if you look down
here a lot of these haven't even been
processed these videos so I'm estimating
about 22 hours or so for this course I
spent a lot of time on it and you can
see the second JavaScript language
fundamentals the second section is three
hours long and this is all the basics
okay so variables datatypes numbers and
strings template literals we're kind of
mixing in es2015 syntax because this is
a modern JavaScript course for instance
we're not going to use var I will
introduce var but we're going to use
Latin Const and use it in the right way
we're going to talk about functions
declarations versus expressions general
loops all kinds of stuff then we'll move
on to Dom manipulation so this is
basically how to work with the Dom
without having to use something like
jQuery I'll show you how to traverse the
Dom how to move up and down how to use
selectors how to add things remove
things replace things we'll also talk
about event listeners mouse and keyboard
events event bubbling and delegation
will also talk about local in session
storage all right once we do that we're
going to move on to Dom projects where
we create three different projects using
stuff that we've learned so first will
be a task list where we can add tasks
through the Dom through a
we'll be able to delete them to filter
them will persist to local storage then
we're gonna build a loan calculator
where we can put in basically a loan
price interest rate and the years to pay
back and it'll do some calculations and
then we're gonna build a number guessing
game and that'll have a lot to do with
UI experience and stuff like that
alright then we're gonna learn about
object-oriented JavaScript and we're not
just learning about es2015 classes you
also want to learn about es5 prototypes
because classes basically just sit on
top of prototypes there's no actual
classes in the JavaScript language it's
just syntactic sugar so it's important
to learn both both methods and then
we're gonna build a Booklist project
where we first use es 5 prototypes and
then I'll show you how to convert it to
classes and we'll do kind of a
comparison and as a bonus we'll add
local storage functionality alright then
we're going to move on to asynchronous
JavaScript this is my favorite section
we actually we're going to learn about
Ajax and xhr and then we're going to
build a custom HTTP library called easy
HTTP we're going to build three
different versions version one is going
to be with Ajax and callbacks so we'll
learn all about callbacks then we're
going to learn about es6 promises the
fetch API and arrow functions and then
we're going to update the library to use
fetch and promises all right that'll be
version two and then we're going to
learn about async await which is a newer
asynchronous feature and we're going to
implement that into the library and
that'll be the final version and then
we're actually going to use that library
later on in the last project alright so
next we'll have another set of projects
that have to do with API so we're going
to build a github finder that will we'll
be able to type in and search for github
profiles it'll list out all their
repositories it'll list all their
information their avatar stuff like that
it'll use a bootstrap front-end by the
way will be using bootstrap materialized
and skeleton CSS throughout this course
then we're going to build a weather
application which fetches data from
whether API will be able to save the
location in local storage so that when
you go back to it it'll have that
location saved then we're going to learn
about error handling and regular
expressions we have quite a few videos
on regular expressions we'll build a
little form validation project and then
we're going to move to other features of
es2015 like iterators and generators
symbols D structuring stuff like that
all right then we're going to talk about
JavaScript patterns so the module
pattern singleton Factory there are many
more patterns but these are some of the
more popular ones and then once we do
that we're gonna build quite a large
project as you can see using the module
pattern so this will be a calorie
tracker where we deal with state it'll
be kind of similar to a like a react
application but built with just regular
JavaScript and the module pattern we're
also gonna implement local storage here
as well and then the last project will
be a front-end to arrest API we're going
to use JSON server to create a fake REST
API and this will be a front-end where
we can create read update and delete
posts all right now we're going to be
using es2015 modules here so we're gonna
have to set up web pack and babel so we
can transpile our code down to es5 so
i'm going to show you how to do all of
that and this is where we actually take
the HTTP library that we created back in
this section and turn it into a module
an es2015 module that we can just import
into our application and use alright so
like I said that this says 15 hours here
but it should be more once these videos
process hopefully these will be
processed by the time you guys get the
course if they're not just give them 12
to 24 hours you can see up to about this
point here everything has been processed
so you don't have to worry about that
but I don't know why you to me does that
why they let courses go live while
videos are not done processing and
there's already hate students enrolled I
honestly don't know how they even found
out about it but it is an anticipated
course
and like I said there's a $10 promo link
down from 175 dollars so it's a pretty
damn good deal I couldn't make it any
lower than 10 unless it's free and I
definitely I'm not doing it for free
because I just spent a lot of time in
this course I spent months I'm trying to
figure out what I wanted to include what
I didn't because when you do a course
about an entire language it's very very
difficult to pick and choose what you
want to include it's not like building a
react course where you just go over the
basics and go over the documentation
build a project and that's it so
hopefully you can appreciate that and
you guys enjoy it and and my my biggest
hope is that it helps a lot of you
become JavaScript programmers and then
move on to learn about frameworks and
libraries and and and and just help your
career and your life in general so
thanks guys I appreciate it and
hopefully I'll see you in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
