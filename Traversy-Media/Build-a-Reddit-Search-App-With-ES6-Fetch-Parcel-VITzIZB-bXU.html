we're gonna create a front-end
JavaScript application that uses the
parcel bundler and the reddit API to
search articles and we can limit them
from either 5 10 25 50 or 100 and we can
also sort them by relevance or by date
alright so if you have taken my udemy
course my modern JavaScript from the
beginning course and you like these you
like the type of projects that we did in
here this is gonna be very similar and
if you haven't taken the course and you
do like this project I'd highly
recommend it I'll throw in a promo link
in the description for 10 bucks and as
you can see it's a 21 out dot 21 and a
half hour course and there's no
prerequisites aside from just HTML we
start from absolute scratch all right so
let's take a look at this application so
if I try to search without any search
term it's just going to give us an alert
that says please add a search term we're
using bootstrap 4 for our UI and if I
put something in here like let's say
burgers and search you'll see it'll
reach out to the reddit API and we're
gonna display a bunch of stuff so we're
gonna display the image if there is one
if there isn't one we're gonna display
this little reddit guy and then under
the image we have the title and then we
have the self text if there is any we're
also going to truncate that make it
shorter if it's really long and then we
have a read more link that will open
that reddit or subreddit whatever it is
on another in another tab and then we
also have the name of the subreddit and
the score down at the bottom in a
bootstrap badge alright and these are
card columns so it gives it that grid
look alright so that's what we'll be
building guys hopefully you enjoy it and
let's get started hey guys if you've
been watching my videos for a while and
you really like what I do when I've
helped you out a lot consider becoming a
patron even for one dollar per month it
pushes me to keep bringing you guys the
best content I possibly can there's
reward tiers for discounts for you to me
courses personal support and more so
check out the patreon link in the
description below for more info
all right so we're gonna get started
here first thing we need to do is set up
parcel which is very very easy if you've
never used it or even heard of it don't
worry about it
it's a package manager similar to web
pack but it's zero configuration so it's
very very simple to setup so what we're
gonna do is just create a new folder for
our project I'm just going to create it
on my desktop and I'm gonna call it find
it fi nd di T and we're gonna go ahead
and open that with vs code or whatever
text editor you want to use is fine and
we'll just bring that over here okay
we'll just split that up and then what
we're gonna do is go to parcel J org if
you don't already have it installed and
just go to get started and we can simply
install it with either yarn or NPM I'm
gonna use NPM and we need to install it
globally so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to open up my terminal in vs code
you can use whatever terminal you want
but I'm gonna go ahead and do NPM
install or I - G and then we want to do
parcel - bundler okay and that will
install it for us and that's really all
we have to do to get it installed you
can then run it from absolutely anywhere
alright so now that that's done what
we're gonna do is create our package dot
JSON file with NPM and knit so package
name is good version description we'll
just say let's say reddit
search app and entry point index j s is
good and go through this author you can
put your own name if you want and
license I'll say MIT alright so we have
our package dot JSON file now what we
want to do is create an index dot HTML
file and we also want to create an index
dot JSP okay so this is gonna be our
source code
what parcel is gonna do is it's gonna
package it up for us and it's gonna put
it into a dist folder and that will be
the actual code that we can deploy and
you can simply upload it to a shared
host or however you want to deploy it
alright so if we look at the parcel
documentation here basically all we need
to do is include our index J s file and
then we can run Parcel index.html and
that will actually start a dev server so
let's do that let's go to our index.html
I'm gonna use Emmet just to put in some
default head body tags stuff like that
and we'll go ahead and change the title
to find it and then we're gonna just
reference that index J s file so we're
gonna put a script tag here with the
source of dot slash index dot JSON and
then in our index J S let's simply do an
alert will just say alert one two three
and save all right so now what we need
to do is simply run this command right
here parcel index dot HTML
alright now what that did is it it
compiled everything into this dist
folder so if we look in here we have an
index.html we have a source map and we
have a find it dot J s file so the we
don't touch these this is our compiled
code this is what we want to work on and
we can actually create modules and we
can import them using either common J S
or es6 modules ok and it'll all get
it'll all get compiled into this one
JavaScript file and that's what we use
that's what we deploy alright but while
we're working we have this dev server
that runs on localhost one two three
four so let's go to that will say HTTP
and let's go to localhost one two three
four and there we go we see our alert
one two three okay so we'll just get rid
of that I just wanted to test it out
make sure that that's connected and then
we're gonna go back to our HTML and
we're gonna create our UI before we
start to get into the functionality now
we're gonna be using bootstrap so I'm
gonna grab the CDN from bootstrap CDN
calm and we want to go right here just
get the CSS this link tag I'm gonna copy
that and put that right above the title
okay we don't need the JavaScript for
anything so we just need the CSS and
then for the UI it's pretty simple so
what I'm gonna do is just paste it in
and go over it instead of typing it all
out I know most of you guys already know
a lot of this stuff I do have a
bootstrap course on udemy too if you
just search bootstrap it'll be the first
the first result so we'll paste this in
I'm gonna close this up and we're gonna
go over it alright so at the top here
I'll just save it and at the top we have
a navbar which is very simple no links
or anything it just has a container
inside of it it has the brand and it has
a class of BG primary and B and now far
dark which makes it blue with white text
okay and then under that we have our
search container which is this whole
section here anything with an ID we're
gonna be grabbing within the
javascript okay the classes are just
bootstrap they're just for style so we
have a container that restricts this box
in the middle the div with the idea of
search is this whole thing as well and
then that has a class of card and card
body BG light gives it the gray
background and then our form has an ID
of search form we have our first field
our input field wrapped in a class of
form group has an ID of search input
anywhere where you see these mb classes
these these are just margin-bottom
classes they're just pushing stuff down
okay and then this is for the checkbox
so this is the first checkbox here that
this the sort by relevance and then we
have the second one which is the sort by
latest okay and notice that they have
the class of form check input and also
the wrapper class has a class of form
check and form check inline which makes
it go horizontal and then we have the
limit so that we have a select list as
the name of limit ID of limit and then
we have all of our options and 25 is
selected by default and then finally we
have our button and then right under
that we have our results this is where
everything's going to go that we search
for and we output but we're gonna
generate it within the JavaScript and
then output it alright and this result
should go under the div with the ID of
search okay so that div ends here and
then we have our results so now that we
have that all set now it's time for the
java script which is the main part of
this tutorial so first thing i'm gonna
do is just bring in a couple things
let's bring in the search form so we're
gonna say document dot we're gonna use
get element by d and remember we had we
gave that an idea of search - form okay
we also want the input value so we'll
say search input
set that to document dot get element by
D and that had an idea of search
- input all right so let's add let's add
an event listener to the form okay so
when this form gets submitted we want
something to happen so let's take the
search form variable and we're gonna
call add event listener and then the the
event that we want to listen on is gonna
be a submit event okay and then when
that runs we want to run a function now
we could put a callback function like
that but I'm just gonna use an arrow
function and when you have an event
listener you pet you can pass in an
event parameter as well so we want to
put an e here as a parameter for our
function and then use an arrow and then
inside this arrow I'm gonna say e dot
prevent default to prevent the forum
from actually submitting to a file okay
and we'll test this out by just saying
console.log and let's just console.log
one two three we'll open up our console
with f12 and let's go ahead and make
sure let's reload this and just type
anything in search and now you can see
we get one two three down here all right
so our event listeners hooked up now
what we want to do is we want to get the
sort by we want to get the input and we
want to get the limit so let's say let's
see let's get search term so I'll create
a variable called search term and we'll
set that to the search input which we
have defined above but we want the value
from it okay so I want to make sure we
do that and then we can just test that
out real quick
all right so now whatever I type in here
shows down here we log it alright next
thing we'll do is get let's a get sort
so we'll say
Const sort by now there's a few
different ways you can get checkboxes or
I should say radio buttons we're going
to use query selector and then we're
going to use a special special selector
called checked or I guess it's a pseudo
selector so it's a query selector and
this works just like jQuery basically we
can use any kind of selector so we're
gonna say any input that has the name of
sort by okay which is both of them the
relevance and the latest but we want the
one that's checked so we want to use
colon checked okay and let's see if we
can get that say sort by alright so now
I'm gonna just relevance is checked by
default
oh well actually you know what we need
the value
all right so we get relevance click this
one and we get new okay go back
relevance go back new good so that's
working now we want to get the the limit
so for that let's create a variable
called search limit and I'm gonna set
that to document dot get element by D as
an idea of limit and we're talking about
the Select list here right here ID of
limit and then we want the value of
course all right and just to test that
out let's take this console.log here and
just move it down and let's change this
to search limit so now whatever I choose
it's a 10 we get that down here good so
the next thing I want to do before we
move on to making our request to Reddit
and all that I want to make sure that we
can't submit an empty form an empty
input so let's say check input and for
that we're just gonna do a simple if and
we're gonna say if search term is equal
to nothing then what do we want to do we
want to show a message okay so we're
gonna create a custom function called
show message and then this will take in
two things one's gonna be the message so
we'll say not show we'll say please add
a search term and then the second will
be the class class that we want to add
to the div because we want it to be a
bootstrap alert message so I'm gonna say
alert - danger all right so let's create
that function we want to go outside of
this event listener in fact I'm gonna
put a comment here that says forum
eventlistener and then we'll go down
here outside of it and let's say show
message and we'll say function show
message okay and that's gonna member
that takes in two things it takes in the
message itself and it takes in a class
name now this is going to be the same
message show message function that we
used quite a bit in the udemy course
it's going to basically create the alert
div from scratch okay so we're gonna use
some some Dom manipulation methods with
vanilla JavaScript so first thing we
want to do is create the div so we'll
say let's say Const
create a variable called div and we'll
set it to document dot create element
which does just that and the element we
want to create as a div next thing we
want to do is add our classes to that
div so we can just say div dot class
name and set that to what we want now
I'm going to use backticks here because
I'm gonna use a variable so this is this
is a template string it's part of es6
now with bootstrap your class should be
alert and then whatever the color you
want are the type in this case alert
danger but remember this alert danger is
coming in right here it's coming in as
this parameter class name so instead of
putting this we want to put a variable
so we want to use this syntax and we
want to say class name okay because if
we put alert success in here it'll be
agreeing it's it's it makes it more
scalable we can just put alert success
if we want a green or if we want blue we
can do alert info or whatever blue is
and so on all right so next thing we
want to do is add the text obviously we
need some text in our message and that's
going to come from this right here so
what we're going to do is we're gonna
take that div
and we're going to append a child to it
which means we're gonna put something
inside of it and we want to put a text
node and in JavaScript to create a text
node you use create text node
okay now you could put some text in here
but obviously we want our message so I'm
gonna put the message variable that
comments coming in from here okay so
we're almost there now that we created
everything we need to get it into the
Dom so it displays so we want to do two
things we want to get the parent
container which is going to be this I
this div right here with the idea of
search container and then we also want
the div that we want to put it before
which is going to be this div with the
idea of search so we want to get those
two things so let's say Const search
container equals document dot get
element by D search - container that's
the parent and then we want to get
search so we'll say Const search get
element by D search
all right so now all we have to do is
insert the message so we're gonna take
the container search container and just
call a method called dot insert before
which does just that it inserts before
so we want to insert the div before the
search element so that it shows right up
here so let's save that let's try it out
we'll reload and we'll leave this blank
and click search and there we go please
add a search term now as it is now it's
just gonna stay there and I don't want
that I want it to go away after us after
a certain amount of time so we're gonna
say timeout timeout alert and we're
gonna use a function called set timeout
which is just a JavaScript function and
it takes in a callback
so we could do function but I'm gonna
use an arrow so I'm just gonna put an
empty set of parentheses and then an
arrow and all I want to do here is
remove the alert so we're gonna say
document dot get element by ID actually
know it's a class so we're gonna use
query selector so dot alert and then we
want to remove it so we can say dot
remove all right now this set timeout
takes a second parameter so we want to
go put a comma here and then the amount
of time that we want it to wait so we'll
say 3,000 which is 3,000 milliseconds
which is three seconds so let's test it
out we'll reload and we'll click search
and then it should go away in three
seconds there we go all right so that
functionality is taken care of I know
that was quite a bit but I think it's
good to create it from scratch within
the JavaScript
rather than like creating a div with
alert
an alert danger because if we do that
we'll have this red line and it's just
it's it gets kind of messy so I think
it's good to do it that way even though
it's a little longer alright so now that
we have that done let's move on so let's
see we checked the input once we enter
something in search I want this to clear
up so all we have to do for that is take
the search input dot value and set that
to nothing okay then we're finally ready
to search Reddit so what we're gonna do
here is obviously we're gonna use the
fetch API but I want to do this in a
different file ok that's basically the
reason I use parcel is so that we could
use modules so we're gonna create a new
file in the root here make sure it's not
in your distal Durr and we're gonna call
this reddit API dot J s all right and
then in this reddit API we're going to
export default it's gonna be an object
and we're gonna have a function called
search all right and this is where we're
going to make our request now in our
index file we have to bring in this
module so we're gonna go up to the very
top and let's say import I'm gonna use
es6 syntax we can do that with parcel
and we'll say import reddit from dot
slash reddit API
just like that and then down here when
we want to search reddit we can use that
excuse me we can use that variable that
we just assigned so reddit and we can
call the search function like that and
we're actually going to have it return a
promise so we will be doing like dot
then but for now let's just pass in our
search term
let's pass in the search limit and let's
pass in sort by okay and these are all
things that we defined up here search
term all this stuff here we're just
passing it into our reddit search
function all right so we'll go back to
the reddit API dot j s and just to make
sure that this is getting called let's
do a console log and let's just say
search okay so now if we reload and we
type something in and search we can see
that that's connected okay
now we're good what we're gonna do is
we're gonna use the fetch API here so
we're gonna say fetch and we're gonna
pass in the URL so the URL is going to
be HTTP wwe.com
slash search and then we want to do dot
jason and then we want a query so we're
gonna put question mark which which
allows us to use a URL parameter Q
equals so query equals and then our
search term and remember this should
this should actually take in our search
term our search limit and our sort by
so we want this to be our search term
now I actually wanted to use backticks
here so we don't have to do any
concatenation or anything we can simply
go like that okay so it's gonna equal
search term so with the fetch API we do
a dot then okay but this isn't actually
gonna give us the data this first dot
then it gives us the response and then
we need to basically say that we want
that response in Jason and then we do
another dot then and it gives us the
data alright so we'll say data and let's
use an arrow function and let's just
console dot log the data alright so
we'll save that reload and let's type in
here burgers I don't know why I chose
burgers but I did and then it gives us
this it gives us an object with a kind
of listing and then data data is what
we're interested in so if we look in
data you can see it has this children
object which is actually an array of
objects 25 by default and these are our
posts so in in our posts we have another
data so we have some digging to do to
get to what we want and in this data is
where all the stuff is so if we go down
to like title which is you can see
there's a lot of stuff but the title is
here we have the URL we have the
permalink so this is where all the stuff
is so we have quite a bit of digging to
do in the API now before we do that I
just want to add the rest of our
parameters because in addition to the
query we can put another another
parameter with the ampersand and we can
say sort and we're gonna set that equal
to our sort by alright and then we'll do
another one and we'll say limit equals
and we'll set that to our search limit
okay and I should probably should have
showed you the reddit API documentation
will say reddit API search and let's see
so right here yeah so see you can take
limit maximum default is 25 as you saw a
maximum 100 Q is a query which is a
string no longer than 512 characters and
what else did we do sort which can be
relevance we did relevance and new you
can also do hot top and comments if you
want and then there's some other stuff
here if you want to experiment so this
is this is the information for the the
search endpoint alright so now that we
did that let's figure out what we want
to return I don't want to return just
that data object because there's just so
much stuff I don't want to return this
so we're gonna go data and then dot data
which will be that all right so let's
let's log this data dot data and then
what do we want children so dot children
and that will give us that will
basically give us the array this array
here right so if we try it
what what I do
sort by is not defined let's see what I
do I didn't do it I didn't capitalize
the B alright and let's test the limit -
we'll do five okay so now now we're
looking at data data dot children which
gives us the array of posts now I don't
want to return the object I want to use
the map high order function to get just
the data so what we can do here is let's
not log this let's return this so we'll
go like that but then we'll take the map
function and we'll pass in data and set
that to data dot data so that way we're
returning just this part of this or of
these objects okay because that's what
we want we don't care about the kind we
just want this alright and then the last
thing we want to do here is return this
whole fetch because what this does is it
allows us to make our search function
return a promise okay good because fetch
returns a promise and we're returning
that so we can now do search dot then in
our index file well one thing I did
forget is I just want to add a dot catch
in case there's some kind of error when
we have promises we can do catch and
we'll say error and we'll just
console.log it like that
okay so that's that's our whole file
that's all we need and if you wanted to
add to this and you wanted to use other
end points or something from the reddit
API you could add another function like
I don't know popular or something like
that all right but we just we just want
this to be a search app for now so now
let's go back here and this should now
return a promise so we can say dot then
actually let's put this on a new line
dot then and then what it's gonna give
us is the data or I'll call it results
so results will use an arrow and then
let's make sure we're actually getting
something so say console.log results and
save all right let's try it and there we
go so 25 results and you can see it's
only it's now just the data we're not
getting that the type or what was it
kind T 3 or something like that we're
just getting the data because we did the
map we mapped it to that these high
order functions are really really handy
all right so now that we have the
results we want to output them into our
UI so let's create a variable called
output and I'm using let because I'm
going to be manipulating it I'm gonna
start it off with just a div actually
it'll be a div with the class and we're
gonna use bootstraps card columns so
we'll go ahead and give it a class of
card columns and then let's see we're
gonna want to loop through our results
and then create a card for each one but
before we do the loop let's go down here
and let's say output plus equals which
is an append we're not overriding output
we're adding to it the ending div to
that div we just created
okay but in here we want to loop through
our results so we'll take that results
that we got from our reddit dot search
from the promised and we'll call for
each okay which is another high order
function that just loops through just
loops through an array so we'll say
results dot for each and here we'll say
post we use an arrow function and then I
actually just want to put a comment
right here say loop through posts so in
here we want to take that output
variable and append to it so plus equals
and I'm going to use a template string
so that we can use variables within it
and we just want a bootstrap card for
each of these posts so if I go to get
bootstrap comm and I go to documentation
components and card I'm just gonna grab
this right here this first one and stick
that in there okay and I'm just going to
get rid of this inline style right here
with the width we don't want that and
then we can fill in all of our dynamic
content that comes from this post all
right but before we do that let's see if
we can output it on to the screen when
we search so we'll go down below the
output right here and remember we have
that idea of results which is right here
this is where we want to output
everything so we'll simply say document
dot get element by D results
innerhtml equals output okay and that
that'll output all of this from here all
of the looping through all the cards and
then the ending div so let's save that
and let's reload this and just search
for burgers and now we're just gonna get
a bunch of static cards because we
haven't filled in anything any dynamic
content all right so let's put in the
title right here so we can use this
syntax so we can take the post that
comes from here and we can call dot
title so if I were to now search for
burgers you can see that now we're
getting dynamic titles now this here
that in the paragraph this is where I
want to put what is it the self text I
believe it's called you know what let's
let's console.log our results and just
so we can see what's available so we'll
go right here and say results all right
so if we look in here we have I think
it's self text that I want right yeah
self text and notice that this doesn't
have some of them it's just blank but if
there is self text I want it to display
here so we're gonna go ahead and say
post dot self text and let's save that
okay now undefined undefined why
shouldn't be undefined oh I put a
capital T here it's all lowercase okay
so now this is the self text notice how
long some of them are actually there's
only one that has it it's really long so
I want to create a truncate function
that will shorten this up so we're gonna
go down below our show message and let's
say truncate
text and we'll create a function called
truncate text which will take in two
things it'll take in a string we'll call
it my string and a limit actually let's
call it text and limit and then we'll
say Const let's say shortened and what
we'll do is set it to text dot index of
because what I don't want this I don't
want it just to cut off in the middle of
a word so what we're doing here is we're
making sure that it's gonna actually be
the end of a word when it gets cut off
so we're gonna put a space and we also
want to pass in our limit alright and
then we want to say if shortened is
equal to negative 1 then we want to
return text this index of if it does if
it doesn't match if it doesn't match a
space then it's going to return negative
1 okay and then finally we just want to
return
TxDOT substring and here we're gonna
pass it we want to start at zero and
then whatever the shortened is is gonna
be the second parameter and there's a
lot of discipline T of truncate
functions you can find just search Stack
Overflow if you don't like this one but
this one seems to work all right so now
we can just wrap the self text in
truncate text okay and let's see that's
gonna take in a second parameter of
however long we want this so I'm gonna
make this let's say a hundred words long
and save and let's try this again and
see how long that text is okay so there
we go
and I'm sorry not a hundred words a
hundred characters so that's all set now
let's do the image because right now
we're just having this blank image here
there's no source now this is where
things can get tricky because not every
post has an image and the images are
actually stored in a preview object
inside of an images array and some of
them don't even have the preview objects
so we have to do some testing before we
can output it or else it'll be defined
undefined so if we look at let's say
this first one and we go down to preview
if it has it which it does okay some of
them do not have this so we have to test
for it but if we look in here it's that
the images is tucked away so we have
preview then we have images which is an
array and the array has one value in it
and that's an object if we look in that
object we have another object called
source and that source has the URL so
that's that's where we get the image URL
so it's root it's really tucked in there
and that's that's what's difficult about
working with api's is just grabbing the
data cuz because sometimes it's just so
far in there and you have to do a bunch
of maps and all this crap and if
statements to check and see if it's a
it's there if it's
to find so what we'll do is check for
this preview if it has it then will will
will navigate to this URL and use that
as our image source so we're gonna go
above the output but still within the
loop within the for each and we're gonna
say check for image okay so we're gonna
say let's image equals post dot preview
now what I'm gonna do here is use a
ternary operator which is like a
shorthand if statement so I'm gonna say
post preview and then we use the ternary
operator and we say post dot preview we
basically want to find this URL we're
saying if this exists then let's grab
this URL which is post dot preview
remember there was an array called
images we want the first value so zero
and then we want the source and then we
want the URL okay
else okay so the colon is else then we
just want to use the little reddit guy
which I forget we just search say reddit
image and I think I used this one it's
not the one I used
let's see no it wasn't that one oh it
was this one right here so I'm gonna
save you image and then I'm just gonna
grab this URL so basically saying if
post preview exists we want to grab the
image if not then we're gonna use this
static image so we're just gonna put
that in alright so hopefully you guys
understand that you could add you could
use an if statement here it would just
be longer and then what we'll do is go
to the image tag into the source and we
can now just put image which is this
variable okay I guess I could use Const
here different people have different
opinions about letting Const I like to
use constant s I know it's going to
change but you know some people like to
use let all the time and it's it's just
preference so let's try this out we'll
save we'll reload burgers and there we
go
so now we're getting all the images and
this one for instance doesn't have the
preview so it's showing that little
reddit guy and you can use a different
image if you want alright guys so we are
almost there now we want to do is let's
see let's do the link so we're gonna go
down to this a tag and we're gonna add
right here we can just do post dot URL
and then I just want to make sure that
it opens in a new tab so we're gonna say
target equals blank and then we'll
change the text from go somewhere to
read more so let's try that out
okay read more and there we go okay so
let's search for something else let's do
J s there we go so just some JavaScript
stuff PHP so we can search for anything
and the limit if we want to do five PHP
it gives us five results one two three
four five columns is a little weird but
let's see let's do latest ten oops
PHP latest ten and there we go ten
results okay so I also want to add the
subreddit and the score down here at the
bottom so I think that's I think that's
all we have left to do so let's go under
under the a tag let's put an H our
and let's put a span I can't use Emmet
in here huh span
let's do class badge and let's do badge
- secondary which will make it gray well
I haven't actually typed out each tip
ending HTML tags in a long time
and will say subreddit and we can get
that with post dot subreddit okay and
then we're gonna do another span with a
badge so what I'll do is just so you'll
just copy this down and let's change it
from badge secondary to badge dark and
let's change the text to score and we
can get this with post dot score alright
so let's try it
okay there we go subreddit Score and to
make sure it looks responsive good we
make it really small and it gets it gets
stacks awesome alright guys so that's
gonna do it for this project now if you
wanted to deploy this you have your dist
folder here with your compiled code in
it now we didn't have to use parcel for
this you could have taken the code
that's in the reddit API file the search
here and put it right in your index J s
and just use that but I wanted to use
parcel because I don't know I wanted to
do something different I wanted to make
it more scalable if you wanted to add
add more modules to it you have the
ability to use like post CSS and some
other features of parcel as well I think
it's a great technology alright so
that's it guys if you like this video
please leave it a like and I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
