building a front-end to the slim PHP
restful api that we created that I
created a few days ago alright so before
I start I just want to mention a couple
things a couple important things one if
you're going to be following along
copying the code I'd strongly suggest
that you go back and build the backend
first by watching that video I'll put a
link in the description if you're just
watching that's fine
but in order to code it all out you'll
need access to that back-end API alright
I have it on github
ok this link right here so you can
download it you can import the database
which is in this SQL file right here ok
it just has our customers table with
some fields so if you want to do that
but I'd still suggest watching the video
so that you can get your virtual host
setup and all that alright the second
thing I want to mention is that if
you're looking to learn the basics of
UJS and you want good explanations of
all the different fundamentals then go
back and watch my few j/s in 60 minutes
video all right this isn't a
step-by-step tutorial this is a project
video so I won't be explaining every
single little piece of code because I
want to get this done in a timely manner
all right so just keep those things in
mind as you're watching this video now
if we take a look at the application
we'll be building
you can see that we're listing all the
customers that are in our bio school
database coming from the API and we can
actually filter by last name if I go
ahead and I add D in there you'll see
that it filters last name D and if I
continue to type let's see that it'll
filter down to dough all right so we can
filter the the customers we can list
them if we click view it'll take us to
customer slash and then whatever the
idea is we can see the name the contact
info the address and so on all right we
can also delete ok so if I click delete
you'll see we get a little alert says
customer deleted and Tom Doe is no
longer there ok we can also edit so
let's see we want to edit Katie Dotson
let's say we want to change her name to
Catherine and submit and you'll see that
she's been updated all right we can also
add a customer so let's go ahead and add
John Doe okay
address will say three Main Street Miami
Florida
okay submit and you can see that John
Doe has been added okay and then we just
have a simple about page as well so
that's all be building I still have my
slim app back-end set up from from the
last video we did there are a couple
things that we need to change from that
video all right a couple small things
one we need to enable cores so that we
can actually have cross-domain requests
so to do that if we go into I've already
updated this in the github so if we go
to source routes customers PHP right
here is what you want to add okay this
is this will enable cores on your server
alright you want to have allow origin by
any domain okay or you could put a
specific domain where you're building
your front-end but this will allow
requests from anywhere ok get post put
and delete requests so just add these
two blocks of code and that should work
the second thing really simple when
we're getting our single customers I
should have actually did this in the
last video but we had it at fetch all
right here and what that does is it gets
in a wreck an array of objects even
though it's only one customer and I
don't want that I want to return just a
single object so change fetch all to
fetch alright if you still have the code
from the video those two things are all
you should have to change on the backend
alright
I actually have to change those things
myself on my end so I'm going to go
ahead and just open up
see htdocs slim app routes customers and
we just pull this down okay so I'm just
going to grab this and we'll put that
right here and I'm also going to just
change under single customer fetch all
we're going to change that to fetch okay
and that should that should be all set
so I'll save that and now the back end
is prepared and we can continue with UJS
alright so let's head over to view js2
the website and go to get started and
let's say you want to click on
installation right here alright we're
going to be using the view CLI if you
watch the my view in sixty minutes video
we're going to do the same thing we're
going to go ahead and you want to
install view CLI if you don't have it
okay of course you need nodejs and npm
but you want to run this I already have
it installed so I'm not going to run
that and then we just want to generate a
project like this view in it
alright so let's go to let's see I'm
going to go to my projects folder and
this is where I want to create it so I'm
going to open up a command line okay so
let's go to projects alright and we're
going to do few in it and we want to use
the webpack module and then we'll name
the application I'm just going to call
it V customers all right and that will
go ahead and generate the application
okay it's just going to ask us a couple
questions we're going to enter through
this let's say simple
customer manager enter it's fine ok so I
don't want to use es lint so I'm going
to say no to this same thing with the
testing we don't need that all right so
now what we want to do is CD into V
customers and we're going to run NPM
install and that'll get the dependency
setup all right so that's all set let's
go ahead and run NPM run dev and that
should start up our application
oh you know what I have to change my
port number on the dev server so let's
see I'm going to open up my editor and
we're going to open up the full project
folder which is V customers all right
and you shouldn't have to do this if
port 8080 is open on your machine but
I'm going to go to build and then dev
server j/s and let's see I'm just going
to change this right here to port 8000
all right we'll save that run it again
and it should open on port 8000 all
right so we have our boilerplate app
running now I'm going to just kind of
get rid of all the the demo stuff so
let's go over to source SRC folder and
we're going to go to let's see app dot
view and let's get rid of this image
right here we'll get rid of the hello
component and for now let's just say
test get rid of the import from hello
get rid of it right here and we'll also
delete the styling right here all right
so let's save that and now we get test
ok no errors in the console it's good so
the first thing I want to do is create I
want to create two components I want to
create customers which will be basically
our landing page and then about which
will be just a simple about page alright
so in the components folder what we're
going to do is let's actually just
rename hello to customers okay so
customers view and then we're just going
to get rid of everything in this div
with the class of hello and let's change
this class to customers and we'll just
put right here for now customers we're
going to change the name of the
component okay we can get rid of this
message value here and let's get rid of
all this styling
all right very simple save that and then
we're going to copy everything that's in
it and create another component called a
boat view paste that in change this to a
boat and change this and this okay we'll
save that now if we go back to app dot
view and what we want to do actually
we're not even we're not going to use
this at all this file because what we're
going to do is set up our router in main
j/s so that we can load customers as our
home page and we'll have a nav bar with
some links and we'll be able to go to
the about page from there alright so
we're going to have to install the the
view router so I'm going to go back to
the command line here just stop it with
control C and we're going to say NPM
install we want to install view - router
and we also want to install view -
resource later on for when we make our
HTTP requests alright so let's just add
- - save and we'll go ahead and run that
alright so that should be all set let's
go ahead and run the server again NPM
run dev okay and then let's just get rid
of this stuff here we don't need any of
this alright so now we're going to go to
main j/s and we're going to bring in the
the view router so let's say import view
router and that's going to be from view
- router alright while we're here we
might as well bring in the resource so
view resource and that's going to be
from view - resource alright actually
you know what that's going to be a lower
case V alright now we need to just add a
little bit of middleware here so we're
going to save view dot
use and then we're going to pass in our
view resource and it's do view dot use
and we're going to pass in the view
router alright so now what we'll do is
create our router object so let's say
Const router and we'll set this to new
view router inhale pass in an object I'm
going to say mode history the base will
be the current directory which is a
double underscored our name let's see
and then we're going to put our routes
which will be an array ok so let's say
path this will be for the home so I'll
just slash and then we want to define
the component that should load which
will be customers ok then we want to
have path and let's say slash boat and
obviously we want to load the about
component alright now we have to import
the customers and about components so up
here we're going to say import customers
and that's going to be from C dot slash
components slash customers
ok we'll do a boat
components slash about all right so we
have our two routes here now we want to
do is go down to our instance and we're
going to get rid of the element right
here we don't need that template we're
going to clear that out for now we're
going to use back ticks so that we can
use multiple lines and then we don't
need this and then we just want to at
the end here say dot money sign mount
and we want to mount to the app ID now
in here I'm going to put a div with the
ID of app okay and we want to put in our
router - view so this will just load
whatever the current view is okay oh I
forgot to pass in router get a pass
setting right here alright so if we save
that you can see that we're getting the
customers view because that's that's the
route component that's the route view so
that's what's being loaded all right we
should be able to if we were to put in
router - link and say 2 equals slash
about
that should bring us to about yep all
right now we're going to be using
bootstraps so I want to implement the
navbar all right as far as bringing
bootstrap and I'm just going to use the
CDN so let's grab that
okay so we'll grab this link copy that
let's change this title while we're at
it we'll say V customers let's say
manage customers all right now we'll put
in a link rel stylesheet and let's put
our href and paste that in okay we're
also going to need the JavaScript and
we're going to put that down here so
let's say script source and we'll grab
that as well
okay now we're also going to need jQuery
for bootstrap j/s so let's get that just
grab this link here and we'll put that
make sure you put it above the bootstrap
up didn't copy
okay paste that in and we should be good
to go so now you can see the fonts
changed and stuff so now let's get a
navbar so we'll go to get bootstrap comm
do this the quick way we're going to go
to examples
start a template control you and let's
grab this okay then we're just going to
go back to main j/s so we can close that
out so in main j/s I'm going to go right
above the router view and paste that in
and then what we'll do is change its get
rid of the class active change this to
router linked will say to slash okay
we'll do the same thing with the boat
that's going to go to slash a boat and
we'll get rid of the contact
okay let's also get rid of navbar fix
top and change navbar inverse to navbar
defaults which will make it the light
color alright and then project name
change that to the customers save it
let's go back or is it and there we go
so now if I click home we get customers
about we get a boat okay no error is
good so let's go ahead and go into the
customers component I'm going to add a
class of container okay and then we'll
just add an h1 and give it a class of
page header and we'll just say manage
customers and let's go to a boat also
add a container okay we'll just say
about save that and there we go so now
what we want to do is bring in our
customers from our API so let's go over
to the customers component and we're
going to add in the data here customers
and we'll set this to an empty array now
let's go under the data here put a comma
and we'll say methods and we're going to
have a method called fetch customers
okay we're going to use the view
resource module and say this dot money
sign HTTP okay we're going to make a get
request and we want to make it to HTTP
and mine is in slim app I believe slash
API slash customers okay then we're
going to do dot then and in here our
function with a response and then what
I'm going to do is just console dot log
and let's log response dot body ok now
this isn't going to run yet what we're
going to do is add it to a life cycle
hook called created which runs whenever
the component loads so we're going to go
down here put a comma and say created
okay make sure you don't put created
inside methods okay it doesn't go in
there and then we're just going to we're
going to run this dot fetch customers
all right so let's go ahead and save
that and there we go so we're getting
our customers from our API now if you
didn't add the coconut enable cores as I
did in the beginning of the video you're
going to get an error saying something
about allowing access all right so you
want to enable cores on the server so
what we want to do we obviously don't
want to just console.log it we want to
assign it to this customers right here
all right so let's say this dot
customers now we want to make sure it's
in JSON format so we're going to say
json dot parse and let's pass in not
request response dot body now we should
be able to access customers from within
our view so let's go up here and what
we're going to do is we're going to have
a table so i'm going to go ahead and
paste the first part in so we just have
a table with a class of table and table
striped we have the t head with the
table row first name last name email and
then an empty one for the button and
then the t body is where we want to loop
through our customers so we're going to
put a table row and we want to use the V
for directive okay which basically
allows us to do a for loop and we'll say
customer in customers
okay so we're grabbing this value which
is being filled here by our response so
let's go ahead and put in our TD oops
okay so this is going to be the first
name so double curly brace customer dot
first name alright and I'm just going to
copy that
okay so have first name last name and
email and then the button is going to go
here I'm not gonna put that in yet
alright so let's go ahead and save that
and now you can see we're getting our
customers so the next thing I want to do
is I want to be able to add customers so
for that we're going to need another
component so in components let's create
a new file and I know I'm going kind of
fast here guys but it's a lot of code so
I want to get it done kind of quickly
and again if you are having trouble
understanding what's going on
I would suggest watching the sixty
minutes video first all right so let's
call this add dot view and I'm just
going to copy what we have in about
paste that in okay we'll change the
heading to add customer change that to
add and then we want to we'll save this
and we'll create a route so in main j/s
up here let's go ahead and copy that and
we'll say add change this to add which
we have to import
just like that
and then what we'll do is add a link
down here now I want the add link to be
over here on the right so what I'm going
to do is copy this ul paste that in and
we'll add another class of nav bar right
okay we can delete one of these and then
we're going to change this one to add
customer and the link will be slash add
save it okay so if I click on that we
get add customer all right so now we
need to create our form so let's go back
to the add component and inside the data
here we're going to have customer and
we're going to set that to just an empty
object for now all right now up in the
template let's put form and we're going
to put a V on submit okay so what that's
going to do is when the form is
submitted it's going to call whatever
function we put in here which is going
to be add customer okay now just to save
time I'm going to paste this form in and
I'll go over it so I separated it into
three different parts which are wrapped
in a div with the class of well okay so
we have the customer info which is the
first name we have a label then we have
the input which is a text and notice
that we have this v-model attribute
which is going to bind it to customer
dot first-name okay we're doing the same
thing with the last name then we have
the contact area which we have the email
and the phone okay you can see v-model
customer email customer phone and then
finally we have the location info which
we have the address the city and the
state okay and then we just have a
button with the type of submit all right
so let's save that okay that gives us a
form now it just says add customer is
not defined so we have to add that so
let's go under data and we'll say
methods
ad customer so this actually will take
in the event object and we want to say e
dot prevent default to prevent the form
from actually submitting and for now
let's just do a test you'll say
console.log one two three
reload and if we were to submit this you
can see down here we get one two three
all right now as far as validation I'm
not going to do anything
advanced we're just going to make sure
that there's a first name a last name
and an email so we'll do a simple if
okay we'll say if no this dot customer
dot first name or actually yeah we'll
just do that so or copy that okay so
we'll change this one to last name and
this to email and for now we're going to
console.log what I want to do is create
an alert component okay because we'll
have different types of alerts so I
think that they should be in its own
component but for now let's just say
console.log
okay and then we'll have an else I'm
just going to put this in here as well
all right and then what we want to do is
we want to create an object from all the
form fields so let's say let new
customer okay that's going to be an
object and I'm just going to grab I'm
just going to paste this stuff in
alright so we're just creating an object
here with all the fields and setting it
to this dot customer dot and whatever
that field alright and then what we want
to do is take this object and we want to
make a post request to our API and
submit it alright so again we can use
the view resource will save this dot
money sign HTTP POST and even though
it's a post request it's formatted just
like the get requests and we want HTTP
slim app or whatever you called whatever
you use for your API domain slash API
slash customer slash ad all right now we
just want to put a second parameter here
with that new customer object okay and
then we want to do then and in here
we'll have our function this will give
us a response but all I want to do is
redirect so after it's inserted into our
database in the backend we want to
redirect back to the home page alright
now since we're using the router we
should have access to this dot money
sign router and then we can say dot push
which is basically redirect alright we
want to go to let's see you put an
object path
we want to go to slash alright so let's
go ahead and save that okay now if we go
to add customer let's go ahead and try
it out we'll say Tom Williams phone
alright so let's go ahead and submit and
there we go Tom Williams okay if we
reload he's still there
good now I want to make sure that the
requests the fetch user our fetch
customer is always called when this is
updated so in addition to put it it
putting it in the created hook I'm going
to copy that
put a comma I want it in the updated
hook as well alright just like that so
let's see now when we submit this I want
to have an alert telling us that it's
been submitted okay it just looks nicer
from a UI standpoint so we're going to
create a new component called alert dot
view and for now let's copy what we have
in the about okay and we'll just change
actually you know what this is going to
be formatted differently but let's
change this and what I'm going to do is
go to get bootstrap and we're going to
go to components and alerts and I want
to get the collapsible one this one here
are dismissible whatever and we're going
to copy this and then put that as our
template okay
now for this component I want to be able
to pass in a message when we when we
call the components so we're going to
add a prop our property right here we'll
say props and just pass in here message
all right and then up here we're going
to get rid of this line we're going to
replace it with whatever that message is
all right so that should do it for the
component itself so let's save that and
then in customers we're going to import
it so let's go right here and say import
alert from alert okay let me just tab
this over and then we're going to put it
let's see let's put it above the h1 and
we'll say alert and say message equals
for now we'll just say test okay now
let's see we're going to have to add it
as a component so down at the bottom
here we'll put a comma say components
alert and let's save it let's take a
look I expected token oh I've got the
comma and the alert component right here
all right so let's save that and now we
have our alert component now obviously
we don't want this to show all the time
so what we're going to have to do is add
in our data not in the alert component
in our customers component we'll go
right here and say alert and we'll set
that to nothing by default and then up
in the component we're going to put a
v if because we only want this to
display if there's something in alert so
if we save that now you'll see it's not
showing and then we also want obviously
we don't want to pass in test we want to
pass in whatever is in the alert so what
we'll do is add V bind to this okay
since we're putting in a variable we
need to use this V bind and then
whatever alert is all right now the way
that we're going to get the alert okay
when we add a customer what we can do is
if we go to our add component and where
we have this push we're going to path
home we can actually send a query along
with this okay we can send information
along with this so what I want to do is
send the alert message so we're going to
add a comma right here and then we're
going to say query and let's say alert
and we'll say customer added so now we
can send this along to that route so
let's save it and then we'll go back to
our customers and then what we need to
do is check for that alert so we'll go
to created because this is going to run
when we when we redirect back and we're
going to say if we'll say if this dot
money sign wrote a dot query dot alert
okay so that means that there is an
alert so then we'll set this dot alert
equal to this equal to the alert that's
coming in so let's go ahead and save
that
and then what I'm going to do to test
this out actually we'll just add another
customer so let's go back and say add
customer
we'll say Jen Thompson
all right so let's say submit and now we
get customer added okay and we can
cancel we can close that with the X
button as well all right good so we can
now create and read customers but we
want to be able to get a single customer
as well and get the rest of the
information so we need a View button
over here that will take us to a details
component all right so let's go ahead
and create a new component and we'll
call this customer details dot view okay
and again we'll just copy what we have
in a boat we'll change this right here
to details okay for now we'll just
change this to details for the name it's
going to be all lowercase customer
details and let's save that now we want
to create a route for this so let's go
to main j/s and we're going to go ahead
and import that and let's add a route so
the route is going to be customer slash
and then colon ID okay it's going to
have an ID parameter and we want to load
customer details component all right so
let's save that now let's go to our
customers view file and go up to where
our table is and we're going to want to
put a router link button in here
alright so let's say router
link and we're going to give it a class
default now it's going to have a two
attribute but since we're going to have
a variable in it we're going to use V
bind so V bind colon 2 equals ok and
then inside this two let's see we're
going to have we're going to put single
quotes and then slash customer slash and
then go outside of the single quotes and
we're going to concatenate customer ID
all right let's save that now if I hover
over it and you look down here in the
corner you'll see we get customer slash
for customer slash 3 click on that takes
us to the details now in the details we
want to again make a request to our API
to get the single customer so let's go
to customer details and we're going to
go under the data and let's say methods
and we'll create a method called fetch
customer and just going to copy what we
have in the customers right here ok
paste that in and then let's change this
route to API slash customer let's see
yeah this is actually going to take in
an ID and then we're going to just
concatenate say slash ID all right and
then we want to set this dot customer
singular to the body all right now we
want to call this when the page loads so
we're going to go under methods and add
the created hook
okay we're going to call this dot fetch
customer and then we need to pass in the
ID which we can get from the parameters
from the route so this dot route dot
params dot ID all right and then once we
assign this dot customer we should have
access to it in the template actually we
need to put it here first that and then
up here let's try and do customer dot
first name okay save it and there we go
so we can get the first name let's put
the last name okay so now we can do the
rest of the info I'm going to paste this
in so we're putting two UL with the
class of list group and you can see we
have we're using the bootstrap icons
this glyphicon class click on dash phone
and we put in customer dot phone and
customer dot email and then down here we
just have the contact I'm sorry the
location info all right so if we save
that you can see we can get all that
stuff alright so we can now get
individual customers if I click on Sam
Smith view we get his info all right and
I just want to put a back button up
above the up above the h1 so we'll just
put in router link and we'll say two
slash
okay so now we have a back button so now
we want to do is we want to have an edit
and a delete button on this page on the
details page so let's let's go within
the h1 right here and let's say try to
think what I want to do here let's put a
span we'll give it a class of pull right
just to bring it up bring the buttons
over to the right and let's do the
delete first because that's easier so
we'll say button and it's going to have
a V on so V on click and we'll say
delete customer okay let's also give it
a bootstrap class BTN danger okay so now
we have a delete button we also want to
pass in the ID to this function so let's
put parenthesis and we'll say customer
dot ID all right and then down here in
our methods let's say delete customer
okay that takes in ID and just to test
it out let's pass along the ID okay so
now let's reload this but click that we
get to now we want to make a delete
request so I'm going to copy this what
we have in fetch customer and we're
going to change it to dot delete and we
want this to go to API slash customer /
delete slash and then the ID all right
and then in here we just want to
redirect
let's get rid of that and say this dot
router dot push okay and we're going to
put in here our path which is going to
be the home page and we also want to
pass along query because we want a
message
so we'll say alert customer deleted all
right let's save that and hopefully this
works we'll go to Gen Thompson click
delete and we get customer deleted and
she's gone good so we're just about
we're almost there we a we can create
read and up
I'm sorry create read and delete now we
need to be able to update so for this
there's a couple ways you could do this
I'm going to actually create another
component called edit with the Edit form
so let's go ahead and do that edit dot
view and it's very similar to the add
form so I'm going to just grab
everything in there and paste it in edit
okay we'll go up to the top here change
that that the submit function here is
going to be I would say update customer
this stuff will all stay the same the
v-model that can all stay the same you
could actually use the same form for add
and edit but I'm going to just separate
it alright and then let's see down at
the bottom
we're going to want to fetch the
customer just like we did in the details
so we're going to have to add a route
with a parameter so for now I'm going to
just get rid of this add customer just
for now actually no let's keep that
because I guess we could just edit it
now so we'll just change that to update
customer and let's say we want this the
check in here and then
we're going to build a new object let's
change it to update customer that can
all stay the same and then it's going to
make a request but we want to make a put
request this time and we want to make it
to API slash customer slash update and
slash update and then the ID is going to
come from the route so we can say slash
and then this dot route dot params ID
okay and then we're going to pass along
the update customer object and then
we're going to redirect that's good
we'll change this to updated all right
so let's save that for now and we're
going to create a new route so we're
going to go to main J s and we want to
bring in edit okay and then let's copy
this change this to edit / ID component
edit alright so we'll save that now we
need a button going to that route so
let's go back to customer details go up
to after where we have the delete button
which is right here alright and for this
we're going to use a router link I'm
actually going to put the edit button
first
so we'll go right above the delete and
say router link and we can give this a
class of BTN and BTN let's see
default I will do primary
and then for our two we want to use V
bind so V bind to and in here we want
the the route we want to go to which is
going to be a slash edit / and we want
to just add on to that customer ID
all right so that'll give us the button
so if we click that we go to edit
customer now these aren't filled in
because we have to make our request to
our API to get that current customer all
right so let's go down here
actually no we want to go to edit dot
view and let's go right above update
customer and we'll say fetch customer
make sure you put a comma there alright
and it's the same fetch customer from
the details page so we can just grab
that and go ahead and paste that in okay
that's going to take in an ID and we
want to go down and go to the created
hook which will go after methods
function and we're going to call this
dot fetch customer and we want to just
pass in from the params so this dot
route dot params dot ID all right and
we're setting that to this dot customer
so that should then fill in all those
fields so let's save that and I can see
all the fields are filled in and we
should be able to update it because we
already did this update customer so
let's say Sam Smith we want to change
his email to let's say Sam it Yahoo okay
we submit we get updated and his email
has been update
it okay so we now have full crud
functionality one thing I do want to do
here is when we for instance add a
customer and we forget the first name
and stuff and we try to submit we get a
console log all right I actually want to
use the alert component here so let's go
to our add component and we're going to
import the alert
so from dot slash alert and the
semicolons I always use semicolons but
by default when you use view CLI you can
see they don't use them so you might see
sometimes they are there and sometimes
they're not
I'll just leave it off I guess I just
want to tab that over all right so we're
bringing in the alert component and then
what we want to do is add that here in
our data so work and we want to go up
here to the top above the h1 and say
alert and we'll have the V if and the
bind so V bind message alert all right
and then down here well we have the test
and we do the console log we're going to
just change that to let's say this dot
alert and we'll set that to that text
okay save it and let's see whoops what
happened here
oh this alert
I forgot the slash okay so now if we try
to submit unknown custom element all we
got to register it we just have to add
it down here as a component so we'll go
after methods that is that in there
whatever all right so let's save that
and we'll try it again
okay submit and we get please fill in
all required fields all right when we
want to do the same thing for the Edit
so I'm just going to let's see we'll
copy this and we'll go to edit view same
thing okay we need to import it and
we're going to what else add it here and
change the console.log this dot alert
okay and then we just need to add it as
a component
okay so alert all right so let's save
that okay so if I were to get rid of
that and try to submit we get our
message good so that's all set now let's
see the last thing we need to do is just
the filter now this search filter was
much easier in viewed 1.0 because there
were predefined filters and search was
one of them so this was easier but they
took those out for some reason I don't
know if they're going to put them back
later or what's going on with it but we
have to create our own which isn't too
bad so first thing we'll do we need to
go to our customers view and we're going
to put in a fun input a text input right
below the h1 so we'll say input and
let's see we're going to give this a
class of form control and let's give it
a place holder and we'll say enter last
name okay and then we're going to give
it a V model of filter input all right
and then we're just going to put a line
break below it
all right so now we have our input okay
so we need to add that filter input in
our data that's what it's complaining
about and let's see what else we're
going to go and tie into the methods
right under fetch customers and let's
say filter by ok this is going to take
in list and value and let's say return
list dot filter and that's going to take
in a function okay inside here let's say
customer and then we just want to return
customer dot last name and we want the
index of so index of the value and then
we're going to say greater than negative
one all right and then up here where we
have the for the V for and we have
customers we're just going to wrap this
in filter by and we're also going to
pass along the filter input okay which
is whatever we're pass whatever we're
typing in the text box is going to get
passed along in here okay so let's go
ahead and save that okay so if I were to
do let's say s you'll see we get Sam
Smith now notice that if I do lower case
asks wait a minute that's not right
yeah if I do a lowercase s it's
different so what we're going to do is
as we type that in we want it to
automatically capitalize the first
letter so that it works so let's see
let's go to filter by and we're going to
say value equals value dot char at okay
we want the first character which is
zero and then we just want to call to
uppercase to uppercase and then we're
going to say value dot slice one okay so
let's see if that works we say s there
we go Smith okay T yep all right so
that's working good and we can just add
some text to the about this is a
customer manager app built with the view
J s framework
and we'll say version 1.0.0 all right
cool
so we can now create read update and
delete customers from the PHP API that
we created so we have a front end and a
back end all right so that's going to be
it I know that this video was was quick
and there was a lot of code and a lot of
information I know that some of you may
have gotten a little confused along the
way if you have any questions put them
in the comments if I can't answer them
I'm sure someone else will be able to
help you out but hopefully you enjoyed
