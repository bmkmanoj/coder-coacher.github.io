to do is create a custom joomla
QuickStart or just adding our own sample
data to a jeweler installation so
ultimately we'll have a package that you
can upload to your server go through a
standard joomla installation and choose
to install the sample data and then when
you go and visit your front end it
should look like this alright and this
site uses the JD portfolio component
from Jim digi and it has its own custom
template and we're even going to have it
configured like this alright so we have
our categories for our portfolio if we
click on one brings us to that category
which has projects we can click on a
single project and it takes us to that
project page alright so what we need to
do I'm using what
that back up here i'm using xampp for my
server so my sites are in my htdocs
folder and it's in this JD portfolio
folder so this is this is this website
alright so i'm going to create a new
folder on my desktop and we call it JD
portfolio underscore QuickStart
underscore J 30 because this is going to
be hot joomla three website three point
two point one to be specific alright so
i'm going to open this quick start
folder and I'm going to take all the
files and folders from my website
and copy them paste them in this folder
this quick start
and what we need now is a clean joomla
installation and it should be the same
version as your site that you want to
use for the quick start in my case it's
three dot-to-dot one which i've already
downloaded so i'm going to go ahead and
find that
okay so joomla three two one stable
package all right and all we need from
here is the installation folder
alright and yeah that's all we need from
there now what we want to do is delete
the configuration dot PHP file because
when you install joomla it creates that
file for you now in our Quick Start we
want to go into the installation folder
and then we want to go into SQL and then
mysql alright so here's where you can
actually see the sample data that's
offered with the default installation
okay so we need our database in this
folder so we want to go to PHP my admin
or if you're using another tool to deal
with your database to export it and so
forth that's fine too our table is JD
portfolio alright so what I want to do
is export this database you can click on
custom you want to make sure all the
tables are highlighted you want to make
sure that structure and data is selected
and
that should do it we can click to add
drop table and that's good so if we
click go it's going to give us an SQL
which i will save to my desktop alright
so let's go find that SQL file and we
want to bring it over to the
installation SQL mysql folder and we
need to change the name to match the
other ones here to say sample data
sample underscore data underscore and
then whatever you want this particular
string here this this can be whatever
you want okay I'm just going to keep it
at JD portfolio all right now there's a
few things we need to do in this in this
file okay so what we have is it's going
to create this database JD portfolio if
we leave it as is so we want to just get
rid of this joomla we'll handle that all
right and we also need to get rid of
these this prick prefix by default
joomla assigns a random prefix to its
tables and we don't want that so what we
want to do is we're going to copy that
including the underscore and go to the
top of the file and then click on search
replace and if you're not using notepad
plus plus I you probably have some kind
of replace function just look around it
could be in the Edit menu but just find
that and then we want to paste in the
prefix and we want to replace it with
the pound sign and then two underscores
alright and that will replace the prefix
during the installation alright so you
want to just click replace all we get
276 occurrences were replaced
and that looks good so now let's save
that all right so now we have our sample
data file now what we have now will work
but during the installation when when it
shows the sample data it's going to be
formatted like this sample underscore
data underscore GD portfolio and we
don't want that we want to just be a
nice string that says you know with
capitals and spaces so we can do that if
we go back into will go up two levels
into the installation folder and we want
to click on language and my default is
going to be en dash gb and then i'm
going to go to the ini file alright and
if you're hearing banging and voices in
the background I apologize it's actually
a snow day so my kids are home from
school so I just want to apologize for
that so what we want to do is go down to
about
to vote line 95 you can see we have this
language string install sample blogs so
we kind of want to just copy this and
paste it and what we're going to do is
change this blog to JD portfolio or of
course you'll change it to whatever your
files called and then we can just have a
nice string here so we'll just say JD
portfolio sample data all right so
that's basically the title now we want
the description so I'm going to copy
this and paste that in and once again
replace blog with JD portfolio and we'll
just say install joomla with install
joomla with all JD portfolio sample data
all right so that will give us a nicely
formatted string so i'll save that all
right now we again we could use what we
have now but when we get to the screen
to choose our sample data our JD
portfolio sample data is not going to be
checked by default so the user could
easily miss that so what we want to do
is make sure that it does get checked by
default so we can do that inside of the
localized xml file which is in the
installation folder alright and all we
need to do is I put in our database file
name which is sample data
the portfolio dot SQL and that should
make it selected by default all right so
you want to make sure you save that now
we should be ready to go so if we go
back to out the root of our Quick Start
folder and select everything and we want
to copy that into our in your case you
may be uploading it via FTP or maybe
what I'm doing using a local server but
we're going to go to htdocs which is my
server root and i'm going to create a
new folder and i'm just going to call it
Q s 1 and I'm going to paste a quick
start package or installation
all right now what we need to do is
create a database for our joomla site so
in PHP myadmin i'm going to create a
database called Q s1 and make sure that
that's there yep so we have an empty
database caulk us one alright so now we
want to do is go to the front end of our
site so localhost / q s 1 and it'll take
us to a jeweler installation which I'm
sure you've seen before I'm just going
to say sample quick starts add an email
username admin next
next
alright so the next thing we need to do
is fill out our database information
database name is Q s1 prefix is fine you
can leave it okay next ah so now you can
see our sample data is there and it's
chosen I'm not sure why it's not
formatted
let's go back into let's see inside of
our site q s 1 which is this site that
we're now let's go to installation
language make sure that everything is
okay so go to our any file see sample
data
all you know what this should be sample
data all right same thing with the title
or ally JD portfolio this should be
sampled data underscore all right so
we'll save that and see if we can reload
I have to go through this again
alright so now you can see that our
string is nicely formatted JD portfolio
sample data alright so let's install
this
so just remember to do the sample
underscore data alright so we'll remove
our installation directory visit our
site and cross our fingers and there it
is alright so we just installed joomla
and we have all of the sample data
component a data and template and
configuration alright so that's how you
can make your own Quick Start package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
