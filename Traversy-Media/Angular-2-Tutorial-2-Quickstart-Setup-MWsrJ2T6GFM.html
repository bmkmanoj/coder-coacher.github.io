you how to get up and running with the
angular 2 QuickStart alright so before
we get into that let's talk about what
is required you're going to need nodejs
so if you don't have that just go to
node.js org go ahead and download it and
install it
it's cross-platform you can install it
on Windows Mac or Linux and yeah so get
that installed I already have it so I'm
not going to go through it but I do have
a video on my channel on how to install
it in Windows and Linux all right so
we're also going to need get I actually
use a tool that comes with this called
git bash and it's a command line tool
and you don't need to use it you can use
the Windows command line or your
terminal whatever it is you use but I
like it it adds a little add some Linux
tools to Windows so go ahead and
download that here
you will need get to clone the
QuickStart so get that set up I already
have it installed so I'm not going to go
through it but it's just a basic
straightforward and installer you're
also going to need a text editor you
probably have a preference but if you
don't I'd suggest Adam especially with
typescript because it has a plugin that
gives you some really nice code
highlighting and stuff like that alright
so if you want to you can download that
and install it alright so now what we
need to do is go to angular dot IO and
this is the official angular website if
we click on the get started button it'll
take you to a page like this you can
click on this link right here and that's
going to take us to the angular 2
QuickStart github repository alright so
all we need to do is clone it so we can
grab this link or not this link but this
command right here copy it and then
we're going to go to wherever you want
to set up your folder mine is going to
be in a folder called projects my C
Drive so I'm going to go ahead and open
the git bash tool right here and like I
said you don't need this you could just
use your Windows command prompt or your
terminal alright and then we're just
going to paste that in and I'm just
going to change this last part my proj
my app okay we'll go ahead and run that
we should be able to go into it alright
so I'm going to open up my text editor
and we're going to add that folder to
the project okay so over here you can
see all the files that it created we
have our package JSON file if we take a
look at that you can see all the
different dependencies down here
including angular 2 we went over this in
the last video all the dependencies and
the dev dependencies alright so there's
nothing we need to do to this file what
else do we have we have our main app
folder here and this has the main app
component called app component TS
alright all of our files will have a TS
file extension now in this component I'm
not going to go over the syntax yet
we're going to do that in the next video
but everything is going to be imported
into this file ok any components we
create and then main TS just includes
the main app component and it also
includes the bootstrap function which
gets your angular 2 application boot
strapped up and running all right so
let's close those close that out in what
we'll do now is run npm install make
sure you're in the project folder and
that's going to get all of our
dependencies set up alright so that
should have created a node modules
folder here now what we'll do is just
run NPM start and what that's going to
do is it's going to compile all of our
typescript into JavaScript you can see
over here that we now have a lot more
files ok so from our app component TS it
created all these JavaScript files the
spec file the map file for debugging and
so on now if you look at the app
component J's file and you look at the
JavaScript here it's absolutely
ridiculous compared to the typescript
is this alright so I don't know if I
mentioned it but you don't have to use
typescript you could of course use
regular JavaScript but you can see that
the difference you're going to want to
go with typescript all right it's much
cleaner and much easier to understand
alright so that when I ran that npm
start it opened up this window for us
this is at localhost 3000 that's the
default address of our application and
it's running on a dependency called Lite
server and that's it that's our
application alright so we are now ready
to jump in and do some coding in the
next video we'll look at components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
