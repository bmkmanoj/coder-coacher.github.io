video I'm going to show you how to
enable and use the windows subsystem for
Linux and bash terminal on Windows 10
now I'm pretty new to this so I'm not
gonna go too in-depth I just want to
kind of show you guys how to get it set
up and running I've had a lot of
requests for it it's not something I'm
gonna say you definitely need to use but
I think it is worth looking into if
you've watched a lot of my videos you've
probably seen me use git bash quite a
bit for my terminal there's a few
reasons for that one it does everything
I need it to do it's very easy to use
most of all it's easy for other people
for for students and viewers to get set
up if they're using Windows obviously if
they're using Mac or Linux they already
have a bash terminal but if you're on
Windows you can just simply download and
install it and you're all set
it's much easier than having to go
through this whole process every time I
want to explain to them how to get bash
on windows alright but with that said
you this may work out for you you may
like it I'm not sure that I'm gonna use
it but I did want to do a tutorial on it
alright now this isn't like using cygwin
or a virtual machine or anything like
that it's an actual Linux subsystem that
runs inside of Windows 10 you have
access to the app to get package manager
you have to run sudo to run run commands
as admin it's basically just Linux on
Windows alright so I'm not advocating
for it I'm not saying use it I'm not
saying don't use it if you want to fight
amongst yourselves about what to use
that's fine if it's good or bad but this
is a completely unbiased tutorial all
right with that said let's go ahead and
get started first thing we're gonna do
is go to the settings in Windows 10 and
we're gonna go down to the update and
security icon and from here on the left
here you'll see the for developers
option we're gonna click that and we're
gonna choose developer mode alright
we're gonna say yes and if you've never
used developer mode it might take a
minute or two to get everything set up
you might see a little preloader thing
here and it might take a little bit but
it'll get set up eventually so once
that's done you just want to go to your
control panel
and go to programs and then this option
right here turn Windows Features on and
off you're gonna click that and then
scroll down to where it says windows
subsystem for linux and you want to
check that off and hit OK ok once you do
that you're gonna have to reboot your
machine or in my case my virtual machine
so I'm gonna click restart now and
they'll be back once this is restarted
all right so we have the machinery
started so now what I'm gonna do is go
down and just search for Bosch and
you're gonna see this come up Bosch run
command so I'm gonna click that and then
this window will open up and it says
that the windows subsystem for Linux has
no installed distributions so we have
the subsystem set up we just don't have
an actual Linux distribution now back
when I with this before I'm pretty sure
that a bun too came pre-installed with
it but now you actually have to install
it because there's actually multiple
distros that you can use now I think
open SUSE is one of them that may be it
or there might be more I'm not not
exactly sure but we're gonna use a bun
too so we're gonna go ahead and close
this it's basically just telling us to
visit the Windows Store and download it
so that's what we're gonna do so we'll
go ahead and go to the store Windows
Store Microsoft store whatever and we're
gonna search for Ubuntu alright so click
on it right here and we're gonna install
it obviously you'll have to login if
you're not logged into Microsoft and it
should only take a couple seconds and
you can see right here open SUSE leap
that's also available open SUSE or SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server so let's go
ahead and launch this and now you're
gonna get a window with a little bunt 2
icon that says installing me this may
take a few minutes and it will so what
I'm gonna do is just I'm gonna pause the
video and I'll be back when this is done
alright so that's all set now what's
going to
it's gonna ask us to create a new Linux
user name or a new UNIX user name and
this is completely separate from your
Windows user name so I'm just gonna say
Brad and it's going to ask us to enter a
password or create a password rather and
now we have a new UNIX user called Brad
okay so we basically are in Linux right
now we need to run sudo to use root
commands we can use the apt-get package
manager we can do pretty much anything
that you can do inside of a Linux
terminal now before we go and update our
packages and all that I just want to
talk a little bit about the system about
the filesystem so right now we're in the
user folder of the Linux subsystem by
doing LS there's nothing here it's just
empty if I do a CD slash it's gonna take
us to the root of the Linux file system
you can see we have our Etsy folder our
home folder the VAR the user the mount
now this mount this MN MNT this is where
the windows file system is located if
you're gonna do stuff to windows files
from Linux from here then you want to go
to the mount folder so CD mount and if
we take a look at what's in here there
is a C folder so this is basically a
Windows C Drive if I go LS into C I'm
sorry CD into C and then we do an LS you
can see Pro Program Files and users and
this is just the basically my C Drive
okay if I wanted to go to my eat my
Windows users folder I could say CD
users slash Brad and let's go into the
projects folder there or maybe I don't
have a projects folder let's say CD
users and CD Brad and let's see
uppercase P projects alright so from
here I could start to I could open up
angular app or client panel or any of
these these folders these applications
and I could work on them from here what
you don't want to do is work on Linux
fold or Linux files from Windows and
that's a big mistake that I made in the
first video I did a lot of you may have
seen that I deleted it because what I
did is I created inside my Linux home
directory a folder and then I opened it
inside of es code which is a Windows
tool and you don't want to do that that
can actually cause data corruption so I
deleted that because I don't want to be
responsible for corrupting anyone's data
but you don't want to do that so now
what I'm going to do is just clear this
out with ctrl L and you probably want to
update your packages and upgrades so
let's do a sudo we're gonna say sudo apt
update and put our password in whoops
what I died with two DS in there okay so
this is going to update all of our
packages once this is done we're gonna
run our upgrade command which will take
a lot longer but that'll upgrade
anything that needs to be updated
all right so now we'll clear this out
and we'll run sudo apt upgrade and we'll
say yes and this is gonna take a few
minutes so what I'm gonna do is pause
the video and I'll be back when it's
done all right guys so that is all set
that took quite a while I'd say about
maybe five six minutes or so so I'm
gonna go ahead and clear this out now we
can install stuff from our package
manager for instance if we wanted to
install a CH top which is a Linux task
manager we could go ahead and say sudo
to install and we'll say H top ok gives
us a little progress bar down at the
bottom and now we can go ahead and run
that we'll say H top and you see we have
our Linux based task manager now there's
no kernel there's no actual Linux kernel
with this subsystem so this isn't going
to show us too much it's basically
showing us the anit it's showing us that
we're running bash and it's showing us
that we're running h top but it's just
an example of showing you that we can
run Linux based programs now in Windows
alright so we're gonna go ahead and exit
that with control C and another thing we
can do easily now is SSH into servers so
if you had like a digitalocean droplet
or something like that with an IP
address you could easily SSH into it I'm
just gonna say SSH into my local host
obviously this would be a remote
connection but just for it just to show
you how easy it is and put in the
password and now we SSH into our local
host okay so it's as easy as that no
puttied anything like that and then we
could just do exit to get out of it now
if you're in just a standard Windows
command line so if I go to CMD and open
that up
all I now all I have to do is type in
bash and it will switch to bash and
you'll see now it's in it's actually in
the mount see users Brad
all right we can do whatever we want
from here now and if we want to get out
of it we can just say exit now another
thing that you can do is you can
actually integrate bash with hyper which
is just a fantastic terminal with a
whole bunch of nice plugins and themes
and you can have new tabs and all that
stuff this is just a default
installation but I'm gonna make a video
on this pretty soon but if you wanted to
use it with hyper you can see it's just
using the regular Windows command line
but if we go to edit and preferences and
we go down to where it says shell which
is right here you can see how it's empty
it actually gives you an example this
bash on windows the location is in
windows system32 bash exe so what I'll
do is just copy that and put that right
in here and we'll save it close this up
and then reload hyper and now we should
now you can see that we're actually
using bash in hyper all right so very
helpful another thing if you wanted to
use it in Visual Studio code which has
an integrated terminal which is just
awesome if we hit a control backtick
that will toggle it and you can see it
uses windows powershell by default
obviously if you're in Windows and if we
want to change that we can go to our
preferences and then settings and let's
just search for terminal and it's all
the way at the bottom here so you can
see that by default terminal integrated
shell windows is using PowerShell but
what I'm going to do is just click edit
and then copy the settings which puts it
over here and we're gonna change the
program to Windows system 32 and then
bash dot exe and save and we'll close
this up and now if I scrap this terminal
with the trash icon and then open it
again with control backtick it should
use bash ok and you can see it actually
opened it in the project I'm in which is
this angular app project which is from
my angular course and notice that it's
in the mount see
the users Brad project's folder alright
so now we have bash enabled envious code
in hyper we can install Linux tools so
there's a lot there's a lot more you can
do obviously but like I said I mean it's
up to you if you want to use this or if
you want to use something like commander
or git bash which I think is fine for
most situations especially for me as a
content creator for me is someone that
you know there are beginners that watch
that what I just did would confuse the
absolute out of them it's much
easier for me to tell them to download
get bash so just keep that in mind guys
you know when you see me not using a
tool that maybe you would use you have
to think of that that other people are
watching what I'm doing and they have to
understand it alright so that's it guys
thanks for watching hopefully you
enjoyed this video if you did please
leave it a like and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
