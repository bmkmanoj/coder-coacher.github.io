hey what's going on guys in this project
we're gonna build a complete customer
management CLI application using nodejs
and MongoDB so we'll be using three
different node modules for this one is
Mongoose which is used to interact with
MongoDB create our model and schema for
our customers will be using Commander J
s which is a complete solution for node
command line interfaces and then also a
module called Inquirer which will give
us a more elegant way to create
customers by asking the user questions
so that they can enter that data alright
so we're gonna just demo the interface
first and then we'll jump into
development alright now I am using git
bash for Windows as my command line but
you can just as well use the standard
Windows command line and if you're on
Mac or Linux you can use your standard
terminal or whatever it is you like to
use this is completely cross-platform
alright so I called this customer - CLI
so that's the name of the interface or
the application and first thing I'll do
is look at the version ok we can specify
a version which is 1 0 0 we can also
have the help option so if we say
customer CLI - - help you can see the
different options which is just version
and help and then we have our commands
so add find update remove and list you
can see we also have shortcuts as well
just one letter shortcuts and then it
will show you the parameters or the
arguments that you need for some of
these such as fine do you need to add in
a name which will search the youth the
users or the customers first and last
name and then we need an ID for the
update and remove alright so let's clear
this out I'm gonna try to do this quick
to get this this demo over with so we
can jump in so let's look at the list so
we'll say
customer CLI list and you can see that
we have four customers in the database
okay so this is all coming from MongoDB
we have the underscore ID which is added
automatically by Mongo and then we have
a first name last name phone number and
email all right now we can use our
shortcut if we want if we just do L just
like it said in the help and those in
the help command we can do L that'll do
the same thing if we want to let's say
get a specific customer then we could do
customer CLI we can either do F or we
could do find and then we could specify
a name so let's say Paul and you can see
we have one match now notice that Paul
and Sarah they both have the last name
Wilson
so if we say find Wilson it'll come back
with both of them alright now if we want
to add a customer we can do customer CLI
ad enter and then it'll take us through
these steps or these questions and this
is where inquire J s comes in so I'll go
ahead and add myself here phone number
and email alright so we get new customer
added and if we go and we do a list you
can see that there is there I am alright
now if we want to update this user what
we'll do is grab the ID and we'll say
customer CLI U or update and then paste
in the ID and it's going to take us
through the questions again so let's say
I want to change my phone number and
email will say Brad T at yahoo.com and
then if we do a list you'll see that
those fields have been updated and if I
want to do a remove I can just grab the
ID and we can say customer CLI R or
remove and then paste in the ID customer
removed and that will do a list
and you can see that that customer is
now gone so we have complete crud
functionality along with listing out all
the customers all right so that's what
we'll be building guys now it's not
exactly beginner tutorial if you if you
don't know anything about no js' or
Mongo you probably struggle a little bit
but I will do my best to explain
everything I can if you guys have taken
my ojs Mongo
dev to development course on udemy you
should have no issues at all with the
mongoose and the models part it's
actually really easy much less than what
we did in the course but yes so I'll do
my best to explain everything and like I
said it's cross-platform doesn't matter
what system you're on so let's go ahead
and get started all right so we're gonna
start from scratch here now I have my
Visual Studio code text editor open with
in a folder called customer - CLI which
is completely empty I also have my
integrated terminal open down here which
you can open from view integrated
terminal or you can just toggle it with
control tilde all right now notice I do
have git bash as my terminal the default
is PowerShell on Windows if you want to
use git bash you of course have to
install it and then you can just go to
preferences settings and then just add
this line right here pointing to your
bash Exe file and if you're on Mac or
Linux don't worry about it just use the
default terminal it's down here alright
so one thing I want to mention is that
I'm already installed MongoDB locally if
you're on Windows and you need help
installing it take a look at the MongoDB
in 30 minutes video on my youtube
channel if you're on Mac or Linux
there's plenty of other tutorials out
there to get it set up locally it's
really easy you could even use a remote
instance from something like M lab
alright so first thing we're gonna do is
just like we do with all node
applications is we're going to run NPM
in it and that's going to take us
through ask us some questions so package
name customer CLI is good version is
good description I'm gonna say customer
management CLI not SLI CLI
index J s that's fine and then I'm just
going to enter through the rest all
right so that's our package dot jason
really simple it's clear this
out-of-control hell and we're going to
install our dependencies okay so we need
three modules so we're gonna say npm
install now if you're using NPM 5:00 or
later you don't have to specify - - save
to save your dependencies but I like to
do it anyways just for people that are
using older versions and then we're
going to install Mongoose which is an
ORM that helps us interact with MongoDB
we're going to install commander ok
which it gives us a whole bunch of
things to do with the command line
interface and then we also want enquirer
what is a qu IR er all right so let's
install those three things and those
should pop up in our package JSON file
alright so now that we have those
installed we can close this up we will
be adding a couple more things later but
we don't need this right now so we'll
close it up so now we're going to create
our index dot JSP alright now this is
where we're gonna put all of our our
methods that are going to interact with
mongoose with our model so add customer
find customer remove customer all those
are going to go in this file although
we're gonna create a separate models
file for the schema for the customer
schema alright so we are going to
connect to mongoose through here or
connect to MongoDB using Mongoose so
let's bring in mongoose set that to
require mongoose right and we're gonna
connect to DB
so we want to create a variable here
called EB and I'm going to set this to
Mongoose dot connect and then we want to
pass in the location of our database so
like I said before you could use a
remote database from like M lab and you
could just stick that URL in here we're
using a local URL which is gonna be
MongoDB : / / localhost and then the
default port for Mongo is 2 7 0 1 7 and
then we want to put our database name
which I'm going to call client not
client customer or CLI alright and it'll
create the database automatically don't
worry about creating it somewhere else
alright now if we just leave it like
this we're gonna get a warning so you
want to put an extra parameter in here
of an object and you just want to
specify use Mongo client and set that to
true all right otherwise you're going to
get a warning thrown now you're also
gonna get a warning for a mongoose
promises which are deprecated so what we
need to do is map them to the global
promise so let's say map global promise
and this will get rid of warning so all
we have to do is say Mongoose dot
promise equals global dot promise all
right and that'll get rid of the stupid
warning all right so now we want to do
we'll save this file and now we want to
create our model now you could put your
your model and your schema in this file
but I think it's neater to put it
elsewhere so let's create a folder
called models and then inside models
we'll create a file called customer dot
j s and this is actually going to be
really simple so we're gonna bring in
Mongoose and set this to require
Mongoose alright then we just want to
set a schema for our customer so let's
say customers
for that we'll create a variable called
customer schema and we're gonna set it
to Mongoose dot schema okay and then
we're gonna put in some curly braces and
let's specify a first name okay that's
gonna be a type of string all right and
then we're gonna have a last name also a
type of string what else we're going to
do phone and then we're going to do
email okay so that's our schema now all
we have to do is export it so that we
can use it in other files or define and
export
so we'll say module dot exports set that
equal to Mongoose dot model and we want
to pass in the model name which is gonna
be customer and then we want to specify
in this specify the schema name which is
customer schema okay and that's it we
can save that so what we've done is we
brought in Mongoose we define our schema
with these the particular fields and
then we created the model and exported
it alright so now we want to bring that
model into index J s all right so we'll
say import model create a variable
called customer and set that to require
and we want to require dot slash models
want to go in the models folder and then
customer okay you don't need to specify
that the dot J S so now that we have our
model we want to create a couple
functions so let's say add customer so
we'll create that will also create fine
customer
okay and then once we do that we'll
start to work with commander I'm not
going to do all of the methods first I
just want to make sure that we can
actually use commander and then we'll
move on to do the remove and the update
and all that all right so we're gonna go
ahead and create a Const called add
customer
okay we're using function expression
here now I'm using arrow functions I'm
keeping this you know as es6 as I can so
instead of saying function like that
we're just going to put in some
parentheses this is going to take in a
customer and then we're gonna put an
arrow function all right and then here
we want to take that customer model and
call the create method which is part of
Mongoose okay and we want to pass in the
customer and then that's gonna return a
promise now when you want to get that
response from a promise you use dot then
okay and then in here it'll give us the
customer and then we'll set that to an
arrow function all right so all I want
to do here is just log to the console
I'm actually going to do console dot
info and then in here we'll say new new
customer added all right and then we
need to close the database so DB closed
if you don't do that it's gonna hang so
make sure you add that so that's add
customer now for fine customer we're
gonna again create a variable called
find customer set it to an arrow
function now find is going to take in a
name it needs a name to find and we're
gonna set that to an arrow lips and
inside here before we do anything what I
want to do is I want to make this case
insensitive okay now the reason I'm
doing this is because let's say we have
a first name of John that's capital Jo
HN
I know find lowercase
this I mean there's a few ways you can
do it but I'm gonna add a search
variable here set it to we're gonna use
the Reg XP constructor so new reg XP so
regular expression this is part of
native JavaScript and we're gonna pass
in the name which is this variable here
and then just specify that we want it to
be case insensitive and we do that with
a lowercase I
okay so that way you know lower case
John or upper case John doesn't matter
so now what we want to do is take the
customer model and call find and with
find we want to pass in here some curly
braces and we want to use money sign or
because we're looking for we're looking
at two different fields
okay we're searching this name should be
searched in the first name and the last
name our first name or the last name so
we'll put a colon and then we need to
open up a set of brackets okay and then
inside these brackets we're gonna put a
set of curly braces and we're gonna say
first name so first name search
basically we're gonna say you know is
whatever is in this search does it match
any any of the first names and then
we'll put a comma here and we want to do
the same thing with last name so last
name search just like that alright and
again it's going to return a promise so
I'm going to go on the next line and do
the dot then and it's gonna give us
customer will set that oops so we'll set
that to arrow function and then we'll
say console dot info and we just want to
basically just log the customer and then
we also want to log the number of
matches
so we'll say console dot info and I'm
gonna put a template string in here so
I'm going to use back ticks which is to
the left of the number one key this way
we can put expressions in here or
variables with this syntax and we can
say customer
length and then we'll just say the word
matches so it'll be you know one match
is two matches whatever and then we just
need to be sure to close the database
all right so that's our fine customer
now before we do the update and remove
and all that I want to test everything
out with just the ad and find so let's
go ahead and export these methods so
we're gonna say module dot exports
equals equals a set of curly braces and
then we want add customer and find
customer all right so that's our index J
S for now now we want to create a new
file called commands J s and this is
where we're going to use commander so if
we look at the documentation okay so we
already installed it now we want to
bring it in we want to create a variable
called program set it to require
commander now this up here we're going
to add later on when we want this to
actually be a shell command for now
we're just gonna use node command J s
and then and then put our commander
stuff you know add or remove or whatever
and we'll do this towards the end but
basically we want to set the program we
can set the version and then when we
want to create a command we just need to
do dot command put in what we want is a
command any parameters and then the
action okay whenever we want the action
to be so that's the the basic format of
of how this works
so let's first bring in commander so
we'll say Const program equals require
commander
okay and then we're also gonna bring in
the functions from the index file so add
customer and find customer so that's
gonna be whoops that's gonna be from the
index which is dot slash index okay and
then we're going to take program go on a
separate line and say dot version so
this is going to be version 1.0.0 and
then we can also put in the description
if we want so that's gonna be client
management system
okay now I'm not going to create the
commands just yet I want to just test it
out make sure we can actually run it so
at the bottom here we're just gonna say
program dot parse and you want to pass
in this argv like that all right so
let's save and now down here I'm going
to clear this out and we're gonna run
node commands dot J s dash dash version
alright so it looks like we have an
error let's see
Harvey's not defined program dot parse
what am I missing here oh it should be
I'm sorry process dot Arg V all right so
let's try this again
and we get one point zero zero good so
it's reading our version so now what we
want to do is start to add our commands
so the first command we're going to add
is actually add so let's say program
program dot command
so it's going to be ad now later on
we're gonna implement Enquirer where we
can just to you know add and then it'll
ask us all those questions but for now
we're gonna have to put the data in with
the command so we're gonna have the
first name first name and then a space
last name space phone and email all
right so that's our command we can also
have an alias which is going to be just
a alright we can also have a description
for each command so description will be
add a customer and then we want the
action okay so for the action I'm gonna
put in a function I mean you could do
function but I'm gonna use an arrow so
I'm gonna put another set of parentheses
and then we'll put in our first name
last name phone email alright and then
we're gonna set an arrow function here
like that and then what we want to do is
call this add customer function that's
in our index file okay and that will
work with Mongoose and that will
actually insert a user into the database
so let's say add customer and pate and
put in first name last name phone and
email okay and that actually you know
what this should be in curly braces like
that alright so that is our add command
now let's do what the find so will go
right under it and we'll say program dot
command
it's gonna be find and then the only
parameter this needs is name okay so we
want name let's see alias is going to be
F and then description so description
will say find a customer and then the
action so let's see for the action we're
just gonna say name and set that to an
arrow function to call find a name or
I'm sorry find customer and then pass in
the name just like that alright so let's
save it and let's go down here and I'll
clear this out and we're gonna try to
add a customer so we'll say node
commands dot J s add and let's say John
Doe the phone number and the email and
enter and we get new customer added
alright so now let's do the find so we
should be able to do node commands dot J
s find and then let's say you'll say
John and there he is alright if we try
to find something that's not there like
Steve we're gonna get zero matches
alright so those commands are working so
now we're gonna move on now before we
actually do the updates and things like
that you remove or the list I want to
make I want to make the add command more
user-friendly instead of just putting it
all in one line like this I want to use
enquirer so that we can be asked some
questions so what we're going to do is
go up to the top of commands J s and
we're gonna go right here and bring in
we're actually gonna put some curly
braces here and say prompt
and set that to require inquire what is
it re are so we're bringing in Enquirer
and then we just want to add we want to
create an array of questions alright so
we're gonna put this right here
so we'll say customer questions so const
questions equals an array and then we're
gonna have a bunch of objects here first
will be a type it's gonna be an input
it'll have a name this one will be first
name and it's gonna have a message and
this is what the user sees so we'll say
customer first name okay so that's for
the first field now what we'll do I'll
put a comma here and we'll copy this and
paste it in three more times get rid of
that last comma and then this is going
to be last name and we'll say customer
last name this will be phone this will
be customer
phone number and then this will be email
alright and we'll say customer email
address so those are our questions now
we can do is go to our ad command and
I'm gonna what I'll do is comment this
out just so you guys have it and then
put the new one in under it so program
command now instead of ad and then all
that stuff where it's just gonna be ad
alright and we put our alias which will
be a we'll put our description which
will be add a customer and then for
action let's see so for action we're
gonna put an arrow function no no
parameters so just an empty set of
parentheses and then an arrow and then
side here we're gonna say prompt pass in
questions and then that's gonna give us
a promise so we'll say dot then and then
that'll give us answers back and we want
to set that to an arrow function
actually since it's one line we don't
even have to use curly braces we can
just say add customer and then pass in
the answers like that alright so that
looks a lot cleaner it also looks a lot
cleaner on the front end on the in the
interface so let's give that a shot
we'll save I don't think there's
anything else we have to do it should
work so let's clear this out and let's
say node commands dot J s ad ok so
customer first name let's say I don't
know Nate we'll say Smith for the last
name phone number
email will say Nate at gmail.com and new
customer added so now let's see if we
can find Nate
so we'll do command J S find Nate and
there is all right so I'm a much more
elegant way to add customers so now
we're gonna head back to index J s and
finish up these methods we want to be
able to update a customer so for that
will say cons update customer equals and
then this is gonna take in the
underscore ID field and then customer
okay we'll set that to an arrow and
we'll take the customer model and call
update that's gonna take in curly brace
and then it's going to be underscore ID
and then it's gonna take in the customer
okay so it needs to know which one to
update that's what the ID is for and
then customer is the data all right and
then that'll give us a promise so we'll
say dot then and inside here it'll give
us a customer and set that to an arrow
function and do console dot info let the
user know that the customer has been
updated and then we'll close the
database all right so that's update
customer now we're gonna do remove
customer which is very similar so what
I'll do is just copy this paste it in
say remove customer change this to
remove and then that's just gonna take
in the ID not the customer doesn't need
any data because it's just removing it
and then we're gonna call customer dot
remove all right and then again that
just takes in the ID gives us a promise
back with the customer that was removed
we're gonna log customer removed and
then close the database all right and
then the last one we want is to list all
customers
so we'll say Const list customers equals
arrow function and we're gonna do
customer dot find okay no parameters
because we want them all it's gonna
return a promise inside here we're gonna
get all of our customers as a response
and then what we want to do is just
console dot info oops
console info all the customers okay
and then we'll also do the length put in
the template string here customers dot
length matches
all right and then actually put will do
customers and then we just want to do DB
dot close okay so that should be it now
we just need to export these methods
that we just created so it's a update
customer remove customer and list
customers save that let's go back to our
commands file and let's import those so
update customer remove and list all
right so now that we brought those in we
want to create the rest of our commands
so we're going to go down to the down
here you should probably put comments
say add command
all right so let's see
you know what I'll do is for the update
I'm gonna copy the ad like that actually
we want the program as well and then
we'll paste that in and we're gonna
change let's see let's tab this over
let's change this to update change the
alias to you change the description and
then for the action we're gonna do
prompt again because we want it we want
the questions again and then we're going
to get the answers and then instead of
calling the add customer we want to call
update customer and just pass in the ID
now the ID is gonna come in as a
parameter right here so we'll go like
that and then update customers or
customer answer we actually want the ID
first
so underscore ID like that because if we
look at index dot JSP ID first and then
the customer so we want to make sure
that we do that in the correct order all
right so that is the update so let's
save that we can actually test it out so
we'll go down here and let's do node
command j/s update and then we need an
ID so let's see let's do a fine first
just so we can get the ID so we'll find
John we'll grab his ID do a ctrl C here
and then we'll do update paste that in
okay so let's just change them to Tom
Doe
okay all right so we got an error here
ID is not defined let's see alright so
it looks like we have an Arab I think
inside of our update customer oh
actually no it's not there it's in
commands right here in the action this
should have actually taken in underscore
ID like that all right we actually don't
if you if you only have one if you only
have one parameter here you don't even
need the parentheses you can just do it
like that so let's try that again so
clear that out we'll try the update so
tom doe okay
customer updated and now we'll do a find
let's do find John first okay no matches
let's do find Tom and there we go so
we're able to update all right so now we
want to do the remove okay we already
have the the removed customer in the
index file now we need to add the
command so for this I'm gonna copy the
find okay let's tab that over we'll say
remove command and we need to do remove
and that's gonna also take in an ID
underscore ID alias will be our
description will be remove a customer
and then for the action it's gonna have
the underscore ID and then it's gonna
call remove customer which takes in an
ID alright and that should do it so
let's save and let's go down here let's
let's add one to remove first so we'll
do node commands j/s add let's just say
test test
okay so new customer added and now if we
did a find for test okay there way it
there is let's grab his ID copy that
and then we'll do J s remove and then
paste in the ID run it customer removed
so now let's do the find again for test
and it's gone alright so we now have
complete complete crud functionality the
last thing I want to do is I want to be
able to list out all of the customers so
we need to add that let's see I'll just
copy this this will be the list command
okay whoops didn't mean to tell all that
all right so let's come in this sort of
a list we don't need any parameters and
then the alias will just be L
description and then the action is just
gonna be empty parameters and then we're
gonna call list customers okay and
there's no parameters in there alright
so let's save let's go down here clear
it out and we'll do node command J s
list and there we go so we have Tom and
Nate to customers so everything is
working as far as our CLI our
application our functions our database
everything is is perfect now what we
want to do is make this an actual shell
command instead of and you know having
to do node command J s from this
directory that's not that's not what we
want so to do that let's see we need to
first add this
line right here this user bin env node
we need to grab that and we need to put
that at the beginning of our commands
files so let's go to commands J s and go
to the very top and paste that in and
save alright and then once we do that we
just need to go to our package dot JSON
file and we need to add let's see we're
gonna go right above where scripts are
and we're gonna put in prefer global and
we're gonna set that to true and then we
also want to set bin and we want to set
that to our commands file ok so dot
slash commands dot JSP sure you put a
comma there alright so basically when we
call the name of our application which
is customer CLI it's gonna call node
commands dot j j s alright and it's
gonna be global so we can access it from
anywhere so let's save this and now the
very last thing we need to do is create
a symlink
and that's very easy all we have to do
is say NPM link ok so now we should be
able to call customer CLI for our
interface now if you want to unlink it
you can just do NPM unlink ok and it
won't work anymore so let's go ahead and
do our final test I could do it down
here but I'm just gonna open up a new
git bash window that's not that's not
inside of our project folder and let's
go ahead and run customer - CLI version
ok we get our version number let's do
the help we get our help page let's do a
list
okay that lists our clients here our
customers let's do a find
so we'll say find Nate okay we get Nate
let's go ahead and add so will do see Li
we can do ad or we can just do a and
we'll add say Jack I'll do Jack Williams
phone number email alright so if we do a
list again and you can see Jack's been
added good all right so if we want to
update let's copy Jack's ID and we'll do
you and then paste in the ID and we'll
change them to oh it's to jail last name
will do Williams
phone number email okay so let's do a
list again and now Jack has turned to
jail good so now for delete or remove
we'll grab the ID of Jill and we'll do
our and then paste in the ID removed
let's do a list and now we only have two
customers all right so everything is
working perfectly so that's it guys
