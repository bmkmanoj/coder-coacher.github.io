ion exceed ease in the last video we
went ahead and added some markup here
added some JavaScript components so the
nav bar the view and we also created a
template for - duze alright and we also
created a router and we're routing to
these home page to our - duze template
and our to do is controller so what I
want to do now is we want to add an
input so that we can start to add - duze
alright we haven't set up our database
yet but we'll get to that after all
right so if we look at the documentation
here under CSS components and then forms
you'll see a bunch of different styles
of form all right I'm going to just use
this placeholder label form so I'm gonna
grab this code here and we're gonna put
this right inside of our to do is
controller
alright so paste that in okay I'm gonna
get rid of this name here and we
actually only need one of these so let's
get rid of that and that okay so - duze
controller we're gonna change the
placeholder - we'll just say add to do
now we also want to put in an NG model
directive and that's really important
okay that's what's gonna bind bind our
data so this is gonna be let's call it
let's call it name okay that's the to-do
name so let's see let's save that and
look at our application let's see why
don't we oh we're getting Bob because we
actually have we actually have data
bound to the name which is right here so
let's get rid of that alright so now we
get add to do so now under the label
we'll put a button and I'm gonna put
that in a div
so we're gonna give this a class couple
classes we want item button button block
and let's do buttons stable okay and
we're gonna need a few other attributes
so let's say ng model and we'll say add
to do
BTN we're also gonna want ng disable and
what that will do is it'll make it so
that if we don't if we don't have it to
do in here if we don't have any
characters in here then the button won't
work all right so all we have to do is
say not name okay if it doesn't have a
name and then finally we want ng click
okay so when the button is clicked we
want to call a function called
save to do which will create a second
alright so let's go ahead and that and
let's see did I do an ending div I don't
think so
alright so let's save that actually we
need to put our text in here we'll say
save okay so there's a button now wait a
minute I shouldn't be able to click that
ng disable all it's disabled all right
so now you can see I can't click it if I
go ahead and add something in here then
I can okay so what we want to do now is
create this safe to do function so let's
go back to our controller and we're
going to say scope dot Save to do is
going to equal a function alright and
for now we're just going to console dot
log all right and let's console dot log
scope dot name okay so we'll save that
and we'll type in something save and
down here you can see it's console
logging something
so since we gave this an NG model of
name we can access it with scope dot
name from within here now in order for
us to save this we're gonna have to have
some kind of database solution and
that's where firebase comes in all right
so what we're gonna do is go to firebase
comm and if you don't have an account
just go ahead and sign up it's free and
then log in okay once you log in you'll
see something like this and what I'm
gonna do is create a new database or a
new app and let's call it I'm gonna call
it my two dudes dev all right actually
gonna call it might - duze because that
doesn't have to be unique but this does
the app URL so you won't be able to use
this just use something else and then
you can see the URL full URL down here
so we'll click create new app alright
and now we can click manage app and
that'll take us to our interface okay so
when we have data you'll see it here
right now it's empty obviously but we're
gonna fix that so let's go back and what
we're gonna do is create something
called a service to interact with
firebase but before we do that we need
to install something called angular fire
alright so let's go ahead and stop this
ctrl C and we're gonna say npm install
angular fire and we're gonna add this
save just like that okay so what we want
to do now is you can see in our node
modules we have this angular fire folder
we're actually gonna have to take some
files out of there and put them into our
j/s folder so i'm gonna open that in
windows let's see my to do is node
modules angular fire dist and we're
gonna want to grab this copy it and
we're gonna put that right in our j s
okay now we also have folder called
firebase and we're gonna grab this
firebase web KS file copy that and put
it inside of our J's folder okay so now
we have to reference these in our index
page okay so we want to put these let's
save it right here okay so this is gonna
be J s slash firebase web dot J s and
then this one will be angularfire oops
alright just like that we're also going
to create a JavaScript file called
services and that's going to go right
above the controllers alright so let's
create that now to create a service
we're gonna say app dot factory and
we're going to call this to do service
ok put in a function and this is going
to take in firebase array all right and
then what we need to do is create a
reference to our firebase database so we
can say new firebase and then we need to
put in the URL which is this right here
well that's not this is the wrong
database I need this one
okay so we'll grab this okay just like
that now what we need to do is create a
variable called two dues and let's set
that to firebase array and then we just
want to pass in that reference okay now
we'll create a variable called to do
service and set that to an object I'll
say all and what that's going to do is
just going to return all of our two dues
all right and then we also want a get
function so for this this is going to
take in an ID so I'll say to do ID and
then we're going to return to dues dot
dollar sign get record okay this is just
part of the firebase API and then we
just want to pass in our to-do ID all
right and then finally we want to return
the service so we'll save that and that
should do it let's close it now what we
need to do is let's go to our app J s
and we're going to have to inject the
firebase dependency all right so when we
create our main module here we need to
have all of our dependencies of course
we have ionic and now we need firebase
alright so we'll save that and go back
to controllers and we need to add a few
things here as well so we want firebase
array
we also want state and then we want the
service that we created so we're gonna
say to do service now we'll go back to
our safe to do and what we'll do is
we'll say scope dot new to do is gonna
equal to do service dot all all right
because remember all is gonna just
return all of the two dues back to us
all right
then we're gonna say scope dot new to do
dot dollar sign add and let's say name
and that's gonna be sculpting so
whatever we type in all right and then
we'll simply just redirect to our to do
state so state dot go to dues all right
so let's save that and let's see what
happens okay I'm gonna just reload here
whoops
oh we're not running in you have to run
ionic serve
all right so it looks like we're getting
some kind of issue let's look at the
console
let's see feel to instantiate my two
dues module firebase is not available
Oh some reason we have angularfire jsj
yes what do they do
oh okay I'm sure you guys saw that a
while ago all right so another thing you
guys are gonna want to do is in our
routes we have our home router or - dues
but we also want to we also want to say
if it's not if we go to a page or URL
that's not the home and that's not in
here then we need to specify where we
want it to go so we're gonna say URL
router provider dot otherwise and then
we're gonna pass in slash alright save
that okay so this error down here
modules not too fine I'm not exactly
sure what that means but it doesn't have
any effect on the application so don't
worry about it so let's go ahead and try
to add something here let's say go to
dinner and save okay so we saved it now
we don't have any functionality to
actually show let's do so let's go to
our firebase and you can see we have go
to dinner all right
what I would like however is for this to
clear once we submit it so let's do that
in our controller here let's see we're
gonna set scope
what is it scope dot name I'm going to
set that to nothing
okay so if we go ahead and add let's say
pick up kids save and then it disappears
good all right and if we go look here we
have pick up kids oh I must have
submitted a blank one let's get rid of
that okay so in the next video we're
gonna make it so that we can actually
fetch these and display them in our
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
