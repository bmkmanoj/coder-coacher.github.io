you how to install bash and get onto a
Windows 7 computer it's pretty easy it
used to be really difficult to use tools
like git and other unix space tools and
windows but now we have software that
allows us to do that pretty easily so
what you want to do is go to I believe
it's get - SCM comm alright so down here
you can see it explains what it is and
then here you see this download for
Windows button and we want to download
that the current version at this time
which is January of 2014 is one point
eight point five point two there is a
GUI version that you could use ah but
I've actually never used that the
command line version is supposedly
easier especially if you have experience
in linux and another command line
software so let's open that up
and it just installs like any other
Windows software I'm just going to keep
it in the default directory ah let's see
we'll add it to the desktop and I'm
going to leave the rest as is now here
you can make a decision if you want to
use git bash only or if you want to be
able to run it from the windows command
prompt and then you have the option to
run git and included UNIX tools from the
Windows command prompt and that's what
I'm going to choose here I want as much
Unix Linux based functionality as I can
get on this Windows machine and see this
check out as is alright so we're just
going to leave this as the default
all right so now it's installed we can
finish and we should have an icon on the
desktop we click on that it brings us
right to our home directory and we can
use unix commands like LS to list our
files all right so here is the users
folder all right so you can basically do
let's just create create a folder for
the hell of it let's go back into if we
do just a CD that brings us back to our
home folder all right and let's see well
create a file with touch say test dot
txt and if we list our files you can see
that it's right here
test.txt let's let's remove that or
rename it you can do that with mV test
txt and we'll rename it to test - dot
txt
ah can I test
oh I said test dot text all right sorry
about that
txt txt all right if we look it's test2
we can remove it with RM all right so
you can work just just like as if you
were in a shell on a Linux system now
back to get the first thing you want to
do when you download get is you want to
set the configuration you want to set
your username well your name and your
password so we can do this with I get
config and then we want to add the
global flag and then user dot name and
in these quotes you just want to put
your name alright so that does that now
if we go go back let's change this to
email
and then you just want to enter your
email address okay all right so that
sets the the global configuration and
you can also set your default editor we
can do that with get config global poor
dot editor and I'm on Windows so I'm
just going to say notepad all right now
if we want to check all of our config
options we can say git config list all
right you can see all of our options
here we have the editor which is notepad
we have my name and email we have some
email options s SMTP server options SSL
things like that none of these are
really that important to us right now
this is just an introduction video we
can also check on specific things with
get config and then we can say user dot
name and that will just give us our user
name all right so that's it really
I'll follow up this video with a video
on how to create a repository I will
create a local repository as well as a
remote posit or e on github and I'll
show you how to
do commit and push it to the remote
repository and things like that so
