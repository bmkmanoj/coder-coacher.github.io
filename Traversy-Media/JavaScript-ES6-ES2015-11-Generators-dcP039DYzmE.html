look at generators in es6 so generators
are basically functions that can be
paused and then resumed as many times as
we'd like and it can at each pause it
can yield a value back okay much like it
would return except it's just paused you
could resume it then you could revealed
another value back so let's take a look
at this okay so to create a generator
it's very similar to creating a function
let's say G 1 now the way that we can
turn this into a generator is by putting
an asterisk character right here and you
can actually do that or you could put it
here I prefer this method but of course
it's just preference now what I want to
do is let's go ahead and console dot log
and we'll say I don't I'll say hello and
then what we'll do is yield ok we'll say
yield will say yield 1 ran alright and
then we'll go back and we'll say console
dot log and we'll put in world and then
we'll do yield yield 2 ran okay so down
here if I just go ahead and say G 1 and
try to run that we get nothing all right
what we need to do is set this generator
to a variable so we'll say VAR g equals
g 1 okay and then we what we want to do
is use it we can say console dot log and
we want to say g dot next okay let's see
what that gives us actually I'm sorry we
need parentheses
okay so it gives us hello because we're
console logging it and then this is what
it's yielding okay it's yielding an
object with two elements we have a value
which is whatever we put in the quotes
and then we also have done which is a
boolean it's either going to be true or
false so since this is the first yield
it's not done okay done is going to be
false now if we want to return just the
value of course we can just say dot
value and if we reload then we just get
whatever the text is that we yielded all
right now for it to resume because right
now it's paused in this spot for it to
resume we need to do this again okay
we'll paste this in I'm going to get rid
of the value first and let's go ahead
and reload and now we get value which is
yield two ran and we still get done as
false all right even though we're at the
end here we're still getting false so
what we need to do in order for it not
to be false is we need to return
something
I will just say returned all right if we
save it and reload we're going to get
the same thing it's still not false we
have to actually do it one more time for
it to be done reload and now you can see
it actually gives us the returned value
and it also sets done to true all right
and of course we can just put the values
here if we want okay so there we go
where we're returning multiple values
from one function now not only can we do
this but we can also use this as an
iterator and we can use a for of loop so
for instance let's do I will say for and
then we're going to put in here we'll
say let G of Jen
all right actually let's say let G of
I'm sorry we want to say let Val or
whatever you want to call it of G okay
this variable should be the second value
here or the second element and then in
here let's do consult log and let's log
Val okay so you can see now it's giving
us hello yield one ran world yield two
ran okay it's not going to give us the
return value if we're using a for of
loop now there's other obviously other
things you can do with generators and
iterators but I'm not going to get into
that now this is kind of an introduction
to two es6 so that's going to be it for
now and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
