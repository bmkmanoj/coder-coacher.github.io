going to be the last video aside from a
deployment video which I'll probably do
next week or something but what I want
to do is add file uploading to our posts
ok so right now if we go to our
dashboard and we go to create post I
want to put a file upload here alright
so we're going to go to our form our
create form which is create blade and
we're going to go right right above the
submit here and let's create a div
create a form Group div and we want a
file field here so we're going to use
our laravel collective package here and
say form file and then just we just need
the name and we're going to call it
cover image cover underscore image now
whenever you submit a file this is just
a general rule you need to have an ink
type attribute in the form and you set
it to multi-part form data so let's go
right after the post here and put a
comma and then we're going to add an
attribute of ink type and we want to set
that to multi-part slash data and save
alright and that should give us a file
upload button alright now if we
submitted it's not going to it's not
going to do anything it's just the UI so
we need to handle this now before we get
into that we need to add another another
column to the post table all right so we
need a cover image column so we're going
to create another migration so let's go
to so you're just going to open up the
terminal here and let's say PHP artisan
and we're going to do make migration and
then we're going to call it ad we'll say
add cover image 2
who posts alright and then we'll go into
the migrations folder and we'll open
that file up you can close this now and
we're going to do the same thing we did
with the add user ID we're going to add
the schema table thing here and then
instead of integer it's going to be
string and then this is going to be
cover image because when we will me up
when we submit our form two things have
to happen one we need to save the name
of the image to the database so that we
can access it later on and display it
and we also need to upload the actual
file so that it knows where to look for
it all right so let's add that and then
we'll just copy that put it in the down
and then we just want to do drop column
so let's go ahead and save that and then
we just need to run migrate so we'll do
PHP artisan migrate and now if we look
at our database reload Post table and we
have a cover image now what I'm going to
do is just delete all of the previous
posts so I'm just going to do that from
here just to make it easier so we'll
just say delete yes and now we shouldn't
have any posts for anybody so if we go
to blog there's no post found all right
now let's handle the actual upload so
we're going to get out of the migration
files here and we're going to go to the
controller post controller and you know
that it submits to store so right here
this is where the form submits to and we
can actually add a validation for our
image so we call the cover image and
we're going to set this to image meaning
that it has to it the file has to be an
image it has to be a JPEG or a PNG or
gif gif whatever the hell but we also
want it to be optional we don't want the
user to have to be able to upload the
image so we're also going to add
nullable alright and then we also want
to map
sighs and I'm going to set this to 1999
and the reason for that is with a lot of
Apache servers the default upload size
is 2 megabytes alright so if if we don't
set this there's a good chance that
they'll try to upload us a bigger image
and it's going to just throw an error so
we're just going to set a max of 1999
okay which is just under 2 megabytes and
then down here we have to do a few
things so it's a handle handle file
upload alright so we'll have an if
statement here and let's say if request
has file and then the name of the image
which is going to be cover image so it's
going to check to see if it was actually
uploaded if the person actually click
Choose file and selected something and
then we want it else all right now if
they didn't then we're going to create a
variable here called filename to store
and we're just going to set it to a
static title called no image dot JPEG so
basically if they don't upload an image
it's going to look at this default image
and use that in the posts okay and you
can set this up differently if you don't
want to have an image or something like
that now when they if they do submit it
there's quite a bit we need to do and
I'm going to show you how to get a file
name with the extension so let's create
a variable called filename with ext and
we'll set that to request file
cover image alright so this will put the
exact filename if it's like my image
JPEG or my image dot PNG this will get
that for you and you can proceed to add
to add that to the database if you want
you could you could call it file name to
store and then just keep going down here
and submit it but if someone else
uploads an image with the same name then
you're going to have an issue so it's
not a good idea to actually use this so
what we're going to do is separate it
we're going to get I will say get just
file name and then down here we'll do
get just extension all right so let's
create a variable called file name and
to get that oh you know what I forgot
one thing here we actually have to set
this to get client original image and I
know these are really long it makes it
look more confusing than it really is so
that gets the original whole file name
with extension so here what we're going
to do is set this to cap info which is a
function and we're going to pass in the
file name with extension and this is
just path info this is just PHP this has
nothing to do with laravel we're
basically just extracting the name
without the extension all right and then
we just want to then put in here path
info underscore file name okay and this
is just using PHP again it's just going
to get the name now to get the extension
so extension equals and we're going to
use laravel for that so request file
cover image and then we're going to do
get original get original client and I
think it's let me just check real quick
extension
okay so I don't believe laravel has
something that will just get the file
name that's why we just use PAP info
here all right so now we're going to
create the file name to store and we're
going to do that by setting a variable
filename to store just like we did right
down here and we're going to set that to
the file name okay just the file name
and then we're going to concatenate on
to that underscore and then the
timestamp okay so we use the time
function and then we're going to
concatenate on to that a dot and then
the extension so we have to say dot
extension so what this will do is it'll
call it the original file name
underscore and then a timestamp which
makes the file name completely unique so
that if someone else uploads one with
the same name it'll it's not going to
overwrite anything or anything like that
all right hopefully that makes sense
and then finally we just want to upload
the image so to do that we're going to
set a variable called path to request
file cover image and then we're going to
say store as and then in here we're
going to do public slash cover
underscore images we're going to create
this folder alright if it's not created
and then this is going to have a second
parameter of the file name which is
going to be filename to store and that
should upload the image so let me try to
explain about the paths so when we do
this when we say store is public cover
images it's going to go to it's going to
go let me just close these it's going to
go to resources and then it's going to
go to now not resources I'm sorry
storage and then app public and it's
going to
discover images inside here in the
public folder now this isn't accessible
accessible through the browser so we're
not going to be able to load the image
what we're going to do is set something
called a symlink to the public folder
and then it's going to create a storage
folder in the public folder and to do
that we just have to want run one simple
command alright so let's open up our
shell prom what is this terminal and all
we have to do is say PHP artisan storage
colon link and says it's been linked and
now if you look in public there's
actually a folder called storage so
whatever we put into the storage here is
going to actually going to show up there
as well for us to use in our website
hopefully that makes sense now down here
when we actually save to the database we
want to add post cover image and we're
going to set that equal to file name to
store so it's either going to be no
image or it's going to be the the image
with the timestamp so let's actually try
to sell we'll save it and let's go to
dashboard create post and let's call
this post one we'll say this is post one
now I have a folder where do they put it
this is on my desktop now did I put it
htdocs
actually maybe I didn't you know what
let me uh let me just grab those images
real quick all right so I'm just going
to paste them on my desktop so I just
have some images which are just
thumbnails to my videos some of my
videos on YouTube so we're going to use
those so lets they choose file and i'm
going to go to desktop and let's grab
the angular two one and submit the cover
image must be an image let me see let me
actually look at the source code here i
just want to look at the form make sure
that we have this
so if inc type equals multi-part slash
data that should be form data let's take
a look at the create see where are we
resources views creates aha okay so this
should actually be form - data and I
knew that because I actually had that
error before when I forgot the ank type
all right so let's try again
oh we need to actually reload the whole
thing let's make sure that didn't go in
all right
all right so we're getting get our get
client original image doesn't exist so
see it's talking about this right here
let me just make sure that that's right
which probably isn't hi to get original
name not image all right let's reload
and continue we get original client
extension doesn't exist yes then that's
because it's actually get client
original extension I hate these long
names we use reload resubmit post
created so now let's go into the
database and look and you can see we
have angular to underscore timestamp
JPEG so that's good and then if we look
in our storage folder we have public
cover images and there it is and if we
look in the public folder right here
cover images there it is
so that that works great so now what we
need to do is display it in our post
which is really easy so let's go back to
vs code and we're going to go to the
index view post index view and I want to
have the image on one side and then the
stuff on the other so inside this well
let's actually create a give the class
of row this is just bootstrap markup and
then we'll have a div with the class of
call mb4 and call sm4 alright and then
i'm going to copy that we'll have
another column another div with eight
columns
alright and then this the h3 and the
small I'm going to just cut out of there
and put it inside the eighth column and
then we're going to have the image in
the
or column all right so let's say I am G
source and then it's going to look into
the it's going to look in the public
folder and then we have our storage
folder so slash storage slash cover
images slash and then we have the the
cover image in the database so we'll say
post cover image save that let's also
add a style here and I just want to say
with width will be 100% there we go
so now we can upload an image now we
also want it on the show page so I'm
actually going to just copy this right
here and we'll go to our show view and
let's just put this right below the h1
reload and there we go
we'll put a line break after it as well
or two line breaks
okay good now you're also going to want
to upload the image you're going to want
to take care of the edit form as well so
if we go to edit you'll see there's no
file thing here so let's add that I'm
going to copy from the create we're
going to grab the the file field right
here and we're going to go to edit blade
put that in right there and we also need
to add the ink type copy that
comma paste that and save and that
should give us the file upload whoops
what did I do
oh this is I get to brackets here okay
so now we need to handle the update
function so let's go back to the post
controller and go to update and you know
what I'm actually going to copy
everything we did in the store so let's
grab this copy go to update go right
here and paste it in now this is going
to work a little different because if
they don't upload an image we don't want
to replace it with no image like they
are here so I'm going to get rid of the
else all right and then down here we
only want it to add if they actually
created an image so we're going to do
this again we're going to test for this
and if they did actually upload a new
image then we're going to do post am i
doing post cover image now what am i
doing yet post cover image equals and
then we want to set this to a file name
to store all right so we'll save that
and then we should be able to if we
submit and we don't upload an image it's
not going to change if we do
wait a minute like why can't I see the
edit and delete buttons here that's not
right I technically just check this real
quick user ID - that's really weird we
should all just in scroll down far
enough all right so let's go edit and
then we will change the image and save
you submit and the image change is good
now the very last thing I want to do is
when we delete a post we want it to
delete the image as well so let's
actually go to htdocs
and go to our app and go to public and
then storage cover images these are the
uploaded images so let's go back to vs
code that while this video is getting
long and we'll go down to destroy and we
only want to delete it if it's no image
I mean if it's not no image JPEG alright
which I guess we have to look at that as
well so let's see right here I'm getting
late right here we're going to say if
because we don't want the the no image
to disappear because we're going to need
that in case someone uploads a new post
without an image so that's why we're
checking for that here
so if post cover image is not equal to
no image dot JPEG then we want to delete
the image so to do that we actually have
to bring in the storage library so up at
the top here we're going to say use
illuminate slash support slash facades
slash storage and if you ever want to
check out the different libraries and
all that with laravel you can easily
look at the documentation and show
everything I do is in the documentation
pretty much all right so to delete
what we have to do is just take that
storage object and we're going to call
delete and let's see we're just going to
pass in the location which is going to
be public slash cover images slash and
then we want the image name so we're
going to concatenate post cover image
and that will delete it so let's try it
out we're going to go over here and
click delete
post removed and you can see the image
actually got deleted so the last thing
we want to do here is make sure that if
we create a post without an image that
it actually uses no women's JPEG which
all you have to do is upload and it will
use it so for instance we'll say post
one this is post one and no image we'll
save and now nothing's showing here but
if we look at open image and new tab
it's looking for no image dot JPEG so
all you have to do is upload an image
with that name and it'll use that so
let's just say no image okay we'll just
grab I don't know just grab this I guess
wait is that it is that a PNG I want a
jpg so let's just save this and we're
going to save it in our public folder
which is here storage cover images and
we're going to save it as no image dot
jpg all right so now if we go back and
reload that's what it displays and and
it'll display that as long as you don't
upload an image so that's going to be it
guys I hope that you liked this series
