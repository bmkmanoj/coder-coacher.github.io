server setup series in this video we're
just going to run a couple maintenance
tasks that I like to do after any boom -
installation alright so the first thing
I want to do is I want to change the
hostname for our server alright so I'm
going to go ahead and log in with look
want to log in with the credentials that
I created when we did the installation
now I'm running this in a virtual
machine but log in and correct
oh okay alright so logged in now like I
said if you are using a server an actual
machine and not using VMware or any
virtualization that's absolutely fine
pretty much everything we do in this
series it doesn't really matter if it's
a virtual machine or not alright so
let's go ahead and change the hostname
by default you can see that my command
prompts has Brad at bun 2 or boom - so
the hostname right now is a bun - ok so
we want to change that and there's two
different places that we want to change
that ok so I'm going to say sudo which
basically sudo allows you to run
commands as root okay as the root user
and there's just a lot of different
things that you need to you need to
access as a root user so you'll be
seeing sudo quite a bit all right
and the editor that I like to use is
Nano alright so it's kind of a newbie
editor it's really easy to use and
that's why I like it I know some of the
hard core Linux geeks like VI or vim but
I think Nano is the easiest to use so
that's what I like feel free to use any
editor that you'd like alright now the
file I want to edit is in the e.t.c
directory which is basically all the
configurations for your system alright
and then the hosts file
and when you log in when you when you
run a command as sudo it's going to ask
you for your password
which I keep typing in the wrong one
alright so you can see we have our
localhost
with our loopback IP and then we have
this 1 2 7 0 1 1 and we have a boom tool
we want to change this thing and I just
call this test server okay now to to get
out of here we want to do a control X
and then it's going to ask if we want to
save so we're just going to hit Y and
then enter ok
brings us out and now that's saved all
right now there's one other place we
want to change our hostname all right
now I'm just going to hit the up arrow
which brings us to our last command and
the file we want to access is hostname
okay it's an ET c / hostname all right
and we just want to change it here as
well
okay control X and get out of here
alright so now we want to restart the
networking service alright so I'm going
to say sudo et Cie in it d / networking
space restart
all right now you're going to get this
message here unable to resolve host
Ubuntu because we have to do a server
reboot in order for everything to take
effect so we're just going to say sudo
reboot
all right so we rebooted and now you can
see it says test server login so that's
our hostname has changed all right and
we can even type in hostname and that
shows us that it's changed to test
server alright so in the next video what
we're going to do is we're going to
assign a static IP address to the server
and we're also going to add in our DNS
name servers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
