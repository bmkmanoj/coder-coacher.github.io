you how to create a very simple angular
2 component alright so we have a fresh
QuickStart application up and running
and this is the app component ts file
and you can see this is very simple
we're importing the main component
package and then we have this @
component this is called a decorator
which allows us to attach metadata to
our component ok so we have a selector
this is whatever you want the custom
directive to be which is my app here we
also have a template which is the
content which is in this case is just an
h1 and then we have the main class for
the component so what we're going to do
is create our own so we're going to go
in the app folder and say new file and
let's just call this my dash component
dot TS I'm sorry that's not right we
want my dash component dot component dot
es ok that's the the convention alright
so what we'll do is import components
and that's gonna be from angular 2 slash
core alright so next thing we want to do
is create the decorator so we're going
to say at component and that's going to
take in an object we'll define our
selector okay we're just gonna say my
dash component and then the template
we'll just put in an h1 and we'll say my
component and then down here we'll
create the class so I'm gonna say export
class my component okay so what we'll do
is let's save this now in order for this
to work we need to import it into the
main app component what's this I'm not
sure what that means and I don't see
anything wrong anyway so let's go to app
component es and we're just going to
import we're gonna import my component
okay what you want to put here is
whatever you name the class okay
whatever that is and that's gonna be
from dot slash my component dot
component okay now remember the selector
is my dash components so we're going to
use that in here we're just going to
insert it alright now if we save that
and we take a look you can see that
nothing's showing up for our component
the reason for that is when we use a
custom directive like this we have to we
have to define it so we're gonna put a
comma here and then we're gonna say
directives and that's going to be an
array and you want to put your class
name in there which is my component save
that and now if we go back why is that
not working let's take a look at the
console no directive annotation found in
my component all right so something's up
with this oh you know what it's that
semicolon that's not it shouldn't be
there
there we go alright so now you can see
that our component is now showing
alright so what I want to do now is I
want to create a property all right so
what we'll do is let's create a property
called title okay I'm gonna put that
there and we can we can cast this as
private or public I'm gonna say private
okay because we don't want to access it
from outside of the class now to add
some add a value to that we'll put that
in our constructor so a constructor if
you don't know that is a function or a
method that's going to run when the
component runs or when the components
created all right so what we'll do is
we'll say this dot title and we're gonna
set that to hello world all right now in
order to use that we need to bind it to
our template and there's a few ways that
we can do that okay so the easiest way I
think is to use interpolation which is
just a double curly brace and then we
can say title all right so let's run
that and you can see that we're getting
hello world so that's one way to bind
the data another way is to use property
binding so for instance let's say we
have an image link okay so we'll say
private image link and let's set that to
actually we're not going to set it there
let's set it down in the constructor
so let's see lorem pixel dot-com / 400 /
200 all right so that's an image link
now we want to bind that to the SD
source attribute in an image tag all
right so let's put an image and then to
bind it we're going to use these
brackets and the attribute we want is
source and then we're gonna set that to
image link all right so let's save that
check it out
and we get an image all right and the
way that this service works it just
sends a different image each time you
reload all right so that's another way
another way we can do it is to use the
bind and then whatever the target so in
this case we could actually do bind and
then source and that should work okay so
there's a few different ways to do it
now with the template you're probably
gonna you're gonna compile you're gonna
pile up some code here some HTML and
some variables and so forth so what you
want to do is you want to be able to
have multiple lines all right but if we
do that the way it's set up now it's
just gonna break on us all right we can
of course concatenate we can put quotes
and plus signs and all that but
typescript and the es6 syntax allow us
to use backticks here instead of quotes
so I'm gonna put a backtick here and
also right here alright and now you can
see that we can actually go on multiple
lines okay not only multiple lines but
we can easily insert dynamic variables
right in the template string all right
so that's a big help
it's a real nice addition to the es6
syntax save it let's make sure it still
works which it does now the next thing i
want to show you is how to bind data the
opposite way so in this case with our
interpolation and prop
bindings we were binding data oops we
were binding data from the from the
class to the view or the template now if
we want to let's say call a function
from inside the component from the
template we can do that as well so what
I'll do here is let's put a line break
and then we'll put a button okay so we
have a button and let's say we want to
run a function when this button is
clicked so to do that we're gonna use
parentheses alright remember we use
brackets let me put this back to just
regular property binding you can see we
have brackets okay those symbolize bind
binding the data from the view to the
component in this case we're going I'm
sorry from the component to the view in
this case we're going to the view or to
the template alright so we need to use
parentheses so in here we want to put
some kind of event so let's say click
and then we want to set that equal to a
function I will say I will just say run
click alright and then down here under
the constructor we'll create a function
called run click and let's just do
console dot log and we'll say you
clicked ok save that and now if I click
this button down here you can see it
says you clicked alright so that's how
we can't handle events from our template
now if you know angular 1 you know that
it was one of the big advantages was the
easy two-way data-binding
alright so we also have that still
available even though we have these two
different methods of binding data each
way we can also do two-way data binding
alright and use ng model in angular 1
and we still have ng model it's just
used in a little bit of a different way
alright so what I'm gonna do here is
let's put in an input
and we'll give it a type of text all
right now to use ng model we need to use
brackets and parentheses
all right so notice that when we go from
the data source to the template we use
brackets when we go from the template to
the data source we use parentheses so ng
model is two-way data-binding so we're
using both alright so let's say ng model
and let's set this to Nate note we'll
set it to note all right and then down
here let's put in private note and here
we'll just say this dot note I'm not
gonna define it I'm not gonna set it to
anything and then up here right
underneath let's put in our double curly
braces and note alright so what this
should do is it should bind data both
ways in and out so let's save that okay
if I start typing in this input box you
can see that it's also coming out here
alright so that's how we can do two-way
data binding now let's say we wanted to
also bind an event we could do that so
let's use key up and we'll set that to a
function called say something alright
and then here we'll pass in the dollar
sign event so down here let's create a
function called say something and that's
gonna take in the event and then we'll
do console dot log P dot target dot
value alright save it and now when I
start typing you can see down on the
console it logs every time I push a key
in every time I key up now you may want
that functionality you may not you may
want it just to go through when you
click enter so what you could do
and set a key up you'll Dookie up dot
inter and now as I'm typing you can't
see it but when I click enter it goes
through all right so that's
functionality that you might want to use
alright so that covers components and
data binding now for each section of
this series I'm going to save the code
and I'm going to upload it all together
in a github repository and that should
be in the description alright so thanks
for watching and I'll see you in the
next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
