mini-series in this series of videos
will be creating a wordpress theme that
uses Twitter bootstrap alright so here's
a brief summary of what you'll learn in
this series so you'll learn how to build
a wordpress theme front to back and how
to customize certain areas such as the
main post loop pages archived posts
search results comments and more you'll
learn how to implement a Twitter
bootstrap framework into WordPress
including the nav Walker class which
will allow us to have drop-down menus
you'll also learn how to implement the
WordPress theme customizer
API into your projects and you might
even pick up some extra PHP skills along
the way so what you should know before
actually attempting this you should
definitely know HTML and CSS you should
know some basic WordPress skills how to
how to set up WordPress how to create
posts and pages but real minimal stuff
basic PHP if you don't know any PHP you
still can get by because we're pretty
much going to be using just snippets and
I'll explain the functionality as we as
we go along and also programming
fundamentals things like variables loops
arrays very basic programming stuff will
help you in this course in the series so
what will be building is a simple
WordPress bootstrap blog template if
this page here looks familiar to you
it's because it's actually one of the
example starter templates that that's
available at get bootstrap com so what
we'll be doing is taking that and
converting it into a wordpress theme and
then this page here is actually I
created this in addition to this it's
going to be a custom front page alright
because we can have a custom front page
that is different than the rest of the
website so I'll show you how to
implement that if you look over here we
have the different features that we'll
be getting into the nav Walker class is
something that we can download and use
to give us drop-down menus so that if we
create a wordpress page that has a
parent it'll actually get
put in as as a submenu or as a sub-item
all right we'll also be working with the
wordpress post loop comment
functionality custom header and footer
files sidebar widgets home page widgets
I didn't write that
post thumbs and metadata custom
templates post formats archive and
search page layouts custom front page
and theme customizer API
alright so enough of these slides let's
go ahead and get started and start to
create our WordPress theme alright so
before we jump into WordPress and
creating a theme I want to get the HTML
down first so we're going to create a
basic HTML template based off the
example template from get bootstrap calm
and then we'll go ahead and convert that
into a wordpress theme so for my text
editor I'm using atom of course you can
use whatever you'd like atom is is
really nice as well as sublime text you
probably see me use that if you've
watched other videos as well so I might
get bootstrap comm and what we're going
to do is go to getting started alright
and we're first going to go ahead and
download bootstrap ok so we're going to
grab that zip file and let's open that
up and then I'm going to create a folder
on my desktop for our HTML template
alright and we'll just call this I will
say bootstrap let's call this WP
bootstrap underscore HTML ok and then
let's open that up and we're going to
create a couple things here we're going
to want a CSS folder we're going to want
a j/s folder okay and then from the zip
file that we downloaded let's bring over
bootstrap CSS so I'm going to bring that
to our CSS folder and same thing with
the JavaScript file we want to bring
over bootstrap j/s alright and then in
our HTML folder we're going to create
our index.html
well okay so now what I'm going to do is
in my Adam text editor I'm just going to
add that folder as a project okay so now
we have access to it over here let's go
ahead and open up index.html and then
let's go back to get bootstrap and go
back to getting started and actually let
me make this a little bigger on the side
over here we want to go to examples and
go down to this this blog template right
here alright we're going to click on
that and it's going to show us the theme
or the template and what we're going to
do is view the source code with control
U and just grab everything that's in
there all right and then we'll paste
that in our index.html file I'm going to
have to make this a little bigger as
well okay so let's go all the way to the
top now now we're going to need to
change a few things here if we go ahead
and save and then we try to look at our
template by opening index in a browser
it's going to look like this okay so
it's just HTML the CSS isn't registering
yet so let's fix that so in the head
area you have this bootstrap CSS
reference it's it's not pointing to the
right place what we want to do is just
get rid of this so it's going right to
the CSS folder and we're not using the
minified version so I'm just going to
get rid of that so it's just bootstrap
dot CSS all right and then there's a lot
of stuff that we don't need here
we don't need from here this ie 10 I
don't really care about ie 10 and then
this blog dot CSS this is referring to
this file here if we go to the source
code and you look at this right here
link href blog CSS let's go ahead and
open that in another tab and it's just
some extra
dials in addition to the the main
bootstrap CSS so let's grab all this and
then what we're going to do is in our
CSS folder we're going to create a new
file and I'm going to call it style dot
CSS and then we're going to paste
everything that's in there okay we so
we'll save that and then we're going to
go ahead and just change this to CSS
slash style dot CSS alright and then
from here down to the the ending head
tag we can get rid of that ok so just
clean this up a little bit so let's go
ahead and save it and let's look at our
template that's not it
there it is reload and now it looks just
like the sample template now for right
now we're going to just leave all the
static HTML and we can clean it up a
little bit clear some of this white
space and then down at the very bottom
where we're including our scripts you
can get rid of this comment and this
right here is referencing jQuery it's
using the Google CDN so we're going to
keep that we don't need this this line
here okay we don't need that now this
here we need to fix as well this is
going to go to just j/s slash bootstrap
dot J s alright and then we don't need
this ie ten hack either get rid of that
okay so that is our static template for
the index page now we're going to have a
custom front page so I figured that we
get that out of the way that HTML out of
the way so let's go ahead and create
another index
I'm sorry another HTML file and I'm
going to call this one front dot HTML
and let's grab everything that's in the
index page for now and paste that into
front alright and then we're going to
change a few things here we want to keep
the head we want to keep the nav menu
what we don't want is everything that's
in the can
Taner here so that container ends right
above the footer so we're going to just
get rid of all that okay get rid of that
now we're going to have a main showcase
area okay which will have a big heading
and a background image now the image you
can get from in the description there
should be a link to to download the
entire theme as well as the just the
HTML template that we're creating now
all right so what we're going to do is
we're going to use section tags here and
we're going to give it a class of
showcase all right and then inside here
we're going to have a container okay in
the container we're going to have an h1
okay I'm just going to say custom
bootstrap WordPress theme and then we're
going to have a paragraph I'm just going
to paste this into just some some dummy
text all right and then we're going to
have a button well it's going to be a
link formatted as a button okay so we're
going to give it a class of BTN BTN
primary and BTN LG large and it's just
going to say read more okay so that's
the showcase area if we go and take a
look at that page front HTML it should
look like that for now and then we're
going to have the area with the three
boxes so that's going to be another
section and we're going to give this a
class of boxes
all right so we're going to have a
container of a container and then inside
that we're going to have a row okay
we're going to use the bootstrap grid
system here so what we want is three
four column divs so we're going to have
class call MD for all right and then
inside here we'll have another div with
the class of box so that we can style
these and then we'll have we're going to
be using font awesome for our icons so
instead of downloading the font awesome
package we're just going to grab the CDN
okay so just grab this link here and
let's go include that up here paste that
in rel stylesheet and now we should have
access to the icons alright so back down
to our box here we're going to put an
eye tag give it a class and we can
choose an icon if we go to font awesome
I don't know the exact URL and then we
go to icons you can see there's a ton of
different icons that we can choose let's
grab this one group if we click on that
it will give us the class ok so we can
just grab that alright and then under
that we're going to have an h3 let's
just put some dummy text in here
same thing with the paragraph I'm just
going to grab that real quick base that
in okay so that's one box now what we're
going to do is copy this four column div
and we want two more of these all right
and then what we'll do is change up the
icon so let's grab let's see it doesn't
really matter
we'll get the gears so we'll just change
this to gears and let's get let's see
we'll do search for this one all right
so let's save that and see what that
looks like okay so it doesn't look very
good yet we have to style it so what
we'll do is go into that style dot CSS
file and go all the way to the bottom
and we'll add some custom styles all
right and I'll just put a comment here
all right
so first we're going to have the
showcase okay we had a class called
showcase and let's put in a height of
600 pixels and let's do what let's do
some padding okay we just want a hundred
pixels on the top and bottom and we'll
do 20 on the left and right okay we want
to line everything to the center we want
a border on the bottom and that'll be
gray one pixel solid and let's say
margin bottom will give 30 pixels on the
bottom and let's see what the color is
going to be white and then we're going
to have a background image so I'm going
to say background:url that's going to be
in dot dot / IMG / showcase dot jpg and
like I said the link to the github page
should be in the description we're going
to set this to no-repeat and then we're
going to center and center okay so
that's the actual showcase div now the
Showcase heading I'm going to say
showcase h1 and let's give this a font
size of 55 pixels padding bottom will
say 20 pixels and color should be white
all right so we also have the paragraph
a showcase paragraph is going to have a
font size of what was it 20 and then a
margin bottom of 50
okay so that should do it for the
showcase area let's take a look okay now
we just we can't see the text because we
don't have the image so let me just let
me just grab that
okay so we'll have a folder called IMG
and paste that in reload and there we go
okay so that's our showcase area now for
the the boxes down here let's style
those okay we don't have much to do
there we're going to take the boxes
class and we're going to align to the
center we're going to give a background
of white and let's set margin bottom to
30 pixels all right now the icons
themselves are way too small so we're
going to take we'll say box and then dot
FA and let's set the font size to 45
pixels and I'm going to make that
important and then we'll set a margin
bottom of 10 pixels all right and then
finally we have the box class and we
just want to set some padding we'll say
15 and and I also want to set a border
that'll be gray one pixel solid all
right so let's take a look and there we
go so that's our front page so we have
the HTML and the CSS and it's nice to
just get that out of the way so that we
can now focus on our WordPress theme and
the PHP code and all that alright so in
the next video we're going to get
WordPress set up and start to turn this
into a wordpress theme</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
