part 9 of our nodejs and Express
beginner application or what I thought
I'd call it some scratch and we're going
to start getting into stuff that's a
little more complicated I kind of feel
bad now about calling this a beginner
tutorial I mean the first few videos
were but now we're starting to get into
some more advanced stuff but I did want
to kind of continue the series I'm
guessing they'll be maybe two or three
more videos maybe if you guys wanted to
keep going enough if enough people want
to then I'll do that but I want to get
it to the point where we have
authentication we can login we can
create posts we can edit only our own
posts things like that so we're going to
be using passport which is right here
simple unobtrusive authentication for
nodejs
and it's extremely flexible and there's
a lot of different strategies that you
can use we're going to be using what's
called a local strategy meaning that
we're going to be storing our username
and password inside of a database inside
MongoDB but you can also use for
instance Facebook strategy so you can
use your Facebook log in Twitter you can
use web tokens so for instance when we
did the mean stack front-to-back series
we used GWT we used JSON web tokens so
that we could make a request to the API
and then return an access key and we did
all 10 ocation that way but since we're
keeping everything on the server this
time everything is you know in our node
app we're not going to be using web
tokens or anything we're going to just
use a local strategy so hopefully that
makes sense I did do a three video
series a little over probably a year and
a half ago called nodejs login system or
something like that and we did this this
local strategy but I didn't do it how I
should have I mean it worked and it's
fine but there's there's better ways to
do it for instance I didn't include a
passport config file I just stuck
everything right inside the route and we
don't want to do that we want to set a
configuration file that has all of our
passport stuff inside of it all right we
just want to clean it up a little bit
from what I did in that series and
that's what happens you know time goes
by and you just you learn more and you
learn a better way to do things so
hopefully we can do that in this in this
this last couple videos all right so
enough talking let's go ahead and get
started so this is the passport website
and the documentation I mean it's okay
as far as the code examples that they
give us but it's kind of meshed together
actually it's not meshed together it's
the opposite it's spread apart so for
instance some of the code is under this
offic authenticate and then some is
going to be under here and then under
user profile and it's just it's a little
hard to follow at least in my opinion
but what we're going to be doing is
using a local local strategy so to do
that we're going to install passport the
core module as well as passport local
and if we look down here basically we're
going to create a strategy and it's
going to first of all look for a user by
user name that whatever they type in the
form the login form and if it finds a
user or I'm sorry if it doesn't find a
user it's going to return with false
here which means that there was no user
found and then if there is a user it
will bypass this and it will go to check
the password and if the password doesn't
match it's going to return done with
false and then it's a does match it'll
go on or turn done with the actual user
so that's how it tells if it's the login
is correct or not
in a nutshell so what we're going to do
is install a couple modules now in
addition to passport we're going to use
something called bcrypt
which is used to hash passwords and then
there it's used to match the hash to
whatever the user types in to login and
we're going to use bcrypt jas not just
regular bcrypt
and the reason for that is because it's
much lighter it's it's it's a JavaScript
only implementation and there's no weird
dependencies whenever I use just regular
bcrypt I always have these strange
things strange dependencies that we need
and errors and it's just a headache so
let's go ahead and install those things
so we're going to do npm install - -
save passport passport - local and then
bcrypt je s alright so we'll get those
three modules installed and let's see if
we go over here it should now be in node
modules see bcrypt je s sorry so what's
up I'm trying to think of where to start
here I mean I have the code in front of
me but it's a little I don't want it to
be too confusing so let's start with
creating a model okay just like we have
with our articles our users need a model
to to map out the schema and so on so
let's do that let's create a new file
and we'll call it user J s and let's see
we're going to bring in Mongoose and
then we're going to create our schema so
let's say user schema and we're going to
create a variable called user schema
okay same thing we did with the articles
mongoose schema actually it should be a
capital s okay and then we want to throw
in here some curly braces and we're
going to have a name field and this is
going to have a type of string and let's
also make this required true all right
and then let's see we'll just copy this
paste this in three more times so in
addition to the name we're going to have
an email also a string a username and a
password
all right and then we're going to create
a variable called user and set it to
module dot exports because we want you
want to be able to access this model
from outside of this file obviously so
let's set this to Mongoose dot model and
then in here we'll pass in the model
name which is user and then the user
schema all right and then let's save
that now for the registration we
shouldn't really have to do anything
with passport because all we're doing is
adding a user ok pretty much just like
we did with the articles okay when we go
to add articles we submit a form why
isn't this running oh I don't have
server running so we just have in a form
and it goes to a function and our route
and we go ahead and submit it so we're
going to do the same thing for the
registration so let's go to routes and
we're going to create a new file here
just like we do with articles ok from
now on whatever you add to this
application pretty much whatever
resource you add you're going to have a
rope a rope file and you're going to
have a model okay as long as it's
interacting with data so this is going
to be users J s plural and C we're going
to do pretty much what we did here let's
go ahead and just copy this and bring an
Express on the router and then we're
going to bring in the user model so this
will be models slash user all right and
then let's see what we want we want to
register route to a get request a get
request to the register route or the
register URL so that we can load a form
okay so let's do just for the comment
here we'll just say register form so
since we're using a routed file here
we're going to say router get that of
app get and it's going to be two slash
users slash register we don't want to
include the slash users here because
we're going to route every
thing that goes to users to this file
alright and then this is going to have a
function with a request in response and
all we're going to do here is res dot
render and we're going to render a view
called register so let's save that and
then let's go to our app.js file and go
down go way down here to where we have
our articles routes and we're going to
do the same thing with users so let's
set users to route slash users and then
just like we did here we're going to
route anything that goes to users to
that file alright and save so now what
we'll do is create the register view so
it's going to views and say new file
register dot pug and just to test this
out let's just say register and then if
we go to users slash register see what
happens here string is not defined what
is this models oh this should actually
be a capital asks for string let's try
that
and let's see we get another error oh I
didn't export the model if they did I
didn't exploit the route that's what I
didn't this file here the routes slash
users needs to have module dot exports
equals equals router all right now
hopefully it works okay let's go over
here and reload and I don't see register
and that's probably because we're hazing
Jade so we wouldn't see it let's go back
to that page and let's copy what we have
in let's see add article because it's
going to be a similar form I'm just
going to grab everything here and I
don't know I don't know why but I forgot
we were using pugs so this isn't going
to work it's going to look at this as a
tag as a registered tag so let's just
paste that in and I can use a dynamic
title will just say register and then
this is going to go to users slash
register but it's going to be a post
request and obviously we'll have to
handle that on the other side and then
for label let's say name and that should
be name as well so I've name will have
email and we'll have user name this
should actually be an input though and
give it a type so type text and then
let's just copy this and we're going to
need two more
I don't know white indents like that I
can't stand that I'm just going to bring
this back so these fields are going to
be the password so let's change this to
password and change this
and the type and then this is going to
be the confirmed password because we
want to check it just to make sure that
they know what they're actually putting
in so that will be for the name let's
call it password - all right and we'll
save that let's go back to user slash
register and now we have a registration
form all right so we know this is going
to post to users register so let's go
back to our users routes and let's
create let's say register process and
we'll do router dot post pans just going
to be slash register remember we don't
need to put the users and then function
with a request and response and then
we're going to use validation just like
we did with articles so let's say
constant aim equals we'll set that to
request dot body dot name okay we want
to grab all the fields so we'll have
name email username password
and password - okay so we'll grab those
and put them in variable then we're
going to need the check bodies because
we're using Express validator so it's a
check body name and then the message
which will just be name is required okay
and then we're going to set the rule to
not empty so let's copy this three four
five and this is going to be email okay
and we're going to set that to not empty
and then we want another email and this
one is going to be the check the actual
email address make sure it's valid
so we'll say email is not valid and the
rule for that is going to be is email
okay and then after that we're going to
have the username and that's going to be
required and then we're going to have
password and that's going to be required
and then we want to match the password -
password - so the way that we do that
actually that should be a lowercase P
and then this is going to be password -
and the message is going to be passwords
do not match and then the rule for that
is going to be equals and then it takes
a parameter of the field that you
actually want to match which is going to
be requests body dot password - password
alright so that should do it for that
now we want to get the errors if there
are any so let's say let errors equals
or quest got validation errors and then
we want to check for them
this will be an if/else so will say if
there are errors then what do we want to
do we just want to re-render the
template right so res dot render
register and we want to pass along the
errors as well okay and then if
everything goes okay and the validation
passes we're going to submit a new user
so let's create a variable called new
user and actually it's um let's use a
let for that so let new user equals new
user remember we brought the model in so
we can do this and then we want to pass
in the field so name which will be equal
to the name variable above and email and
password okay so there's our object
we're saying new user now
before we submit this before we actually
call new user dot save we need to hash
the password and we brought in bcrypt up
here right no we didn't so we do need to
bring that in so let's say be crypt and
that's going to put be crypt equals
require and make sure and here you put
be crypt Jas and then down here right
after where we create the new user we're
going to save be crypt and it has a
function called Jen salt and that's
going to generate the D salt and we're
going to say it's going to be ten
characters and then we have a callback
and that's going to actually give us the
salt so we'll have an error if there is
one and then the salt all right and then
we want to call another function which
is going to be bcrypt
dot hash which does just that it will
hash the password so it's going to take
in the actual password which is going to
be at
we'll be able to access from new user
dot tasks work okay
so whatever is typed in the form is
going to be put here the password and
then we're actually going to run it
through this hash and it's going to give
us that back okay now we have to pass in
the salt and then we'll have a callback
okay and that will take error and the
hash and we just want to check for that
error and see you can handle this how
you want I'm just going to console dot
log and then let's set new user dot
password okay instead of it having to be
the plain text which it is at this point
we're going to set it to the hash okay
hopefully you understand what just
happened so we submit the password plain
text it's still plain text here then we
generate the salt then we call the hash
passing the salt along with the plain
text password gives us a hash back and
we set new password new user dot
password to hash alright now we're ready
to call the save method so we can stay
in your user dot save all right and
that's going to take call back and an
error if there is one we'll check for
that error and see we'll just console
dot log and we'll return there okay and
then we just want to do else you guys
can handle errors however you want if
you want to do it a little more
elegantly then you can do that but if it
passes we're going to send out a flash
message and we're going to say let's see
this is going to be a success message
and we're going to say you are now
registered
and can log-in okay and then we'll just
redirect and we're going to redirect to
the login page which we didn't create
yet but we will
user slash login all right let's save
that now just so this actually functions
how we want it to and actually redirects
and shows the message let's just create
the login route so we'll go to our users
actually we're already in the users
route but we'll go under the register
which is right here and then we'll just
say router dot get and this is going to
be to login that's alright function and
see request response and all we're going
to do is render the login template
alright so let's go to views and say new
file login dot pug and let's copy what's
in the register dot pug okay and then
we'll paste that in and we're just going
to let's change this and then we only
want the username and password so we're
going to get rid of these get rid of
this and it's going to post to user
slash login all right so at least now we
have the view so if we go to users slash
login that works good so now let's try
the from the registration username I'll
just say Brad password I'm doing one two
three four five six but it should get
hashed submit
name is required passwords do not match
let's see let's go to our registration
template so input name equals paths or
our name equals password to name equals
username so those look good
let's go to our route now where we're
submitting it to and for some reason
it's not check body username password
what the hell name is required oh this
should be lowercase and then see why
isn't that one marking maybe my
passwords really didn't match let's save
that and we'll try this again one two
three four five six submit passwords do
not match password two should be the
name of right here password too
sometimes I wish I livestream these
things so you guys could point out my
stupid errors because you guys I'm sure
most you know some of the times you guys
already see what the hell's wrong
password two is the name
password to and equals required all this
3s is Jesus and this should also this
should be Jen salt
I don't know life would get salt because
it generates a salt it passes in here
and this should actually be error er are
it's not a long day and I did the same
thing here okay whatever is whatever's
here if that said error then this should
be our but it should match and I think
that's it should be good let's try it
out so see I'm just going to refresh
this page submit cannot get user login
all right Oh user it should be users ah
see right here should be users slash
login
all right last time hopefully you are
now register so you know what I think I
just I think I just submitted it twice
but that's fine at least we know it
works but we don't know yet let's take a
look at the database so I'm going to
just open up the standard Windows
command line so I can go to the Mongo
shell we want to run this as
administrator and let's go into MongoDB
/bin Mongo and let's say use we named it
node KB and let's do D B dot users dot
find yeah see itwhen and twice so I'm
going to I'm just going to delete one of
these so we'll say DB dot users dot
remove and we want to match underscore
ID and we want to match it to one of
these object IDs so I'm just going to
ctrl C copy that put that in there and
now we should only have one good and
look at the password it's a long head
very secure hash so we now have full
registration on in our application now
last thing I want to do in this video is
just put a register link over here so
let's go to layout and
sorry about that what I'm going to do is
just let's go right here let's create
another ul so it'll be nabbed NAB - nav
bar and then nav bar nav bar - right
let's tie them and link ok this is going
to go to slash users slash register
all right we've eyes will put the login
link as well
alright let's reload and that's wrong
for some reason ul now bar the hell
all this is backwards it should be
navbar - nav while making a lot of
mistakes in this video guys hopefully
hopefully I haven't lost you alright so
register we have that login doesn't work
yet but we'll get to that in the next
video so I'm going to stop it here it's
getting late in a very long day and I
will continue this in the morning and
I'll try to get the login video out as
well alright thanks for watching guys
and I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
