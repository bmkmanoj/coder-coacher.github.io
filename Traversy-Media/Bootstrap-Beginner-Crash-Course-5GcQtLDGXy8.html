today we're going to be looking at
Twitter bootstrap which is a front-end
framework now before my longtime
subscribers start complaining asking why
the hell is he doing the tutorial on
bootstrap
let me just say that I'm starting to add
videos to my channel for beginners I
just did one on building an html5
website and a lot of you seem to like
that
I do have bootstrap stuff on my channel
but those videos are a little more
advanced as they work with sass and less
which are CSS pre compilers and they're
also on building themes what this is is
just an all-around look at the CSS
components and some of the other
features of bootstrap alright so it's
geared towards beginners but of course
your advanced programmers are welcome to
freshen up your UI skills I have one
more bootstrap video after this which
will be creating a complete CMS admin UI
and then after that we'll be moving
along to more advanced subjects and
we'll go from there
all right so what is Twitter bootstrap
bootstrap is a front-end framework
meaning that it's used on the client not
the server and it's specifically used
for user interfaces and themes so design
what the user sees in a website or
application it includes bits of code and
HTML CSS and also JavaScript now
unfortunately in this video we probably
won't get to the JavaScript part we'll
see though I will see what happens
bootstrap is used for building
responsive mobile first web applications
and websites and what mobile first means
is it refers to designing for smaller
screens first and then working up to the
larger screens all right so it's great
for mobile apps and mobile websites it's
also the most popular framework of its
type by far foundation is pretty popular
as well but nowhere as near as popular
as bootstrap is so why use bootstrap or
any framework at all why not just build
the HTML and CSS outright in many cases
that may be a good idea but let's look
at what bootstrap can offer you so
increase development speed this is the
number one reason to use a framework
work not just a front-end framework but
any kind of framework PHP JavaScript
with bootstrap all your helper classes
for alignment and style and positioning
they're all done for you you may need to
do some tweaking but for the most part
all you need to really worry about is
adding those classes to your HTML ok
responsiveness is another huge advantage
instead of using custom media queries
and creating a responsive site from
scratch you can simply use the grid
system and you'll have a mobile-friendly
website or application consistency is
another one so with class names style
markup keeps your website and your theme
very consistent it's completely
customizable of course you can add your
own classes and your own design to any
bootstrap theme and it allows you to
create really custom interfaces also
support like most frameworks it has
documentation and relative to other
documentation it's pretty good and also
has a huge community like I said it's
the most popular framework out there so
there's a lot of people using it you can
ask pretty much any developer for help
and they should be able to help you
alright so what we'll cover in this
course or this miniseries whatever you
want to call it we'll talk about what
bootstrap is that's pretty much what
we're doing now we're going to get it
set up and installed and I'm going to
talk a little bit about the different
ways we can implement it so we'll look
at the HTML and CSS components like I
said I don't know if we're going to get
to the the JavaScript part the modal's
and things like that but we will be
looking at some of the JavaScript in the
admin theme video that I'm going to
create we'll also look at the grid
system which is probably the the best
part of bootstrap allows you to create
layouts without having to use floats or
any of that alright we'll also create
what we're going to be working on is a
bootstrap cheat sheet so it's not going
to be a theme you know an organized
theme we're just going to look at some
of the classes and syntax and put
together a single index.html file that
you can refer to to figure out what you
need to do to create a lot
Hertz or progress bars Jumbotron navbars
things like that all right now of course
you could always go and look at the
documentation but we're going to go
through it step by step and you'll have
something to refer to on a single page
now as far as what bootstrap gives you
four components and helpers and things
like that this is just some of them okay
navbar drop downs Jumbotron which is
like a showcase area alerts progress
bars I'm not going to go through the
whole list but these are some of the
things that you can implement very very
easily
you also have JavaScript widgets and
helpers so things like transitions
modal's which are not nice-looking
pop-ups drop downs
tabs sliders things like that so as far
as setting up the bootstrap there's a
few different ways to do it and there's
more than what I have listed here the
the way that we're going to do it is
just download the files now you get all
the source files including sass and less
and all that stuff but what we're going
to do is just take the distributed CSS
and JavaScript the compiled code and
just include it in our template okay
really easy if you don't want to
download the source files you can use a
CDN or content delivery network which
basically you can just put a script tag
or and a link to the CSS right in your
template that's hosted somewhere else
not in your website or application the
downside to that is that you can't
really work with it offline because you
need to be able to access that resource
you can also use Bower which is a
package manager Bauer's a client-side
package manager it installs things on
the client side like bootstrap jQuery
we're not going to get into that I do
have I do use Bower in many other videos
NPM is another package manager but
that's on the back end side that has to
do with nodejs
using JavaScript on the server and you
can include it kind of like you you
would with Bower
all right but we're not going to get
into that in this video this video is
for beginners and then the last thing I
want to mention is that when you use the
bootstrap JavaScript file you also need
to include jQuery
okay it uses jQuery for all those those
widgets all right so that's really
important all right so that's it for the
slides let's get into it and start to
look at some code alright guys so we're
going to get started here and what I've
done is just created a folder on my
desktop called bootstrap cheat sheet and
we have an index.html file in there and
I just have the text hello all right so
that's what we're seeing on the browser
here now of course you can just load
your HTML file through your file system
or through your operating system just
open it up but I'm using the server it's
actually an add-on for atom that gives
us a local server it's supposed to have
live reload but it's not working you'll
see if I go ahead and save that
this doesn't reload automatically I
really wanted it to but I need to
actually hurry up and get this done so I
don't have time to troubleshoot it so
I'm just going to have to manually
reload it alright old school so what
we're going to do is go to get bootstrap
comm that's the official web site for
bootstrap and you'll see up here
bootstrap 4 is coming this has been here
for ages
bootstrap 4 we have open this up is
actually still in alpha alpha 5 and I
have no idea when the hell it's gonna
it's going to be stable I debated on
doing bootstrap 4 for this video but I
wanted to do you know what is stable and
available at this time so there will be
a bootstrap 4 video coming just not
right now
alright so let's take a look at the
website I'm just going to make this a
little bigger so if we click on getting
started this actually gives us a link to
download ok we can get the the compiled
CSS and JavaScript which is what we're
going to use you can get the entire
source code you can use sass and less
which are CSS pre compilers gives us the
CD ends we can use gives us the commands
for Bower an NPM things like that
composer let's see if we could go down
here this gives us basically the
structure of the bootstrap source code
how to install with grunt which is a
task runner that's more
we're not going to get into that and if
I click over here on basic template
you'll see that this is how you know
something to start with gives us the
meta tags that we need all of that a lot
of stuff that we don't need as well but
what we're going to do is grab this okay
I'm going to just paste that in there
alright and let's make this bigger I
like to do it side by side but
unfortunately it doesn't show enough I
need to make this a little bigger okay
and let's just take a look here so we
have our doctype we have our HTML tag
with a Lang a language attribute for
English obviously if you're using a
different language you want to change it
in the head we have our UTF our
character set we have this http-equiv
which we're setting to X stash you a
compatible and this just has to do with
providing an HTTP header for the value
of the content attribute
this is for the viewport for the size of
the screen basically and we're setting
it to the device width okay whatever the
width of the device set it to initial
scale of 1 all right let's get rid of
this comment and for our title let's
change it to bootstrap cheat sheet okay
now we haven't downloaded the files yet
but we're going to point to CSS we're
going to create a folder called CSS and
then we're going to use the minified
bootstrap file okay now if you don't
know what minified means it's basically
you take the the the CSS file and you
get rid of all the white space all the
comments you make it as as small as
possible okay and give a really small
file size by taking that stuff out you
can also use bootstrap dot CSS which is
not the minified which has all the
comments and all that stuff alright but
usually you don't need that now I'm
going to get rid of all this we do not
need that okay and then we have our body
we have an h1 hello world and right here
it's loading jQuery using the Google CDN
ok we're using this Ajax Google API now
you could download jQuery and just you
know
included in your in your files if you
want but we're just going to keep this
alright and then we're just pointing to
a J s folder with bootstrap again the
minified javascript alright so let's go
ahead and save that and if we were to
reload we're not going to see any style
changes or anything because bootstrap
isn't being loaded in fact if I open up
my console it's going to tell us that
it's not finding these files so let's go
ahead and download bootstrap we're going
to go to actually we're going to go
right here and we're going to go to this
download bootstrap link okay notice that
it has the dist okay this is distributed
so it's it's basically the compiled CSS
and JavaScript and also the fonts so
let's open that up okay we'll open that
zip file up and go into here and you can
see we have a CSS folder fonts and J s
okay now we're going to bring that over
to our bootstrap cheat sheet folder okay
and we're going to just clean this up a
little bit if we go into CSS we have all
these different files like I said we
have the unmanned the minified we also
have this theme file which is for a
custom bootstrap theme but we don't want
that either all we want is this file
right here bootstrap mint dot CSS so I'm
going to just go ahead and delete
everything else and fonts folder we do
want that if you want to use any of the
icons that are the glyphicon x' you need
to have this so we're going to save that
in the jas folder we're going to get rid
of bootstrap j/s which is the unmanned
then we also don't need this npm j/s
okay so all we want is bootstrap Minjae
s now if we go and we reload you can see
that oh I guess it did a live reload did
work maybe it just takes a while you'll
notice that the font has changed the the
padding here has changed alright so we
know that bootstrap is being included
also we're not getting any errors in the
console
all right so let's go back to the
documentation and if we continue on the
get started and we go to examples you'll
see that there's actually a bunch of
pre-made templates that you can use the
starter template with the navbar this
one has the Jumbotron and some button
examples the grid system if we go down
here you have one that implements the
carousel which is a JavaScript widget so
there's some basic starting points you
can use and I've actually used these
quite a bit but we're not going to get
into that we want to just start from
scratch start fresh and just go just do
some custom coding all right so now what
I'm going to do I'm not going to go
through any of this because we need to
keep this kind of short if we go to the
CSS link up here in the navbar and we
look over here you can see we have the
grid system okay so this gives us all
the different classes for the grids and
we're going to go through all this I'm
just showing you what's available the
documentation the typography this is
actually what we're going to start with
just basic heading classes things like
that paragraph classes let's see tables
okay see the different tables you can
style them striped and bordered forms
okay so forms look pretty nice in line
forms buttons different colors and sizes
let's see images you can format your
images to be rounded or bordered or
whatever helper classes for alignment
things like that let's see so that's the
CSS link if we go to the components link
gives us even more stuff because there's
all the icons and the classes see
dropdowns button groups okay you can
group buttons together the navbar which
of course is important let's see
breadcrumbs labels pagination I'm not
going to go through it all right here
we're going to actually look at that in
our file we're going to type it out but
you can see that everything is available
from the documentation even JavaScript
if we look at that gives us the code for
instance for the modal okay this is a
little demo here
we click that opens up a modal and get
all the code for that okay so it's
pretty good documentation alright so now
what we're going to do is go into our
file and we're going to start with
typography and some of the helper
classes alright so let's go ahead and go
into the body and we'll just keep this
heading here okay let's open that up in
the browser I'm going to close the
console now usually you want to push
your your content to the middle and not
have it up against the side here and
normally you'd use CSS you'd put a
margin Auto you'd put some maybe margin
on the top overflow:hidden things like
that with bootstrap we have a class
called container that we can just add
and it'll take care of that stuff for us
all right so I'm using Adam for my
editor by the way so if we go ahead and
save that now you'll see that it just
gets pushed over in the middle here okay
and it's set to be responsive you can
see that changes as you make the browser
bigger and smaller so container is a
really important class alright so now
what I want to do is look at headings
and paragraphs and things we can do to
style Bo's all right
let's see you know what I'm going to
make this smaller so we can see both
alright so for the heading there's a
class called page header so if we say
class page header and save that you'll
see that it gives it some extra padding
and it gives it a border okay makes it
look pretty nice okay nice and clean you
want to use that for you know your page
titles things like that alright we can
also put some smaller text in here we go
small okay which is just an HTML tag
this isn't special to bootstrap or
anything
and if we were to say just say secondary
text save that and probably want to put
a space right there okay so that just
gives us a little subtext which looks
kind of nice alright so now let's put in
some paragraphs ok now using atom or
sublime text we can use the Laura you
can type in lorem and then tab and it
will give you this sample content all
right let me just space this out okay it
gives you quite a bit here it gives us a
good sized paragraph and I'm going to
wrap this in paragraph tags okay and we
just make that a little bigger alright
so if we save that now you can see we
have a paragraph and this looks pretty
nice just by default looks pretty clean
as far as the line height things like
that the font alright now if we want to
let's actually take a little piece of
this and copy it and we'll put a shorter
paragraph above it alright and then
we're going to give this a class this
top paragraph or class of lead save that
and you'll see that now it's a little
bigger okay so if you want to have a
paragraph that kind of sticks out you
can use the lead class alright now we
also have inline text elements so for
instance if you want to highlight some
text let's say we want this we'll put in
a tag called mark like that save it and
you can see that that text is now
highlighted if we want to cross out some
text we can do that we can do that with
the del tag
okay so now you can see that this text
is now crossed out let's see what else
we can do we can obviously do underlines
some of this stuff isn't you know unique
to bootstrap but it does format it nice
and neatly bold obviously you can do
strong and all that so nice text
formatting let's see next thing I want
to look at is alignment okay so what I'm
going to do is go under we're going to
stay within this container div and I'm
just going to put a line here horizontal
rule just to separate it and let me just
comment this stuff too just so you guys
can have it so this will be two caps
will say alignment okay and up here
let's put a comment blog Rafi all right
yeah so for alignment we have different
classes we can use what I'm going to do
is paste in just some very short
paragraphs
okay so save that and obviously these
aren't aligned yet because we haven't
add in any classes but let's say we want
to align to the left we can use a class
called text left okay so if I save that
oh well it is to the left okay so if we
want to align to the center say text
Center save okay so that moves it to the
center you can say text right moves it
to the right we can do justify so text
justify save that okay so we're not
going to see any difference here but it
is going to justify it and then we can
also make it so that it doesn't rap by
saying text - no rap okay so that will
prevent any rapping now we also have
some transformation classes I should
probably add that here as well okay so
let's say we want all the text to be
lowercase so if we we can just go ahead
and add in text - lowercase and now
notice that it's all lowercase we can do
text uppercase okay save that now that's
all uppercase we can also do capitalize
which I believe will capitalize the via
the first letter of every word
okay so just some some nice helper
classes now we also have classes for
floats so let's put a comment here we'll
say quick floats okay
now let's say we have a div let's say
div floated whoops - floated - right
okay so if we save that you'll see it's
just normal but if I go when I add a
class of pull-pull right save it you'll
see that it's now floated to the right
okay and of course we have float left
so that's a div floated to the left okay
which isn't going to look any different
now I'm going to put an HR right here
and notice that the HR is now directly
through the text which obviously we
don't want so when you float something
and if you know CSS you probably know
this you have to clear it all right in
order for things to go back to normal
so with bootstrap we have a special
class for that called clear fix okay and
just put a comment here
okay so save that and now you'll see
that HR is moved back where it should be
alright so that is alignment okay next
thing we're going to look at is block
quotes okay so if you have a quote from
someone that you want to style and make
look nice what we can do let's put a
comment okay so we're going to use the
block quote HTML tag and let's give it a
class of block quote okay and in here
let's put I'm just going to paste this
in just a small paragraph okay so if we
save that you'll see it's formatted
pretty nicely it has this bar on the
side here we can also add in a footer to
our block quote so I'm just I'm going to
do a little bit of copying and pasting
just to speed things up a little bit so
we have this wrapped in a footer tag and
we have the name wrapped in a site tag
with the title alright so if we save
that you'll see that that's formatted
nicely now if we want to reverse this
and put this on this side we can just
use the class block quote - reverse and
now you'll notice that it's reversed
text is aligned different we have the
bar on that side alright so that's a
block quote
okay next thing we're going to look at
is lists okay now bootstrap has a
component called a list group we're not
going to look at that just yet this is
just regular lists so let's first look
at what are just a standard list looks
like with no classes so we'll save that
okay so by default lists the list items
have a bullet and they also have the UL
has some padding I believe it's ten
pixels padding pushes it over to the
right now if we want to take away that
styling all we have to do is give it a
class of list unstyled save that and now
you'll see the bullets are gone the
padding is gone we can also create
inline lists so let's just copy that and
let's give this a class of list
- inline save it and now we have an
inline list okay which is good for menus
things like that alright now if we want
to include actual code maybe you have a
web design or development blog and you
want to include some code you can do
that although there are better solutions
out there such as markdown but you can
do it and it's formatted nicely and a
lot of this stuff is HTML by default but
you'll just see how bootstrap styles it
nicely
alright so let's say we want an h1 to do
our slashes and not have it parts will
do the ampersand LT and let's put in h1
and then we're going to do ampersand GT
semicolon and let's say heading text
then we'll do the same thing grab that
okay and we'll just put a slash before
the h1 so if we save that and now you'll
see we have our h1 and the heading text
all right now if you want to do keyboard
commands you can do that as well I'm
just going to paste this in so I just
put a line break and
we have the text change directory with
CD and then I wrap that in this KBD this
keyboard tag and then down here we have
ctrl + what is a ctrl + and then we have
a comma so let's save that see what that
looks like ok as you can see that's
formatted pretty nicely if you want to
tell somebody which keys they have to
press or something like that alright so
now we're going to do is put in another
HR here and we're going to take a look
at contextual classes now bootstrap has
a set of contextual classes to use for
SEP 4 different colors and styles for
instance primary gives you a blue color
success gives you a green color info I
believe is light blue and you can use
these on different things you can use it
on paragraphs you can use it on alerts
panel headings all types of stuff all
right so let's just take a look at
contextual colors just spell that right
- contextual colors and let's just go
ahead and paste some short paragraphs
alright so they're all paragraphs with
hello world this first one we're going
to give a class of text
- primary ok let's take a look at that
notice that the first one here is below
you know what I'm going to do is we're
going to just put a div down at the
bottom here and give it a style of
height let's set the height to 400
pixels or can I just say height 400
pixels
and save that there we go so that way
it's not at the bottom of the page you
guys can see so that gave us a blue
color okay we also have success so text
- success and save that now you can see
very faintly when it's a green color
okay we also have info we have warning
okay just remember these keywords
because they're all associated with a
color and then we have danger save that
and now you'll see that for info we get
a light-blue warning as a yellow it's
hard to see with just the little text
and then danger is read and then this
bottom on here we can actually use text
- muted save that and that makes it
basically just light okay light gray all
right now we can do the same thing with
backgrounds so what I'm going to do is
copy all of this paste that and let's
say contextual background colors and all
we want to do is change text to BG so we
have BG primary PG success BG info PG
oops
PG warning BG danger and I don't think
BG muted is one button we can try it so
let's save that and now you can see that
they each have the background now you
probably want to add some padding
because everything is you know flush up
against the text so you may want to add
some padding but you can see you can do
the same thing with backgrounds all
right so that takes care of typography
and a lot of the different helper
classes for text now we're going to look
at
and for this I'm going to open up a new
container so we're going to go outside
of that one let's just separate things a
little bit okay and let's put an H R in
between here as well
alright so now we're going to look at
buttons
okay so buttons you can format a link as
a button a button tag and input with the
type of submit which you would use in a
form so let's take a look at some of
those so first we just have a standard
button and let's give it a class of BTN
and then BTN - default which is kind of
a style of the button okay and then in
the text let's just say button
actually we'll say default all right so
let's see what that looks like okay so
that's what a default button looks like
it's just white and you hover over it
and you get a gray background now we can
do the same thing with a link same kind
of formatting so let's say a and this
would go somewhere and then we could add
the same class that we did here okay
whoops I don't want to do that that's an
a tag and then you probably want to put
in a role attribute of button okay and
let's just say default actually you
don't we'll do let's make this text say
button this one will say link just so we
know what it is okay we can also do an
input tag okay so this would typically
be for a form so B type submit okay we
can give it the same class
and this would have a value as well so
this would be a submit save that and now
you can see that each one is formatted
the same way even though it's a button a
link and an input okay so now let's look
at the different contextual styles of
the buttons just like we have with the
text so we'll go right here and say
contextual buttons okay I spelt that
wrong okay I'm just going to grab this
right here this button this is the
default change that to default I'm going
to copy that and we're going to put some
other ones in here as well okay so after
default let's do primary so instead of
BTN default will do BTN primary my
spelling is her osius so I'd word her
osius okay so after primary will do
success okay and then we'll do info
obviously different situations you're
going to want to use different colors
and context we have warning so an
example would be the success is a green
green one so you probably want that
let's say if you post a blog post and
you just want a message saying blog post
created that would be an example of a
success and then this would basically be
with alerts not buttons for instance
with a button with danger which is red
you'd use that for a delete if you're
going to delete something something that
can have consequences okay so let's take
a look at these and there's our
contextual buttons
okay you can also format a button as a
link if you don't want the background
and all that so if we were to say BTN -
link and say link save that now you can
see the button is just like a link
there's no border or anything now we
also have different sizes for the
buttons so it's a button sizes okay
and I'm just going to copy this default
button and what we're going to do is add
in a class here of BTN - LG for large so
if we look at that notice that the
button is much bigger than the rest of
them the next one down would be just
your default button so just copy that
again save that so that's just the
default let's actually put a line break
right here as well okay we'll make that
a little more readable we'll put a line
break here - okay so we have the large
we have the regular and then we have
small copy that change that to BTN SM
and then we also have extra small so XS
save it and you can see the different
sizes and of course you can use
different context with it as well for
instance if we want the small one to be
blue we can do button primary and now we
have a small blue one all right we also
can add a disabled attribute so let's
say this little one here we want that to
be disabled we can say disabled equals
disabled and now if I hover over it
you'll see the little X I can't do
anything with it it's disabled alright
so that's the basics of buttons now
we're going to move along to forms and
for that I'm going to create a new
container actually
put this comment above the container
like that okay that ends there and then
we put another comment for forms okay
let's go ahead and put in a form tag
okay so what we need to wrap a container
okay so in the form let's do a field now
you want to wrap your fields in a class
called form control okay wrap them in
form control and then let's put a label
so we'll say name and then we'll put our
input give it a type of text and let's
see we'll add a placeholder say add name
alright so let's see what that looks
like oh I'm sorry this form control
should be form group there we go and
let's put a char right here now I don't
like how this I mean this just looks
like there's no styling at all so what
we want to do is in the input we want to
give that a class of form control
save it and now that looks much better
it goes all the way across it has some
padding some height width so that looks
good now let's do an email so what I
would do is copy the form group paste
that in and change that to email
probably want to change the type to
email we're using html5 and we'll say an
email save it now we have another field
okay we can also do text areas let's
copy this form group and we'll say
message okay instead of an input let's
do a text area with the class of form
control you can still use a placeholder
okay but this needs an ending tag as
well text area alright save that now we
have a message alright a select list
let's just paste this in save some time
I'm going to go under this form group
okay I'm going to have another form
group and then a label with gender have
a select class form control put our
options male female and I want it to be
politically correct so I put other okay
let's take a look at that that looks
pretty good
also file upload fields will go under
the form group here and paste that in
whoops let me just grab that again okay
form group label upload file we have an
input with the type of file and we can
also have these help blocks we have a
paragraph with the class of help block
telling us that we can only upload PNG
and JPEG files alright let's just
separate these form groups a little
alright so there's our file upload okay
and we also have checkbox let's go ahead
and add one of those so under the form
group
paste that in we get a check box okay
very simple and then let's put our
submit button paste that in we're just
having a button with the type of submit
set it to the button default class and
there we go so that's a very simple form
using Twitter bootstrap now we also have
inline forms what I'm going to do is
just copy and paste this in in the same
container let's just put an HR here
okay we'll paste that and now we have
form with the class of form inline same
thing we have our form groups okay it's
an email this one is a password and then
we have a checkbox with remember me and
then a button so what makes it inline
basically is this class right here so
let's save that and let's see maybe this
is too small to be and yeah there we go
so when you get to a certain point it
stops being inline but you can see there
that's a nice login form set up alright
let's see next thing let's move on to
tables okay so up to this point you can
see I have a nice little cheat sheet for
the different classes but let's see just
push this stuff over alright so we're
going to go under this container and
that should not be contained like that
that should be a div that I do that
anywhere else
No all right you guys probably caught
that a while ago okay so let's see form
that ends their container ends here let
me just make sure that matches up yep so
we're going to create a new container
okay all right so for tables I'm just
going to paste in just a standard table
okay paste that in it's just a table
with first name last name and age save
it and that's what it looks like by
default which is pretty ugly okay I'm
just going to put an HR right here
separate it okay so that's pretty ugly
and we can fix that very easily if we go
and we add class to the table tag of
table and save it look at that look how
drastic that changes okay it actually
looks nice and clean now there's other
classes we can add on to format it even
further for instance if we say tables
striped okay what that does is it takes
every other one and Dockins it gives it
a nice little effect we can also make it
bordered you say table - bordered I
don't really use this what it is
possible okay see the borders what else
we can make it so that when we hover
over a table row here it will highlight
so we can do that with table - hover
okay notice when I hover over it it
changes and we can also do table
condensed
okay and that will just make it kind of
smaller you can see it condensed the
padding a little bit and we can also use
contextual classes here so for instance
let's say Jill we want her row to be red
we could stay class make sure it's on
the TR and we could stay danger
okay now her Row is now red if we wanted
John to be success or to be green they
could say success and that turns his row
green okay so very easy very minimal
code to to make this look pretty good
alright so moving along now we're going
to go to lists groups and you know what
I'm going to just add some comments here
I want you guys to be able to use this
if you need so this will be that's forms
that's labeled alright I guess for this
one we could put in line form okay
that's our table and let's go outside of
the container put an HR and then we'll
open a new container
okay and we're going to do a list group
so I'm going to paste in just a regular
list okay save that your standard list
let's turn it into a list group by going
to the UL and saying class equals list
group okay now if we just do that it
doesn't really do anything we need to
also add classes whoops
save that we need to also add classes to
the list items so class equals and we
want to say list group item letting it
know that it's an item of this list
group all right and then we'll just copy
that we want to do it for all of these
all right so it's save and there we go
so that looks pretty nice now if we want
to do a menu that's going to be a little
different when we do is just paste this
in okay so notice we're not using allies
we're using a tags with the list group
item save that okay whoops I want to put
that within the container okay and
notice that we can hover over them and
they have links okay now if I click on
that one you'll see that that's now
active okay it adds a class called
active if we want an active by default
then we can just go and add in right
here I'll stay active save it and now
it's active okay and when you label it
active it gives you the primary context
context which is blue now let's say we
want this one to be success or green we
could say list
group item Jesus I can't type item -
success okay that makes it green we can
also disable them so if we go here we
just say disabled let's see
list group item disabled it should
disable it I would think okay they were
no huh maybe I'm wrong about that oh
well
so moving on let's move away from those
groups we're kind of running out of time
here I want to move on to panels and
wells which kind of give us a background
for our content and also a heading so
I'm going to go outside of this
container did I know I didn't let's put
our Comment screw okay we'll go outside
of this container create a new one now
this is the container alright so let's
start with panels now let's go to the
documentation and go to components and
let me just make this a little bigger
not components
or yes components but why isn't it
working
it's my internet out please don't tell
me my Internet's out all right there we
go
now if we go down to panels and right
here so we have panel heading without
title and we have it with the title I
want the one with the title which is
this right here so we can just grab that
okay let's put a comment here paste that
in to have this over so basically we
have a div with the class of panel and
panel default then we have a panel
heading with an h3 that has the class of
panel title and then the panel body
where all the content goes so let's take
a look at that okay so there's our panel
we can also add a footer to our panel so
if we go under the body and say div
class equals panel footer
save it now you can see it has a footer
alright and if we want to change the
colors here we can use the context so if
we were to say let's instead of panel
default actually no we probably want to
put this on panel heading nope not panel
heading right here panel default let's
change it to panel primary save that and
now you can see that as the blue
background also gives us a blue border
around it so you can add that you can
make it green red however you'd like
now wels pretty simple it's it's just
the background gives you some padding
and a background color of gray by
default so let's see we'll go right
under the panels and let's put a comment
say wells and let's do div class equals
well and we'll just say hello world
alright save that what are we havin
trouble with live reload again looks
like it
all right so that's our well you can see
it just has some padding with the
background there's a couple
customizations we can do with Wells so
let's just copy this paste it in twice
this one will do well - LG this one will
do well
- SM so we can do large and small and
let's see oh we also have to have the
class of well so we need both ok so now
you can see there's some more padding
this is bigger this one has less and
it's smaller okay so those are wells now
we're going to look at alerts let's just
put a char right there and I apologize
if I'm moving kind of fast guys it's
just that this is a lot of mock up a lot
of content to go through and I want to
just get as much as possible so this is
for alerts and let's see what we'll do
is let's paste in a couple of these one
two three four all right so we just have
a div with the class of alert the role
of alert and let's make this a success
alert all right now if we just look at
it now how it is it's just just the text
but if we add here alert - success save
that now we get a green alert we can do
the same with info say an info
Alerts and I'll just add here alert
- info okay this one will be warning so
we'll do a worked - warning this will be
danger and I can imagine the amount of
comments I'm going to have about my
spelling there we go again alert -
danger all right so let's save that and
now you can see the different alerts
that we can do now what's cool is that
we can also grab an alert where we can
dismiss it
we can click X and get rid of it so for
that let's go under here and I'm just
going to paste this in so div class
we're using alert warning and then we're
adding alert dismissible and then inside
of it we have a button with the class of
clothes a data dismissed attribute of
alert and we're using this and ampere
stamped x for the x mark all right and
the alert text will just say you can
close this so now you can see we have
this X here if I click that it goes away
and I believe you have to have the
JavaScript file linked for it to be able
to do that okay so next thing progress
bars so let's put an HR right here
actually let's stay within the container
okay and we'll just put
say progress bars and let's see we're
going to say div class equals progress
okay so that's kind of the wrapper class
and then inside you want to do div class
equals progress bar okay and let's see
we're going to give this this s to have
a style so that we can define the width
of it or the percentage so we'll say
style width is 50% I think that should
work and in here let's just put the text
50% let's see what that does
okay so that gives us a nice progress
bar now there's some things we can add
to it to change the style up so for
instance if we want to make it green we
can use the contextual classes and say
progress our success okay now it's green
we can also make it striped
okay now notice it's striped and we can
even make it an animated if we make it
active that and now you can see that
it's animated so pretty cool all right
so we're getting there guys next thing
we're going to look at is badges or
labels and then badges so let's go ahead
and put underneath here we'll put a line
or an HR and then I'm just going to pay
some of the stuff in so these are the
labels okay labels we have the span
class label and then label default just
like the buttons we're using default
primary success and info warning and
danger so let's save that okay now
notice this one is big this primary
because I have it within an h1 so if you
put it within a heading it's going to
make it bigger alright so those can be
pretty helpful badges so let's paste
this in so badges we have a link here
going to inbox and then we just have a
span with the class of badge and then 50
and then here we have a button with
messages with a span of a class of badge
with two okay so if we look at that
you'll see we have this inbox with 50
that's good for if you're building some
kind of message system and then you have
the button messages with two okay so
those are badges let's see next we have
images so for that I'm going to paste in
we're going to go outside of the
container which ends right here I'm
going to paste this in okay another
container and we have an image with the
class of thumbnail we're just using a
placeholder image here then we have an
image with the class of image rounded
which will give it rounded corners and
an image circle which will actually make
the images circle so
save that and that's what we get you see
the different styles of image okay now
next thing I want to look at is a really
important part of bootstrap and that's
the grid system okay so let's go right
here and put a comment will stay grids
this will be in its own container okay
so when we want to start a grid
basically a grid is broken up into
twelve blocks okay we have one two three
four all the way to 12 and then you can
you can say how many of these blocks you
want to use in each div so for instance
a common one would be to use an eight
you know eight columns for your main
layout and then four for the sidebar and
notice that eight and four is going to
equal twelve all together alright so
what we'll do is create a row okay you
want to wrap your grids you want to go
by row and then let's say we wanted
eight columns so we'll say div class
equals call MD eight okay and I'll go
over what MD means in a minute and then
underneath that actually let's put some
content there will say lorem tab which
will just give us some content and we
probably want to wrap that in a
paragraph okay and then underneath it
let's just copy that paste it in and
change this to four okay and we'll just
cut this text down a little bit okay so
let's see what that gives us let's make
sure we put an H R here
okay so here's our grid we have an eight
column here and then we have a four
column so this would commonly be the
main layout and then a sidebar all right
so it does it makes it so that you don't
have to use your floats and all that
judging the margin and padding it takes
all that into effect all right so let's
do something a little different let's do
four three columns okay notice four
times three is 12 so we can do that and
have it look good so we want four boxes
essentially lined up so what we'll do is
let's see let's just copy this whole row
right here and put it underneath and
then we're going to change this to three
this one is also going to be three but
we want the same text in each one so I'm
going to copy that paste that in and
then we just want two more of these
three column divs so I'll paste that in
save it and now notice that we have four
three column divs okay um what else I
mean you could do any combination you
want you could do two six column divs so
for instance if we copy I let's copy
this row okay we'll go underneath this
row change this to six and six save it
and see what up
okay so notice that this and this that
there even because they're both 6 and we
could put line breaks here to separate
this a little bit okay you could even do
12 1 column divs so that's a lot of
codes so let me just grab that okay so
right here paste that in so basically we
have a row with 12 of these column D
ones and look at that alright now as far
as the MD that stands for medium screen
size now if we go to a certain point
like let's say when it gets to here when
it's like tablet view it automatically
goes into just all on top of each other
no more columns now if we want to keep
that format let's say the 8 for we have
up here the sidebar in the main column
if we want to keep that here what we
could do is say call - SM - 8 and then
call - SM dot 4 so if we save that now
you'll see that we have the columns back
if we go down even more it'll do it
again now if we want to still have those
columns here we could add call - XS - 8
and then call - XS - 4 okay so now we
have the columns again which you
probably wouldn't want if you're on a
screen this small you probably don't
want columns like that but you can do it
okay so there's two more things that I
want to show you two pretty important
things and that's the nav bar and the
Jumbotron okay so we'll start with the
nav bar we're actually going to put that
at the top so let's go away at the top
here and let's see we'll put it
right below the body now this is quite a
bit of code so I'm actually going to get
this from the documentation which is
what a lot of people do so let's go to
components and a navbar okay we're just
going to grab this whole thing from this
nav to this nav and let's put that right
here okay just going to tab that over
now let's see what this looks like okay
so there's our nav bar this has a lot in
it has a branding our logo some links it
has a drop-down and just to let you know
you have to include the Judi bootstrap
JavaScript for this to work okay there's
also a search form which we don't need
but you can have and then some links
over here with another drop-down and if
we look at the code here I'm going to
get rid of some stuff I don't want that
form so from here this form to the end
right here let's get rid of that okay
save it now that's gone we can also get
rid of the links over here that's the CL
with the class of nav bar right and get
rid of that save it now that's gone all
right
now notice that if I make this bigger
the the nav bar content is way over here
and I don't want that I want that to be
in a container so what we would do in
this situation is just see how it has
container fluid change that to just
container okay now it's pushed towards
the middle all right
also if you want this to be a darker
color all you need to do is change nav
our default class to nav bar inverse
save that and now it's a dark color okay
and let's just change the brand the logo
right here we'll say
bootstrap cheat sheet save that all
right so that's the navbar next thing
last thing is the Jumbotron which is
where is it basically a showcase area we
have a big heading some text learn more
and usually you put an image or
something behind it as well
alright so for that we can just type
that in
let's go below the navbar okay we'll put
a comment here and let's see we want to
give the class of Jumbotron
okay and then in here we want a
container because we want everything to
be pushed into the middle okay we'll put
an h1 say welcome to my website and then
we'll put in a paragraph I'm just going
to say lorem tab give us some content I
don't want it too long say up to here
alright and then we probably want a
button so we'll say a a trap okay give
it a class of BTN BTN primary
they read more all right a lot of times
I like to Center the content in the
Jumbotron so if we just add text Center
and let's save that okay so there's our
Jumbotron now if you want this to be
gone this is the space right here that's
the margin for the navbar what I would
suggest is just in your own custom style
whether you want to do it up here or
have your own style sheet you could say
dot navbar margin-bottom
zero okay and actually you want to have
that after the bootstrap CSS so we want
to put that right here all right and
that gets rid of that I notice that the
navbar by default has these rounded
corners usually you wouldn't want that
so what we could do is just say order
radius zero okay now it doesn't have the
rounded corners all right so this is a
pretty nice cheat sheet if you need to
know some classes for bootstrap that was
what I wanted to do get you guys that I
realized there are some things that I
didn't get to cover I probably will make
another video for the JavaScript stuff
and just about definitely going to make
that CMS admin theme UI that we're going
to build with bootstrap all right so let
me know if that's something you guys are
interested in okay and I'm always open
to suggestions
if you guys if you guys read my comments
and you can see that I do respond to
guys if you have a suggestion for a
project that I like and I think will
benefit my subscribers okay I do have a
twelve project course building bootstrap
themes so that's something that you
probably want to check out if you're
interested in this kind of thing
and that's it so if you liked this video
please like it and please subscribe and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
