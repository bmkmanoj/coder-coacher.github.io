description below hey what's going on
guys so many of you know that I've been
really working hard on my next course
I'm also moving so my time has been very
limited I haven't really had the time to
do any in-depth coding YouTube projects
so I figured that we could discuss
something that many people may be
interested in something I'm asked a lot
and that's if jQuery is still relevant
in 2018 and after watching this video
I'd like to hear from you guys do you
still use it or do you use it for do you
think it's dead or dying and so on now a
word of caution
I know developers can be very I guess
territorial over the technologies they
use and any video like this can always
get a little controversial although I do
try my hardest not to make it that as
with any video like this take it with a
grain of salt
and never let just one video influence
you too much make sure you do your
extended research and form your own
opinions alright so why make this video
well what I want to do here is I want to
look at the jQuery library what it
includes and what I mean by that is the
main things that it's used for and I
want to provide people with some
alternate solutions using vanilla
JavaScript and also some specialized
libraries okay because I think that some
people aren't aware of how far
JavaScript has come since es5 we'll also
look at the pros and cons of jQuery and
hopefully it can help you decide if it's
still relevant are worth learning and of
course at the end they'll give you my
opinion in my direction which again take
with a grain of salt because I'm just
one person all right so first off I want
to say that jQuery was and still is an
awesome library it's probably the
best generalized JavaScript library that
was ever created many developers owe
their career to jQuery I can say I can
pretty much say that for myself as well
because back when it was so much more
difficult to write vanilla JavaScript
when it come to the Dom and stuff like
that
jQuery really allowed us to do things
that you know we may have given up on if
this library didn't exist so I do have a
deep respect for jQuery as a technology
and what it's done for web developers
and even web designers so jQuery was
king for many years starting I don't
know 2006 something like that before I
even started doing web development and
there were a few reasons for that it was
an all-in-one library that you could use
for almost anything that includes Dom
manipulation Ajax calls utilities
animations just a lot of different
things and it was very easy to learn at
the time it was much easier than doing
this stuff with pure JavaScript it was
also cross browser compatible now if you
wanted to do something and you looked at
the jQuery code and then the JavaScript
code you would ask yourself why the hell
would I not use jQuery for this
situation it was much less code it was
much easier code to write and understand
we also didn't have many if any if any
frameworks at that time for things like
Dom manipulation you know there was no
react or angular I mean there were some
some other frameworks starting to pop up
but they were very new when they weren't
that great so jQuery was often learned
before JavaScript and that that's just
because it was so much more
understandable and allowed you to really
do things much faster and made you feel
more productive on top of that you had
jQuery plugins that gave you this
instant functionality for specific
things all right but a lot of that has
changed not just in 2018 but in the past
few years I'd say since about 2015 or so
since es6 really javascript has made
made huge strides and jQuery is no
longer needed in many
situations so what I want to do is go
through some code examples compare the
jQuery version to the vanilla JavaScript
version and I think it'll give some
beginners some perspective because they
may be looking at jQuery articles from
2013 and not even know that this stuff
exists all right so let's start off with
Dom selection all right this is probably
the first thing that you learned when
you learn jQuery it was one of the most
valuable assets to be able to take any
CSS selector whether it's a class an
element a nested element pseudo elements
anything and treated as an individual
node in your javascript we would simply
wrap it in a dollar sign in parentheses
and then we could do what we want with
it if we wanted to do this with
JavaScript back in the day the only
similar option was get element by ID but
that had to strictly be an ID we did
have get by class name and get by tag
name but that would return not the
direct element but I believe an HTML
collection which we had to do all kinds
of hocus-pocus just to get a single
element and do something like change a
class name or something like that and
then even once you get got the element
doing something with it in the Dom was
much more work with vanilla JavaScript
all right well now we have query
selector to get a single element and if
we want to get groups of elements like
and let's say we want a group of Li tags
we can use query selector all which
returns a node list that we can treat as
an array and these two methods take in
just about anything that a jQuery
selector will take in including all the
things that I mentioned earlier they're
also both compatible in all modern
browsers including ie so at least to me
for simple selection it may be a bit
longer to type but I wouldn't use a
large multi-purpose library to save a
few characters and you could always just
define it in a variable and it'll be the
same length anyways when you're running
your methods on it and so on also if
you're interested there is a tiny
library I believe it's called bling that
allows you to use the dollar sign just
like jQuery in place of document dot
query selector so in terms of selection
it's the exact same thing and I don't
see any reason to use jQuery for Dom
selection all right so what about Dom
manipulation traversing things like that
now if I'm not mistaken all modern
browsers with the exception of some
versions of ie include all of these
api's and these are just some of them
there's a lot more but you can also use
a transpiler like babel to compile your
JavaScript for all browsers so we have
jQuery on the left in blue and vanilla
JavaScript on the right in green and you
can see there's not much difference
between a lot of these now this element
here money sign element would be a
jQuery selector this over here this
element variable would be document dot
query selector or document dot get
element by ID something like that but
you can see that a lot of the methods
are the exact same we can remove
something using dot remove we can
prepend another element using dot
prepend we can insert something before
with dot before when it comes to
changing classes and stuff it's a little
different you'll see jQuery uses add
class vanilla JavaScript uses class list
dot add which is a little different but
not much not much remove class we have
class list dot remove and we can even
toggle with class list toggle and then
if we want to let's say select the
parent element in jQuery we would use
the parent method in vanilla JavaScript
we would just use parent node okay if we
wanted to clone we could use clone and
in jQuery we could use clone known a
clone node in vanilla JavaScript and
then the true just means that we want to
clone its child child nodes as well all
right and these are just some of them I
do have a course called modern
JavaScript from the beginning which I'll
link in the description where we go over
the
in a lot of other modern javascript api
x' native api's alright so what about
events now jQuery has a lot of event
related methods so so many that it can
be a little confusing but one example is
the on method so in this case what we're
doing is taking an element and calling
dot on passing in the event that we want
to look for which is a click and then we
have a callback where we execute our
logic alright and if we look at the
vanilla JavaScript version now you can
use inline events but it's it's not
recommended at all what's recommended is
add event listener so we would take that
element add event listener add in the
event which in this case is a click and
then a callback in this case i used an
es6 arrow function okay and i would
definitely suggest learning he has 6
before learning jquery I could use a
callback function here just like I did
up here as well but I personally prefer
arrow functions but then we would just
have our logic so not much difference
here so again you know why use jQuery
for events all right so now let's talk
about HTTP requests and Ajax calls now
for years jQuery was preferred by just
about everyone over the horrible syntax
of xhr which is the XML HTTP request
object used to send Ajax requests well
with es6 we got the fetch API which is a
promise based API to make HTTP HTTP
requests in a very easy way we simply
call fetch we pass in the URL we can
also pass in an object if we want to
change the method like for instance a
post request and also of course if we
want to send data along with that or any
header options anything like that and
then we get a promise back which
contains a lot of stuff and what we do
here is just map it to usually map a to
jason so that we can get the json data
and then we just add one more dot then
which gives us the actual data and then
we can do what we want with it so it's
very easy it's a very easy syntax and we
can also of course use a sink away and
clean it up even more to make it look
less asynchronous okay make it make it
look more more synchronous and then in
addition to fetch we have smaller
specialized API
I'm sorry specialized libraries such as
Axios which is a fantastic library now
yes it is a library but it's a tiny
library that does one thing great as
opposed to doing a bunch of things and
you can see the syntax is just Axios dot
whatever the request passing the URL
one dot then and we can just get res dot
data so very very simple it's even
easier than the fetch API alright so
that is Ajax request and I didn't have
enough room to put in the jQuery AJAX
but I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen
that before
alright so that brings us to utilities
now jQuery has a slew of Handy utilities
for manipulating arrays and stuff like
that
we could easily check to see if
something was an array or something is
contained in an array with this is array
or an array but now in vanilla
JavaScript we can do array dot is array
pass in something that'll give us
that'll tell us if it's an array or not
if we want to check to see if something
is in the array one option would be to
use index of if it's there it'll give us
the index if not it'll give us negative
one so we can just test for that
javascript also had now has a bunch of
high order array methods which are just
fantastic for instance if we wanted to
loop through an array in jQuery we had
the each method now we have the high
order function for each that we can call
on an array so we can say dot for each
and we can get the value of each each
element or each the hell each value in
the array we can also get the index of
course just like we could with
each if we wanted to let's say translate
all items in an array or an object to a
new array of items we used map in jQuery
but now we actually have map in
JavaScript which works in a very similar
way if we wanted to let's say find the
elements of an array that satisfy a
filter function we had grep in jQuery
now we have filter in JavaScript another
one is parse Jason and jQuery to parse a
JSON string now we have Jason dot parse
so you can see these are very very
similar and pretty much the same length
pretty much the same amount of work -
the big library
alright so animations now animations
with vanilla JavaScript is one thing
that is much more difficult than with
jQuery but there are many other options
so if you're going to use animations
with JavaScript you're probably going to
be using CSS transitions or keyframes to
do things like fade ins and stuff like
that which is more trickier than using
you know dot fade in/fade toggle or
whatever we also have the web animations
API which I'm not that familiar with so
I can't really speak on that that much
and then we also have third-party
libraries like green sock which again is
a specialized library that does one
thing really well which is it's kind of
a trend that that that we're seeing
these days instead of using this large
generalized library we're using these
smaller libraries for specialized
functions or specialized
just aspects of your of your application
all right so let's take a look at the
list now of jquery's main uses so dom
selection we now have query selector
query selector all Dom manipulation we
have native browser api's pretty much
all standard in in all modern browsers
of course ie always gives a but we
have compilers like babel and polyfills
and HTTP ajax fetch fetch or Axios i
actually would prefer to use this over
Jake
korie's syntax anyways utilities we have
map filter reduce etcetera or low - low
- is another library that is fantastic
because you can just load in the
specific utility that you want if you
wanted to use just map you could bring
in map from low - which you know mitten
is very very very small file size
animation you can use css3 or use a
third-party specialized library whether
it's a JavaScript library like green
sock or something like animate dot CSS
there's a lot of different options out
there and then browser support which was
a big reason for a long time to use
jQuery well now we have modern browsers
and we also have things like babel and
we have polyfills so that's not really
an issue so you can decide for yourself
if jquery is is needed I guess I'm not
gonna say it's not relevant yet we'll
get to that but as far as these main
things that it's used for a go you can
decide if it's needed now this video may
seem like I'm just all over
jQuery but there's really only two
things that bother me about it these
days the biggest being that some
beginners still proceed to learn jQuery
which is a JavaScript library before
learning the JavaScript language and
when it's capable of especially with all
the strides it's made since es6 I think
everyone should learn a language before
a library or a framework in that case
another thing is as I just went over
with logical code examples is that it's
not needed in many cases and it's not
needed in its most used cases anymore
even if you can't do something with
vanilla JavaScript I would recommend
using a specialized library not a
generalized one alright now I haven't
even mentioned frameworks yet frameworks
really are the future at least for
larger applications or mid to mid-sized
to large applications my suggestion is
to learn JavaScript
learn the language all the modern syntax
and all that and then focus on a
framework like react angular or view
these are frameworks that are the food
okay not just the future but the now if
you look at the jobs that are needed
there they're asking for react
developers angular developers view isn't
as popular in the job market but it is
getting up there and it's also just an
awesome framework so that's what I would
suggest now with all that said I bet you
thought that I was gonna say screw
jQuery it's it's not relevant well
that's not the case it is still relevant
even in 2018 and the reason that I say
that is because although it's phasing
out which which may be a debate for some
people some people may say it's not but
I think it's phasing out and and most
developers seem to agree with that it is
still widely used in applications and
websites that have been around specially
ones that have been around for a while
and it's almost a guarantee that you're
gonna run into it in your career now if
you know JavaScript and you're decent
with it jQuery will be simple to learn
you'll get it very quickly and you don't
have to master every single method but
just learning you know Dom selection and
all that is gonna be very very easy for
you if you already know JavaScript if
you know basic Dom manipulation already
my suggestion is to learn jQuery but I
would suggest learning it as kind of a
supplement after learning JavaScript
maybe after you learn the basics of a
framework and I don't mean just learn
about for loops and functions in
JavaScript learn es6 learn the fetch API
at least the basics of Dom manipulation
and by the way then one of the best ways
to do that is with my 21 hour course
smart and JavaScript from the beginning
had to throw a shameless plug in there
not not to be a Salesman and promote my
own course but my goal for that course
was was to do just that is to teach
people modern JavaScript without having
to use a library all right now I'm not
saying that jquery's is useless in 2018
I would use jQuery typically on a simple
site with no framework when I need a
quick solution or a plugin that usually
involves some kind of
nation animation isn't my strong suit so
maybe for certain types of sliders
counters scrollers things like that
I haven't written jQuery in quite a
while but even my own website uses a
jQuery plug-in for the the animating
numbers at the bottom with the
subscribers and views and all that stuff
that's actually a jQuery plug-in which I
do plan to rewrite in vanilla JavaScript
I just haven't had the time and I guess
that's a perfect example of what I would
use it for is to get something up you
know up and running quickly that is
basically temporary until I can find the
time to to revamp it the way I want
I guess quick solutions is my main use
for jQuery mostly by plugins
but I never use it for writing simple
individual things like Dom manipulation
or HTTP requests or anything like that
we have vanilla JavaScript and and
specialized for libraries for that as
well as of course frameworks for larger
applications react and angular they all
do that Dom manipulation and stuff even
better than vanilla JavaScript does
alright so hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video and remember I'm just one
person you can disagree with everything
I just said and that's absolutely fine
everyone's different and everyone thinks
in a different way I do my best to look
at the facts and in this case actual
logical pieces of code but of course you
know I had to throw my own opinion in as
well but I also respect yours whatever
it is if you swear by jQuery and you
think it's the best thing in the world
that's I respect that because you've had
different experiences than I have and
I'd like to hear those experiences and
if you guys still use jQuery what you
think about it and all that so please
leave a comment if you want and you know
just be respectful and mature but that's
gonna be it guys thanks and I will see
you in the next video before I go I just
