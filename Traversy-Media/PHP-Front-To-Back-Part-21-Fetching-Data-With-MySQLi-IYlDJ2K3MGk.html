parts was this 21 of PHP front-to-back I
know it's been awhile since I uploaded
to this series I've just been really
busy I I'm working on a 10 project
laravel course for onyx and that's
taking up a lot of time so what we're
going to do today is work with databases
finally I know a lot of you guys have
been have really been asking me when
we're going to start working with MySQL
so we're going to do that we're going to
start off with MySQL I or MySQL MySQL
improved which is an extension that
allows us to interact with the database
in my opinion it's not the best I would
prefer something like PDO
but we will get to that but MySQL I is
easier and to be a PHP programmer you
should definitely at least know it now
you can use it in a procedural syntax or
in object-oriented with classes what
we're going to do is start off with
procedural and then later on we'll move
on to the the object-oriented way of
doing things so I have open PHP myadmin
and if you've been following along and
you have xampp installed you should have
this just go to localhost / PHP myadmin
and what we're going to do is create a
database to work with alright so this is
going to be the start of a really simple
blog application alright so we're just
going to call this PHP blog and create
the database alright let me make this a
little bigger now we're going to have to
create a table okay unfortunately with
with relational databases we have to
kind of predefined everything the tables
or the columns we're going to use the
data types for the columns it's not like
something like a MongoDB or you know
another no SQL database where we can
kind of do it on the fly through the
application we have to first set it up
in the database layer
alright so let's say we want five
columns and we're going to call this
table posts alright so this is going to
hold blog posts so this is where we need
to put our fields we're going to have an
ID field and the type is going to be
integer which is already selected and
then over here we make this a little
bigger over here
going to mark this off right here AI
which is auto-increment
meaning that it's going to the ID is
going to it's going to add one every
time a record is added so let's say that
we have records up until ID three the
next one we put in will automatically be
ID 4
alright we're also going to make it the
primary key ok you should have this
little pop-up just click go and that
will that will label it as the primary
key all right then we want a title and
that's going to be a VAR char which is a
variable character and we're going to
just set it to the max of 255 and then
the next one is going to be body ok the
body of the post and that's going to be
the text type and text we don't have to
specify a length all right and then
we're going to have the author which
will also be varchar' will just say 255
and then finally we'll have created at
that's going to be a timestamp so right
here at timestamp and we're going to
make this have it's going to have a
default value of the current timestamp
okay that way we don't have to worry
about it every record that we insert
will automatically get that you know
that day and time so let's say save now
we have our post table so I want to
insert some data because the first thing
we're going to do with our application
is you know select data from the
database so we need to insert and we're
going to say for title it's a post one
you don't want to touch the ID because
it's auto increment it's going to update
by itself and then we'll just say this
is my very first post on this awesome
vlog I don't know doesn't matter
author just put myself and then let's
add another one we'll say post two we'll
say this is post number two alright
author will just say John Doe ok and
then we'll click go down here and now if
we go to browse you can see we have two
posts
so now what we'll do is create a new
folder in the PHP sandbox and that's
going to be website 8 and let's create a
new file and we'll save that as index
dot PHP tape so this is going to be just
basically the blog role just a list of
posts like you'd see on any blog
homepage ok so we're going to start off
by connecting to MySQL so to do that
we're going to let me just put a comment
in here and we'll say create connection
and then we're going to put a variable
I'm just going to say Co and n for
connection and we're going to set that
equal to MySQL underscore Connect I'm
sorry
MySQL I that's the old way of doing it
without the I alright so what we want to
put in here is for things basically we
want the host which is going to be
localhost we want to put the user which
is going to be root for me and then the
password okay make sure you put your
users password and then the database
name which we called PHP blog all right
so that's the connection string now what
we want to do is check the connection
and we can do that by putting an if
statement and we're going to check for a
MySQL i underscore connect underscore
Jarno all right which is actually a
function so if that's look so if that's
true then we're not connected or there's
an error so we'll say connection failed
and then let's just echo out a message
will say failed to connect to MySQL and
then we can actually concatenate onto
this the the actual error so we know
what's going on we can get that from
MySQL connect I connect i haven't used
this in a long time
underscore yo are no and yeah that's
that should work so let's go ahead and
save that and then we'll go to localhost
slash PHP sandbox slash website 8 what
the hell I like mrs. belt local host PHP
sandbox website 8 okay so we're not
seeing anything which is actually a good
sign if I were to go over here and let's
say route 1 which obviously isn't isn't
correct and we reload we get access
denied for route 1 ok if we were to
let's say change the name of the
database to something that's not there
and reload will get unknown database so
this will tell us what's wrong
alright so I'm going to put it back to
the correct settings and that's it so
we're connected but I don't want to have
this inside of this file because we're
going to need this in other files as
well so what what I would usually do is
create a new folder why is that not
updating new folder see refresh hell
not sure why that's happening let's
create it out here then on htdocs PHP
sandbox website 8 and we'll create a
folder called config alright guess we
have to do that for some reason and then
in config we'll create a new file and
we'll save it as DB dot PHP all right
and then we'll move this this whole
thing to the DB file and then we'll
simply require that file so say require
that's going to be in config slash
DB dot PHP all right so now we're
connected let's go ahead and try to
fetch the posts all right so let's see
we're going to we're going to first
create a query so we can put that in a
variable and the query I want is going
to be select all from posts now if you
don't know SQL at all I would suggest
going and watching my SQL
beginner-to-intermediate series and
it'll tell you all about select
statements inserts updates and all that
so that's our query it's put in a
variable and then what we want to do is
get the result let me just put comments
here too so this is going to create
query and to get the result we're going
to set a variable result and set it to
MySQL I underscore query and we're going
to pass in query all right actually we
want to pass in the connection and the
query all right we can use this because
we're requiring the DB file up here
which has that connection variable
alright now there's a lot of different
ways to fetch data we're going to use
MySQL I fetch all and we want to get
back an associative array okay so let's
say fetch data and for that let's put it
in a variable called posts and we'll set
this to MySQL i underscore fetch all
all right and then in such all we're
going to pass in the results and then
the type of data or the type of format
that we want which is an associative
array so we want to say MySQL i
underscore associative array is it's
like this so name Brad and so on alright
so now we should have that data inside a
post what we want to do now is free the
result
so this basically freeze it from memory
let's say MySQL I my SQL i underscore
free underscore result and then we just
want to pass in the result all right and
then finally you want to close the
connection so for that we're going to
call my sqli underscore close all right
l we going to pass in the connection
okay so now we're getting the data let's
save this to make sure there's no errors
all right there isn't we don't have any
output here but what I'm going to do is
just do a var dump okay remember that
for our dump we're going to pass in
posts and let's see what we get and we
get this array with you can see title
and it gives us the type and the
characters and all that so it looks a
little mushed together but the title
post one body has the body and then it
has post two and so on all right so what
we want to do now is output this stuff
somehow so down here I'm going to put
some HTML we need to close this out all
right so put our HTML down here I'm just
trying I'm going to try to set this up
like a real application let's go ahead
and put in a title here so we'll just
say PHP blog and let's make it look
decent by adding bootstrap so we're
going to use boots watch
and I'm just going to grab this first
one I'll click download' grab this link
and we'll go and put that right in here
all right and then in the body let's put
an h1 and we'll just save posts okay and
then what we need to do is loop through
the posts that we're getting back here
we're going to do that with a for each
loop okay so we're going to use this
this some shorthand syntax so for each
it's not really short it's just
alternative and for each okay so we're
going to say for each posts as post and
then let's put a div and we're going to
put a class here well which is a
bootstrap class and then we'll put let's
say an h3 and in here we'll say PHP echo
post remember it's an associative array
so we can access them like this okay so
that's h3 and then let's do let's see
let's put a small tag and in here we'll
say created on and then we want to date
so PHP echo post and remember we have
that created app field that gets filled
automatically and then we'll say bye
and then we'll echo out post post author
all right and then under that let's just
put a paragraph tag and we'll say PHP
echo post body all right
yeah it looks good so let's save that
and let's go over to our application and
reload and there we go
post one you can see we're getting the
date the author and the body I just want
to wrap a container around this stuff I
know we don't have to use bootstrap it's
just kind of adding something to the mix
but I wanted to you know look at least a
little decent alright reload and there
we go so that's how we can select
multiple rows from the database so now
what I want to do is I want to make it
so that we can click on these and then
grab that specific post from the
database okay so let's go down here and
let's put a read more length okay so
this will go to post dot PHP and we're
going to send a parameter we're going to
send the ID and then in here we can say
PHP echo post and get the ID alright and
let's see let's also give it a bootstrap
class of BTN and BTN default alright and
then the text will just say read more so
now we want to create a new file in the
website eight directory and we're going
to save this as post dot PHP okay so
this is going to represent a single post
and what I'll do here is just copy
everything from the index file paste
that in we're bringing in the database
we're going to say select all from posts
but we want to specify what post and we
can do that with a where clause so we're
going to say where ID and for now we'll
just say where ID equals one alright and
then we're going to do the same thing
here we're going to you know pass in the
query get the result and then when we
fetch the data instead of doing MySQL I
fetch all we're going to do my MySQL
fetch Assoc which will basically take
that one
and turn it into an associative array
all right and then we just want to get
rid of this right here
all right and then let's see we'll free
the result that can all stay the same
now since it's only returning one post
we don't need to do a for each so let's
get that out of there and I also don't
want this in a well and so you'll just
move this back and let's actually put
the title in the h1 so we'll grab that
put it in the h1 and then get rid of
that okay we'll keep the small we'll
keep the body get rid of the read more
because this is an individual post we
don't need a read bar and that should do
it so let's save and go to website eight
slash host PHP undefined variable post
all right here take off that s right
there and there we go now if we want it
to correspond to one of these which to
reload for instance post two we need to
get this ID right here and then pass it
into the query all right so let's go
back here and let's say let's say get ID
okay so get ID we're going to create a
variable called ID and then set it to
remember this get ID now there's an
extra security precaution we should take
here and run this through a function
called MySQL i underscore real how is it
real escape string okay we want to wrap
that in that and that'll escape any
dangerous characters or anything that's
you know harmful and then let's see
right here instead of using just
hard-coded one let's uh let's
concatenate on two here and we'll say ID
okay and let's save so now if we click
on post - whoops what happened here oh
this real escape string it expects the
connection as well so first parameter
should be the connection and there we go
post - if I click on this read more we
get post 1 all right we should also put
a like a back button here so let's go to
post and let's see right above the title
I'll just put a link to slash and we'll
say back and we'll give it a class of
BTN and BTN default okay now you see how
I click back and it's actually going to
the root of localhost and I don't want
that what I want to do is create a
config variable for the root URL so we
can use that throughout the site so in
the config folder I'm going to create
another file and save it as config dot
PHP and we're going to define a constant
okay so let's say define let's say root
so it should be caps roots underscore or
URL and then we're going to define that
it's going to be HTTP localhost / PHP
sandbox slash website 8 okay so this way
if we were to deploy this onto a server
with a different URL we could just
replace this and use this throughout the
site so let's save it and we're going to
include it on both pages as the first
file first require okay so that will be
config dot PHP and then let's go down
here where we where we have the link and
let's put in right here PHP echo root
URL
and then we'll do route URL
I'm also going to include the slash at
the end here so we don't have to put
that on extra alright so that should
work let's try it ok good now for the
back button let's go to our post PHP and
we also need to require the config here
and then down here let's put PHP echo
root URL ok we'll try that
it's reload back and there we go good
now it's also a good idea for your
database parameters to be in the config
rather than just right in here so what
we can do is say define and we'll say DB
and you may have seen something like
this before so this will be localhost
just copy that so host user password and
name user root pass and DB name which is
going to be PHP blog ok and then we can
save it and go to our DB and we can
replace these with DB host user paths
and name alright and that should still
work there we go
alright so let's see oh wow it's been a
while let's see what can we do to clean
this up a little let's uh let's create
an includes folder as well I'm trying to
structure this like a real application
so we'll say new folder and
that's high yeah it's not working all
right so it's a new folder Inc and then
in there let's create a new file called
header dot PHP and also file called
footer.php all right and then in the
index page let's grab from the doctype
down to the beginning body tag and cut
that out and we'll just put here include
it's going to be include and then Inc
slash header dot PHP all right and then
we'll put that in the header save that
close it up and then for the footer I'm
going to grab just this just the HTML on
the body cut that put that in the footer
save it close it up and then we want to
include that as well okay because you
want to try to you want to try to not
repeat yourself as much as possible all
right and then we'll do the same thing
on the post page so I'm just going to
grab that and we'll replace this with
that and then these with footer
all right and everything should still
work good and then the last thing I want
to do really quick is put a nav bar so
let's say new file and the includes save
this as nav bar dot PHP and let's
quickly just go to get bootstrap comm
get started
examples starter template control you
and grab the nav ok we'll just put that
in here let's get rid of the nav bar fix
talk
let's change inverse to default let's
add the project name which is PHP blog
and then all we need is right now is the
home link and that's going to have PHP
echo root URL we're going to take this
active class off for now all right so
now we need to stick that in the header
file right below the body so let's say
PHP include and that's going to be let's
see now far we don't need the Inc
because we're already enough in that
directory alright so there we go
so we have a little start of a blog
application alright so in the next video
what we'll probably do is create a form
so that we can actually add a post to to
the database alright so hopefully you
guys like this and it wasn't too
confusing and I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
