this particular video is gonna be on
installing WordPress we're going to
install WordPress version 3.5 one we're
going to install it on a zamp
local server if you want to setup zamp
on your computer I believe you can get
it at Apache friends org alright so you
can download for Windows or Mac or Linux
just awesome software it basically gives
you the environment of of that that a
hosting account would give you but it's
on your local machine as opposed to a
third-party web server so I'm not going
to go through installing this installing
examp I have a video for that if you
want to check that out first
but what we're gonna do is install
WordPress on to our zamp server so i'm
just going to click download and this is
this is wordpress.org download depending
on when you're watching this video the
version might differ you might have a
later version but this one is three
point five point one so I'm gonna save
that it's a zip file
and I'm gonna open that zip file and you
have one folder called WordPress and
these are all the files that are needed
to have to install a wordpress blog and
what you would do if you're using a say
a shared hosting account you'd want to
upload these files through FTP maybe
FileZilla or another FTP client you'll
have to get these files on your web
server since I'm using zamp which is a
local server I can use my file manager
so if you use examp
you want to go to your zip installation
which is usually on your C Drive unless
you changed it when you installed it and
in that folder you have an htdocs folder
now me I'm not gonna use this because I
actually I'm using a different folder
for my htdocs I'm using my Dropbox just
so I can access my zamp files on any
computer with Dropbox which is it's just
the same thing I named it htdocs it's no
different just pretend that I'm using
the core htdocs folder if that makes any
sense at all
so I'm gonna create a new folder and I'm
just gonna call it WordPress
and that's where I'm gonna have my
installation so I'm going to take all
these files yeah and drag them over
all right so now we have all our files
and we can you can access your ZM server
from localhost but if we just have
localhost it's going to take us to I
don't have in my htdocs directory I do
not have an index.html or an index dot
PHP so what it does is just list the
entire folder structure now if this was
online this would not be safe to do but
where it's local it's fine so we want to
click on WordPress because that's the
folder where we just put our files now
what it's doing it's telling us that we
we don't have a WP dash config dot PHP
file and WordPress needs this to be able
to install now if you go to the
wordpress folder you'll see we have this
folder wp-config - sample dot PHP so
what we need to do is change that we
will just want to get rid of the sample
on the dash on the end and then we want
to open that file and you can use
notepad or whatever you want I'm using
sublime text but you can use just a
regular windows notepad text Maido or
whatever you want to use and from here
we need to add our database credentials
WordPress is a database driven system so
it's absolutely necessary to have a
database and the most popular databases
MySQL if you're using a hosting account
maybe GoDaddy a Hostgator or something
like that you can create your database
from in their back-end from your hosting
panel for us we're using zamp so we can
go right to PHP myadmin
which is a program that allows us to
manage our database tables and columns
so you can access that just go into
localhost
slash PHP myadmin and we want to type in
our password if you just installed zamp
i'd suggest that you add a password to
your PHP myadmin because by default
there is no password so here were in PHP
myadmin and you can see on the side here
these are all my the databases that I
have we want to create a new database
for our WordPress installation so if we
go up here and click databases I'm just
gonna call it WordPress create so now we
have a database called WordPress which
is totally empty and the database will
get filled up on installation so if we
go back to where we were
localhost / WordPress and reload you'll
see it says error establishing a
database connection that's because in
the config file we just saw we don't
have the right credentials so we need to
add that so DB name will be what we just
created in PHP myadmin which is just
WordPress so that's the name so we want
to put that here
the user by default your date if you're
using zamp your default user is root
password we want to put like I said if
you don't have a password
I'd suggest putting one I can't I'm not
sure if you can even use WordPress if
you don't have a password for your
database but I'm just going to put mine
in very easy password to remember
localhost you want to keep that unless
your host doesn't use this they might
use some other kind of host name
I think GoDaddy does that but you'll
have to find that out from them but most
of the time this will just be localhost
and everything you don't have to worry
about anything else here you just want
to save that and then if we go back and
reload now we get the Welcome page so
here you just want to fill in some info
the site title I'll just say
WordPress dev site I'll keep the
username and admin create a password and
you want to put your email address in
most likely you want this checked you
want search engines to index your site
so if we click install WordPress
all right so WordPress has been
installed and it shows us the user name
so let's click login now when you have a
wordpress site if you want to access the
admin area you need to go to your site
slash WP dash login dot PHP let's login
here oh that's not right any login so
now we have our back-end of the
WordPress site if we want to view the
front-end we can go here to visit site
and we have a default WordPress
installation so we have a wordpress
website now and from here you can go on
to add content to get a theme installed
and just anything you want so that's
that's it that's the base installation
I'm going to make another tutorial
probably right now on how to set it up
and configure it and add a theme and all
that good stuff so if you could please
subscribe to my channel and I'll see you
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
