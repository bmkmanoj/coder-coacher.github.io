application complete for now we have a
crud application that is working with
our loopback back-end but they're
completely separate right now you can
see that the front end is on 3001 the
back ends on 3000 what we want to do is
combine the two so there's a few things
that we need to do a few steps we need
to take so this is this is where we left
off in the last video we have the react
server running here I have the loopback
server running here so what I'm gonna do
is stop the react server control see
we're still in the client source and
then we're going to go into our package
Jason for the react app okay make sure
it looks like this and basically when we
run when we run NPM build which is going
to call this script right here it's
gonna call react scripts build whoops
don't want to do that we call that it's
going to take our source code and it's
going to compile it into static assets
that basically we could just upload to a
server okay it's gonna just create our
client files now what we want is instead
of just putting it into a folder called
build which is what it will do by
default we want it to go into the let me
just show you right here we wanted to go
into this client folder which is part of
loopback that's the client side of
loopback alright we wanted to go from
here into there instead of just a build
folder inside of here which will happen
by default so we're just going to add on
to this build script right here so we'll
say react scripts build and we want to
just put in right here
double ampersand and we're going to put
in the CP command which is the copy
command we want it to be recursive okay
we want to take everything and we want
to copy it from build slash everything
so everything that's in that build
folder all the static assets that it
compiles we want to copy it to dot dot
slash client slash
okay it's gonna go outside of the client
CLI into the client folder that's in the
loopback server okay so hopefully that's
clear again it's gonna take the build
folder that it that it creates it's
gonna copy it into the client folder so
let's just make sure it looks exactly
like this and then we'll save this
alright and then we should be all set
we'll go ahead and close that up and now
down here we're gonna run NPM build all
right now make sure when you run NPM
build you're inside of the client source
folder all right it wouldn't work
anywhere else anyways but just make sure
you're in there and hopefully with what
should happen is it'll put everything
into that client folder and loop back so
let's go ahead and run this I'm sorry
it's NPM run build all right so it's
creating an optimized production build
I'm not sure why that happened
it's kind of weird maybe I should have
ran it in the terminal alright so I'm
just gonna guess that let's let's check
the files so if we go to meetups and
clients or so it created the build this
is what the static assets looks like you
can see there's a folder called static
and now let's check in meetups inside
the loopback client folder and there it
is everything got copied alright I'm not
exactly sure why vias code just went
blank like that but it did move the
files so I'm gonna go ahead and just
close up vyas code I guess
and hopefully that worked now if we
let's restart the server here if we
restart the loopback server and we go to
localhost 3000 not it not the Explorer
but just localhost 3000 we're still
gonna get this screen okay and that's
completely normal
there's a couple things we have to do on
the loopback side so what we'll do is
open up vs code again and instead of
being in the client source folder I want
to open up just the the the root folder
so let's say open file open folder
actually and we want to open just
meetups ok not this client source but
meetups itself alright and you can see
that the client folder now has all of
our static assets in there from react
and there's a couple things that we want
to change so first of all we want to go
into server boot and then root j/s and
right here where we have this router get
slash we just want to get rid of this
server loopback status that's that's
what's displaying this right here the
status so we can just completely get rid
of that and get rid of that comma so
it's just nothing it's just the get
slash
so that's the first thing and then we
want to go into the middleware
middleware JSON file and go down to
files okay right here files it's just an
empty object and we want to add to this
loop back actually should be in quotes
double quotes so this is going to be
loopback let's see hash static and then
we want to set that to an object and we
want to say params again should be in
double quotes so params and then here we
want to put in money sign exclamation
dot dot slash client okay so basically
what we're saying is that the static
page for this loopback server should be
the client folder which is this right
here that we compiled all our react
stuff - all right and that has the
index.html file in it that we want to
load so let's go ahead and save this and
let's go ahead and restart the server
all right let's cross our fingers and
let's reload localhost 3000 and there's
our application all right we're no
longer running anything that's in the C
at this the client source folder this is
all coming from this the client folder
on the loopback server alright so now
what we want to do is test everything so
you can see that the details page works
let's try to edit something so we'll say
angular meetup we'll change it to let's
say 41 Main Street save go to angular
meetup 41 Main Street let's add
something here we'll say PHP meetup and
that's going to be in let's say I don't
know
Sacramento and address 33 Brook Ave and
save and there we go PHP Meetup alright
let's make sure we can delete so now we
have a complete full stack react and
loopback application now you're not
going to want to edit anything in this
client folder what you're gonna do is
use your client source folder that's
here that's your dev environment okay so
if you make any if you want to make any
changes you'll obviously you know go
into your components and do whatever you
need to do and then you're just gonna
run again
NPM run build from the client source
folder and it'll build it into the
client folder alright that's gonna be
your workflow now like I said we're not
going to get into authentication just
yet I'm pretty new to loopback I've
built full I've built full stack
applications with react and node node
and Express I imagine that the
authentication with loopback all we
really need to do is make a request to
get an access token and then we can
store that access token and we can use
that to then make requests to
authenticated routes and and off making
routes protected in loopback is really
easy if you watch that other loopback
video I was telling you about you'll see
how we can do that alright so we'll
probably make it so that you can see the
meetups publicly but you'll be you'll
have to log in to add them alright and
there's no promises when I'm gonna make
that video I do have some other things I
need to get to including my next course
since and some other YouTube stuff that
I have planned but hopefully this gives
you guys somewhat of an idea on how to
mix react and loopback
at least in one way I mean you know
people do different things in different
ways but this is just one way so
hopefully you liked it and if you want
to go ahead and you want to try the
authentication yourself or you want to
add to this application I'm gonna put
the link in the description to the
github repository so feel free to clone
it fork it do what you want with it
