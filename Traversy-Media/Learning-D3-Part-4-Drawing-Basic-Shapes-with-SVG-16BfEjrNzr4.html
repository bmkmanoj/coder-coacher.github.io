learning d3 series in this video we're
going to talk about SVG or scalable
vector graphics and SVG is heavily used
in the d3 library because it allows us
to create really complex shapes and just
do a lot more visually than we could
with HTML and CSS alright so we're going
to what I'm gonna do is just show you
the SVG at its core I'm just using the
SVG tags right in the HTML and then
we'll move on to drawing shapes using d3
and SVG together alright so what we're
gonna do here is just create an SVG tag
and this is like the canvas you could
think of it as we're gonna give it a
width of 400 and it's give it a height
of 400 and we can also add a style
attribute and let's just highlight the
background so I'm gonna say background
and we'll make it light gray add the
closing tag
and now if we reload now you can see
where our SVG canvas is okay so we can
go ahead and draw different shapes on
this canvas let's do a rectangle just
because I think that's the easiest thing
to do so we can use the Rex tag and
we'll set a width let's set that to 300
and we'll set a height to 300 and style
let's give it let's say you can say fill
and let's say RGB you don't have to use
RGB values here but I'm gonna I'm just
gonna make it red all right and we also
want stroke and for that let's do RGB
and we'll set that to black and then we
need to define a stroke width and the
stroke is just the border so for that
let's say 3 pixels
and I'm sorry just three and that should
do it so let's close that up now if we
reload what do they do
Phil oops I'm sorry we don't need these
quotes for us a habit okay so now we
have a square that's 300 PI by 300 wide
it has a stroke of three pixels let's go
and change that to one okay so now we
have a stroke of one pixel and it starts
right here okay now if we want to move
this over we can do that pretty easily
we could set an X value and let's set
that to 100 and you'll see that it
pushed it over a hundred pixels let's
actually set it to 50 that way it's
right in between all right so the x
value is horizontal and if we want to
move it down we'll give it a Y value and
we'll say 50 for that as well and now
you can see it's in the middle of the
SVG element or the SVG canvas
all right so that's a rectangle if we
want to do a circle we could do that as
well let's just add another SVG actually
I'm just gonna copy this and let's just
get rid of the rectangle tag and I'm
gonna do a circle and we'll set let's
see we're gonna set CX to 50 and see why
I'm gonna set that to 50 as well and
then we need to give it a radius we'll
give it a radius of 40 let's set the
stroke to black so you can see we can
set the stroke like this or we can do it
in the style like we did here all right
and then we can set stroke width let's
set that to 1 and we can set our fill
and we can set that to let's say yellow
all right so I think a lot of people
find this way easier you know putting
just the attributes rather than putting
it all in a style tag so let's save that
and reload so there we have our yellow
circle and the CX and CY is the x and y
axis so if we want to go more than 50
let's say 250 and 250 and that's going
to move that down
all right so I don't want to get too
much into just just SVG I want to show
you how to do it with d3 so that's all
we're gonna do for now with that so
let's go ahead and just comment that out
all right and all we want in our HTML is
our element so let's say div id equals
let's just call it element alright and
then we're going to add our script tags
okay and what we're gonna do is select
the body so I'm gonna say d3 select we
want the body
and then we're gonna have what we're
gonna do is append an SVG element so let
us say append SVG and I'm just gonna
save this just to clear this out all
right and then what we're gonna do is
for this SVG we're going to set some
attributes so we can use the adder and
let's set width and we'll set that to
400 and let's set the height 400 and a
style so we'll set the background and
it'll set it to like gray just like you
did before and now if we reload we get
that same SVG canvas that we had before
only we're using d3 all right so let's
go ahead and append a rectangle
now I'm going to try to kind of mimic
what we did up here we set the width and
height to 300 so let's do that
so set width to 300 set the height to
300 all right and then we want the x and
y values so X was 50 and Y was also 50
and we can fill it do that we're going
to do dot style and it'll set Phil to
read alright and then we can also set
the stroke so I'm just going to copy
that and change that to stroke set it to
black and we also want the stroke with
and let's set that to 1 and let's go
ahead and save that and there we go we
have the same exact thing that we did
here except we're using d3 now we could
go ahead and do this over and put
something next to it but we can also
stay on this SVG element if we want so
what we're going to do here is let's do
d3 dot select and we want to select the
SVG and let's do dot append and we're
going to append a circle and you'll say
dot adder and I'll do CX set that to 100
this one will be CY we'll set that to a
hundred as well and then we need our
radius save 50 and let's give it a fill
we'll fill it with blue and there's our
circle okay if we want to move it a
little bit let's change that to 200 and
there we go all right so I think that's
a good place to stop I just wanted to
kind of introduce you to drawing simple
shapes with SVG we're not going to need
to know much more than that to be able
to build what we're going to build
alright so in the next video
we're going to go ahead and build a bar
chart using SVG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
