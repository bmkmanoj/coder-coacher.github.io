front-to-back we're going to be working
with files and folders and file paths
alright this is actually a very powerful
part of PHP is is working with the file
system and being able to write to files
and create them and read from them and
so on so I've created a new folder
called website 7 in the PHP sandbox and
I just have an empty index.php file
alright so in here I'm going to just put
in my PHP tags and first thing we're
going to do is look at a couple
functions that work with file file paths
so let's say we want to return the file
name with the file extension so I'm just
going to create a variable here with a
path to a file so we'll say slash there
are one slash we'll just call this my
file dot PHP all right so let's say we
want to get the file name so we could
use a function called base name and I'm
going to just comment this file really
good so you guys have this as a
reference so this is going to return
file name so we'll say echo base name
and we'll pass in the path ok we'll open
it up over here local host PHP sandbox
web site seven and we get my file dot
PHP ok so it looked at this it knows
that this is the path it knows that this
is the file name alright now if we
wanted to get just the file name without
the PHP extension we can do that as well
we'll say return filename without
extension so for that we can just we'll
just say echo base name path and then
we'll just add another parameter and say
dot PHP so let's just comment this out
here and save that reload and we just
get my file ok so that's how you can get
it without the file extension
all right so the next function we're
going to look at is their name and what
that will do is it will return the
directory name from the path so let's
say echo der name and let's just put
something in here actually we'll just
put that file I mean that path variable
okay it's reload and we get slash door 1
so it looks at this it knows again this
is the file name but it gives us the
path ok as opposed to base name which
gave us the file so even if we were to
put more than one level here if we were
to say do that and reload it will give
us 0 dyrone alright so what I want to do
now is I want to create a file so let's
go in website seven I'm going to create
a text file and from here let's just say
hello world and we'll save this as file
1 dot txt I don't know why it takes a
couple seconds to create that it's weird
okay so let's let's say we want to check
to see if this if that file actually
exists so there's a function called file
underscore exist that we can use so file
underscore exists and we're going to
pass in here file 1 dot txt actually
know what I'll do is to put variable up
here and set that to file 1 dot txt and
then I'll just put that in here all
right so let's go ahead and reload that
and we get a 1 it's looking in the
current directory for file 1 if I were
to change this to file 2 and reload
we're going to get false or nothing ok
so you could put this in an if statement
and check for it as well
okay so that's file exists just going to
continue to comment this stuff out and
let's let's look at real path okay so
what what real path will do is it gets
the absolute path so the it gets the
whole thing not just the relative path
so let's say echo real path and we'll
pass in file and reload and we get
nothing that's because there is no file
- so let's change that back to file 1
and now you can see it gets from the
absolute route I'm on Windows so it's
looking in the C Drive into xampp htdocs
PHP sandbox website 7 and file 1 dot txt
alright now we have another function
called is file and what that does is it
checks to see if file ok so let's do
echo is file file ok so let's see what
that gives us that gives us a 1 just
like file exists the difference between
these is that we can use file exists for
a folder as well so if we create a new
folder we'll just call it test and we
run out say is file test and reload we
get nothing we get false if we do file
exists oops
file exists
and reload we get one okay because it
will return one even if it's a folder is
file will not that's the difference all
right so another thing we can do is we
can check if a file is writable okay so
let's do echo is underscore writable and
we'll pass in our file variable which is
file 1 dot txt and reload and we get a 1
now if I go to my operating system and
go to the file 1 dot txt and I go to
properties and then set it to read-only
and go back and reload we get false
because now it's not writable ok let me
just change that back and in addition to
that you can also do is readable ok so
if you had some kind of permissions on
that made the file not readable that's
going to return it's going to return
false another thing we can do is get the
file size so if we say echo and as a
function called file size and we'll go
and reload and we get 11 and if we go to
that file and let's look at the
properties here you'll see that the size
is 11 bytes ok so what I want to do now
is give you some functions that can
manipulate the file system we can create
directories and files and copy them
rename them do different things like
that so first one we'll take a look at
will be to create a directory or folder
and that's going to be MK dir just as
you would do in the terminal
alright so let's say make directory and
let's see I'm going to delete that test
direct folder that we created
and let's make one called testing okay
so if we save that and we go and reload
and now see over here a testing folder
was just created so that's that pretty
easy another thing that we can do is we
can delete a directory so the the rmdir
command will delete a directory as long
as there's no files in it so let's say
rmdir testing and let's reload and
you'll see that that is now deleted all
right so this will remove directory if
not empty or if empty sorry oops okay
let's see what else can we do here let's
uh I don't want to get into creating a
file just yet let's copy a file so let's
say we want to take file1.txt which has
hello world in it and we want to copy it
to another file or basically take it and
create another file with it with the
same content so to do that we can use
the copy command so let's do echo copy
and we'll take this takes two parameters
first one is going to be the file we
want to copy second one is going to be
the file we want to create from it so
we're going to take file 1 and we're
going to create file 2 with the same
content so let's reload and now you can
see it created file 2 text which has
hello world in it all right we can also
rename a file so let's say rename and
we'll take file 2 dot txt and let's
rename it to my file dot txt ok we'll
reload and now you can see file 2 is
changed to my file dot txt still as
HelloWorld in it
okay say rename file okay we can also
delete a file and we can do that with
the unlink command so let's say unlink
and we'll pass in here my file dot txt
go ahead and reload and now my file txt
is gone so you can see we can do pretty
much anything in terms of creating and
copying and all that stuff now let's say
we want to read what's in the file and
output it on to the screen in our
browser so it's a write write from file
to string so for that we can use
something called file get contents so
let's do echo file underscore get
underscore contents and then the file
name I'm just going to put in the
variable we have which is file 1 dot txt
and we'll save that and reload and we
get hello world ok so this will take
whatever file we pass in and just echo
it out into the browser now we can also
write a string to the file so let's do
that so for that we can use file put
contents ok it's going to take the file
name and then it's going to take what we
want to pass in so let's say goodbye
world okay I'll run that and it that
what it passes us back if we echo this
out is I believe that's the file size
let me just check that yeah that's the
file size but if we look in file 1 now
you'll see goodbye world
now notice it didn't just add this to
the
file it replaced what was there which
was hello world now if we wanted to
append to this instead of replace it we
have to do something a little different
so I'm going to go ahead and just put
hello world back and then what we'll do
is first we'll get it and then we'll
append onto it and then put it back so
let's say we'll say current and set that
to file get contents okay and then what
we'll do is take that current and then
we'll append with dot equals will append
space and then goodbye world and then
what we have to do is put it back so
file put contents and then we're going
to pass in here the file name and then
current okay so let's go ahead and run
that and now if we go back to file one
text we get hello world goodbye world
which I misspelled but that's fine all
right so that's all we have to do to
append now there's a lot of other things
that you can do with files but what I
want to show you next is to use the F
open command so basically what that will
do is we it allow us to put a file into
a variable called a handle and then we
can run continuous functions on that
handle so let me give you an example
let's say let's say we want to open a
file for reading
so we could say handle and set that to F
open and then we'll pass in the file
name okay and that actually takes
another parameter which is what you want
to do with it whether you want to write
to it read to it both we're going to put
an R because we want to read to freed
from it
and then we'll say data equals and then
we're going to use a command called F
read and then pass in the handle and
then we can pass in the file size and
pass in the file name like that okay and
then we'll take that data and let's just
echo it reload and we get what we have
written written in the file I'm just
going to fix that okay so that is F open
and F read now we can also write to a
file this way let's say open file for
writing so again we're going to create a
handle and set that to F open pass in
the file name except this time we want
to write to it and then let's say we
want to I guess we could create a
variable called text and we'll just say
I don't know John Doe and then we can
use F right and we're going to pass in
the handle and then pass in the text and
then you should also close the file when
you're done so for that you can use F
close and just pass in here the handle
all right we should do that up here too
all right I'm actually going to let's
let's not use file one we can create the
file from doing this as well so instead
of that let's say file - dot txt alright
so that should create the file right to
it and then close it so save
and reload and now over here if you look
we have file to dot text and it has John
Doe in it okay and we can continuously
write to this if we want so let's say we
have text equals Steve Smith we could
again do the F right so now if we reload
and go to file - we get John Doe Steve
Smith now if we wanted to put this on a
new line we could use a newline
character here so actually you know what
let's use double quotes here because if
we use double quotes we can put this
right in like that
okay backslash n do the same thing here
okay so we'll reload and go to file -
txt and now you can see they're on
different lines all right guys so I
think that's going to be it for now you
get quite a few different functions here
that pertain to files and folders so I
would encourage you to experiment with
it maybe create your own little
application that logs data to a text
file or something like that maybe use a
form maybe create a form that you can
make a post request and then have that
data log to the file or something like
that I don't know I'm just giving you
some ideas alright so thanks for
