weekend and as you guys know on the
weekends I like to put together really
small front-end projects that are pretty
useful and you know teach you a bit
about vanilla JavaScript and HTML and
CSS and all that so we're going to be
building a weight converter that's going
to take in an input of pounds and then
give us back the the equivalent in grams
kilograms and ounces and we'll also be
using bootstrap for for the UI so this
is it right here we have an HTML 5
number input we can either enter in
numbers or we can use the arrow keys if
I go ahead and I either click the arrows
or enter a number you'll see that we get
this these cards these are bootstrap 4
cards with the equal weight in grams
kilograms and ounces you'll see each
time I click this it'll change it's very
reactive if I go ahead and I type in a
number it'll also do it as well
all right so that's what we'll be
building let's go ahead and get started
so if you guys really like my videos and
you learn a lot from them and maybe you
have a couple extra dollars to spare
check out my patreon page I'm working on
creating special content for patrons you
also get special deals on future courses
and there's even an email support here
for all YouTube videos and projects to
learn more visit patreon.com slash
travis e media alright guys so we're
going to go ahead and get started now I
think you're going to be surprised when
you see how little JavaScript we
actually need for this app we only need
about ten lines or so most of the the
markup most of the code we're writing is
going to be HTML markup with bootstrap
classes okay now we didn't have to use
bootstrap but I figured it's a good
opportunity to kind of give you give you
an example of building a very simple UI
with bootstrap for all right so let's
get started I have a folder called
weight converter with a blank index.html
file that's the only file we're going to
need for this project and I have it open
on my localhost and I'm able to do this
because I'm using the atom text editor
and I'm using a package called atom live
server which just opens whatever folder
you're in on your localhost and of
course you don't need this you can just
open up index.html on your filesystem
you also
don't need to use atom you can use
Visual Studio code or sublime or
whatever it is that you like to use all
right so let's go ahead and get started
I'm also using a plug-in called
Emmet which allows me to use HTML
shortcuts for example I can do an
exclamation and then hit tab and it's
going to give me the HTML head and body
layout with some meta tags just kind of
a starter boilerplate alright so for the
title here let's change that to weight
convertor and we're going to be using
bootstrap
4 so I'm going to grab the CDN for that
search for bootstrap for CDN and CVN
stands for content delivery network and
it's just a remote version of bootstrap
so we don't actually have to download it
and include it should be right here so
let's grab that paste that in it's just
a link to the bootstrap CSS file
currently bootstrap 4 is in alpha 6 so
yours may be different depending on when
you're watching this but it should be
the latest version at this URL alright
so now that we did that let's go ahead
and start with our markup so in the body
let's so let's create a container div so
I'm going to just do dot container tab
and that's Emmet working right there
when I say dot container tab it gives me
a div with the class of container of
course if you don't have Emmet you know
you're going to have to type this out
but when you see me do that that's
because I'm using that plug-in alright
now in the container what that does is
it pushes everything into the middle but
I want this to be a really narrow app so
what I'm going to do is use the grid
system and I'm going to I'm going to put
everything into a six column grid and
then just offset it to the center so
let's create a div with the class of row
and then we're going to do a div with
the class of call MD - six okay so six
column div and in here let's go ahead
and put our h1 and I'm going to give
this h1 actually a class of display -
those are three display three and then
it's also giving a class of text Center
all right and then we'll just say wait
Converter okay we'll save that and there
we go all right make this a little you
know what let's do display for looks
display for should be that's a little
smaller all right and I'm also going to
add some style tags in the head area
because I just want to add a couple
things first of all for the body I want
to add a margin top I just want to bring
it down let's say 70 pixels and let's
also make the background actually I
won't do that just yet let's just do the
large and top just pushes it down a
little all right and then under the h1
we're going to put our form okay so
let's put a form no action attribute or
anything like that and then in this form
we're going to have a div with the class
of form group which is a bootstrap class
we're going to have a label I don't need
a for attribute actually you know what
we don't even need a label let's just
put the input so input with a type of
text I'm actually going to give it a
class of form control - LG which is
basically going to format it to look
nice with bootstrap it's also going to
make it a little bigger with the LG
alright let's see what else do we want
here let's actually change this from a
text to a number input and we'll go
ahead and save that let's see why is
that not just oh we also need a class of
form control like that there we go all
right we'll add a placeholder as well so
we'll just say enter pounds there we go
and let's see what else we need here I
think that's it for the actual it's
given an ID this input I'm actually
going to just put all these attributes
on a separate line
all right so give it an ID as well so
give it an idea of lbs input all right
because we're going to need something to
grab on to when we create our event
listener so there's our forum now we
want is down here we want an output for
everything so under the forum let's
create a div and I'm going to give this
an ID of output and in here we're going
to have some cards okay so the cards are
going to be the results so the grams the
kilograms the bounces are all going to
be in their own card so let's create a
div with a class of card they're also
going to have a class of card block okay
so in the card block we're going to have
an h4 and this is going to be grams and
then we need an output for the result
because it's going to get calculated in
JavaScript and then we're going to
output it to to a div so let's give this
a class let's call it what did I call it
grams output all right lips I mean to
the class it should be an ID okay and
then we're going to do the same thing
for kilograms and ounces so we're going
to copy the card here paste that in once
again and let's change this to kilograms
and then we're going to change this to
kg output and then this is going to be
ounces and we'll set this to oszi output
all right and that should be our
interface all right now I do want to
give it a dark background and I also
want to give these cards a color for
each one to kind of separate them so
let's go back up to the style and in the
body we're going to say background set
it to triple three and we're going to
set the color to white okay now notice
we can't see the text in the cards
that's because the background is white
so what we're going to do is just add a
class to each one of these divs that
have the class of card this one's going
to be card -
primary that'll make it blue actually I
want the first one to be tired primary
and then the second one we're going to
do card what I do for the second one
success which will make it green and
then this one will be card - danger
which will make it red and there we go
now I do want a little bit of spacing
between these so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use the bootstrap class of
MB - - that'll give it a margin bottom
same thing here MB - and we'll do it on
this last one as well and that will
separate them a little bit all right
let's also put a little bit of spacing
under the heading so we'll just add MB
300 for the h1 all right so there's our
interface and now we need to work on the
JavaScript all right now when we start
to type in here if we start to type a
number or we click the up arrow we need
an event listener for that okay and the
event type we're going to listen for is
actually called input so let's go down
to right above the body tag and we're
going to put in our script tags all
right and we want to first of all grab
we want to grab the the input remember
we gave it an ID of lbs input so what
we'll do is we'll say document dot get
element by ID we want to grab the
element with the idea of lbs input and
then we want to add an event listener so
add event listener okay we want to
listen for an input event and then we're
going to run a function alright just
test that out let's say console dot log
and I'll just say one two three okay
let's go over here and hit f12 open up
our console and I start to type a number
oops and you'll see down here one two
three if I click an arrow that is also
firing off that function now what we
want to do here is we want to get
whatever
we're putting into this input so let's
create a variable I'm just going to call
it pounds and we're going to set it to
first of all we need to pass in an event
parameter and then we can say e dot
target dot value all right and then
let's just console dot log pounds okay
so now whatever I type in here you can
see it's logging it down here and if I
click the arrow it does the same thing
so that gets the input now what we want
to do is we want to target these
different outputs for instance the grams
the kg and then we want to output the
equivalent and we can do that by
selecting them by their ID so it's a
document dot get element by ID and we
want grams output and then we just want
to set inner HTML so the inner content
we're going to set that equal to
actually you know what let's change
pounds to lbs so we're going to set that
equal to lbs and then we just need to do
a little bit of math so we want to do
lbs divided by zero point zero zero two
204 six and that's going to convert
pounds to grams okay
so let's go ahead and save that and now
if I click the up arrow you'll see grams
now works every time we fire off that
event it's going to do that translation
and it's going to output it to the grams
output all right now we just need to do
the same thing for kilograms and ounces
so we're going to just copy this here
you know what I need to wrap this so you
guys can see the whole friggin thing
let's see toggle soft wrap why is that
not working
oh I did have it wrapped all right I
guess I can just make it a little bigger
yeah because this is completely
responsive so all right so again copy
this paste that in two more times this
one's going to be the kg output remember
we've used that as a as an ID and then
we need to do the correct conversion
which is going to be lbs divided by two
point two zero four six okay that's
going to give us kilograms and then for
the ounces output let's change this to
OC output and for that we just need to
do pounds times sixteen all right
so let's save that let's go ahead and
just put a 1 in here and there we go
okay so one pound is 16 ounces everyone
most people know that and then we have
the conversion for grams and kilograms
all right so our application is now
working now one last thing i want to do
is when we first come to the application
i don't want to show these cards here so
remember we gave it an ID of output
wrapped around all the cards what i'm
going to do is when we first enter the
application let's go ahead and let's set
document dot get element by d of output
and what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to set the style dot visibility
and I'm going to set that to hidden look
alright so if we save now it's going to
disappear now if we leave it like that
it's going to stay hidden but what we'll
do is when that of that event fires off
we're going to set it to display visible
again so we'll just copy this and we'll
go right here right in the function and
then we're going to set this to visible
all right so now if we go and we enter
something now there it's going to show
up all right and we can type in numbers
as well so that's it guys we have
created a weight converter
now oh you know what one last thing we
need to offset this because I want it to
be in the middle so let's go up here and
just add two right here we have the call
md6 we're just going to add in call our
offset m md3 i think that's yeah there
we go so now it's right in the middle
all right now I'm going to give you guys
a little homework and I want you to try
and try and kind of transform this
application into something where we can
add kilograms or grams or ounces and
also get pounds back
okay there's there's a lot of different
ways you can do this you could have a
select list that's going to you know
select if you want this to be pounds or
grams or whatever you could you could
add other text inputs underneath it and
you could have pounds and then another
input for kilograms and another for
grams and so on there's a lot of
different things you could do so I want
you to just think about it and and try
to figure that out and then feel free to
post the link in the description too to
what you've created from it all right I
want to start doing kind of an
interactive assignment type type videos
and I think this I think it's a pretty
good idea to get you know to get the
community involved and so people can see
other people's work and so on all right
so that's going to be it for this video
