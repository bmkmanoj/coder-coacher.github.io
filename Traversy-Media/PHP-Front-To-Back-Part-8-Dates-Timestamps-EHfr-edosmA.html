front-to-back project or not project bug
video and in this video we're going to
be talking about date okay we're going
to look at the date function which is a
very important function as well as a
couple others so I'm going to create a
new file here and let's go ahead and
let's save this as date dot PHP okay I'm
just going to go on my browser to local
host PHP sandbox slash date dot PHP so
let's throw in our tags and let's go
ahead and just echo out date the date
function and see what happens so by
default it's going to give us a warning
because we didn't put any parameters in
so it doesn't know what to give us we
can basically dissect to the date and
time and return whatever we want from it
okay so if we were to put in a lowercase
D that's going to give us well that's
going to give us the day so let's try
that you can see I get oh one and the
date today is March 1st 2017 so it gives
us the number of the day we can also do
the month comment that out and for this
let's say month and reload and we get 3
okay because it's March if we want to
get the year we can do an uppercase Y
and that's the year so it's comment this
out and that should give us 2017 we can
even get the day of the week so if we
say echo date and we use a lowercase L
that'll give us
day of the week okay so if we reload
that we get Wednesday okay so now we can
combine these as well which is usually
what you want to do so let's do echo dig
and let's say we want the format of year
month date so let's do Y / m / B and if
we take a look at that it gives us 2017
3-1 okay if we want to use the format
month/day/year then we can just do month
day year okay and you can use whatever
you want in hand for instance if you
wanted to use dashes or hyphens you
could do that as well okay whatever you
want so in addition to working with date
the date function also works with time
so if we want to say echo date and let's
pass in here and H that will give us the
hour all right so let's reload and it
gives us o - now that's actually wrong
for me and I'll tell you why and I'll
play how to fix it in a second I just
want to show you that we can also do the
minutes okay so minute is going to be an
I call it that out okay so that gives us
five and then we can also get the
seconds with an S
gives us 50 and then we can also get
whether it's am rpm with an a comment
that out and save that reload and we get
PM okay so we can also combine these
together so let's do echo the echo date
and pass in here I'll say H pull in I :
s a so let's see what that gives us so
that gives us two oh six pm in 24
seconds now if you look at my time down
here it's actually eight oh six a.m.
so what we need to do is define the
timezone okay because for some reason my
system my PHP and my xampp is set to a
different time zone so it's a set time
zone and for that we used 8 underscore
default underscore our time zone get or
set rather if we want to get it we can
use get and here you want to put the
time zone so in my case is America / new
underscore York ok for the semicolon and
you load see that's invalid oh this
shouldn't be a space there should be a
slash okay so now we get the correct all
right so we can also make date and times
so I'm going to show you a function
called make time or m'kay time what I'm
going to do is set a variable called
time stamp and we're going to set this
to m'kay time and I'm going to set let's
say 1014 54 9
n and then 1981 so this is actually my
birthday so it's hours minutes seconds
month/day/year okay so let's see what
that gives us if we say echo timestamp
it gives us the string of numbers all
right you might not have been expecting
that you're probably expecting a date
well a timestamp what's that is let me
just paste this in a UNIX timestamp is a
long integer containing the number of
seconds between the UNIX epoch which is
January 1st 1970 and then to the
specified time - to whatever today is or
whatever not in this case in this case -
whatever this is ok so that's the number
of seconds that have passed since that
date and that gives us an exact time
that we can use all around the world ok
now if we want to change this to an
actual readable date we can do that okay
we can do that using the date function
so let's do echo date and let's say we
want it in the format of month day year
and then we can pass in a second
parameter of a timestamp guys let's pass
that in and then we reload and we get 9
10 81
ok we could also add on H I a and it
also gives us the time okay so we can
make a timestamp with make time and then
we can convert that into a readable date
using the date function all right so the
next function we're going to look at is
string - time or STI - time and it just
does just that'll take a string and turn
it into a time and there's a whole bunch
of different strings we can use or
different formats we can use so let's
say time stamp - and we'll set it to STI
- time and here let's input show your
single quotes let's do 7 o'clock p.m.
I'll say March 22nd 2016 okay so that's
a string now if we echo out timestamp -
let's see what we get we get a timestamp
for that date all right and then we can
take that timestamp and we can put it
through the date function so let's echo
date and let's see we'll just grab this
formatting right here and actually I
will do this time as well I mean yeah
the time and then it's going to take a
second parameter of timestamp - all
right let's take a look at that we want
to comment this out though and that
gives us three 22 2016 7 p.m. now the
string that we passed in here is very
specific but we can be much more vague
so let's say time stamp 3 and I'll sort
of - string to time and in here let's
just put the string tomorrow and I'll
change this right here to time stamp 3
reload and it gives us tomorrow's date
today's the first and it's giving us a
second okay we can also do days of the
week so for instance I'm just going to
copy this and it's changed out the
timestamp for and then let's say next
Sunday it'll actually take that and give
us a date change this to a timestamp for
reload now we get 3/5 it's going to give
us the next the next coming Sunday ok we
can also do let's say plus 2 months
times 10 to 5 reload and it gives us two
months from now we could also do plus
two days or years or anything like that
ok so it's very flexible as to what you
can pass in here and get a timestamp
from all right so those are the basics
if you want to look into this more to
look at how you can format dates then I
suggest you go to the documentation so
you could go to php.net slash manual
slash English for me and then function
dot and then you can look up any
function so date dot PHP ok and then
down here you can see all the different
formatting rules that we can use I only
showed you a couple of them but there's
actually a ton of them alright so you
may want to check that out and there's
some examples as well but yeah the
documentation for PHP is pretty damn
good it has definitely saved me and
helped me quite a few times ok so that's
it for this video guys we will be using
you know we'll be using dates throughout
the series so that's going to wrap it up
and thanks for watching and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
