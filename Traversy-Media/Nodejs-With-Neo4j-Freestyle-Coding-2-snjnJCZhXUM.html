you how to use the neo4j driver for
nodejs alright so if you don't know what
neo4j is it's a graph database and I
have a pretty decent video on it called
neo4j graph database and cipher so if
you want to check that out it's about 40
minutes long and I show you I go over
what a graph database is I show you how
to install it in Windows and how to get
a simple database up and running much
like this one alright so right now I'm
in neo4j browser and I just created some
nodes some movie nodes actors and
directors and just added some really
simple relationships between them so for
example we have al pacino right here
which is an actor node and we have some
movie nodes that he's he has a
relationship to using the acted in
relationship all right and then we have
some directors can see right here we
have Francis Ford Coppola and he has a
directed relationship with the movie The
Godfather alright and we also have
Robert Nero which is another actor
related to the Godfather movie with the
acted in relationship alright so I'm not
going to go over this stuff too much I
just want to show you how to use the
driver we're not going to create an
in-depth application I just want to get
and Express a nodejs and Express service
set up and implement the driver and
interact with the database so what I'm
going to do is going to go to where I
want to create my application which is
going to be in my C Drive and then
projects and I'm going to create a new
folder and let's call this neo movies ok
now I want to open my command line
as administrator okay then we're going
to go to that folder all right now what
I want to do is generate a package.json
file to do that I can run NPM in it and
if you don't have node no js' installed
and NPM you just want to go to node.js
org go ahead and download it and install
it and you should be all set all right
so let's go ahead and just click enter
here for the entry point I'm going to do
a BAS the rest is fine okay so that
should have created a package.json file
I'm going to go ahead and open my editor
and let's see I want a new window and
I'm using Visual Studio code which is a
nice free editor if you want to use that
or whatever you like alright so I'm
going to go ahead and open folder and I
want to open Neal movies and you can see
we have a package.json file all right
next thing we're going to do is set up
our dependencies so let's go right here
and say dependencies ok we're going to
be using Express use Express for our
routes and things like that want the
latest version we also want body parser
okay we're going to be using eg a s for
our template which is embedded
JavaScript and for that I'm going to say
version two point four point two and
we're also going to use Morgan which is
a logger and then finally we need the
neo4j driver which is going to be neo4j
- driver we'll get the latest version
all right so those are our dependencies
let's go ahead and save that and go back
into the command prompt and we're going
to run npm install okay that'll get all
those dependencies set up alright so now
that that's set up what we're going to
do is create an app j/s file ok let's
add Express we're also going to add path
which is a core module and logger
which is Morgan and body posture okay
we'll add the node in the neo4j driver
after I set after the server setup
alright so now we're going to initialize
our applet Express okay we also want to
set up the view engine so for that we're
going to do app dot set views and we're
going to use path dot join here what
we're doing here is just saying that we
want to use a folder called views to
hold our views all right then we need to
set the engine so view engine is going
to be ejs all right now we get some some
other middleware that we want to add
here let me just grab that real quick
just your standard middleware for body
parser this line here we're saying that
our public folder is going to be a
folder called public alright our our
static folder so I don't think that
we'll need that but I mean it's good to
have just in case you want to use
bootstrap or jQuery something like that
image is something where you need a
static folder all right now let's sum
let's see we want to we want to do we
want to listen on a port here so we're
going to say app dot listen let's do
port 3000 and then we'll just do a
console dot log
all right and then we just want to
export there we go all right so the
server should now run let's save that
and we're going to go back over here and
say node app and you can see that it's
running on port 3000 so if we go to
localhost 3000 okay so the server is
running but we're getting this message
cannot get slash and that's because we
don't have a route set up for slash
which is the home page all right so
let's go right here and say app dot get
and we'll put in a slash and then a
function okay that function is going to
get a request and response and all we're
going to do is say res dot send and
we'll say it works all right now if I go
when I reload we have no change that's
because we need to restart the server
now if you don't want to have to keep
restarting it what you can do is you can
install node Mon so to do that we can
say npm install node mon and you want to
add - g for global that'll make it so
that you can use it from anywhere
alright so once that's done we should be
able to just say node mon and that'll
just kind of watch it for us so if we
reload we get it works alright so now
that that's up and running I'm just
going to make this smaller
all right so now that's up and running
what I'm going to do is implement the
driver so let's go right up here and
create a variable called neo4j and I'm
going to set that to require neo4j -
driver okay so once we have that we need
to let's go right above where our route
is and create a variable called driver
and this is where we can connect to
neo4j now we connect using the bolt
protocol which is I believe it was new
to version 3.0 of neo4j so what to do
that I'm going to say neo4j dot driver
and here we're going to pass in bolt : /
/ localhost and so let's see second next
parameter is going to be your
authentication for your neo4j server so
we can say neo4j
dot auth dot basic and then I'm going to
pass in the username which is neo4j for
me and for you if you didn't change it
and then whatever you made your password
alright and that should allow you to
connect ok then after that we need to
create a session variable so that's
going to be set to driver dot session
all right oh one thing I did forget is
up here where we require neo4j driver we
actually want to add dot v1 all right at
least at this time we need to do that
okay so now we should be able to start
making queries all right so now let me
just bring over a page from the
documentation here all right so we've
done this we've done this in this so now
to run a query what we need
do is use that session variable and then
use run the run method you can see here
they're creating a person node I don't
want to create anything just yet I just
want to fetch some data so let's go into
our route here our home route and we'll
say session dot run and then after that
will be dot then let's check this out so
then and then catch that's what we'll
catch any hours all right so let's go
into run and I'm going to put in query
will say match let's get some movies so
we'll say n movie and then we're going
to return and limit 25 all right so
that's just the query as as simple as
that now we need to do is add a function
call back function in here and that's
going to take a result and then we
should be able to loop through that
result by saying result dot records dot
for each alright and then inside here
we'll have a function and that's going
to take a parameter called record and
then let's just do console dot log
record alright so before we run that
let's just go down to our catch and put
in function it's going to take an error
and we're just going to console.log the
error if there is any alright so we'll
save it and then let's go to our console
and let's see what's this no such file
or directory huh
not sure what that means let's restart
this okay so it looks like it's working
now what we want is in fields this
underscore fields you can see there's an
object we want the properties object so
let's go right here and we'll say
console.log record dot underscore fields
0 dot properties let's try that and
there we go so you can see we're
fetching the movies we're getting the
year and the title alright and if we
wanted to change this query let's say
actor reload and then we get the actors
if we want we could take just take off
the label completely if we want to get
all nodes and there we go we can get
we're getting movies actors and
directors all right so we know the
driver is installed and set up correctly
now you probably don't want to just
console.log this stuff you want to bring
it into your application all right so
we're going to have to render a view for
that so let's go down to where we have
res send and
let's see we don't even use me we don't
even want this down here anyway we want
this stuff to happen up in the then call
back alright so let's go right after the
for each which ends right here so we'll
go right here and say res dot render and
so let's see let's render index okay
save that and then we need to create a
folder called views and inside there
we're going to create a file called
index dot ejs and let's just do let's
put a heading in here we'll say movies
save it make sure that works alright and
then what we want to do is though the
way that it's constructed your result is
a little weird so what I'm going to do
is I want to create a new object with
with the movies in it alright are an
array so let's go right under dot then
and create a new variable we'll call it
movie array and set that for now just to
an empty array all right and then down
here in the for each what we want to do
is you want to add to that array okay
through each iteration we want to add
each movie so we'll say movie array dot
push and let's pass in an object alright
now we can actually get the ID using
record dot underscore fields 0
dot identity
what is it identity dot Lo and I'll give
us the actual ID all right and then we
want the name so what I'm going to do is
copy this right here or cut it and then
just get rid of that and let's see title
and then we'll just say dot title and I
want to actually want to change this
back to movie all right and then we also
want the year so for that we'll grab
this paste that in dot year all right so
we're constructing this array of movies
and then what we want to do is we want
to pass that array into our view so
let's go right here and it'll say movies
is going to equal movie array
all right so we'll save that and then
let's go into our view and we're going
to use ejs syntax which is less than
percent and then we'll say movies dot
for each and in this for each goes a
function okay and let's pass in what we
want to use as a variable will use movie
and we need to make sure we end these
both of these lines
all right and then we should have access
to each movie so let's go ahead and just
do let's do a ul here and then inside
here we'll have allies and we should be
able to say movie dot title hopefully ok
let's save that and reload and there we
go we're bringing in all the movies from
neo4j now let's see we want to get the
actors as well if we wanted if we're
going to do that let's go back to AB KS
and we're going to have to nest our set
our run calls our session runs so let's
go down to where we have our view and
start look let's say session dot run
okay and then let's see in here we'll
say match ten actor and then return and
limit 25 okay and then den de then we're
going to have a function and I'm going
to get the results now for this I'm
going to use result to just because I
mean we probably could use result even
though use it up here but just to kind
of so it's not so confusing
we'll use result to alright and then
we're going to do the same thing we're
going to create an array so this one
will be actor array and then we can take
result two and say dot records dot for
each
and then I'm just going to copy what we
have right here and put that here okay
except we want to change this to actor
array and we only we don't want a year
or a title I'm going to change title to
name okay and then what we'll do is I'm
going to take the the render right here
and cut that out and put that up here
right under the for each right and then
we should be able to also pass along
actors
all right so let's save that and then go
back to our view and let's see I'm going
to copy this whole thing ok we'll change
that to actors and we're going to do
actors dot for each and this will be
actor dot name alright so now we're
getting the movies and the actors
alright so the next thing I want to do
is we want to be able to add movies from
our application so let's go right above
here and let's put a form so we'll just
have that's fine we'll put a label I
don't care about this looking good you
guys can can take can use bootstrap or
something to make it look a little
better but I'm just going to focus on
the functionality so it's not going to
be very pretty
alright so say movie name and give it a
type of text and a name of name let's do
movie name
okay then we'll put a line break and
we're also going to want the year then
we want a submit button okay let's look
at that it doesn't look very good but
that's alright let's actually put a line
break here and here alright so in the
form tag we want to add a method of post
it's going to be a post request and the
action will say slash movie slash ad all
right so now we want to go on the other
side and create that route so let's go
to app J s and go down here and say app
dot post
okay that's going to take a request and
response and let's see what do we need
to do we need to grab the values that
are in the form field so let's say var
name equals request body not movie name
and same with the year okay just to test
it out let's do console dot log I'll say
name and then we're just going to do a
redirect will say res dot redirect to
the home page alright so let's see if
that works
OOP
okay so let's just say tests cannot post
movie ad oh I didn't put the route okay
let's take a look at the console and we
get tests so we know that it's grabbing
that input so what we want to do now is
the same thing we need to have a session
with the run method so what I'll do is
just I'm not going to copy it I'll just
retype it so session dot run okay so in
here let's do create and and this is
going to be a movie so create an movie
and let's put in the title and we're
going to put a placeholder here just say
title / am okay you don't want to put
that you don't want to put it directly
in and let's put a comma and then we'll
say what else does a year year program
and then we're going to return will
return end dot title all right and then
over here we're going to need another
parameter and we'll say title / Ram is
going to equal the movie thought I put
name didn't I yeah you know what I'm
going to change this to title
I'm going to do it here and back in the
view right here I'm just going to get
rid of movie so it'll just be title in
year just to try to avoid confusion all
right and then down here we'll just
change that to title yeah all right and
then over here that can just be title
all right and we also want the year
params so we're going to put a comma
there all right so that's our query now
and then we need our function function
takes a result and we don't need to
really do anything here I'm just going
to redirect and we just want to close
the session with session dot close
alright let's go ahead and save it and
let's reload and let's put Independence
Day 2016 submit and there it is
Independence Day if we reload it's still
there and if we go to our neo4j browser
we should see it as well so let's reload
and click on this asterisk over here and
there it is Independence Day you can see
it has its year too
alright so we can now add we can now
read data from our neo4j database and we
can add data all right and as you
probably expect you can do the same
exact thing with actors and directors so
let's go ahead and do that let's add the
actors form so what we'll do let's put a
heading up here
change these to H threes okay and then
let's copy this form and this will be
add actor will have a go to slash actor
slash ad I think they just have a name
property so we don't need this
alright so there's our active form let's
go ahead and go to app J s and we're
going to do the same kind of thing I'm
just going to copy this okay we want to
get the name and let's change this query
to create if you don't understand these
queries at all then I would suggest got
watching the other Neil 4j video that I
have because that'll explain all of this
change this okay we don't need the year
and then over here let's return the name
get rid of that
all right so that should do it let's
save it and let's reload we'll add an
actor here let's say Jeff Goldblum
submit and there we go
so we can now add movies and actors now
obviously neo4j and graph databases are
the best when you're working with data
that's related to each other so what I'm
going to do is we're going to add
another form to add an actor to a movie
all right so let's go ahead and go to
our view and I'm going to just copy this
let's say add actor to movie and that's
going to go to movie slash actor slash
add okay so we want to add the movie
we're not going to need the years but we
are going to need that the actor name
all right so now let's go to app J s and
just going to copy this hope this isn't
getting too confusing and what was the
route I think it was movie slash actor
slash ad and then we want to get both
the title of the movie and the name of
the actor okay now this is going to be a
little different we're adding a
relationship
so let's totally clear this out this
query okay so we know we're going to
have a name and title so we can add
those and then for the query we're going
to do match okay so match a actor and we
want the name that's going to be set to
name / Ram
alright and then we're going to put a
comma here and then another set of
parentheses and then B movie that's also
going to have that's going to have a
title which will be titled program all
right and then we need to go right here
and do merge so we want to say merge a
and it's gonna have a relationship of
acted in to be alright and then we're
just going to return a.b alright so
that's how we can add a relationship
alright so hopefully that works let's go
ahead and save it alright now what I
want to do is I want to add Jeff
Goldblum to Independence Day because if
we look at the graph right now they
shouldn't be related ok so you can see
right here ok there's no relationship so
let's go ahead and try to add that so
movie Independence Day actor Jeff
Goldblum submit and then if we go back
to our graph well that didn't work let's
see what the console says name per am
not defined
not defined
oh I didn't put I didn't put curly
braces around this that should be yeah
like that same thing here
you guys probably notice that all right
let's try it again
okay
and there we go okay so you can see now
we have enacted in relationship between
Jeff Goldblum and Independence Day all
right so we can now read data we can add
it and we can also add relationship all
right so I'm going to go ahead and stop
here now that you can see how this works
how you can use the neo4j driver and
write queries I would suggest that you
keep going and maybe make it so that you
can click on one of these movies it'll
take you to a page and list all the
actors I might do that in the future I'm
not sure if you guys want me to do that
let me know in the comment section but
that's going to be it for now
hopefully you enjoyed it and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
