been following me for a while then you
know that I like to make crash courses
and I like to make crash courses on CSS
framework so bootstrap materialised
foundation and what we usually do is we
create a cheat sheet which is just kind
of a one-page HTML file that has all the
class names and all that stuff so you
can you can go back and you can
reference it and it's there for you when
you want to create your own projects so
we're gonna be doing this for skeleton
CSS which is a very very lightweight
simple responsive boilerplate or
framework and in addition to the cheat
sheet we're gonna build a landing page
okay which is very similar to the demo
landing page and the documentation the
reason I'm doing both is because the
cheat sheet is gonna be very small
because this is a very lightweight
framework it's not meant to be something
like bootstrap where you can build you
know an entire website with just those
classes with just the framework this is
more for like if you want a base of you
know not horrible looking buttons and
you know you want classes to float
things stuff like that but there's no
components like cards or alerts or
anything like that it's it's very
lightweight all right so that's what
we'll be doing in this video guys
hopefully you enjoy it and let's get
started
alright guys so I am envious code right
now and I have a folder called skeleton
crash and just a single index.html file
with nothing in it now I'm using live
server so if you want to use that with
vs code just go ahead and click on the
extensions icon search for it and
install it you should then be able to
right click and say open with live
server of course you don't need to use
that you can just simply open the HTML
file so what we're gonna do is put some
basic structure in here I'm using Emmet
so I can do exclamation tab and we're
going to change the title here let's say
skeleton CSS crash course
and we need to include skeleton so
there's a few ways we could do it we
could download it what I'm gonna do is
use the CDN so I'm going to search for a
skeleton CD n spelt that wrong it's
alright and then let's grab it from CD
nsj com
so we'll say copy link tag and we'll
just stick that in right above the title
and then I also want actually no I don't
want anything else right now when we get
to the the landing page I'm gonna use
font awesome as well but we don't need
that for now so this like I said this is
gonna be a cheat sheet I should actually
change this to cheat sheet and it's just
gonna include all the basic classes that
skeleton uses okay now what's nice about
skeleton is that there's not even a lot
of classes they just make things look a
little better by default okay so let's
start with just adding some headings all
right now I'm gonna comment this so
we're gonna put a bunch of headings in
here let's say h1 whoops so each one
will say heading and I'm just gonna copy
this so we'll do 1 2 3 4 5 6 and we'll
just change these to H 2 H 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 and
let's go ahead and save that and that's
what the headings will look like now if
we were not using skeleton if I take
away the link here that's the standard
HTML headings okay so you can see the
fonts change the size is changed and
there they just look cleaner alright so
next thing we're gonna look at is some
of the utility classes I want to look at
floating okay so if you're using just
HTML and CSS then you need to you know
add a float left or float right then you
need to add a class to clear with
skeleton we can simply we can add a
class of you pull left or you pull right
and then we can clear it with UCF okay
so let me show you what I mean so we'll
put an h2 in here I'm going to give this
a class of you - pull -
laughs okay now all of these utility
classes start with you - so that's left
and we'll go ahead and put another one
in here and this will be right okay no
if we save that you'll see that now we
have our h2s once to the left once to
the right now if we try to put content
under it it's gonna look all messed up
because it's not going to be cleared so
what you would do is just put a another
div under here and I'm gonna give it a
class of you - CF so clear flow all
right and then we'll save that and then
anything we put onto here will be
cleared from those floats okay
so let's take a look at buttons so when
you when you work with like bootstrap
and material not well not really
materialized but a lot of the different
frameworks have many types of buttons
many colors and sizes and all kinds of
stuff
skeleton basically just has two types
okay as the default white button and
then it has a primary color so what I'm
gonna do here is just put in a button
tag and we'll just say button and let's
save that and it's gonna look like this
automatically but notice we didn't have
to put any classes or anything it just
looks nice all right now we can do the
same thing with an input with the type
of submit so we'll just say submit and
I'll save and you can see that
automatically looks nice you know
compared to I'm saying compared to a
regular HTML button and we can also do a
in input with the class or not the class
but the type of button alright now if
you want a link to look like this then
you'll have to add an extra class of
button so in here we'll just say link
okay so now we have a link that's
formatted as a button now in addition to
this let's just put a line break here we
have primary buttons
so let's uh let's just copy these oops
copy those and we're just going to give
this a class this button we're gonna
give it a class of button - primary and
save and you'll see that it gives us
this light blue color it has a hover
effect as well so we just need to give
this class - both of these inputs
alright now for the link you can't just
do button primary if you do that it's
gonna look like this okay you need to
add button primary in addition to the
regular button class and then it will
give it that look okay now if you want a
like a block level button that goes all
the way across you can apply the utility
class you full width and this is not for
just buttons this is for anything that
you want to be full width so let's say
full width and I'm gonna say not just
for buttons so let's go ahead and put in
a button and we're gonna give this one a
class of you - full - width I'll just
say full width
button and you can see it goes all the
way across and of course we could also
add a class of button primary if we want
it to be a blue button or teal whatever
that color is okay now let's take a look
at lists now with lists there's not
there's not any special classes to do
like a list group like bootstrap has or
a collection like materialized has it's
just a basic UL it's just a basic list
but let's take a look at it anyway so
we'll put some allies in here let's go
say hello times four this is Emmett by
the way allowing me to do this and let's
say home about
services and contact all right so we
save that's what a default list is gonna
look like now I'm just gonna do
something real quick guys so you guys
don't have to look at the bottom of the
screen down here I'm going to put in a
div with an inline style you don't have
to do this I just don't want you guys to
have to look down here so I'm gonna add
a margin top of 500 pixels there we go
so now I can just scroll up alright so
that's a default list now we can also
have an a nested list so if we go inside
services and put a UL and we'll put an
li and we'll say web design programming
and save and it's gonna look like that
alright so nothing special but again it
looks better than the default HTML if we
were to take away skeleton and take a
look at this it looks horrid okay so
very minimal class usage here but it
still makes things look much better by
default alright so next thing is a code
block if for some reason you want to
display some code maybe you have a web
dev blog or something
say code blog so what we would do is use
the HTML pre tag and then the code tag
and then let's put in some CSS we'll say
body color white background black and
save and that's what a code block is
gonna look like alright so next thing
we'll look at is tables
okay so whips tables let's put in
actually no I wouldn't pay I'm gonna
paste this in just because I don't want
to waste time typing out a table okay so
we just have a name email on city and we
have two entries in the table so let's
save and that's what it looks like now
if you want this to go all the way
across that's easy we can just add the
utility class of you - full - width and
it goes all the way across all right so
that's tables let's take a look at forms
okay so what I'm gonna do is just paste
in a very basic form let's go through it
we just have a form each each label and
input is wrapped in a div tag no class
no form group class like bootstrap we
just have a name a membership this is a
select list a message which is a text
area and then a check box actually
shouldn't have that just yet a check box
and then a submit button so if we save
it it's gonna look like that which still
looks you know much better than a
standard HTML form with no classes
whatsoever now what you're probably
going to want to do is take the input
classes or I'm sorry input tags and add
a class of you full width all right and
what this does obviously you guys know
what this does it makes it all the way
across so it kind of makes it look like
a form control class in bootstrap so
let's just go ahead and copy that we're
also going to add it to the select we're
gonna add it to the text area and that's
it and then for the check box for the
span right here I'm just gonna give this
a class of label - body which I believe
just gives it some padding and let's see
if the input the inputs fine if you want
it to be blue you could just give it a
class
button primary and we'll save and there
we go so nice-looking form so the last
thing I want to look at is probably the
most important thing and that's the grid
system
okay skeleton does have a grid system
and it's very simple so in the grid
system we have a row class just like we
do with most frameworks inside the row
we want to define our columns let's say
we wanted like a main area and the
sidebar so that would probably be an
eighth column and a four column so we'll
have a class of eight you'll actually
spell out the the number eight and then
also a class of columns all right and
then in here I'm just gonna say lorem
forty tab which will just give me some
sample text and then let's go ahead and
copy this paste it again and then this
one's gonna be four columns and I'll
just take away some text so we'll save
it and there we go it's as easy as that
now what I'm gonna do is just add a
style up here in the head and we're
gonna say class columns and the class
column which I'll show you in a second
we're going to give a background of
light gray and a border of one pixel
gray solid ccc solid and then let's also
give it padding 10 pixels just so we can
see the outline of the columns okay so
that's that's an eight and for let's say
we wanted to do half and half so we'll
do a six and six so we could just copy
this row paste that in we'll change it
to six columns and six calls and let's
let's match up the text
save and there we go we should probably
put a line break between the two now
these are responsive you'll see if I go
bigger they look good and once we get to
a certain breakpoint they'll actually
stack on top of each other all right so
they are responsive by default all right
so let's the next thing in addition to
doing like you know writing out the
numbers like this we can do like 1/3 or
1/2 so let's go and create a new row
I'll put a line break we'll create a new
row and we'll say class 1/3 now if you
use this syntax you're going to use
column instead of columns ok singular
and let's just say lorem 10 tab okay so
that's 1/3 let's save and you'll see it
just takes up 1/3 of the row and then
what we could do is copy this and we
could change this one to 2/3 save that
and there we go you could also do if you
wanted 3 equal width columns you could
just do all one thirds so just to three
of these
let me fix this formatting all right so
three one thirds let's just put a line
break there and there we go now you can
also do one half so if we say class row
let's say class one half and also column
and we'll just copy this and save and
there we go so basically the same as
doing like the six columns up here so
that's the grid system very very simple
and again this is very useful if you're
you want to build something that's
almost completely custom CSS but you do
want some default styling you know to
make things look a little better and you
want to use like a grid system and some
utility classes okay so that's the crash
course now what we're going to do is
create a landing page so this is gonna
be like the demo landing page if we go
to skeleton CSS see right here so it's
gonna be kind of like this but it's
gonna be did it's it's different code
it's it's code that I think is more
optimized or a code or markup whatever
you want to call it HTML and we're gonna
change it up a little bit I'm going to
use different images we're gonna use
font awesome so we're gonna take this
and just build something a little
different so let's go ahead and inside
skeleton crash I'm going to create a
folder and I'm going to call it landing
okay and inside landing we're gonna
create a file called index.html we're
also going to create a folder called CSS
inside CSS we're gonna have a file
called style dot CSS since this is such
a minimalistic framework we're gonna be
writing quite a bit of our own CSS
alright and then I think that's good
let's go ahead and go to our index we're
gonna close up the cheat sheet we don't
need that
and let's put in our basic structure
oops
bulbs I'm in the CSS file all right so
let's create our basic structure and
we'll just call this demo landing page
we need skeleton so let's see I'll just
grab that from the cheat sheet so I'm
gonna grab the link right here alright
now I also want to use font awesome so
we're gonna go ahead and grab font
awesome CDN okay so let's see we'll just
grab this link right here and put that
right under the skeleton one and we
should should be all set for the head
area so I want to open this on my server
here so I'm going to go to my I'm gonna
leave this this server going and just go
to landing and this is our landing page
all right now as I said I redid this in
the way that I like to do things and
what I like to do is break each part of
a template or a website into sections
and a few guys have if you guys took my
bootstrap course my bootstrap for
project course then you know that I like
to break it into sections and give it
either an ID or a class and you know
just keep things very modular so let's
create a section here and we're gonna
give it a class of section I'm also
going to give it a class of showcase
okay this is the main showcase area and
we're gonna put a container in here oh
that's one thing I didn't mention in the
in the dammit I didn't mention in the
the cheat sheet is there is a container
class and I actually wanted to wrap
everything in a container so I'm gonna
do that that just does you know exactly
what it does in other frameworks it
pushes it into the middle gives it that
margin auto
all right and then we'll just tab that
over I'll just format it so when Vyas
code if you don't know you can do alt
shift F and that will format everything
alright so back to our landing page we
have the container inside the showcase
section and we're going to put in a row
we're going to be using the grid we're
gonna do two one half columns so let's
say class one half and also column so
this one is actually going to have an H
for and I'm gonna give this a class of
showcase - heading and we'll just put
ten words in here I'm going to say larom
ten tab and let's see below the H four
we're gonna put a link so an a tag and
we're gonna give it a class of button
and also button primary alright and then
this doesn't have to go anywhere and
then in this link here it's gonna say
download now this is basically like a
landing page for a mobile app I'm gonna
put an icon here as well so we're gonna
use the eye tag and say class equals fa
fa - download okay so this is font
awesome that we're using here so let's
save and there we go
now for the image we just pull up is
this it yes so this is the project that
we're on no it's not that's that's the
final one let me just pull up our
project so let's say file explorer
projects skeleton crash-landing and
let's go ahead and create an images
folder
all right and then I have three images
I'm gonna bring down and these are all
in your project files I'm actually
including the PSD as well save you so
this this iPhone here may look like the
one in the demo but it's not it's
actually from a PSD mock-up site that
gives you free PSD mock-ups and I
included the the mock-up PSD as well and
then the section BG this image is from
pixels comm but I went ahead and I added
a blue layer over it with some opacity
to make it look like that so these are
completely custom images oh thanks
thanks cow for your pledge appreciate it
so what we're going to do now is go back
and we're gonna add this the iPhone
image in the other column so we have
this one half column let's go right
under it and we'll say one half column I
really should take those notifications
off of this screen so in here we'll say
image and we're gonna give it a class of
showcase - IMG and the source is gonna
be images slash and it's called I think
I called it iPhone dot PNG let me just
double check yeah iPhone dot PNG and
let's see that should be good let's save
it and now it's gonna be humongous at
first don't worry about it we're gonna
fix that in the CSS actually you know
what let's do that now so usually I do
all the HTML and then the CSS but I
think with this project we'll kind of do
it will kind of you know go back and
forth so this this is actually all the
mock-up for the showcase that the
showcase is done now each section will
have a class of section as you can see
here so for that
and by the way this is going to be very
responsive so we are going to have some
media queries as well but we're gonna
set a padding we're going to use the the
CSS of REM unit so we're gonna say eight
REM top and then let's say zero and then
seven REM bottom so that's for anything
that has the class of section we're also
going to text align to the center okay
and then for the section heading I'm
gonna have a section heading class and a
section description so for those I'm
just gonna set a margin bottom of one
point two REM all right now for the
showcase let's take care of that large
image so it's a showcase - image
alright usually with bigger frameworks
like bootstrap you'll have certain
classes for images that will it'll make
them a hundred percent of their
container like thumbnail or whatever it
might be responsive image but we don't
have that in skeleton it's very minimal
so we're gonna just set this position to
relative and we're gonna set the max
width of this image to 80% of its
container and then we're just going to
add a little bit of margin so we're
gonna say margin three REM on the top
and then the right and left should be
Auto and then the bottom I'm gonna set
it to negative twelve REM because you'll
see I wanted to go down below kind of
overlay the the section below it so
let's save that now this isn't doing
anything because we didn't actually link
the CSS file so let's go ahead and do
that so up in the head let's put link we
want this to go to CSS slash style dot
CSS
and save and there we go alright and if
we make this bigger you'll see that it
is it is responsive in the sense that
the image is a percentage okay so it's
gonna be 80% and I'm just gonna leave it
big for now so let's see what else we're
going to do here I think we can move on
to the next section so after the
showcase let's actually comment this and
you guys that have been following me for
a while you'll see that all my HTML
themes and websites they they're pretty
much all this all the same they're just
sections commented they'll have us a
class that'll apply to all of them such
as section sometimes it's an ID and then
it has a special class to work with just
specifically that section alright so
this one I'm gonna call section a and
then the reason that I use classes like
this like section a rather than being
more descriptive is because you may want
to take you may want to replace this
some day with something else so if this
is gonna be let's say the section with
the icons which is what it's going to be
and we call it icon section later on we
might want to change it to something
else we might want to put the icon
section down at the bottom so that class
name wouldn't would no longer make sense
so I like to be semantic and giving
names that really don't pertain to the
content that is inside of it section a
may not be the best thing to name it but
at least it doesn't it's not you know
connected with the content inside of it
if that makes any sense at all all right
so let's see it's gonna be pretty
similar to this so I'm just going to
copy that and then we're gonna keep
section class section and then we're
going to change showcase to just section
- a we're going to keep the container
we're going to keep the row let's just
get rid of everything that's in the row
all right so this is the basic
boilerplate for all of our sections now
in here we're gonna have three one-third
columns so let's say class one third dot
column all right and then let's see
we're gonna have our icon here so let's
put an eye tag we're going to give it a
class of FA and then also a class of FA
- calendar okay so we have our icon
underneath that we're going to have an
h5 and we're gonna say plan your life
and then under that we'll have a
paragraph with ten words
okay so we'll save that and that's what
it's gonna look like so far so let's
copy the one third div we're going to
need two more of these except except the
second one we're gonna change the icon
to FA cloud will also change the heading
here to upload to the cloud and then
let's change the last icon to users and
we'll say manage users save that and now
we have our one third columns so this is
quite a bit we need to do to this
section here so let's go back to our CSS
now I'm not handling the media queries
yet we're gonna do that at the end but
let's see as far as CSS goes let's add
our class of section - a and we'll add a
background image which will be a URL
okay URL is gonna be dot slash images
slash section
- BG dot jpg
okay so that'll be this section now
we're gonna add a background size here
background size of cover let's see did I
get that image name right section
- BG jpg oh you know what this should be
dot dot slash since we're in a CSS
folder we have to go outside of this
then into images there we go so you see
this is the reason I put the negative
twelve REM right here for the bottom of
the the image because I want it to go
down onto this section all right so
let's finish this up we're gonna add a
color of white and we're gonna give it a
padding bottom of five Ram
okay now the icons are very very small
so we're going to change those so let's
say section a FA r dot FA I'm going to
set the font size of these to 40 pixels
let's set the margin bottom and we'll
set that to let's say 0.5 REM and then
we're going to set the color to like a
very light blue which is going to be a
hexadecimal value of B EE b FF alright
save that and there we go so looks
pretty good now for let's see for the h5
right here I'm going to change the
margin bottom a little bit so let's say
section a h5 I'm just gonna set the
margin bottom
two point three REM and that should
close that gap a little bit all right
and I think that's good
so that's section a now section B we're
gonna do next I'm just gonna copy
section a section B and it'll change
that so let's see as for the inside of
this so everything in the container we
can get rid of container ends right here
so we'll just take all this get rid of
it and this is going to be very simple
we're just going to have a heading and a
description and a button so let's say h3
class section heading and this will just
say section head and you guys can put
different text if you want all right
let's see under the heading we're gonna
have a paragraph with the class of
section - description and here we'll
just say lorem 10 and let's do the link
so the link is gonna have a class of
button and also button - primary okay it
doesn't matter where it goes and it's
gonna say view the docs and then I'm
just gonna put an icon right above it so
I with the class of FA and the class of
FA - what is it FA - file save that and
it should look like that now this is
actually really easy we don't have to
add any special CSS for Section B so
we're going to move on to Section C
which is going to be very similar to
section B so we'll just copy this lets
us format this first
I guess it is formatted shouldn't this
be here though alright so just copy that
this will be section C change that to a
C and containers good headings good
everything else is good I'm just not
going to have a button here or a link so
I'm gonna get rid of that let's save and
it's gonna look like this so we're gonna
add a little bit of CSS to section C so
we're gonna go down the bottom here and
say dot section C we're gonna give it
the same background image as section a
actually will copy all three of these
styles right here that should be good
and then let's see the description so
section C dot section description I'm
just gonna add a margin bottom of for R
M and save and there we go so let's
check out the responsiveness of this so
I think that that looks good keep going
down looks good once we hit I think it's
five fifty which is like right here
you'll see that everything gets stacked
okay all the grid system gets stacked so
that's responsive and I like that so the
demo one actually has a lot of media
queries that I don't think are necessary
just little margins and stuff the only
thing that I do want is when it's really
big like a thousand like that when it's
full I think that this should the text
here should be moved down so what I'm
gonna do is just add a single media
query here we'll say at media and let's
say min with 1000 pixels and then we're
gonna take the showcase heading oops
dot showcase
heading and we're gonna set the font
size to 3.0 REM okay so we'll make it a
little bigger and then we're gonna just
push it down by saying padding top 11
REM and save and now you can see it's
pushed down I think that looks a little
better okay so once it gets below a
thousand which is right here
then it won't that won't be in effect or
you can even make it that's still kind
of high maybe if we made it 750 like
that you guys think that looks better up
until we get to about there all right
yeah I think that looks good you guys
can mess with it if you want but I think
this is a nice little landing page it
uses a skeleton grid system it uses the
you know the skeleton buttons and fonts
and all that so I think this is a good
place to stop hopefully you guys enjoy
this and maybe someday you'll use this
in your in one of your projects and
