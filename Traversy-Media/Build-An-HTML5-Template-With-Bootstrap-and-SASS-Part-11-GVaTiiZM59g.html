about done we just need to add a couple
things - to the responsive version so
what we need to do is create some media
queries so what I'm going to do is
create an another SCSS file inside of
layouts and I'm going to create a new
file and I'm gonna call it underscore
mobile SDSS alright and in there we're
gonna create a couple media queries
actually basically rolling we only need
one and it's gonna be for tablets and
under okay so the screen size of a
tablet and under most tablets range
around 768 pixels
alright so we're going to say media
and so max
with is gonna be 768 all right so let's
just check this out and don't forget to
add that to your main file
all right so let's make this smaller
so the menu
is good
okay the the showcase looks good this
search bar
I would like to Center in the middle so
it has a class of search and what I'm
going to do is change the display to
inline block and then text-align:center
alright let's see if that does anything
all right so now that's in the middle
the blocks look good the list I'd like
to put a little margin underneath to
separate it from that image so we'll say
list actually just list itself margin
bottom 20 pixels
actually you know what we don't we want
it for the button shoot
you know what let's do it for the image
we'll give the image of margin-top so
device
margin taught
all right
and let's see
okay so for this for this image here we
need to make it smaller and we need to
change the the negative margin that we
have so it had a class of device small
and we'll set margin bottom to 20 pixels
and let's make that important
and I want these to be aligned to the
center so for the device class I'm going
to display block and set margin to auto
actually we need margin top 20 so let me
just say 20 Auto
Oh
all right so that's in the center
and then for the for our list I guess we
could just put some margin underneath so
what our main
you L we want to say margin-bottom 20
pixels
okay
we could even text-align:center
and for the h3s as well I think those
are h3
I say we should be nesting these
maybe there H force
all right
all right so that looks good to me go to
the about page carousel looks good works
tabs accordion the images for the team
full screen our full width testimonial
looks good blocks footer alright so
everything seems to look good services
tabs
Blagh
these here comments
we need to just add a clear class in the
HTML so if we go to blog and we want to
find the comments and then here we'll
just say div class equals clear fix
and just put those in between the list
items and that will clear the float okay
and then we'll just go to s CSS base and
we'll put it in the normalize okay we
can just say clear both
and also ad
to those list items we want to add an
overflow so let me just go to modules
list not list typography
and I'm just going to set it for all
list items so overflow audible
that's not doing it
this comments overflow:auto importance
there we go
okay contact
map
form looks good boxes all right so
that's it I realized that that took
quite a bit of time to build actually
home one more thing here we have this
login link on their mind
all right so looks good I hope you

these take some of what you've learned
