we're gonna take a look at a new
JavaScript layout engine called Murray
and as you can see here this is the
website it's Hall 2h alt u github io /
Murray and it's it's basically allows us
to create responsive sortable filterable
and draggable grid layouts so there's a
very nice example down here and it kind
of looks like a CSS grid layout but we
can take things and we can move them
around and you'll see that it
automatically sorts you can make it so
that you can get rid of things in the
grid you can sort by form fields so if
we want just the red boxes just the blue
we can sort by title and color we can
change the layout here so there's a ton
that you can do with this layout engine
now if we go down here you'll see that
there's some other examples for instance
if you wanted a to-do list and you
wanted to be able to prioritize your
to-do z' you can restrict the movement
as well so if you want to just
horizontal dragging or just vertical or
no dragging at all just a simple grid
system you can also do that now there
are some dependencies it does need
hammer j/s which is used for
drag-and-drop support and then web
animations which is used for the fast
animations so we will be needing those
we're just going to use a CDN we're
going to keep things simple we're not
going to use NPM or anything although
you can so what we're going to build is
not nearly as extensive as this here but
we're just going to kind of get started
with it and we're gonna build a grid and
we can sort things okay so we can go
ahead and move things around and it
automatically sorts now I use two
examples one with just words and and you
know just text and the background color
and then also some images and notice
that when we when we click and hold the
color changes and then when we release
it's a different color so you can you
can customize the stuff within the CSS
all right so that's what we'll be
building
it's completely responsive so if I go
ahead and I make my browser smaller
you'll see it automatically sorts it
automatically changes so that's what
we'll be building guys hopefully you
enjoy this this is the last video before
the holidays so I wanted to do something
but something that's not too you know
too in-depth so let's go ahead and get
started
hey guys if you've been watching my
videos for a while and you really like
what I do when I've helped you out a lot
consider becoming a patron even for one
dollar per month it pushes me to keep
bringing you guys the best content I
possibly can
there's reward tiers for discounts for
you to me courses personal support and
more so check out the patreon link in
the description below for more info
alright guys so we're gonna get started
here I just have v/s code open and I
have an empty folder called Murray grid
with an index.html file and a c a.style
dot CSS file so if you're following
along just go ahead and create those two
files that's all I've done okay there's
nothing in them so this is the github
page for Murray and it kind of guides us
on what we need to do so we need to when
we need to include the Murray script and
we can do that with a CDN or we can use
NPM or Bower which I wouldn't suggest
using Bower for anything anymore but
we're just going to keep it simple and
use a CDN so we're gonna grab the
minified version here let's go ahead and
just put some basic HTML body in here so
head body tags I'm using Emmet so I'm
able to do exclamation tab if you're
using vs code you have Emmet installed
by default if you're using something
like atom are sublime text you can
install it as a plugin alright so I'm
just gonna close that up and for the
title here let's say very grid and we're
gonna put that script tag that we just
copied down here
now as I said it does have two
dependencies web animations and hammer
j/s web animations obviously handles the
animations hammer j/s handles the drag
events so right here they show you an
example but they don't give you the CDN
link for the dependency so we have to
get those ourselves so let's search for
web
- animations CDN we're gonna get it from
CDN j/s calm and just copy this one here
the minified version I'm gonna say copy
script tag and we're gonna put that
right here and then hammer J s is gonna
go in the middle so let's search for a
hammer dot J s CDN we'll get that from
CDN J s column as well we want the
minified version copy the script tag and
put it right there
all right so now we have the external
scripts that we need let's also create
our own script tag now when there's
actually going to be just a couple lines
of JavaScript all we really need to do
is initialize it and then pass in any
options that you want so what we're
going to do now is add the markup and as
you can see from the example there's
just a div with a div with the class of
grid and then each item inside the grid
has a class of item and then an inner
div of item content okay class of item
content so that's what we're going to do
we're going to go ahead and put in a
class of grid and I'm using M it for my
abbreviations let's do a class of item a
class of item - content okay and then
what we're gonna do is just we're gonna
create a bunch of these so let's see
oops just copy this so let's do actually
let's put some text in here first we'll
say one and then we're gonna take the
item and we're going to paste and that's
four five six seven eight nine ten and
then I'm just going to format this so
now we'll do is just change the text
real quick so let's say two three
for I know this is a little tedious but
I really don't like to you know copy and
paste everything so five six seven eight
nine and ten all right so let's save
this now I'm using a plug-in or an
extension for vs cold called live server
there's a vs cold piss code called live
server if you want that just go ahead
and click extension the icon extension
here and search for live server and
install it alright and you don't need
that you can just open up the HTML file
or use something else but if you have
live server you can just right click and
say open with live server and that's
going to open over here in the browser
so nothing special what we want to do
now is add our CSS so we need to make
sure that we link that style.css file so
I'm going to go to the head and just put
in a link tag will link to style dot CSS
and save and then let's open up that CSS
file and let's go ahead and add body and
I'm just going to add a font family of
arial arial helvetica sans-serif and
let's add a background the background
color I'm using is just a very light
gray so it's gonna be F CF f CF af9
which is pretty close to white but let's
save that and now you can see the font
change so for the CSS if we look at the
github page they have an example now
we're not going to use this exact CSS
but we do want to use some of it so are
most of it actually the grid we want to
position:relative so let's go ahead and
do that
position:relative and then for the item
we're going to display that as a block
let's do position:absolute I'm gonna do
a height of 200 pixels and a width of
200 pixels and then also a line height
oops not a line break but a line height
of 200 pixels and then let's do a margin
of 5 pixels
all right let's also text a line to the
center so that should be good for the
item just actually let's put a z-index
in here as well so if you're not too
familiar with CSS a z-index basically
the higher the number the closer to you
it's going to be the closer to the front
so one would be closer to the front than
0 2 would be closer than 1 and so on so
if we look over here we have different
classes for different states so the
dragging state when you're actually you
know holding down and you're dragging it
we want the z-index to be closer to us
because we don't want it to be behind
the other ones so we want to hire a
z-index when we release we want less
than dragging but higher than the rest
when it's hidden we want a z-index of 0
so we actually do want all of these so
I'm just going to grab these all right
it's just I like to put line breaks
under those and then for the item
content
the content we're going to position this
relative say position relative and we're
going to set a width of 100% and also a
height of 100 percent and let's do we
want the cursor to be a pointer okay
because when we hover over it we want
that pointer it's not going to happen by
default so let's say cursor:pointer and
let's say we want the color of the text
to be white and let's set the background
okay the background is going to have a
hexadecimal color of five nine six it's
gonna be five nine six eight seven D
like that which is a blue little kind of
a grayish bluish color we're gonna set
the font size to 40 pixels and let's set
we want to Center this as well so we'll
say text-align:center and let's save
that okay so this is what we see so far
and that's that's fine we haven't
actually initialized muri yet so another
thing I want to do is just change the
color for when we're we're dragging it
and then also when we're releasing it so
we want these two here but we don't want
to change the actual style of this class
we want the item content inside of these
classes so I'm going to copy those two
and go down here and just add dots item
whoops
item - content and same thing here so
dot item content and then I'm gonna
change the background
so for dragging let's see for dragging
we're gonna do 8 9 9 3 a 2 which is kind
of a lighter color than the default and
then for the releasing we're gonna do a
background and that hexadecimal is gonna
be 1 5 2 C 4 3 which is a darker blue
alright and that's it for our CSS so
we'll save that now we're gonna go back
to our index.html go down to our script
tag and let's see we're gonna take a
look at the github and basically all we
have to do is initialize the murray
constructor so we'll set a variable here
so I'm gonna use Const and say grid and
set that to new Murray and then we want
to pass in whatever the wrapper for the
grid in our case it's the class of grid
okay so you don't have to use class grid
you can just whatever you use you put in
here so let's save that and go back and
there we go now by default
I cannot drag okay that the default
value is just a regular grid if I resize
the browser it does go ahead and sort
okay so it is responsive but if we go to
the documentation these are all the
different options that you have so the
one that we're really interested in is
drag enabled which by default is false
so to add an option what you need to do
is just add a second parameter of an
object and then you can put whatever
options you want so we want drag enabled
to be true and we'll go ahead and save
that and now I mean now we can move
things around so it's as easy as that
what's that three lines of JavaScript
okay so just just a constructor with a
single and we have a sortable grid so I
think that's that's pretty cool
some of these other things I don't I
don't know what all these are you guys
can look into
if you want if you want to restrict
let's say to horizontal
dragging you could do drag axis so let's
try drag axis and I think we can just do
like X I think it's x and y yeah so now
if I try to scroll if I try to drag down
I can't I can only go this way and if I
were to choose Y then I can't go over I
can only go up and down so you can
imagine the things you can do with this
you could create games like matching
games things like that you can hide
things behind them so this could be used
for a lot of different things I've just
an image gallery a nice interactive
image gallery maybe it's a do list where
you can change your priority priorities
so I can be pretty cool so let's see
what I want to do now I mean that's
pretty much the the introduction to this
what I want to do now is just add some
more items but I want to use images so
I'm going to copy everything within the
grid class not the grid class itself but
all the items so down to here and then
we'll just copy and we'll go ahead and
paste that in and then I'm gonna replace
let's format this real quick I'm gonna
replace the one with an image tag and
the source is going to be lorem pixel
Lauren pixel calm and let's do it's the
format of these images so it's going to
be the dimensions so of 200 by 200 and
then we want nature so we can put a
category and then slash one so let's say
we'll go ahead and copy that image tag
we don't need an alt so then copy that
and we're just gonna paste these in here
so this one will be nature / - this will
be slash 3 4
it's at six seven eight nine was was
giving me a problem for some reason the
image nine wasn't rendering so I'm just
gonna take off this last one and make
this one ten all right so let's try that
we'll save and it might take a second
for the images to come in because
they're coming from Lauren pixel
normally these would be images that you
would provide you know locally while
it's slow alright so what I'm gonna do
now is just resize the browser like that
and now we can move things around should
be able to yep okay so it's responsive
you'll see if I make this smaller now I
did use a fixed width for the boxes so
it's not gonna reach all the way over
you can change that if you want my goal
was basically just to show you how to
kind of kind of initialize this this
what is this layout engine alright so
I'm not gonna really go any further than
this I just wanted to do a quick video
on it or you know kind of quick and
introduce you to it and you may want to
look into things like having a forum
where you can sort by certain things you
can you can actually make it so you can
delete them you can look at all the
options that that are included so just a
basic introduction video so hopefully
you guys like this and maybe you'll look
into this I like to research new
technologies this was actually brought
to me by a friend that does some
research for me and you know - lets me
know new things that that people may be
interested in so I like it it interests
me so I figured you guys would - so
that's it guys thank you for watching
and I want to wish you all a Merry
Christmas or Happy Holidays whatever
whatever holiday you celebrate and
that's it thanks for watching guys and I
will see you probably after the new year
but maybe one video before that alright
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
