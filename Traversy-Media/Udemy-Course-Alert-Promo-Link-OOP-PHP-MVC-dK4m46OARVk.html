you a preview of my latest udemy course
along with a limited link in the
description to get it for just ten bucks
so this course is called object-oriented
PHP and MVC if you don't know what MVC
stands for its Model View controller and
it's a specific design pattern that
we're going to be using for the
application and the framework in this
course now this is not a beginner PHP
course if you don't know the basics of
PHP I would definitely suggest checking
out my youtube course PHP front to back
that'll give you all the fundamentals
that you need to know before doing
something like this alright because what
we're doing in this course is we're
creating a complete PHP
model-view-controller framework from the
ground up so something like a mini code
ignitor
now we're gonna create it from absolute
scratch it's going to be completely open
source
I call it traverse the MVC but you can
rename it you can change it you can add
whatever you want to it and you can call
it your own alright it's it's completely
open-source once we build the core
framework we're gonna build an
application on top of it which will
include user authentication access
control crud functionality for posts and
I'm gonna give you a glimpse of the
application and of the code itself
before we do that let's take a look at
the curriculum so basically we have our
course setup our Welcome we setup our
xampp environment then we're gonna do an
intro to object-oriented PHP looking at
things like classes and properties and
methods inheritance access modifiers
things like that nothing to do with the
framework of the application just kind
of an introduction and then we're gonna
start on our framework okay so first
we'll start with the core we're gonna
create all of our folders and files that
we need we're gonna create the core
library which is going to handle taking
the URL and basically mapping it so that
it loads a certain controller based on
whatever's in the URL a certain
controller and method we're also going
to be using the dot htaccess file to
rewrite urls then we'll start on the mV
see workflow the bass controller class
we're going to work on loading models
and views we're gonna create our
database class we're going to use PDO
for that for connecting to our database
basically every model we create we're
just going to load the database library
and we can do our queries through there
all right then we'll move on to the
application we're going to create the
initial app we're going to setup the
database we're going to create a
complete user authentication system then
we'll move on to the post functionality
where we can create read update and
delete posts and then finally we're
going to deploy our application to a
shared hosting account all right so
that's the curriculum now right the
second some of these videos are still
processing but those should be done
later on today it's just it's just this
section here and a couple from this
section but everything else is good to
go alright so this is the application
we'll create on top of our custom
framework
it's called share posts and it's
basically we can just create an account
and we can create posts and share them
alright so we have a home page we have
an about page you can see we're using
bootstrap for the register form right
here we implemented some really nice
validation so if I go ahead and I click
register you'll see we're using all the
bootstrap for registration classes I'm
sorry no registration validation classes
we're doing things like checking the
email for instance I already have an
email registered at Brad at gmail.com so
if like like try to click register you
can see it says email is taken alright
so let's go ahead and create a real
account
we'll say Jack Smith and we'll say Jack
at gmail.com password should be at least
six characters and of course that's the
match and then we'll register we also
created a custom flash messaging helper
so we'll see stuff like this and then we
can log in let's say Jack at gmail.com
well about the seat there and then we'll
put in our password and login and then
it takes us to the post page all right
you can see I already have some users
registered out and they already have
some posts and if we click on more
that'll take us to kind of a details
page for the post we can go ahead and
add a post so let's say Jax
post this is a test and submit and you
can see our post was created now if we
click on more you'll see that since this
is our post we can edit and delete it so
if I click edit we can go ahead and
delete it or edit it I'm sorry I'll just
put in a 1 there and submit okay that'll
edit it you can see we're using our
custom flash message helper here and of
course we can delete and that gets rid
of it all right so the application is
pretty simple but it is built on top of
our own framework so there's a lot to
learn here that I haven't seen anything
really like this on udemy there is a
couple framework custom framework
courses but nothing where you're
actually building something with the
framework so I think that's where it's
really valuable all right and then of
course we can log out so let's take a
quick look at the actual code for the
course so this is vyas code that I have
opened and over here you'll see we have
a public folder and an app folder so app
is where everything is and then public
is basically just the front of the site
which has the index.php file which
doesn't have much it just loads up the
bootstrap file and the app folder and
then initializes the core library
alright and the bootstrap basically just
requires everything we have an auto
loader to require libraries alright so
for libraries we have core dot PHP which
is our core class this handles loading
the controllers and methods and
parameters basically it's going to look
at the URL okay so we dissect the URL
down here and we decide what controller
to load what method to load and if
there's going to be any parameters in
the array okay so that's what that does
and then we have our core controller
class
I'm sorry I I guess it's a bass
controller class that loads the models
and views for us and then we have the
database class which implements PDO okay
we're using PDO we're using prepared
statements we have methods like query
buying to bind our parameters execute
result set to get an array of objects
single to get a single record as an
object so things like that all right and
then of course we have our MVC structure
so we have controllers for instance our
post controller you can see we have a
method of index and that's gonna fetch
posts from the model okay so we're able
to load the model here the post model
get the posts put them inside of a data
array and then we can load a view and
pass that data into the view so this
should look very familiar if you've used
something like laravel or CodeIgniter
or even a JavaScript back-end framework
like Express basically we're just you
know loading a view and we're getting
data from a model okay you can see we
have a bunch of different methods here
all right so I don't want to show too
much but that's a controller then we
have the post model where we're
implementing the database library that I
just showed you we create an instance
here then we can call those methods like
query we do joins and there's just a lot
of stuff that you're gonna learn in this
course and there's no libraries there's
no frameworks we're creating the
frameworks so I haven't seen too many
things like this too many courses like
this I have seen a couple courses
creating a framework but they didn't
really use it they just created it we're
actually gonna build an application on
top of it okay and of course we have our
HT axis files where we do our rewrites
so that you know we don't have to do
question mark URL equals or whatever we
can just do slash posts and and our
model our controller and methods and
stuff like that all right so that's
that's really it that's what this course
is all about now I love making you to me
courses because it gives me the
opportunity to really share everything I
know and take the time and try to
explain it the best I can and
create hours of content for you guys all
right now all you guys come first
meaning my subscribers you guys have
stuck with me throughout the years so I
always create a $10 promo link for my
courses which is the absolute lowest
coupon you can do on udemy now I have a
lot of people waiting for course
releases many subscribers this is the
way that I announce it okay when I
create a course now I had a guy leave a
comment a ridiculous comment in my last
release saying oh now your YouTube
channel is nothing but a promotion for
your premium content and that really got
to me now I know this is just one guy
that has no idea what he's talking about
but I have almost 500 videos on YouTube
and this is the fourth course promotion
so this guy obviously doesn't understand
the amount of time that I've spent
making free content and when I do make a
premium premium course I try to make it
the lowest price possible especially for
you guys because it's important for me
to share what I know and I know if I
make the price too high people aren't
going to buy it all right everything
that I learn I want to teach that's just
how I feel anything that I know I just
want to give I want to give away and
most of it is for free but again I do
have a family to feed so I don't want to
rant too much but I just really hope
that not even you know 1% of you guys
see me in the way that that guy did
because I think very highly of you guys
you know meaning my subscribers and
followers and I'll continue to give you
free content but when I spend 50 hours
making a course I have to charge
something ok anyway I just wanted to put
that out there
if you're interested in this particular
course the promo link is in the
description alright thanks for watching
guys and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
