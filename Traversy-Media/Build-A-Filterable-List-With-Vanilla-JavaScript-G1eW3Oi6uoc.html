simple mini project for you we're going
to be building a filterable list using
just plain JavaScript we're also going
to use materialized CSS as the front-end
UI so if we look over here we have this
My Contacts and it's not really a
contact list it's just a list of names
but it's it's basically the premise for
a contact application and we have this
input up here and if I start to type
here if I put a B in here you'll see
it'll filter out everything that doesn't
have a B in it and if I keep typing if I
put an R it's going to filter out to
Brad because that's the only name that
actually has a B and an R in it all
right and if I start if I type more and
it doesn't match anything obviously
nothing is going to show up and it's
very reactive if I go and I delete
you'll see that everything will come
right back so it's pretty easy it's
pretty simple project it is the weekend
and I spend you know most of the weekend
with my kids but I did want to just do
something really quick for you guys
alright so that's it let's go ahead and
get started this video is sponsored by
dev Mountain if you're interested in
learning web development iOS or UX
design dev Mountain is a 12-week design
and development boot camp intended to
get you a full-time job in the industry

click the link in the description below
alright so I have a blank index.html
file here and I'm using atom for my text
editor I'm using atom live server to
display it over here and I have it in a
folder called filterable list and this
is the only file we're going to need for
this project it's going to be very
simple so let's put an exclamation tab
and if you have Emmet installed what
that will do is it'll just generate a
basic HTML structure give you head tags
body tags your viewport I would highly
recommend installing Emmet as a plug-in
if you don't have it then just go ahead
and type this out at least just the head
and body tags and for the title let's go
ahead and we'll just put in my contacts
and we're going to be using materialized
CSS so let's grab that from the CDN
okay I'm just right here we'll get it
from CD nsj calm we're not using any of
the JavaScript widget so we just need
the CSS so we're going to put it inside
of a link tag here go ahead and paste
that in alright and we can close that up
and then inside the body let's put a
container div because that's going to
kind of you know auto out the margin
push it to the middle just like any
other framework and we're going to put
an h1 in here and let's give it a class
of a line - Center which is a
materialised class to push it to the
center and we're just going to stay my
contacts okay and that should auto
reload just test that out all right so
it is Auto reloading why is that not
centered is it a line Center no it's
Center aligned sorry about that that's
one of the things that sucks about using
so many different frameworks is because
sometimes you just you get the class
name too mixed up all right now under
that we're going to use a collection
okay collection in materialises is
pretty much like a list group in
bootstrap which is just a fancy way of
styling a UL so let's go ahead and put a
UL and we're going to give this a class
of collection and we're also going to
give it a class of width - header just
like that and I'm also going to give it
an ID and the only reason I'm giving it
an idea so that we can grab on to it
from our JavaScript okay and I'm going
to call this names because it's a ul of
names and then inside the UL we're going
to have some allies so let's say Li and
I'm going to give this a class of
collection - header and this is actually
going to be the letter okay you know how
we had the a and then the names and then
the B the names and so on so this is
where we're going to put the a and I'm
going to put it inside of an h5 so we'll
just put an A like that and then under
that we're going to have a list item or
couple list items with the class of
collection item okay just like that and
then those are going to have a tags
which are just going to go nowhere
they're not actually going to lead to a
page and then we'll have the name so
let's see what do they have for names
Abe and then what we'll do is just copy
the collection item a couple in here so
we'll have Abe and then I had Adam Allen
and Anna okay so those are all the aids
now what we'll do is copy the collection
header and then all the items and then
right under it will paste that in and
then we'll change this one to be okay
then we'll do save back I'll do Bill Bob
and Brad okay and then under that will
do one more we'll do see obviously if
this was a real application you'd have
all the letters but I'm not going to
there's no reason to do that
I'll see what other names that I have
Kerry Kerry we have Cathy and we have
Courtney okay we'll just get rid of this
one so let's go ahead and save that till
we get so that looks pretty good now we
need our input okay we need a filterable
input so let's go right below the h1 and
put in an input okay now materialise is
really good that's when one of the
things I like is you don't even have to
add a class name to your input it'll
automatically style it nicely but we do
need an ID so that we can grab on to it
in the JavaScript so that'll be lets say
filter input and then let's also add a
placeholder and we'll just say search
names save that and there we go so
minimal mock-up and it looks pretty good
now of course we didn't have to use
materialized but I wanted it to look
decent so let's go right above the
ending body tag and put our
and this is where all of our JavaScript
is going to go like I said we're not
using any libraries we're not using
jQuery I mean you could use jQuery and
you could have less code but
you'reyou're depending on a library and
that's just it's not really cool these
days to use jQuery if you don't have to
okay and sometimes I mean if I use
jQuery a lot of people give me and
rightfully so I mean it's good to just
do it you know with plain JavaScript so
let's go ahead and let's create a
variable to grab this input okay so
it'll stay let's we'll call it filter
input and we'll set it to document dot
get element by ID and I'm sure you know
most you guys know what that does it'll
grab any element any tag by its ID and
remember we gave that input or is it we
gave the input an idea filter input okay
just like we're code we're naming the
variable so let's go ahead and put that
in there okay so now that we have that
what I want to do is add an event
listener to that let me actually add a
comment here I want this to be well
commented so we'll say get get input
element and then let's add event
listener okay now I could have went like
this in the input I could go on key up
because key up is the event Jesus a key
type so on key up and then call a
function but every time I do the heck
you guys give me and you know it's
it's it's kind of the old way of doing
things so it's good to have an event
listener so let's go ahead and do that
we're going to take the filter input and
we're going to say add event listener
okay and then the type of event is going
to be a key up and then when that
happens we're going to call a function
that we're going to call to filter names
okay and then we'll put our function
here called the filter names
okay and let's just do a console dot log
and I'll just put in a 1 so now let's go
over here and hit f12 open up our chrome
console and if I start to type you'll
see that it just prints out a 1 ok every
time I type it'll print out a 1 that's
what these numbers are here so obviously
that's not what we want to happen but we
just want to you know make sure that
that function is actually being called
so now we want to get the value of the
input so let's say get value of input so
we'll create another variable here let's
say let will say filter value and let's
set that to document dot get element by
ID okay and then remember we gave it
this input we gave it an ID of actually
know what week well that's outside the
function well yeah we'll just do this
again so we'll just say filter input and
then we don't just want to get the
element we want the value so we want to
do dot value and then I'm also going to
just convert it to uppercase to make
sure that the you know when we type in a
name the first letter is uppercase and
we can do that with just saying to
uppercase like that all right then let's
console.log it until we get so filter
oops
filter value now as I type you'll see
down here in the console it's just going
to put out whatever I whatever I put in
there alright and it's actually going to
make everything uppercase which is fine
I just we just need to have we need to
be consistent when we go and we match
what's being typed in we have to make
sure that it's uppercase as well all
right so let's get rid of that
console.log and now we want to do is we
want to get the UL okay so the UL we
gave an ID of names so that's what we
want to grab onto we want to create a
variable representing that they get
names ul will say let and let's just
call this
I guess we'll just call it names and
then we'll set it to document dot get
element element by ID as an idea of
names
all right so that'll get the UL and now
we want to do is get all the collection
items in the UL so this UL has a bunch
of allies and some of them have
collection header as a class the ones we
want to the collection items because
that's what we want to match we don't
care about the actual you know the
letters so let's create another variable
for those I will say get get items
actually know what I'm just going to
call this ul because I don't want to get
that confused with the items so I will
say get Li I get allies from ul and then
I'm just going to call this Li alright
so say document dot C yeah wait a minute
what I do know we're going to take the
UL and then we're going to call get
we're going to call what am i doing I
call query select all okay now query
select all a query select are all is a
really handy function and it kind of in
a way can kind of replace jQuery we can
select anything based on its class name
or or whatever you know before that that
function came along we had to use get
element by ID meaning we had to just get
things by their ID but now we can grab
them by classes or anything else so
we're going to get the Allies with the
class of collection item okay so we want
to get all of those and it's basically
going to put that into an array all
right then what we want to do is we want
to loop through that array we want to
loop through all the collection items so
let's say loop through
collection item allies
so we'll do a for loop and say let y
equal zero as long as I is greater than
Li dot length and then we just want to
increment by 1 I plus plus okay and then
inside this loop we want to get the we
want to get the names and remember those
are wrapped in a tags so we can use a
function called get elements by tag name
and then throw an A in there so we want
to get all the links so let's do that
we'll create a variable called a alright
now since we're in a loop we want the
current iteration of the Li so we're
going to use an eye right there and then
we'll say dot get elements by tag name
okay and then we'll throw in here a so
we're going to get all the lengths all
right actually you know what we only
want to get the current link so we want
to put zero right there alright and then
we want to check to see if it matches we
want to check to see if what we type in
here is and it has an index inside of
the the name the current name that's in
the loop all right so let's put a comma
here and we'll just say it matches our
if match that's fine and so we'll do an
if okay actually this will be an if-else
and the way that we're going to match is
we're going to say if a dot in our HTML
now inner HTML is going to grab whatever
is inside the a the a tag okay so this
is the a tag but we're looking at this
we're looking at the name inside of it
so enter HTML and remember how we switch
the to uppercase when we you know when
we type it in here it's being output is
uppercase so we're going to say dot to
uppercase just so we're consistent on
that and then we can use dot index of
okay index up and then we can put in
here the filter value
okay whatever is being passed in the
form and we just want to match that we
want to say if it's greater than
negative one that means that there's a
match that one of the letters matches
one of the letters and the names now
what do we want to do if there's a match
we basically don't want to do anything
we want to we want to set the CSS style
property to nothing if there isn't a
match we want it to disappear so we're
going to set the style property to none
and the way that we can do that is we
can say Li I meaning the current
iteration the current one you're on and
we're going to set style dot display to
nothing okay and then if it doesn't
match then we're going to set it to none
all right so hopefully that should work
I believe so let's save that and let's
go ahead I'm going to just close the
console I'm going to put a P in here
okay now it's going to take away
anything that doesn't have a B and then
let's put an R and there we go so it
matches Brad if I put Brad E then it's
not going to match okay let's see let's
match an ax
so we'll do K and now it's going to
match anything that has an A and an end
you could you could modify this to make
it so that you know it would have to be
a n at the beginning or a N together you
could do that but I want to keep this
really simple and this works you know
and for most people this is going to
work if you're looking for an ax you're
going to find an ax you know but I mean
like I said you can tweak it how you
want but that's what we're going to do
that's how we're going to leave it feel
free to you know edit this make it your
own do what you want with it
just just figure to be a pretty cool
project or at least a simple project for
people that are kind of you know
learning JavaScript maybe maybe you're
working in some frameworks but don't
really understand how to build something
with just vanilla JavaScript I want to
do some more videos that that are you
know based on just regular JavaScript
rather than knowing how to put together
or how to remember how to put together a
react application because you really
need to understand the code and
understand
is going on and hopefully you know the
videos that I put out help you guys but
yeah thanks for watching please
subscribe leave a like again I've been
mentioning it lately I do have a patreon
it's in the description if you want to
check that out even a dollar per month
from enough people will allow me to do
this full-time and do projects like this
every single day so thanks for watching
guys and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
