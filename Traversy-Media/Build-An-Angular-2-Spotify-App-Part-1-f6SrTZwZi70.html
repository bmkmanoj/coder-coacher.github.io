to be building an angular 2 application
that utilizes the Spotify API so that we
can search and fetch artist and album
info from Spotify now this project is
directly from an edge wanax course which
features 12 angular 2 projects much like
this one so if you enjoy this and you
find it helpful I would suggest taking a
look at that course I'll leave a link in
the description all right so let's take
a look at what we'll be building now the
front end we're using bootstrap but
we're using a customized version of it
from boots watch we'll be able to search
for an artist so we have this input here
let's say we want to search for the rock
band Aerosmith and you can see as we
type it searches it fetches the artists
and gives it back to us alright so if we
click on Aerosmith which you can see has
the title and then the genres of that
band if we click on that it takes us to
a page that lists all of the album's ok
we also have an image up here the title
and the genres alright so if we want
this live in Berlin if we click album
details you can see it takes us to
another page a details page where we
have the title the album title the cover
the release date we also have a button
to view and Spotify so if I click that
it's going to bring us right to the
Spotify site and down here we actually
list all the album tracks and not only
list it but we can preview it if we
click that it's going to open up another
window and start to play it alright I'm
not going to let that play but you can
see we can preview each song on the
album all right so pretty helpful we
also have just an about page here and
that's pretty much it so it's very
simple but again very helpful if you
want to look up the albums of an artist
and even preview some songs ok so
hopefully you guys enjoy this miniseries
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
