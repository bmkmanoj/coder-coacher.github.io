download install and configure
codeigniter we'll do some configuration
but we probably won't get it get to all
of it in this video because there's
quite a bit that needs to be done to set
it up correctly we want to have SEO
friendly URLs so we get to create a dot
htaccess file we want to link our
database we want to include our all our
autoloaders so there's quite a bit to be
done to get the the optimal setting
alright so you want to do is go to ellis
lab comm slash CodeIgniter
and just click on the green download
button alright so look
so now I have the zip file open which
has an application folder a system
folder and a user guide folder all right
so what we want to do now is create the
folder on the server where we want
coding idea to run and like i said i'm
using xampp if you're using xampp then
the default location of your server
folder is in your c drive and then xampp
and then htdocs alright so this is where
you want to create the folder my
installation I have it in my Dropbox
folder so if I go to my Dropbox I have
my in htdocs' folder just so I can
access it on multiple machines
which I would suggest that you do as
well alright and in this directory we
have a my to-do folder so I'm going to
create a folder actually you know what I
want it to be named my to do so I'm just
gonna look
just say my to do old and then I'm gonna
create this folder and call it like to
do all right so if we open that up we
want to drag all our files into that
folder and if you're not using xampp and
you're using just a host or you have
your own server just upload it to
whatever folder you want for your
application all right so now we have the
the files in the htdocs bowl there and
the first thing I want to do is get rid
of this user guide and it's basically
just the documentation and you can find
the same info on the CodeIgniter website
so there's really no sense in having
this so I'm gonna get rid of that all
right and the next thing I want to do is
we have two folders application system
system we don't touch it has all the
core libraries things like that all the
core helpers we don't want to touch
anything in that folder we do want to
touch things in the application folder
this is where we'll be storing our
controllers models and views and we will
do our configurations you can see
there's quite a bit of configuration
files here for security reasons you
don't you don't have to but I like to
change the names of these directories so
I'm actually going to rename this just
app and I'm gonna rename this just sis
sys
and you can change it to whatever you
want but if you change it make sure that
you open up this index.php file all
right so I'm going to open up sublime
text which I'm using as a code editor
you can use whatever you'd like sublime
text is free and it's it's it's pretty
nice so I'm going to add a project
folder and I'm just gonna select that
code igniter folder I mean I'm sorry
that my to-do folder which I have in my
Dropbox folder
in actually in my htdocs folder
all right so now I have my my structure
here so I'll minimize that and what we
need to do since we rename these folders
is open up the core index.php file and
if we scroll down if you take a look at
this we can we can set different
environments if you've ever used rails
or are something like that then you
probably probably seen this and you can
add different functionality for
different environments for example the
development the development environment
we're showing all errors all right
because we want to be able to debug if
we're in the production environment then
we're setting ever reporting to zero all
right so you can set different things
depending on which witch you're in which
environment you're in all right so this
is where we want to change the names so
the system folder we renamed to sis and
then the application we renamed to app
all right so so let's save that do a
ctrl s and let's go ahead and visit that
directory so localhost /
my to do
nope not like to do CI alright so this
is the default welcome page when you
install codeigniter
and it's basically a controller called
welcome which has a model a welcome
model and a welcome view alright so if
we go and look in the file structure and
app an app there's a welcome controller
and let's see actually it doesn't have a
model and then the view is just this
welcome message view and this is what
we're seeing here we have some inline
CSS here and then just the message that
you see what we want to do now is we
want to set our base URL all right so
that would be in the config and in
config dot PHP alright so we have two
things here we have a base URL which is
going to be for us is going to be
localhost / might to do all right
that'll be the base URL and we have a
default index page which is index dot
PHP alright so we also have in our
routes file we have the default
controller set as the Welcome controller
and since what the Welcome controller is
set to the default that's what we see
when we don't have anything on the end
of this alright we don't have a
controller in our URL but if we go to
controller I mean I'm sorry my to do
slash welcome we don't see it and that's
because we need our index page so
index.php slash welcome alright so as it
is now when we create a controller say
we created a control called pages if we
wanted to visit that's that view we
would have to do index dot PHP slash
pages and we don't want that we want to
be able to just to slash and then our
controller
all right and if you don't understand
that what we have in here is going to
call this controller so slim since we
have slash welcome it's going to call
this controller here all right which
then loads the view which we see down
here this welcome message all right so
what I want to do is get rid of that I
want to be able to go to this URL in
right now as it is we need to do the
index.php so what we need to do is we
need to create an HT HT access file and
we want to create that in our root
directory so I'm going to go ahead and
open up our folder structure here and we
want to create I'm just going to right
click and create a new document and
we're gonna call it dot HT access all
right so let's windows sometimes has an
issue with this because it doesn't have
an extension
I think we can do it through sublime
text through the editor let's see new
text document rename dot h t XS alright
so that let us do it so do it through
your arm through your code editor if you
have to
couldn't find this item alright good so
we have our thought htaccess file if you
have to you can open up FileZilla and
and log in to your website and create it
there alright so we want to grab that
htaccess file alright so actually that's
not the one we want you want to make
sure that you get the one in the root
because if you look in the app directory
it has one as well in the system
directory we don't want to touch those
alright we want only the one in the root
so I'm going to close that up and we
want this one which should be blank and
what I'm going to do is just paste some
some content in here some code that'll
interact with our server and what its
gonna do is it's gonna route everything
through the index dot PHP file and it's
gonna make it so that people cannot
browse like they can't browse to our
website folders through the browser the
only thing that's gonna be public that
the browser will be able to access is
the index dot PHP file and then things
like images CSS stuff that we need to be
public
alright robots.txt things like that
alright so we need this to be able to
use nice URLs without the index dot PHP
so let's save that alright and if we go
back here and we try to reload this now
we have we don't need to use that index
dot PHP alright so that's how you enable
SEO URLs with CodeIgniter
alright so the next thing we want to do
is connect our database oh I'm sorry we
need to fill in we want to go back to
that config dot PHP file and the base
URL usually we would put localhost / my
to do alright so that is perfectly fine
but this isn't dynamic if we decide to
move this this app to a new domain then
we have to re-enter something here so
what I do is put in something dynamic
where it can automatically find the URL
using superglobals so let me just grab
something and paste it in alright
so I'm just gonna get rid of this and
paste this in alright and this is going
to grab our domain through the server
superglobal through HTTP host and then
the directory name we can get through
the script name right so this is going
to equal the same thing and if you move
this site or this app to a new domain
it's automatically going to configure it
all right so I do this on all my
codeigniter apps and now what we want to
do is since we enabled SEO URLs and we
don't need that index dot PHP in the URL
you want to just get rid of this just
set this to nothing alright and let's
see there's a bunch of things you can do
if you want URL suffixes if you want it
to look like this dot HTML you can do
that language settings I don't think
there's anything that we need to do here
oh actually we do alright so if you're
going to be using the session class
which we are because we're going to have
a login system then you want to set an
encryption key and this can be anything
you want all right so I'll just put it
one two three four but you want
something with more security than one
two three four all right
and then let's see down here this looks
fine
all right so that's all we have to do
with this so let's save the config dot
PHP file and next we want to open up the
database file and we want to insert our
info here all right so our username was
root password I think I have just right
here simple password and the name of the
database which let's say we named it new
to do
all right so we want to put that in the
database name
and we we're not we're not restricted to
MySQL we can also use other databases
postgrads or something like that but by
default we have the MySQL driver so
that's fine and that's it for the
database so let's save that still make
sure everything's working all right so
let's see we want to configure the
autoloaders so if we go to auto load
duck PHP and what this does is makes it
so that you don't have to manually load
certain aspects of your site or your
apps such as packages libraries helpers
config files language files and models
so anything you want to use you want to
add in the proper array here and one
thing that we definitely need is the
database library if we're going to
connect to a database we need that so
we're going to place that in here so all
we need to do is database all right so
we're going to be using a few libraries
here I think yeah we want the session
library as well
all right so database in session and we
want to use the form validation as well
and if you want to know more about these
libraries I encourage you to go to the
coding on our site and go to the
documentation and you'll find everything
you need that's another reason I really
like code igniters everything is well
documented in my opinion now helpers are
basically just functions their files
with functions they don't have a class
they don't have anything they're just
functions you can include alright and
there we can make our own helpers but
there's a few core helpers that we want
to use one is the URL helper we also
want the form helper and we want the
HTML helper okay
so that should be all we need for now we
will auto load some models when we get
to that but for now we can just save
this
all right let's make sure everything's
working all right so that we basically
have a complete coordinator installation
that has been configured
all right so in the next video what
we'll be doing is creating a new
controller in replacing the Welcome
controller and we'll look at that all
right so thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
