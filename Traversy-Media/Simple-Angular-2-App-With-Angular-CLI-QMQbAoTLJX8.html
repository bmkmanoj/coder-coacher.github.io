you how to put together a quick angular
2 application using the new angular CLI
which is a bit of a change from some of
my earlier videos on angular 2 where we
use the QuickStart
alright now if you're on Windows Mac or
Linux it doesn't matter just make sure
you have no js' and NPM installed if you
don't just go to node.js org go ahead
and download and install that and you
should be all set
alright I'm using Windows so I'm going
to open up a command line as
administrator alright and then you just
want to go wherever you want to set up
your project I'm going to go into a
folder called projects alright and first
thing we want to do is install the CLI
now we want to make sure we install it
globally with the G flag here so let's
say npm install g angular - CLI and that
should get it all set up ok so once
that's all set we can generate an
application using ng new and then
whatever we want to call it we'll just
call this a - - duze alright and that
might take a minute or two to generate
so I'm going to pause this and I'll be
back in a second
alright so now that that's done we can
go ahead and CD into that folder and
let's go ahead and run ng serve and that
should start up our application alright
so we're going to go to local host port
4200 and there we go there's our
application open up the console you can
see there's no errors everything is good
and we're ready to create our
application so what I'm going to do is
open up our project folder in my editor
which is Visual Studio code which is a
really nice free editor
for angular 2 because it has really nice
typescript highlighting and typescript
is what angular 2 uses by default so
let's open up that folder and the file
structure is a little different than the
QuickStart everything that we're going
to be doing is in the source folder this
is where the app folder is where all of
our components and services and all that
good stuff will go all right we also
have a config folder for our environment
and testing we have the dist folder
which was just created when I ran the
app that's the compiled application that
you don't want to touch that you want to
work in the source folder and then it
gets compiled to the dist folder the e
to e folder is for end-to-end testing
which I'm not really going to get into
public that's where you want to put your
style sheets or your external scripts
jQuery things like that and then we have
our typing's down here and angular CLI
has these two config folders as well we
have the angular CLI jason file and then
we have the build configuration file
which we don't really need to explore
right now alright so let's take a look
in the app folder okay we have app
component TS and if you know angular 2
or you've watched some of my other
angular 2 videos this should look pretty
familiar ok we have our component
decorator which allows us to attach
metadata to our component we have the
selector which is app root we have a
template URL which is the HTML file
that's created for us as well when we
created our application we also even
have a style sheet that is dedicated to
this particular component which is the
app component alright and then down here
in the class we're just setting a
property title to the text app works if
we look in the HTML file we just have an
h1 and then we have the title which of
course is app works and that's what we
see over here
alright we can all we also have spec
files for testing
I'm not really going to get into that I
just want to kind of cover the basics so
what I want to do now is create a new
component for our two Do's so what I'll
do is go into our command line I'm going
to ctrl C to stop this and then we're
going to generate we're going to
generate a new component okay we can do
that with ng G component and then
whatever we want to call it I'm going to
call it - duze we'll run that and you
can see that it created all these files
for us all right when you name the
component you don't need to do dot
component because it adds that for you
all right so let's go ahead and run this
again with ng serve and now if we look
over here you can see in our app folder
we now have a deduce folder and that
creates all these files for us okay if
we look at our main TS file it looks
just like the the root app component and
then in the HTML file it just says to do
is works now we don't see it over here
because we haven't included it yet in
our root components so let's do that if
we go to app component TS we'll go up to
the top here and it will say import and
it's called - duze component and that's
going to be from dot slash to do swoops
to do slash to do dot component all
right now we also have to add that as a
provider I'm sorry as a directive so
we're going to put a comma there and say
directives and then just add two dues
component alright so we'll save that and
then in the dues component notice the
selector is app - dues so what we'll do
is go to our app component HTML file go
under the h1 here and we'll say app to
do
save that and now you can see we have
our component displaying here now let's
go back into our - duze component TS
file and what I'm going to do for now is
just add the two Do's right here and the
component so right above the constructor
let's say - duze and then in the ng on
an it that's where we can put all of our
initialization code so I'm just going to
put in here by saying this - duze and
we're going to set that to an array of
objects okay each to do is going to have
some text will say pick up kids at
school let's see this one will be
meeting with boss
and dinner with wife okay so we have a
couple - duze now let's go ahead and
save that and then if we go to our HTML
file we're going to go we'll get rid of
this and let's create a heading say
to-do list and put a UL and then in our
li we're going to have our ng 4 so we
want star ng 4 and we're going to set
that to let to do of - duze okay and
then in here we should just be able to
say to do dot txt save that and now you
can see that it's fetching the to do is
from our component and outputting them
onto the screen
alright so let's say we want to have an
input so that we can add to this list so
I'm just going to go right above here
and put in another heading we'll say add
to do and let's put a form ok and then
we're going to have an input with the
type of text and we're going to add an
NG model here which allows it gives us
two-way data-binding I'm going to set
that to text and then we need some kind
of event to happen so in the form tag
here I'm going to add an event handler
for submit event just set that to add to
do save it and then back in the
component we're going to go underneath
the ng on an it and we're going to add
add to do now since we added the ng
model equals text on to that input we
can access it by saying this
dot text okay let's actually just
console dot log and we're getting this
red line because we have to add it up
here as well all right so let's save it
and then whatever I add and here enter
we get test all right so what we want to
do is just add it to this array of two
dues and that's pretty easy we just say
this dot to do is dot push and then pass
in this actually want to pass in an
object with text and this dot text save
that okay and then we'll just type in
test to do enter and you can see it got
added okay we can add as many as we'd
like now when I reload they're going to
go away because they're not being
persisted to a database or anything like
that
now before we address that let's go
ahead and make it so that we can remove
these two dews all right so back in the
HTML right after the text here I'm going
to put a link actually we don't want
that let's just put a button and let's
put some parentheses and we'll say
delete to do I'm sorry I don't want to
do that I want to put click and then
equals delete to do and let's pass in to
do dot text now with a production
application you probably have an ID or
some kind of unique value but since we
don't have that we're just going to pass
in the actual text all right the point
of this application isn't to isn't to
build something that we would use in
production it's just to kind of give you
an idea of how to create an app using
angular CLI and how to just do some
basic stuff all right so let's go ahead
and save that
whoops we forgot to add text to the
button let's just put an X okay now when
we click it it's going to look for a
function called delete to do which we
don't have yet so we're going to go back
into the component and say delete to do
okay let's put here to do text and then
what we'll do is do a for loop okay I'm
going to say for VAR I is equal to zero
not one I and then we're going to say as
long as I is less than this dot - duze
dot length and then we want to say I
plus plus because we want to increment
by one all right and then what we need
to do is match the text to the current
iterations text so we'll say if this dot
- duze I dot text is equal to - do dot
text which is what's passed in then we
want to splice it out of the array so
this dot to do is dot splice and we're
going to pass in i1 all right
let's go ahead and save that and now if
I click one of these you can see that it
deletes them all right if I reload
there's they're going to be there again
because again the data it's not getting
persisted to a database all right now we
have a lot of different options as far
as databases you could use something
like firebase you could use MongoDB or
some other kind of no SQL database but
what I'm going to do is we're going to
build a service and we're just going to
use local storage okay something really
simple it'll kind of mimic an outside
API
all right so let's go ahead and generate
a service which we can do with angular
CLI so we're going to just ctrl C to
stop this and then what we're going to
do is say ng g service to do okay so
that generated a to do dot service dot
es file let's go ahead and run ng serve
again alright and then we'll go and open
up our service file which is right here
okay and you can see it already adds the
injectable decorator for us it creates
the class now this error here we
shouldn't have to worry about it says
experimental support for decorators is a
feature that is subject to change set
the experimental decorators option to
remove this warning okay I'm not going
to worry about that yet unless it gives
us some issues all right now what I want
to do is just go in the constructor and
say console dot log to do service
initialized okay now it's not going to
run right off the bat we have to go and
import it so we're going to go into our
route app component app component TS and
let's go and import to do service from
and let's see that's going to be dot
slash to do dot service ok now we have
to include this as a provider so right
here we're going to say providers to do
service ok we'll save that
now we also want to include it in our to
do component so we're going to import it
here as well okay so we have to do dot
dot slash to go outside of the deduce
folder and then to do dot service
alright and since we added it as a
provider in the root app component we
shouldn't have to here all right now
we're going to have to inject it as a
dependency we're going to do that in our
constructor parameters right here so
we'll say private underscore to do
service set that to to do service okay
I'll save that and now down here in the
console you can see to do service
initialize so we know that that's
connected now we got to figure out how
we're going to store these okay we're
going to use local storage now with
html5 local storage you cannot store
arrays or objects it has to be a string
so what we're going to have to do is
convert the our arrays and objects into
strings and then insert it into local
storage and every time we fetch it we'll
have to convert it back into Jason
alright so let's get rid of this this
whole thing alright and then we're going
to go to our service and let's go and
create a function we'll call it get to
dues all right so what we'll do is
create a variable called two dues and
let's set that to local storage dot get
item okay that's how we can get a stored
item and it's going to be two dues all
right now like I said it's it's going to
be a string when it's stored in there so
we need to convert it to Jason so we can
just wrap it in jason dot parse
all right and then we can simply return
that all right and then back in our
component in the ng on an it will save
this dot to dues is equal to underscore
I'm sorry this dot underscore to do
service dot get to dues okay and then
let's just do for now no that's fine
we'll just leave that okay we'll save it
now obviously we don't have anything
stored so we're not going to get
anything here now the way I want this to
work is if there's no to dues if we
don't add any and there's nothing that I
want a file I want to create a file
that's going to initialize a couple
sample to dues like the ones we just had
so I'm not going to put that
functionality in the service I'm going
to put that in a separate file alright
so in the app folder I'm going to create
a new file I'm just going to call it in
it - - dues dot TS okay and we're going
to export class in it okay then we'll
have a function called load and this is
where we're going to check to see if
there's anything in local storage so
let's do if
local storage dot get item two dues is
equal to null or local storage dot two
dues I'm sorry local storage dot get
item two dues is equal to undefined okay
so if it's null or undefined that
obviously means that there's none there
and I'm actually going to just make this
a little smaller in this wider
okay so there's nothing in local storage
so let's first do a console log just to
let the user know we'll say no no to
dues found creating okay and then we're
going to create a variable called two
dues and set that to an array actually
I'm just going to paste this in same
stuff we had before okay so creates a
variable with the two dues so now we
need to set that value in local storage
so local storage dot set item now
remember I can't store and jason has to
be a string so what we'll do is let's
say set to dues to jason dot stringify
and then pass in two dues all right so
it'll turn it into a string and then
save it and then we're just going to
return okay now if this is false so if
there are two dues let's put an else
right here
and then we're just going to console.log
found to dues all right and that's it
that's our initial least an
initialization file so let's save it and
then I'm going to go back into our
service file and we need to import that
so we'll say import and knit from and
then we're going to go let's see we need
to go outside nope it's in this same
same file so just in it - duze okay now
in order to use that we're going to take
the to do service and we're going to say
extends in it okay and that's going to
give us an error right here because in
order to call the init class constructor
which we don't have one but it's still
giving us an error all we have to do is
type in super okay and that's going to
fix that all right and then finally we
just want to call the load function so
we'll say this dot load so let's go
ahead and save that and let that reload
and now you can see that those to do is
have been generated down here you can
see No - duze found creating so now that
we're fetching them from local storage
the next thing we want to do is want to
be able to add them to local storage
alright so back in the component where
are we to do is component TS we already
have the add to do and if we go ahead
and add it it is going to be added here
but it's not in local storage if I
reload it's not there anymore
so what we'll do is so we're going to go
right under the push we did here and
we're going to say this dot underscore
to do service dot add to do and we want
to pass in let's see we want to pass in
this dots too actually you know what
what I'm going to do is up here I'm
going to save our new to do equals and
then the object which is going to be
that and then instead of doing this
we're just going to push in new to do
okay and then down here we can just pass
in new to do now we're getting an error
here because that's not created yet so
let's save this and then we'll go and
create that in our service okay that's
going to take in new to do so first
thing we're going to want to do here is
just like we did here we're going to
just fetch the two dews from local
storage I'm going to copy that paste
that in and then we'll just add new to
do so we can say - duze dot push and
then we're going to pass in the new to
do
all right and then we need to set it
again
so say local storage dot set item
okay the item we're setting is to do's
and remember it has to be a string so
we're going to say Jason dot stringify
and then pass in two dues all right so
let's save that all right and then let's
put in a new to do here let's say go
food shopping and enter and now if I
reload you can see that it's there it's
still there that means it's in local
storage now what we want to do is the
delete I can still delete it here but if
I reload it's not going anywhere we need
to actually delete it from local storage
so we'll go back to our component to
dues component and go into our delete to
do function here and we'll go under the
for loop say this dot underscore to do
service dot delete to do and then we're
going to pass in to do text okay
now that should be uppercase T and then
what I'll do is I'm going to copy this
for loop because we're going to the same
basically the same idea in the service
so let's copy that and make sure that's
saved and then we'll go back into the
service and let's create delete to do
okay that's going to take in to do text
and let me just paste that in for now
that for loop by copied but before that
we're going to have to fetch the two
dues from local storage so I'll copy
that paste that in and instead of this
dot two dues it's going to just be to do
is because we're now using we're not
pertaining to that okay so we'll just
get rid of this
okay and then we just need to reset just
like we did up here
save that paste that in save and now if
I delete go food shopping and reload it
stays deleted alright now I realize that
we don't have a way to update these okay
so you might not want to have to delete
and then re-add it if you want to update
one so we're going to go ahead and do
that alright now what I'm going to do is
add a new property here and we're going
to call it app state all right and let's
set a default will say app state equals
default and then what I want to do is
make it so that when we click one of
these it's going to change into the edit
state all right so let's go to our HTML
and we're going to wrap around this to
do dot text let's put a span and we're
going to say click OK click equals hmm
let's say edit to do
okay so click equals edit to do and I
want to pass in the actual to do okay
let's save that let's go back into the
component say edit to do it's going to
take in to do and let's change the state
will say this dot app state is now going
to equal edit okay and let's console dot
log this dot app state alright I'm just
doing this off the top of my head I
didn't prepare this so forgive me if I
get a few errors o closing aught into
the closing button I'm sorry the closing
span
all right so if we click that changes it
to edit all right now when it's changed
I want to take that to do what I want to
input it into this this text box which
pertains to the text property so what I
can do is say this this dot text we're
going to set it to to do dot text all
right let's see what that does
okay if I click that there we go dinner
with wife click that so whatever one I
click is going to show up in that input
box now there's a few ways you could do
this but I think what I'll do is have a
different form for an update so and we
can do that depending on the state so
we'll say div div star ng-if and let's
say Apps state if app state is equal to
edit and I'll say is equal to default
then we want this
and then let's copy that and we'll say
if it's equal to edit then our submit
we're going to want this to be update to
do and actually know we can do is
include the heading so I'm going to get
rid of that and I'm going to put that in
here
add to do and then in the edit let's say
edit to do alright so let's try that
alright so I click that and you can see
we get edit to do so we know that this
is being loaded now when we click on one
of these and we see this text we want to
save this this text kay the old to do
before we change it so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to set another property
up here called old text and then we'll
go down here and when we go into edit to
do we're going to set that so we'll say
this dot old text is going to equal to
do dot text alright and then we're going
to have our update to do which is fired
off when we submit it and that's going
to take in actually that's not going to
take in anything what we want to do
let's first just console dot log and
then this dot text should be the new
value all right so we click on this
dinner with wife let's change it to
dinner with dad enter and now you can
see down here it's change so what we'll
do is loop through them just like we did
here with the delete a set in okay we're
going to we're going to loop through and
then instead of the to-do text right
here we're going to change it to this
dot old text
okay we're going to see if the current
iteration the current text is equal to
the text when we clicked on at the old
text if it is then we're going to save
this dot to dues
I dot text is going to be this dot text
which is the new text all right so let's
save that if I click on dinner with wife
change it to dad enter and now you can
see that that's changed to dad now if I
reload it's going to still be wife
because we haven't we haven't persisted
it to local storage through our service
so that's what we're going to do now so
under the for loop we're going to say
this dot underscore to do service dot
update to do okay and then we're going
to pass in both the old text this dot
old text and also this dot text which is
the new text save that and then let's go
into our service okay we're going to I'm
just going to copy what we have and
delete to do paste that and change it to
update to do okay it's going to get
passed in two things it's going to get
old text and we'll say new text okay
we're going to fetch the to do is just
like we did in all the other functions
and then we're going to loop through and
we're going to say if two dues I dot
text is equal to old text then we're
going to set to dues I dot text we're
going to set that to the new text
okay and then we're going to just set it
again down here so let's save that okay
dinner with wife change it to dad enter
changes there let's reload and it stays
alright so we now have full create read
update and delete operations on our to
Do's now real quick just to make it look
a little better we can add bootstrap so
let's just use the CDN actually no we
can use his boots watch basically gives
you some custom themes for your
bootstrap okay so we have all these
different themes
let's grab let's see we'll just grab
this superhero if I click download takes
us to a custom bootstrap CSS file I'm
just going to grab the link here copy
that and then we'll go into index.html
and let's just put that up here say link
rel stylesheet paste that in save it
okay and just to shape things up a
little bit let's go to get bootstrap and
I'm going to go to getting started
examples and the starter template right
here we're going to do a control U and
just grab the nav copy that and I'm
going to put this in the app component
HTML file we can actually get rid of
this h1 as well okay we'll paste that in
let's change the project name to a2 to
do's I'm going to get rid of the allies
we don't want any links and let's put
let's put a div here give it a class of
container okay and we'll just do div
class row okay we'll save that let's
take a look all right I actually want to
remove this class right here navbar
fixed top I'll get rid of that all right
and let's see let's do for the input I
want that to go all the way across so in
our to do is HTML file where we have our
input we're just going to add class
equals form control I'm going to do the
same for the other input here the edit
save that all right and then for the to
do list
let's see instead of actually will keep
the span but for the LI let's add a
class here of well alright actually no
you know what we'll do we're not going
to do well let's do the UL will give a
class of list group and then for the LI
we'll give that a class of list group
item
all right and then for these buttons
here let's let's give the button the
class of BTN and then BTN danger and
then I think we can do BTN SM for small
or is it's small maybe it's just SM
actually I think we can do BTN tiny
let's try that
well maybe not
let's see components actually you know
what that's fine let's just leave it
alright make sure it still works we get
rid of dad reload okay if we want to
edit one we'll change meeting with boss
to meeting with client enter if we
reload and it sticks so that's going to
be it for this video in this application
feel free to improve on it add to it
