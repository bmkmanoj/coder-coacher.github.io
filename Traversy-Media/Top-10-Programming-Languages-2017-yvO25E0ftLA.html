programming languages to learn in 2017
now as I've said many times before these
types of videos tend to bring out the
trolls and the fanboys people that have
their own opinion and declare it as fact
so before we begin I just want to
clarify a couple things so one this is
my opinion only everyone has an opinion
everyone's entitled to one you may or
may not agree with my opinion or another
person in the comment and feel free to
express your own opinions just please do
it in a respectful way and try to
realize that not everyone thinks and
learns the exact same way that you do I
know this is common sense for 99% of you
but there's there's always that 1% that
just doesn't get it all right so this is
a list based on my own experience in
research I've worked with most of these
languages on this list but for the ones
that I haven't I've done a ton of
research and have also talked to people
that do work with these languages daily
so I'm not just pulling the info out of
my ass the languages in this list are
going to be ranked by popularity syntax
ease of use things like that alright and
what I'll be doing is just briefly
explaining the advantages to each
language my suggestion to you guys would
be to watch the video do your own
research and then form an opinion of
your own and if you want to post your
own list in the comment section that's
absolutely fine as well alright and
lastly this list includes languages of
all kinds we're not just talking about
web development we're talking about
desktop apps mobile applications any
kind of programming language all right
so let's go ahead and get started all
right so first at number 10 we have go
also known as golang which was created
back in 2007 by google and it's become
increasingly popular due to its
simplicity in fact the team that created
go said that part of the motivation for
it was from their frustration with the
complexity of the C++ language go is a
statically typed language it's
relatively fast and not just programs
built on it but it also compiles code
very quickly go is or has backed in
concurrency support meaning
that processes can start run and finish
simultaneously it's also a garbage
collected language which means that the
developer doesn't have to worry too much
about memory management that stuff gets
taken care of on its own it's also a
language for productivity and the code
is really readable it has a rich
standard library and it even includes a
fully working web server I've you go
very briefly but it's definitely
something that I'm going to get I'm
going to use more and get into and
eventually create some videos and
courses around it alright so for number
9 I chose the rust programming language
rust was actually the most loved
language on Stack Overflow for 2016 it's
a general-purpose language that's used
to create fast and secure applications
and it's aimed to create code that's
memory safe and it eliminates the
creation of dangling pointers which are
a certain type of memory error it has to
do with D allocated memory and just some
real nerdy stuff that even I don't
really understand it also takes
advantage of powerful modern multi-core
processors and Russell is designed in a
way that it can it can be used to create
large client and server programs that
run over the Internet and it's also a
multi paradigm language it can be used
for a writing procedural code or
functional object-oriented and it's also
used to to perform concurrent operations
okay so it's really powerful in that
aspect and it uses a self-hosted
compiler called Rustique which was
developed by the mozilla family alright
so number eight is Swift now Apple has
basically moved away from objective-c
and move towards Swift it's proven to be
a smarter language and one that can
create a more direct and meaningful
connection between iOS developers and
end-users not only that but Swift will
also replace C the C language for
embedded programming on Apple platforms
so obviously this language is specific
to people that want to get into mobile
app development with iOS if you're a web
developer and you already have a couple
languages under your belt maybe learning
moving to learn Swift may not be a bad
idea
all right objective-c had a lot of
issues with the with the apps crashing
and Swift code is far less error-prone
because of its support through
manipulating text strings and data all
right classes are also not divided into
two parts like they are with Objective C
so you literally write less code than
you would if it was objective-c let's
see Swift also supports dynamic
libraries which are executable chunks of
code that can be linked to an app so
Swift apps can be linked to newer
versions of the language as it evolves
dynamic libraries are directly uploaded
to memory which cuts down on the initial
app size and that can increase
performance alright so number eight is
Swift so for number seven I chose Ruby
which obviously is the language for the
popular Ruby on Rails framework Ruby is
a dynamic reflective object-oriented and
general purpose programming language
Ruby syntax is incredibly readable in
fact they've seen code where I had to
kind of do a double-take because I
thought it was just written you know
written English text and that was one of
the goals of the developer was to create
a very readable syntax that's pretty
close to the English language data
structures are built into the language
such as a raised list and stacks
compared to something like C where you
basically have to rely on a library for
these things or write your own so as I
just stated Ruby is the language of
rails where a Ruby on Rails and that
alone is a good reason to learn it to
learn Ruby rails is broad agility and
module and a modular approach to
developing web applications and there's
not too much that you can't do with Ruby
on Rails the community I in my own
opinion I think has died down a little
bit if this were a couple years ago I
think Ruby would be a little further on
the list but all in all it's a really
good language and rails is a really good
framework for web applications and of
course Ruby has its own package manager
and dependency management and that's
ruby gems we can easily install and
remove software and dependencies using
gems and Ruby on Rails is actually
a gem itself all right so I put C++ at
number six which is a general-purpose
programming language and was built on
top of the C language C++ is extremely
powerful and high-performance it can be
used to build system software game
engines desktop applications as well as
web applications and the number of job
postings mentioned on indeed.com and I
think it was the last year in 2016 it
grew by 20,000 postings so there is a
high demand for it in the workplace C++
has imperative object-oriented and
generic features that can be used for
many things Windows is largely written
in C++ as well as some Linux desktop
environments such as KDE C++ is also
highly portable and it's often the
language of choice for multi device
multi-platform app development and it
has a very rich function library so
number five is C sharp which is a
language that was developed for
Microsoft's net framework it can also be
used on non Windows machines with the
release of the dotnet core open source
development platform C shop is also
being used to power unity which is an
incredible 2d and 3d game engine c-sharp
is also a pure object-oriented
programming language which allows us to
create much more modular and reusable
code this is a huge advantage over C++
in c-sharp everything is considered an
object even simple data structures so C
shop has very strong memory backup so
having a memory leak in a c-sharp
program it's not as big of a deal as it
would be in a lot of the other
programming languages and this gives
c-sharp and edge it also has a rich set
of libraries and as far as the learning
curve it's not that steep especially if
you already know a language like C or
C++ or or even Java all right now this
one I'm a I'm a take some heat for I put
PHP at number four and yes it's a love
or hate language and this is a open
source server-side language that's used
for web applications so love it or hate
it you can't really deny that PHP is
used all over the place it accounts for
a huge percentage of websites and
applications I don't know the exact
number but I know it's pretty high and
even WordPress alone which is a PHP blog
in CMS accounts for something like a
quarter of websites out there or
something like that PHP is a
multi-paradigm language meaning you can
use procedural code functional
object-oriented and other methods of
writing code the amount of freedom can
be a huge pro or a huge con depending on
it on the developer that's one thing
about PHP that really sucks is you can
write some really horrible code and it
will still work all right another big
plus to PHP is that it can be embedded
right into the HTML code as long as the
file has a PHP extension you can put PHP
anywhere you'd like as long as it's
wrapped in tags it's also very easy to
learn I think a big part of that is due
to how flexible it is and again this can
be good or bad it allows sloppy code to
work and that's really not a good thing
but either way it is really easy to
learn all right and one of the best
features of PHP is how simple it is to
deploy you can pay five bucks a month
for shared hosting and simply upload all
your files
you don't need shell access most hosting
companies have PHP and MySQL
pre-installed so deploying is extremely
easy and then you also have frameworks
like laravel which is probably I would
say the best framework out there for PHP
and then you also have cake PHP code
ignitor which is really easy to learn
framework so there's a there is a lot
going on with PHP even in 2017 alright
so number three is Java Java is a
general-purpose
object-oriented language it's been
around for quite a while and is
extremely popular now when it comes to
finding a job in the programming world
learning Java will give you the most
opportunity it's ruled the job market
for years now and in 2017 the number of
jobs on NB com have risen by 30,000
posts so that's pretty significant and
in addition to that 90% of fortune 500
company
use Java as a server-side language for
back-end development so Java is pretty
much the official language for
enterprise there is a saying in the Java
world right once run anywhere meaning
that compiled Java code should run on
all platforms that support Java without
having to recompile ok Java applications
compiled to bytecode which can run on
any JVM or virtual java virtual machine
unlike C and C++ alright in addition to
computer programs Java is used on
Android systems so you can also have the
benefit of learning mobile app
development now as far as learning Java
I wouldn't say it's easy but I would say
it's relatively easy if you compare it
to other languages of its kind it was it
was pretty much designed to have a
simple and no-nonsense syntax and
finally Java was built to be extremely
robust and secure Java puts a lot of
energy on early error checking as the
compilers are able to detect many
different issues that other language
compilers would not detect beforehand
alright so that's number three number of
two is python python is a
general-purpose language that focuses on
productivity and it can be used for
desktop apps web apps data mining and
much more even robotics and biometric
stuff I'm using Python a lot these days
and I really enjoy it if I made this a
few months ago I probably would have put
PHP above Python until I actually
started to get into it the syntax is
very readable it's clean its
straightforward I think it's pretty
similar to Ruby in my opinion much of it
just looks like written English which
makes it very easy to learn and not only
that but I realized that you can do a
lot with Python with a small amount of
code okay Python also has a huge
standard library it ships with things
like XML parsers multimedia services
protocol support and a ton of other
stuff and as far as web development
I think Python uses one of the best web
frameworks out there which is Django and
I haven't done
too much with Django yet on this channel
because I'm rather new to it and I'm
learning a lot about it but I can create
a basic crud application and and you
know implement authentication stuff like
that Python also has the flask framework
which is a micro framework which I've
worked with briefly and it's pretty easy
to catch on as well
Python has some asynchronous coding
benefits so rather than writing we can
use a single event loop to do work in
small units and like some other
languages we looked at Python is
multi-paradigm we can use procedural
programming functional as well as
object-oriented programming all right so
we're down to number one and if you've
been keeping up with my channel in my
videos you probably already knew what
number one was going to be javascript is
the programming language of the web and
of the browser and now beyond so it's
absolutely everywhere it's used in
something like 90% of the webpages on
the Internet I would encourage everyone
to learn JavaScript even if you're not a
web developer now we have things like
electron which which can allow us to
write desktop applications with
JavaScript
we have react native ionic PhoneGap
these are all technologies that allow us
to create mobile applications and hybrid
applications using javascript and HTML
and CSS nodejs is an incredible
server-side technology which acts as
JavaScript runtime we also have npm node
package modules which is part of node
and gives us a package manager so we can
easily install software javascript is
continuously evolving with es6 and now
we have seven javascript has lots of
missing pieces back and if you look at
the old es 5 and and before that but
that's all now coming together and it's
being all the missing parts are being
put into these new these new standards
of JavaScript ok and then we have
frameworks like angular react view and
many other front-end frameworks as well
as back-end we have Express so I can't
say enough about JavaScript and where
it's going to go from here I would
definitely suggest that all of you learn
script no matter what what profession
you're in alright guys so that's going
to be it for this guide or this whatever
you want to call it countdown I don't
know but you know I'm sure that there's
a lot of you out there that disagree
with some of what I say or maybe even
all of what I say but you know this is
just my experience in my opinion so try
not to get too hung up on it and that's
it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
