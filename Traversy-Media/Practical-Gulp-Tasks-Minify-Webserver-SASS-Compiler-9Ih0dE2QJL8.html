gulp which is a task runner or a build
runner and it's very powerful you can
use it to do all kinds of tasks what I'm
going to show you today is just
scratching the surface there's a lot
more you can do with and if you've ever
used grunt it's it's pretty similar to
grunt there's a lot of the same tasks
that you can do with gulp but in my
opinion it's a little easier to learn
and I think it's a little more powerful
but that's just my opinion but anyways
what we're going to do is I'm going to
show you a couple tasks we're going to
minify our javascript alright so we'll
have a source file that we actually edit
and use in development and then we'll
run it through gulp and it'll minify it
and then move it to a distribution
folder alright so well minified
javascript will also run a webserver
I'll show you how to get a webserver up
and going
using the gulp web server plug-in I
think it used to be gulp connect I'm
pretty sure it used to be but now it's
gulp web server alright then we're going
to compile as CSS files which are sass
files sass is a CSS preprocessor I do
have some videos on it if you want to
check those out it's really helpful you
can do things like have variables in
your CSS mix-ins which are like
functions you can nest styles there's a
lot of stuff you can do with it and then
we're going to use the JavaScript lint
plugin and what that does is it helps us
debug and it can it can give us some
extra hours and you know if we forget
semicolons or whatever it may be and
then finally we're going to implement
browserify and watch if I and that's
probably the most difficult thing that
we're going to do browserify what it
does is it allows you to use NPM modules
without having a node server all right
so it allows us to to use that common
j/s syntax and require files require
third-party modules
and we don't need any kind of server
alright so let's go ahead and get
started this is the github repository
here let's click on go alright but we're
not gonna actually do anything with this
because we can just install gulp through
NPM alright and then the page I just
showed you it's pretty easy to setup
we're just going to install it globally
first so you can use it anywhere and
then we're going to create our project
folder and install it as a dev
dependency then we're going to create a
gulp file dot J s this is where all of
your tasks will go and this is very
simple syntax gulp task you want to name
it and then you run your function
alright and then finally you just run
gulp alright so let's go ahead and
create a project folder so I'm just
going to create a folder on my desktop
and let's just call it gulp dev
all right now as far as command-line
tools I'm using git bash for windows if
you want to grab that you can go to get
- SCM comm download it it's going to
give you the git version control system
but it also comes with this git bash
utility that I really like alright and
if you install it you can actually right
click on a folder and you'll get this
context menu and you can just open up
git bash in that folder alright so I
prefer it over the standard windows
command prompt it also gives you some
extra UNIX based tools all right you'll
also need nodejs installed in npm NPM
comes with nodejs if you're using
windows just click on the big download
for Windows button if you're using Linux
or Mac you can install it however you
want through your package managers or or
whatever just make sure you get that
installed alright so first thing we're
going to do is install golf globally so
we want to say NPM install and you want
to add dash G and then go
alright so that'll install it globally
and they'll be pausing the video when
we're installing stuff like this just so
you guys don't have to sit here and
watch it so it may seem to take longer
for you than me but that's only because
I'm pausing it
alright so gulp is now installed
globally so what I want to do now is go
to our project folder and we're going to
create we're gonna create a package dot
JSON file and if you have any experience
with nodejs you probably know what that
is
it's basically a manifest it holds
things like the app name the author but
most importantly it holds all your
dependencies and your dev dependencies
alright and you can actually install
modules through that file all right now
you could just go ahead and create it
but what we're going to do is run NPM in
it and that's going to just ask us some
questions and it'll create the file for
us so the name will just keep as gulp
dev version 1.00 fine description will
just say simple gulp app I guess entry
point let's make that app dot J s you
don't need test repository keywords
author you can put your own name in
there license we'll just keep the
defaults ok so it's going to ask us if
this is alright that's fine and creates
the file for us alright so if we go
ahead and open that up
all right so we don't have any
dependencies yet and you could just put
it in here but we can also install them
through through the command line and
also save them in this file all right so
first of all we're gonna need gulp
locally so what we're gonna do is say
npm install and then we want to attach
double - and then save - dev all right
so that's going to go ahead and install
gulp locally and it should add it to
that file as well so let's open that
again
no it didn't
oh I'm an idiot I just said npm install'
we didn't even say gulp I sorry about
that guys so we'll have make sure that
we install gulp alright so you can see
down here created a node modules folder
and it should have a gulp folder as well
that's where all the code is for gulp
you don't need to touch that at all
alright and if we reload this package
file you can now see that we have dev
dependencies and we have gulp alright
and installs the latest stable version
let's go ahead and create the rest of
our folders here alright so we're going
to want and what we're doing here we're
building a directory structure that you
can use that you can reuse when you
build other applications alright so
we're going to create an SRC folder and
this is where the JavaScript that we're
actually going to edit and develop with
is going to go alright and then when we
save it and we run it through gulp it's
going to do all our compiling and then
it'll spit out another file in the dist
folder
alright so in the sauce folder let's go
ahead and just create an app J s file
alright and let's see what else we need
let's create an index.html first thing I
want to do is be able to minify our
JavaScript so we're going to need a
plug-in called gulp uglify alright so we
can go and install that here we're just
gonna say gulp - uglify and that will
install it and it'll also save to our
package JSON file
all right so now what we need to do is
create a gulp file ok so create a new
text file and you want this to be called
gulp file dot J s alright and we'll open
that up ok so first thing I'm gonna do
we need to require if gulp itself so I'm
going to save our gulp equals require
and we're gonna pass in go alright now
we want the uglify module so we need to
include that as well and this is going
to be gulp - uglify alright so before we
go in and use the and create the
minification let me just show you the
syntax so it's gulp
a dot task and then we want to pass in
the name of the task let's just say
example and then we're going to have a
function alright and let's just do
console dot log and we'll say running
example all right so let's save that and
go back into our command line let me
make this bigger
you guys probably can't see that alright
so we're in the gulp dev directory so
what we want to do is say gulp example
alright and you can see here it tells us
that it's using the file and then it's
starting example and then it does the
tasks which were just console logging
run example and then it tells us when
it's finished
alright so let's create something that
actually does something helpful all
right so let's change this task load
let's change it to minify j/s alright
and then inside here what we're going to
do is return the gulp dot SRC so this is
where we can define the source file and
we're gonna say it's in the SRC folder
and it can be anything
dot j s alright so any javascript file
and then we're going to go ahead and say
dot pipe and we're going to pass in the
the uglify module
our function and then we want to do
another pipe oops
and this is where we want to put our
destination folder so we're going to say
go dots dest and then we're going to
pass in our distal der all right that's
where we want the minified code to to be
available now what we can do instead of
having to say gulp and then the name of
the task we can create a default task
down here so we'll say gulp dot task and
we want to pass in default all right and
then it takes an array of tasks that we
want to run all right so we want minify
j/s let's and that should actually have
quotes let's add some comments
all right so let's save that and now if
we go to our JavaScript file let's go to
source app J s and let's just write some
meaningless JavaScript will say function
do something and we'll just alert
something we'll create a variable say
variable I equals 12 doesn't really
matter what we're doing here we'll put
another function say log something and
then we'll change that to console dot
log all right so we have our JavaScript
file now to minify it all we need to do
is say go alright and you can see that
it started the minified j/s task and now
if we go to our dist we have an app j s
file if we open that up you can see it's
it's completely minified all right so
it's as easy as that very very small
amount of code and it's super helpful
all right so the next thing I want to do
is show you how to use sass s CSS files
and have gulp compile them alright so
let's go and let's open up the index
page first of all and just put some
standard HTML in here
we'll say go dev for the title and then
we want to first of all include the CSS
file now we'll be working in the S CSS
file and then we'll compile it to CSS so
that's what we want to include in our
link here all right so it's going to be
CSS slash style dot CSS alright and then
let's include our disc JavaScript down
here
okay so we'll say script SRC it's going
to be in the dist folder slash app dot j
s alright and then let's just put up
we'll just say welcome
all right and if we open that up
okay so here's our HTML file now it
should have ran that JavaScript okay
that's fine we don't have the stylesheet
yet but it should have ran oh no we
didn't call the function that's right
all right so let's call it so down here
we'll say do something and we'll say log
something and if we save it and then we
go back and say gulp that's going to run
it through again okay so now we're
getting our alert and then we get the
console log all right so back to the s
CSS we're going to have to create two
folders so we want a s CSS folder and
then we want a CSS folder
all right so in s CSS we're going to
create a file called style dot s CSS
all right and we're going to open that
up
and let's set a couple variables all
right so to setup variable you can use
the dollar sign will say background
color and we'll set that to red and
let's set color to white
oops I don't want that all right and
then we'll have our body set background
color and we want that set to our
variable and we'll set the color as well
okay so let's save that now we have to
create the task and it's very similar
I'm just going to copy this
okay
and we'll just call this sass and then
we're going to use the same SRC
except we want as CSS slash and then any
file that ends in s CSS okay and then
we're going to call the sass
module and we're going to set the
destination to CSS all right so it's as
simple as that now we can add that to
our default and now when we run gulp
it'll do that so if we reload now it's
gonna it's not going to take it because
we haven't ran gulp yet so let's go
ahead and do that
what's a SAS is not defined
oh we don't have the plug-in the module
installed so let's go ahead and do that
we want to say NPM install save dev
gulps s and then we want to include it
here kind of a brain fought
all right now if we go in run gulp can
see that it ran the SAS task and now if
we reload we get our red background and
our white text next thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to install the J's hint
module and what that'll do it'll help us
with debugging and error checking and
that all right so let's go to our git
bash utility and one install gulp - Jas
hint
all right so now let's go back to our
gulp file and we need to include it okay
I'll call this Jes hint and then we want
to require gulp j/s hint and then we'll
create the task
and we'll call this hint
and let's see we want the source to be
the same and then we're just going to
change that to J s hint and then we want
to say pipe dot J s hint dot reporter
and let's see the task we want to put in
here default and let's go down here and
include that
hint
all right so it looks good let's save
that
okay if we wanna go
and now you can see right here it
actually found something alright so in
our style dot s CSS files looks like
we're missing expected alignment or
function call instead of expression I'm
not exactly sure what they mean here
because there is a semicolon assignment
a function call and instead so are an
expression
not sure what that means so I'm gonna
ignore that but you can see that it can
be helpful and it can give you errors
and hints that normally you wouldn't see
in the console or or anywhere so it
makes debugging a little easier alright
so next thing let's see what we got left
a web server so we want to install the
gulp web server module so say npm
install save dev and sculpt web server
all right and we're going to want to
include that
all right
and then we'll make a task for it
so we're gonna need a source
oops
okay we'll just call it web server
and then I'm gonna say gulp thoughts
source and what I'm gonna do is I want
to move basically just our application
our client-side files to the app folder
all right so let's create an app folder
and we'll put the index file there let's
close it
and then I'm gonna switch things up a
little bit all right so I'm gonna put
the CSS folder in there as well and then
also I want the compiled JavaScript
folder in there so let's create a j/s
folder and I'm actually just going to
move this to that to that j/s folder all
right and of course we need to update
our gulp file okay so now we don't need
this dist all right so let's just update
this real quick
javascript is now gonna go to so
actually source is the same but it's
gonna go to app /j s when it's compiled
and then this is gonna go to app slash
CSS and I think that's that's good
all right so back to the web server and
now we want to say pipe and then we want
to call web server and we're going to
pass in an object here and we want to
define the port we'll say 4,000 and we
can actually do a live reload and we'll
set that to true and you want to set
open to true as well all right and then
we don't need this this pipe
all right so let's put this down here in
gulp in the default save and let's go
and run it
and it opens it right up for us and then
it should lie it should reload if we
edit something so let's go to app index
and let's see we'll say welcome let's
change this to hello world and save and
updates for us all right so now you can
just streamline your development and
it'll auto update for you you don't have
to go and restart it now if we go ahead
and change something in our source
JavaScript file let's open that up and
let's say actually we need to update the
index.html as well instead of this dist
app it should be Jas
okay so let's update the app J s and
will change something to hello world and
save it
and if we reload we're still getting
something we're not getting hello world
alright so the web server is running but
it's not the app Jas is not going
through the compiler or the minify er so
what we can do here is implement a watch
so let's go back to gulp file and we're
gonna right here we want to watch these
files for changes alright so we're going
to set a new task will say gulp task
watch and so let's see if we can get rid
of this will say go don't watch
okay so we want to watch the source we
wanted to watch the source so SRC and
then any JavaScript file alright and
then we want to define the task which is
minify J s alright and then we also want
to watch our SAS compiler so we'll say
gulp dot watch and this will be s CSS
slash and then any s CSS file and SAS
alright and then we also have to add
watch down here
all right so let's save that and let's
cancel that out and then we'll rewrite
and go okay it's gonna start the server
we get hello world all right now let's
try again and edit that okay so we'll go
to a app j/s and let's change it to
welcome save it
okay and then if we go back we get
welcome alright so now it's gonna it's
going to compile after every save we
don't have to go and run gulp alright so
you can see it just continuously runs
all right so this video is getting a
little longer than expected so I'm not
gonna do the browserify in this video
I'll create another one for that but
yeah so gulp is really easy to use you
can see the syntax is simple we're just
calling tasks we're using pipe we're
calling the source and then the
destination and that's about it for most
of these something like browserify is a
little more complicated that's why I
want to do that in a separate video but
yeah hopefully you guys like this and
learn something and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
