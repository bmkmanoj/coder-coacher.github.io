we're going to be taking a look at Emmet
which is one of my favorite tools for
web development it really really
streamlines and increases your workflow
with HTML and CSS and gives you some
really nice abbreviation so that you can
quickly add your markup and you can
quickly add your CSS and it also gives
you some really cool actions such as
quickly commenting out blocks of code
and then uncommenting them so this is
something that I think every cent every
developer should at least look at and
try if you don't like it you don't need
to use it but my guess is that if you
try it you're going to love it because
it's going to just cut out a lot of the
crap that you don't want to do you know
so we're going to take a look at it
mostly the HTML abbreviations but we'll
also take a look at some of the CSS and
I think you'll enjoy it and let's get
started this video is sponsored by dev
Mountain if you're interested in
learning web development iOS or UX
design dev Mountain is a 12-week design
and development bootcamp
intended to get you a full time job in
the industry to learn more visit dev

description below
alright so Emmet is used as a text
editor plug-in and if we go to Emmet IO
and we go to download it's going to show
you all the different text editors and
all the IDE that you can use Emmet with
now installing Emmet is going to be
different depending on what you're using
in this video we're actually going to be
using atom which is a really nice text
editor by github it's built on electron
which is a JavaScript platform for
building desktop applications it's one
of the most popular text editors for
both front and back-end development so
that's what we'll be using but of course
you can use sublime text you can use
NetBeans IDE Eclipse notepad plus plus
there's third-party support for visual
studio code for phpstorm just pretty
much any any decent editor that is
available at this time alright so we're
going to go into Adam just open that up
what I have here is a folder called
Emmett's sandbox and this will all be
available for download and I have an
abbr
HTML file so abbreviations dot HTML and
I have a bunch of comments here which is
going to be kind of our guide to to the
abbreviations that we're going to use
and then we also have a CSS file and
then in actions HTML file we'll get into
that later now to install Emmet in atom
it's very very easy all you have to do
is go to settings and go to install you
can search for Emmet click on packages
and you can see I already have it
installed if you don't you'll see this
install button just go ahead and click
that and then you'll have settings
uninstalled disabled you might have to
restart the editor for it to take effect
though all right so once you have that
setup we're going to jump in now again
if you're not using atom all of the
abbreviations are still going to be the
same you're just going to have to
install it on whatever text editor
you're using obviously I can't go
through every single text editor and go
through the steps but it should be
pretty easy especially if you've
installed plugins before so let's start
off right here now in the comment we
have the actual shortcode or
abbreviation that we're going to type
now to trigger our abbreviations you
just hit tab so for instance I'm going
to go right here and I'm going to hit
div tab and what that's going to do is
it's going to give us a beginning div
tag and an ending div tag which isn't
really anything special in fact in atom
even if you don't have Emmet installed
it'll do this but we'll get into you
know the more advanced stuff along the
way but we're going to start at the you
know start at the very bare-bones here
so let's say we wanted an h1 at
beginning and end tag we could say h1
tab okay so that way we don't have to
type out the ending tag and the brackets
and all that now there's also short
codes for longer elements for instance
blockquote header footer button things
like that so let's say we wanted to
block quote we could do B Q tab that
will give us a block quote if we wanted
a header we could do HDR tab footer we
could do FT our tab button BTN tab and
you
can still do the long version as well so
I could still say header tab and that
will give us a header as well all right
now let's get into adding classes and
ID's so as you guys know if you know any
HTML CSS you know that a class is
represented by a dot and ID is
represented by a hash or a number sign
so let's start off by creating an h1
with the class of my headings so
normally you do like div class and you
put the name of the class in this case
my heading and then you'd end the div
like that but with Emmet what we can do
is we can just say whoops that was a div
I meant to do an h1 but whatever if we
wanted an h1 with the class of my
heading we can just do h1 dot my heading
tab and that will give us a class of my
heading so let's say we want to div with
the class of my class
so we could say divs dot my class tab
all right now when we're using gives you
don't even have to use the div element
you don't have to type out div dot you
can just do dot my class tab and it'll
give you a div with my class ok now if
you wanted to add more than one class on
to the same element that's easy as well
so let's do a div with a class of class
one and class two
so we'll do dot class one dot class two
tab and now it gives us a div with both
classes okay just make sure that you
attach it right here you don't put a
space and then dot class two because
that's going to mess it up
all right just make sure that they're
attaching like that all right now for
IDs we can do hash and then let's say we
want to div with the ID of my ID so
we'll say hash my ID tab and that will
give us a div with the ID of my ID all
right now we can also mix and match IDs
and classes so let's say we wanted to
div with both my ID and a class of my
class we could do hash my ID and then
dot my class tab and now you'll see it
gives us an ID and a class
all right and if we wanted to do you
know more than one class with the ID we
could do my ID and then a class of class
1 oops got the dot class 1 and then
another class of class 2 tab and now we
have our ID we also have two classes all
right so that takes care of just you
know the plain element as well as IDs
and classes now what if we want to add
content into our element so for that we
use brackets so what I'm going to do is
go right here and let's say we want to
have an h1 and inside the h1 we want to
have the text my title so for for
content we use our curly braces so we'll
say h1 curly brace is my title and make
sure you go to the very end and hit tab
and now we have an h1 with the text to
my title ok you can also you know add a
class to the h1 if you want so we'll say
h1 dot read and then we'll put our curly
braces and we'll say my read title hit
tab and now we have an h1 with the class
of red and it has my red title as the
content
alright this actually shouldn't be here
so what about nesting what if we want to
put you know an element inside of an
element so for that we want to use an
angle bracket so we want to use a
greater than sign so let's go right down
here and let's say that we want to div
inside that div we want a ul and then
inside that ul we want an Li so what we
would do is take the div we'll use the
the nesting character which is the angle
bracket or the greater than and then
we'll do ul and then we'll do another
angle bracket and then Li and then tab
and you can see what that's done it's
created a div inside the div put the UL
inside the UL put the li all right so
let's say we wanted to put some content
in the li we could do the same thing
they could say div inside the div the UL
inside the UL the Li and then inside the
Li will just say list item 1 and then
tab and you can see it's put the content
inside there
now what if we wanted to put more than
one Li usually when you have an
unordered list you'll have more than one
list item so for that we can use
multiplication and we use the asterisk
for that so let's say we want a ul we
want to give it the ID of navigation
right and then inside there we want to
nest the in Li but we want more than one
Li we want five of them so what we can
do is we can say multiply by five right
and then we'll put another angle bracket
and then the content that's going to be
within it and I'll just say list item
one all right we'll hit tab and now we
have the UL ID of navigation we have
five lis and inside it says list item
one now we can take this a step further
we can actually use an index so that we
can access whatever an index number of
the Li we're on so instead of doing list
item one and all of these let's do one
through five so to do that same thing
we're going to take a UL ID of
navigation and we're going to put Li
times five right and then for the
content we're going to say list item and
then a money sign which represents the
index so we get tab and now we get a
list item one two three four five all
right so just a cool little trick if you
want to add an index in there so we've
talked about nesting with the angle
bracket with the greater sign a greater
than sign so what about siblings what
about things that are on the same level
so if we look at this ul here all of
these lis are on the same level
okay the Allies are actually a child of
the UL and ul is a parent of the Allies
but these are all siblings so let's say
that we want to create a div and then on
the same level we want a ul so four
siblings we're going to use a plus a
plus symbol so we'll do plus ul and then
let's do plus Li and then tab and you'll
see that it created all three of these
elements but nothing is nested
they're all siblings they're all in the
same level all right so let's say we
wanted to have an h1 with a class of
title and on the same level we wanted to
have a paragraph of the class of body
hit tab and now we have an h1 and a
paragraph with classes on the same level
now what if we wanted to wrap a div
around these so we can mix and match
using you know nested elements with
siblings so what we would do is we could
say we'll have a div and then inside
that will have the h1 with a class of
title and on that same level we'll have
a paragraph with the class of body so
now we have a div with an h1 and a
paragraph inside of it alright so we can
also group things together so what I'm
going to do here is create a div and
then we're going to go ahead and nest in
a group so we use parentheses for groups
and this group is going to have a header
and inside the header will have a UL
inside the UL will have an Li let's do
two Li so we'll say multiply by two and
then we'll put an a tag inside the
allies all right then outside the group
let's go
plus footer so on the same level of the
div we should have the footer and then
we'll nest a paragraph inside there and
I guess in the paragraph let's put some
content we'll just say
copyright 2017 okay we'll hit tab and it
created all this content all this markup
for us so we have our div we have our
header and footer which are on the same
levels the header has the UL with the
two l is the footer has the paragraph
all right now we can also add attributes
now sometimes when you do for instance a
tab it'll automatically add an attribute
like an href because you're not going to
really see an a tag without an href at
least not very often so they actually
included that by default but to add
custom attributes you can do you can use
brackets so let's put some brackets here
and I am actually going to use an 8
tref is one of these so we'll say we
wanted to go to http google.com but
let's say we wanted to add a target
attribute as well so we just put a space
here and say target equals do blank and
then if we wanted to add a title we
could do that as well
like that and then we'll go in and we'll
hit tab and now you'll see it turns it
into an a tag with all of those
attributes of course it doesn't have to
be an a tag you can add attributes to
any element all right so now let's take
a look at forms and input now before I
do this I want to show you guys a couple
resources because I'm not going to be
going over every single abbreviation so
if I go back to my browser okay one of
them is this cheat sheet this is at
Doc's Emma do slash cheat sheet and this
has all the different all the different
symbols you'll see multiplication
nesting siblings all the stuff we just
went over but it goes in depth with the
different abbreviation so if you want a
color input a number input I'm not going
to go over every single one so this is a
good resource for you guys all right
it's pretty big - pretty long then you
have all the CSS stuff and then you also
have a file called snippets dot jason
which is actually included on your
computer if you installed Emmet and you
can you can actually edit this file but
this is the github page of it and it's
separated into CSS right here and this
has all the different CSS abbreviations
we're going to go over some of these and
then down here we'll have the HTML let
me just scroll down right here we have
all the HTML stuff so for instance BR is
going to give you a br tag image tags
inputs all this stuff so you might want
to look into this we're actually going
to add a custom custom abbreviation in a
little bit but I will get to that in a
little bit now we're going to take a
look at forms and input so if I just say
form tab that gives us an act
chin again because that's that's a
common attribute and they decided to put
that in there by default now usually you
would want to have a method attribute to
say is this going to make a post request
or a get request so if we want this to
be a get request form we can say form :
get tab and that will give us a method
get same thing with posts we can say
form : post that will give us a method
of post okay so if we type in label tab
that will give us a label with a four
attribute if we do input the default for
that is going to be a text attribute
freaking seagulls the default is going
to be a text attribute and I'll show you
how to change that in a minute
now if we do InP tab that'll also give
us an input but it will add a name and
an ID which is very common when you're
building forms all right now if we want
to change it from a text to let's say an
email input we can say input : email tab
and that'll make it an email alright if
we want to make it a submit input we can
do input s tab and we get submit and
again you want to check these these
resources here let me just show you real
quick so or is it looking for the submit
right here input s okay so you can do
input S or input submit and that will
give you the input with the type of
submit also a value okay so this is kind
of like a cheat sheet in itself now to
locate this file it's going to be
different depending on what text editor
you're using I'm using Adams so it's
going to be in my users folder and then
in the user whatever user in my case
Brad and then dot Adam packages Emmet
node modules Emmet and then live and
you'll see I have a snippet Jason file
and I can go ahead and open that up
alright and that's going to be the same
file that we just looked at on github it
has all the CSS Aviation's and all the
HTML abbreviations
and I'm going to show you how to add a
custom one in a minute so let's move on
to X let's do a select real quick so if
we say select tab that will give us a
select tag within that name in an ID now
we also have extended structures we can
use this plus symbol so for instance if
I say select plus tab that will actually
add the option in there an option tag if
we do table plus that will give us a
table row and table column if we do oh L
plus that will give us the Li same thing
with ul plus all right so it just adds
the the inner tags of the of these
elements alright so let's take a look at
creating a custom alias in the snippets
file so let's say if we go back up here
and we look at this this right here we
created a div we have an h1 and a pin a
paragraph class of title class of body
let's say we want this to show up if we
say post tab so we want to create a
custom a custom abbreviation called
posts so what I'll do is go into the
snippets file make sure you're in the
HTML section and then inside
abbreviations let's just go all the way
down okay so it ends yeah it ends right
here so I'm going to put a comma and
then let's do post and what we'll do is
we'll set this to let's do div no clean
quotes here so we'll say div with the ID
of post and inside that we want to have
an h1 with this class of title and on
the same level we want a paragraph with
the class of body all right so that's
what we want as our post so let's go
ahead and save this now if I try and do
it and let me just go down here if I try
and do post tab it's not going to work
because we need to actually restart Adam
since we edited that file so I'm just
going to close it up and restart
and then if I go right here and I say
post tab now you can see we have our
little post template all right now you
probably would have this you know you
have a lot more markup in here something
that's actually worth you to create a
snippet for or an abbreviation for but
just know that you can do that all right
another very helpful thing with Emmet is
we have document structure short codes I
keep columns short codes but there are
abbreviations for instance the
exclamation you guys have probably seen
me use this quite a bit if I just put an
exclamation and I hit tab it gives us
this entire HTML structure with the
doctype with the HTML tags the head and
body tags the title the viewport it
gives us all that stuff just from typing
in exclamation tab which is really
helpful now by default it's set to html5
so if I go down here and I say html5 :
I'm sorry HTML : five tab it gives me
the same thing but we can also set this
up for different versions of HTML for
instance if we want HTML for
transitional we can say HTML : 40 tab
and you'll see it actually gives us the
doctype for HTML 4 okay in transitional
mode now if we look at the just go back
to the snippets file when we go down
right here you'll see the different
options so html5 I showed you that 44
transitional we have HTML 4 static we
have X XHTML XML you can also use Emmet
with SVG so there's a lot of stuff that
you can do that I'm not going to get
into you can even you can create a whole
course on Emmet but I want to just show
you the basics and fundamentals of
things that I use the most all right
let's go back to Adam and now what I
want to show you is something else
you've probably seen me use quite a bit
if you if you watch my videos and that's
the alarm if some generator so that's
the dummy text generator you'll see if I
go over here
I type in larom tab it'll give me a
paragraph of sample text okay now if I
want to limit the number of words to say
ten I can say LARM ten tab and it will
give me ten words okay if I say lorem
500 tab it will give me 500 words okay
and then another cool thing we could do
is let's say we wanted to create an
unordered list and we wanted to have
four list items with different dummy
text in each one so we could easily do
that by saying you L will give it a
class of my list and we're going to set
we're going to nest into that alarm 10.8
'im and then we're going to say x four
and then tab and what this has done is
its created an unordered list with the
class of my list and it gives us four
allies with the class of item and then
we have some dummy text in each Li okay
notice that the text is all different so
this is really good for prototyping and
just creating something to look at while
you're creating your templates or your
your you eyes or websites or whatever it
may be all right now for the CSS I'm not
going to really get in depth in this
because for one thing this video is
running kind of long already
but the HTML is is the the most
important part that I wanted to cover at
least in this video so in the CSS file I
have this my element right and I'm just
going to show you some of the different
abbreviations and again you want it you
want to use that cheat sheet as a
reference but let's go over some of the
simpler things so let's start with the
colors so for color we can do C colon
and then let's say we want this to be
black so color black I'm going to say
hash 0 0 0 tab and that will give us a
color of black we can even use a short
cut shorter shortcut and say C hash 0
tab because since the color is all zeros
we can just specify 1 0 if we wanted it
to be let's say light gray so f4 3 times
we could say C and then we can do hash
f4 tab
and it'll make it light gray okay so
that's colors let's talk a little bit
about positioning so if we wanted to
position this element absolute we could
say P : a tab and that will give us
position:absolute let's say we wanted to
do relative we could do P : our tab
position:relative we can do fixed we can
do well since they're static so P : s
would be static now if we wanted to set
the coordinates for instance we want to
do top 100 pixels we can do T 100 tab
now by default it's going to do pixels
but you could do percentages if you want
so if we say top let's do 50 P tab top
just t t 50 P tab and that will do a 50%
if you want to use ends you can do let's
do it from the from the left so we'll
say left not left just l see L will say
3 e tab so that'll be left 3m all right
so for floating we could do FL tab and
that will do float left by default we
could also do FL : L which will also do
float left we could do float right by FL
r if we wanted to do float:none we could
do FL n all right and then to clear we
can say CLR tab that'll do clear right
by default but we could also do what is
it CL r which would be we should do
clear right we can do CL L which should
be clear left
CL be clear both and CL n clear none
alright another thing we can do is set
the display so let's say D B that will
display as block we could say di for
inline or D IB for display:inline-block
for per margin we can say M 10 tab that
will give us 10 pixel margin we can do
specific position so let's say margin
right so mr
10 would be margin-right we could do ml
20 notice I'm not putting the colon it's
not required but you can for instance we
can say MB : 10 and that will do
margin-bottom 10 pixels and again we
don't have to use pixels we can say m t1
e and that will be margin-top 1m okay
padding we have the same thing we can
say P : 30 or we can just say P 30 okay
that will both give us padding 30 pixels
if we wanted to do padding top we could
do pt 40 padding top PL I don't know 12
padding left okay so just some some nice
shortcuts so for sizing we can do
Heights and widths so if we say W 100
tab that'll do with 100 pixels we could
also do percentages so if I say H let's
say H 50 P that'll do height 50 percent
we could also do H auto H col h : auto
or just H auto or maybe H auto doesn't
work now if that doesn't work my
suggestion would be to always use the
colon because sometimes it's not going
to work without it let's see what else I
want to show you real quick for lists
so if we say list : n that'll do list
tight list-style-type:none we could do
list : see that would do circle we have
list
let's : s would be square and so on
again you want to look at the snippets
file or the cheat sheet you can see
everything that's that's available let's
see text align so text align would be ta
so we could do ta l which you do left we
could do ta : R which would be right we
can do justify so ta J would be
justified we can do text decorations
so if we want text-decoration:none we
can do TD n we can do TD u for
text-decoration:underline fonts I think
this is really cool the font family so
let's say we want say F F : a tab and
that will give us the whole you know
arial helvetica sans-serif this is
something I hate typing out so that's
really helpful there's also like F F F F
T which will give us Times New Roman
some fallbacks F F V which will give us
verdana so font families we also have
font weights so if we do FWB that'll do
gold we can do fw n for normal we can do
fw and then a number like 400 okay so we
can set the font weights that way we can
also do font styles so FS i for italic
FS e you for not you what is it n for
normal and we can do FS o for oblique
all right and then for important we can
do just an exclamation tab that will add
the important flag and what else we can
do combination so let's say we wanted to
we wanted to have like padding right 10
plus margin left 5 tab and it'll add
both of those those styles alright so
like I said there's a ton more there's
animations there all there's all types
of short codes and abbreviations you can
use I'm just going to go ahead and save
this I will have this stuff available in
the link in the description alright so
lastly I want to get to some actions now
I want to advise you that depending on
what editor you're using and what other
plugins you're using some of these
combination of keys may not work you may
have to go in and change them there
there have been quite a few things that
have been quite a pain in the ass to
figure out and try to change and all
that but I'm going to go over some very
basic stuff this this is by no means
everything I would suggest looking at
the documentation to to find everything
but I think one of the most helpful
actions is the commenting toggle the
comments which is going to be control
control and forward slash so if we go
down here to this little bit of HTML
that I have let's say we wanted to
comment out this section we could just
highlight it and we can do control
forward slash okay if I wanted to
comment out this h1 control forward
slash and then if I wanted to uncomment
it just as easy we just highlight it
control forward slash same thing here
and it's not just HTML we can also do
this in CSS if we wanted to take all of
these you'll see it'll add it will
comment out every single line that is
highlighted want to uncomment it very
very simple so that's probably the thing
that I use the most as far as these
actions go we can also do this go to
matching pair so if you're stuck and you
can't find the ending div or the ending
section tag or some other tag you can do
ctrl alt J now usually with with text
editors like Adam if you hover or if you
click on the opening div the ending one
will actually have a line or something
under it or it'll be highlighted but if
you don't have that you know you can do
what was it ctrl alt J so if I hit ctrl
alt J you'll see it'll skip to the
ending div if I go on this section
control all J it'll go to the next sex
the ending of that section now another
helpful one is to select through items
we can do ctrl shift and end period or
ctrl shift
comma to go back I think that's the
order but let's go ahead and click right
here we'll do control shift period and
that's going to go to the next attribute
which is the ID of page it'll go to the
value next it'll go to the next tag to
the the key value pair and then to the
value next tag and so on now you're
supposed to be able to do comma because
that was shift control period which goes
down comma is supposed to go back but it
does not in my case I think something
else is overriding it but it should you
should be able to navigate up and down
alright let's see what else so to move
things if you want to move lines up and
down
you can do control up or down so let's
say we want to take this paragraph and
we do control and the arrow key up and
down so we can move things around which
is kind of cool we can merge lines so
let's see what's that shift control M so
if we want to take this section and do
shift control M it'll put it all
basically on one line okay we can also
increment values our numbers so let's go
to the CSS and let's say this hundred
pixels right here we'll go ahead and
highlight that now if I hit if I hit alt
and then the up arrow it'll actually go
up by 0.1 okay down will go down by 0.1
now you're supposed to be able to do
shift control up and down so shift
control up and that does not work for me
for some reason I don't know why I think
it's again it's being overwritten by
something else and then if you want to
go by tens you can do shift alt yeah
shift alt obviously it goes up by ten we
can go down by ten
you can also basically do some math here
math expressions with ctrl shift Y so
for some reason I did like four times
five and I highlight that and I do
control shift Y it'll actually perform
that that arithmetic which is kind of
cool all right so I think that's going
to be it guys we're kind of running out
of time here now by no means is this
every single thing that M it can do it's
just an introduction I would suggest
looking more into it so you know don't
don't come hit me with you know what
about this and this and this I know
there's more you can do but this is just
the stuff that I personally use it
mostly for so hopefully enjoyed this
