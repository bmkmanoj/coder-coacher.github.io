JavaScript and Dom crash course now in
this part what I want to do is talk
about events okay we're gonna look at
all the different types of mouse events
keyboard events and I know this doesn't
this isn't going to be as relative to
just the Dom as the last two videos but
it is a very important part of
interactive JavaScript you know adding
event listeners to elements from the Dom
so that's what we're gonna do in this
video and hopefully you enjoy it so what
we're gonna do is just go into our Dom
j/s this is all our previous code from
the last two videos and I'm gonna show
you how to add an event listener alright
now this is the the I guess the best
practice for adding an event now you
could do something like this actually we
need to create a new button anyways
because I want to look at some click
events and I don't want to use the
submit button so I'm gonna go right
under the UL and I'm just gonna put a
line break here and let's put in a
button and let's give this a class I'm
gonna put our bootstrap classes in hand
just to make it look a little better so
BTN also a class of BTN it's to do BTN
doc I guess and let's see I'm also going
to give it an ID of button and I'm using
Emmet by the way that's why I'm able to
use this syntax so we can do this and
then we can type tab and it'll turn it
into an actual tag alright so let's just
say click here actually make this a
block button too so I'm gonna add BTN
block and now we have a little button
here so what we could do what you may
have seen in the past is you can say on
click equals and we can actually run
JavaScript in here we could say alert
one like that and you'll see it'll
actually run or you could set it to a
function let's say
we'll just call it button click and save
and then we can go into our JavaScript
and we can say function button click and
we'll go ahead and just console dot log
and we'll say button clicked and save
and if I click it you'll see we get it
down here now this is I guess the old
way of doing it it's it's better to use
an event listener because you don't need
to have this in your markup okay you
want to keep everything you want to keep
it separate so we're gonna just get rid
of that and we're just going to grab on
to this using whatever you want query
selector I'm actually going to just use
get element by D since we have an idea
of button so what I'll do is I'll say
we'll create a variable I'll call it
button and I'll say
document dot get element by ID of button
and we're going to say dot
addeventlistener and we're going to
listen for a click event and then we
want to run a function okay so we can do
this and then we can say console dot log
one two three and now if I click it we
get one two three now this is one way of
doing it just having a function like
this or you can use a named function so
I can replace this with button click
like that so now if I save now we get
button clicked because it's actually
calling this function alright so this is
the ideal way of doing it now of course
you can use what you've learned in the
last two videos and do stuff with the
Dom for instance let's say we wanted to
take the header title so we'll say
document dot get element by ID and we
know we have an ID of header - title and
we'll say dot text content equals
changed ok so now if I click the button
you'll see that the header gets changed
if we want to do let's say
document dots query selector and we'll
get the idea of Maine and we'll set the
style dot background our background
color and we'll set that to light gray
and save so now if I click the button it
changes the title and it changes the
background color of the of the Maine ID
all right so of course you can you can
integrate you know dot all these Dom
selectors and properties that we've
learned and you can attach them to
events all right so what I want to do
now is I'm just going to comment those
out and we're gonna pass in an event
parameter here okay when when you when
you listen for an event and you run a
function you can pass in this parameter
and let's just take a look at this so if
we say console dot log e okay or you can
call it whatever you want you might see
it spelled out as event whatever is is
here we're just gonna log so let's go
ahead and save that and click and now
you'll see we get basically all of these
different properties alright so we can
get all kinds of stuff from here we can
get like the class name of the of the
element we can get the IDS or attributes
we can get the the position of the mouse
client X client Y will give us the
position of the mouse when we click it
so I just want to kind of take a look at
some of the things that we can get from
this so let's go ahead and just comment
that out and let's say first of all it's
due console dot log and let's log the
target all right or a dot target sorry
so save will click and it gives us the
actual element that was clicked okay or
whatever it or not just clicked if this
was like a key down on an input a key
down event it would give us the input
okay instead of the button so whatever
element and whatever element the event
is fired from so let's say we wanted to
get the ID we could say console
dot log and we can say e dot target dot
ID and we'll save will click the button
and you can see the ID is button if we
want to get the class say console dot
log and we'll say e dot target and we
can say class name and we'll click and
it's going to give us basically this the
whole string of all the classes now
there's also a method called class list
and this isn't just further event this
is the this isn't just for the event
target you can get you can get the class
name I probably should have did this
earlier but you could get the class name
or the class list from any element so
it's a class list and save click and
it's basically going to give us this
this Dom token list it's kind of like an
array of the classes alright so see some
other stuff we can get now we can we can
output this stuff into the Dom if we
want so for example if we wanted to
let's put let's see let's just put a div
here with an ID of output and we'll go
ahead and we'll say C save our output
equals document dot get element by D
output and we'll say output dot in our
HTML equals and we'll put an h3 in here
and then we'll just we'll just
concatenate in let's say e dot target
dot ID all right so if I click and now
you'll see the ID will get output to the
Dom so just some stood we're just
experimenting here I mean there's I
don't really know why you would use this
but just to know that you can alright so
let's look at some other stuff now in
the event object so we have the type
so if we say console dot log and we can
get a dot type okay but we're not using
the target anymore we're just doing a
dot type if we click you'll see that
it's a click ok so it's basically going
to tell us whatever kind whatever type
of event that it is alright another
thing that we can look at is the
position of the mouse so if we say e dot
client X this is going to get the
position on the x axis when it's clicked
so you'll see 194 if I go over here 3 4
9 5 5 4 so the client X is actually the
position from the with the browser
window so from here over and if we do
client Y let's try client Y that's gonna
be from the wind from the top down ok so
you can see that actually let me just
comment the X out so they're all pretty
much around the same area because it's
coming from the top down now that's from
the window if you want to get the most
position from the actual element that
you're inside of then you want to use
offset X and offset Y so let's say
console dot log and we'll say e dot
offset offset Y it's 2x and save and if
I go right over here and I click we get
zero and you'll see it it'll increase as
I go over so that's from the actual
element itself and then of course we can
do y
so if we do why if I click so there's
negative 1 1 4 12
so as I go down it's gonna increase ok
so just remember that client is from the
browser or the window and offsets from
the the actual element itself all right
another thing we can do is we can test
to see if when you click it if you're
holding down the Alt key or the shift
key or the control key
so if we say console.log let's say e dot
Alt key and save if I click it we get
false now what I'm gonna do is hold down
my Alt key and click and we get true so
you can do things based on if you're
holding these keys down or not so let me
just copy this and then I'm gonna change
this one to ctrl key ctrl key and this
one is shift key so I'm just gonna click
it everything's false I'm gonna hold
down shift and click you can see that
the last one is true if I hold down ctrl
and click that one's true I hold down
alt and click that one's true ok
so you can do an if statement to see if
shift was held down if it was then you
can have different functionality in your
script all right so that's something
that may be useful to you all right so
that's pretty much all I want to look at
as far as the event object let me put a
comment up here just to separate so this
is where we started events all right I
know this is messy the script guys but
it's just kind of a reference for you
guys to use when you're actually
building something let's see what do we
want to do next so next let's just take
a look at some of the different Mouse
events all right because we have we have
different events based on different
actions so we want to look at some of
the mouse actions we already looked at
click but what I'm gonna do is actually
comment out this whole button click
function
I guess you know we'll get rid of this
to comment that out notice I'm not
deleting anything because I want you
guys to have this but I'm going to
create a new function here called run
event and we're gonna pass in our event
object here and we're gonna just console
dot log and we're gonna say oops I'm
gonna say event type and then we're just
going to concatenate a dot type remember
that we could get the type of event by
using that dot type and then what we'll
do is let's add let's see we're gonna
create a variable for our button I shall
just copy what we did up here except
instead of running button click I'm
gonna say run event alright so we'll
save and we get event type click alright
so let's look at some of the other types
so if we go ahead and actually you know
what I'm gonna do is let's move this
down here and say button alright so this
is this is gonna do the same thing it's
just not connected like that alright now
let's look at some other types of events
so we also have double click so what
I'll do is go in here and I'll say dbl
click and I'm just going to comment out
this lets save now if I click nothing
happens if I go ahead and double click
we get our run event and it's going to
tell us the type which is a double click
ok we also have the most down event so
I'm gonna go ahead and change this to
Mouse down and I'm gonna click down and
as soon as I click down it runs okay it
doesn't wait for me to lift up or
anything as soon as that Mouse goes down
that event fires off
we also have mouse up okay in addition
to most down so let's say Mouse up
let's save I'm gonna click and hold
nothing happens when I release then the
event fires off okay so there's a
difference between mouse down and mouse
up alright so the next thing I want to
do is see I want to test some other
types of events but not with a button so
what I'm gonna do is go and I'm going to
create under the button I'm gonna put in
a div and I'm gonna just I'm gonna give
it a inline style I'm gonna give it a
width of let's say 1 second let me just
check my my thing here so we're gonna
give it a width of 400 pixels and a
height of 200 pixels and a background of
light gray all right we'll save that and
you can see we have a little box here
let's let's put a line break we'll move
it down a little bit alright so we have
this gray box and I'm also going to give
it an ID of box so that we can grab on
to it so we'll go back to our JavaScript
and let's create another variable I'm
gonna copy that we're gonna call this
one box we're gonna get by ID box and
then I want to look at some more events
so let's take a look at the mouse enter
event
so we'll say box dot add event listener
and we're gonna listen for the mouse
enter event and then we're gonna run
event so let's save whoops that should
be uppercase alright so as soon as I
enter the box you'll see it fires off
alright if I go out and I keep going in
it'll keep firing that event off so we
have mow center we also have most leave
so if I go ahead and I
paste that in let's change this to Mouse
leave so we enter and then we leave and
then that gets fired off so enter leave
and to leave now in addition to Mau
center and most leave we also have mouse
over and mouse out so let's say mote
mouse over and mouse out alright so
we'll save that and then you'll see that
when I enter both of those mouse over
and mouse enter fire when I leave both
mouse out and mouse leave fire off so
what the hell's the difference they're
doing the same thing well the difference
is if this element has something in it
like let's put in will put in an h3 and
we'll just say hello all right so if we
enter okay both are gonna fire off most
over mouse enter now if I go when I go
hover over that hello that that child
element you'll see that hold on a second
this is actually this is getting too
confusing let me just let me comment out
most leave and mouse out so we're only
dealing with the enters so we go in the
box both fire off if I go over the hello
only the mouse over goes fires off okay
the most enter is only going to be for
that for the element itself but the over
will be for any inner elements okay does
that make sense you'll see that it keeps
firing off as I go over this but the
mouse enter will only be going in the
actual the you know the the parent
element alright and it's the same thing
with most leave and mouse out so if I go
ahead and comment those out and we'll do
the same thing if we leave will get both
but if we go on this one and leave we
just get most out not most leave alright
I hope that makes sense so those are
some of the the other Mouse events now
we also have mouse move so what I'll do
is let's just copy this
and let's change this to mousemove and
then that's gonna fire off whenever i'm
just in there and i'm moving the mouse
now what's cool about this is we can
actually grab the position of the mouse
and we can do different things with it
so let's go to our run event and let's
take our output remember we have that
variable output represent which is
connected to this div right here so what
I want to do is I want to help put the
mouse position into our application or
into our browser here so we'll say
output equals and let's say we'll just
put an h3 will say mouse X and we'll
just concatenate onto that ee dot offset
X okay and then we'll go let's see we'll
end our h3 and then we'll put another h3
and it'll say mouse Y concatenate a dots
offset Y
and then we'll end our h3 like that
let's save see oh we got to do output
dot innerhtml
and now you'll see that it's tracking
the most position inside okay as I move
it now we can take this a step further
and do something cooler let's comment
this out and what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to say document actually no we'll
just take let's take the box okay so we
have our box variable which is set to
the document dot get element by ID box
so this this whole box here and we're
gonna say dot dot style dot background
color and we're gonna actually set this
to RGB okay so you can set colors to RGB
values which is red green blue so it'd
be like the red color the green the blue
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
take the red and green and we're gonna
connect it to the number the offset
numbers alright so in here we're gonna
just concatenate like this so we're
gonna say e dot offset
let's do offset X here okay and then
we're going to put for the green we'll
concatenate ee dot offset Y and then for
the last value for the blue we'll just
put 40 alright so let's go ahead and
save this and let's go in the box and
move around and you'll see if the color
is actually changing because it's
changing the value of this RGB it's
changing the first two parameters based
on this wherever the mouse is alright
now we could actually take this a step
further and instead of doing just the
box we could say document dot body
remember we can access the body of the
document and we'll change the style of
that and now
the entire body will change the
background-color as we move all right so
let's I think that's pretty cool is it
practical and useful maybe not but
that's not what this what this series is
about this is just about learning all
right so that's it for that now what
we're gonna do is look at keyboard and
input events okay so we have our form
here we haven't even used yet so we're
gonna work with this now I still want to
use this run event right here I'm just
gonna comment that part out let's
comment this out all right so we're
gonna need to grab on to the input so
I'm going to create a new variable here
called item input and we're going to set
it to document dot query selector and we
can use any selector we want in here so
I'm going to say input and I want to
grab the input with that has the type of
text alright let's also create a
variable for the form itself we're gonna
need that at some point so we'll say
query selector and we're just gonna grab
let's say form alright we only have one
form so that's fine so let's see let's
go down here and let's create let's take
our item input and let's add an event
listener and we want to listen for a key
down event
okay so we'll say key down and then
we're going to run the event let's go
ahead and save and I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna just click a key and you see that
it fires right off each time I type that
key that event is gonna fire off now if
you want to and you probably would want
to catch what you're typing in here then
we could go down to our run event and
let's say console.log and we can say
console.log e dot target dot value so
let's go ahead and save that and then as
I type you'll see that it'll actually
log what I'm typing so we could take
this and we could output it somewhere so
let's say we wanted to put it all right
so we have this output div right here so
what we could do is we could say
document dot get element by D output dot
will say inner text equals actually will
do inner HTML
equals and h3 and then in here we'll
just go ahead and we'll put in a dot
target dot value save and let's start
typing and you'll see that it'll
actually output down here all right so
let's go ahead and just comment those
out and hopefully you know doing this I
mean this is just a mess of code but
hopefully this gives you guys some ideas
of maybe some stuff you could build all
right so let's look at some other inputs
we have key down so as you would
probably guess we also have key up so
key up is gonna run when you release the
key so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
I'm gonna push down and hold a key you
get key down if I let go there's key up
okay so that's keydown keyup we also
have key press
so if we say key press let's comment
these two out and if i just press any
key it's gonna go ahead and fire off
alright so those are the key events now
we also have other events that are
attached to input like text inputs like
this so we have focus and blur so what
I'm gonna do is take the item input and
let's change key press - let's say blur
actually let's do focus first and we'll
save focus is when you just click inside
of an input like that okay you can see
how it's alive it's it's
it's active it's focused okay so that's
going to run then now we also have blur
so if we say before you click in we get
focus we click out we get blur okay so
in focus out bar now two other pretty
cool events we have our cut and paste so
if we go ahead and change this to cut
and change this to paste and let's go
ahead and type something in here
actually let's comment these two out we
go ahead and type something in let's
highlight it and let's cut it and it'll
actually fire that event off okay if you
wanted to for some reason I don't know
take the let's see what could we do here
document dot body dot style dot actually
let's do style dot display and set it
equal to none if we go ahead and cut so
home let's type something in and then
we'll do cut and everything freakin
disappears so just there's some weird
stuff like that you can do I'm not gonna
leave that that's just a stupid example
alright and then we have pace so if I go
ahead and I paste something in that's
gonna run and it's gonna be the pace
type alright
now another one we have is input so
input will actually run when you do
anything with an input so let's change
this to input alright so we'll save that
and then I'm gonna just start typing we
get input if I go ahead and cut we get
input if I paste we get input so
anything you do with this input if you
are listening for that event it's gonna
it's gonna fire off alright so now what
I want to do is I want to add in a
select lists or a select box right here
so let's go in our index
tml and we're gonna go let's go right
after the text input and we're gonna put
in a select and we actually don't we
don't need a name and an ID
I just want to select with a couple
options let's say option we'll do 3 of
them and we'll just say 1 2 3 this this
doesn't really matter and let's actually
add a class to make it look good a
bootstrap class of form control and save
let's also add a margin right to class
just to push that button over a little
and there we go so now we have a select
item our select list so if you want
something to fire off when you choose
here you can use the change event so
what we'll do is create a variable for
this element so let's save our select
will set this to document dot query
selector and let's say we just want to
choose the select element is only 1 and
then down here we'll say select dot
addeventlistener and let's listen for a
change event
okay so change and then we'll run event
save let's go over here let's choose
something and you'll see that that will
fire that change event off if we want to
get the value we can do the same thing
we did with the text we can console.log
e dot target dot value so if we save
you'll see we get two three one so
that'll give us the value
and I believe if we if we do this the
input that should work as well if we
listen for input let's see
yep so that will right input and change
when we select those we'll both run all
right so the last thing I want to show
you is a submit event which is going to
be on the forum okay we set a forum
value here so we're gonna go form dots
addeventlistener and we want to listen
for a submit run event all right now if
I go ahead and I just type something in
we don't even have to type anything in
but let's just click the submit button
and notice that nothing's happening
actually you can see a blink down there
see if I keep clicking it'll blink real
quick that's because it's actually
submitting to the page okay it's just
working like a regular HTML form in
order for it not to do that you have to
prevent that from happening and the way
that you do that is you take this event
parameter that's passed in and you call
a dot prevent default okay which is a
function that's going to stop that from
happening so now if we go ahead and save
and now we submit you'll see that it
actually works okay it's not it's not
submitting to to an external file or
whatever it does by default all right
guys so I think that's gonna be it for
now like I said I think in the we'll
have one more video and in that video
we'll actually make this into an
application where we can add items we'll
be able to type something in add it to
the Dom have it show up here and then
maybe add a delete button over here that
we can click and we can get rid of the
elements here obviously they're not
going to be persisted to a database or
anything like that it's all just in the
UI it's all on the Dom all right but I
think that'll give you a little bit more
experience on actually building
something real instead of just you know
the sandbox that we've been working in
so hopefully you guys like this if you
did hit that like button please
describe if you're not and thanks for
