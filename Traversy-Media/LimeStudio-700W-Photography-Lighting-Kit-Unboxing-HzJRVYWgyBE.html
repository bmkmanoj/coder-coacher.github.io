I'm going to unbox and demo and possibly
review the lime studio 700w photography
softbox lighting kit okay so I got this
for my youtube channel and it basically
gives you these two large lamps for for
lighting in your videos now this product
was only 69 99 so it's not going to be
professional grade or anything like that
but there were a lot of reviews and most
of them were pretty good actually so I
decided to go with it I didn't want to
spend more than you know 100 bucks on
this stuff because it's basically right
now it's just a hobby you know so don't
have a big budget for this kind of stuff
I do have a green screen that I got I
forget exactly how much was like 80
bucks or something like that so you know
this with that I'll be able to make you
know better quality videos so what I'm
going to do is go ahead and unbox it but
before I do that I'm just going to go
over what's included alright so these
are 24 by 24 inch and you get two of the
light holders with the softbox reflector
286 inch tall studio quality high output
umbrella flash strobe lights or strobe
light stand 22 photo light bulbs that
are 85 watts they're daylight balanced
pure white light bulbs and one
convenient carrying case alright so
that's what's going to come in the box
so let's go ahead and open it up and we
just grab something and I have a whole
bunch of stuff that I'm going I'm going
to be unboxing and reviewing but I want
this first so that I can use it like
music in those videos
all right I don't have a razor blade so
I got to use this oh all right and you
know 6999 you can't really all right so
it looks like we get the carrying case
here nice lime studio all right then oh
if you have my son in the background he
just upstairs playing so so we got 250
got two bags and then we get two of
these boxes and then two of these long
boxes all right so let's see what's in
here and i'm not you know a professional
broadcaster review or whatever you want
to call it the reason I'm doing this is
because I like to buy gadgets I like to
buy tech tech stuff and you know I like
to do a lot of research on you no
reviews and unboxings like this just so
I can see what's coming in the package
what it's going to look like just just
so you know so i buy a good product so
that's what I'm trying to do for you
guys you know forgive me if I if I make
a mistake on the specs or or whatever
the video is not little extremely high
quality I'm just doing this in my spare
time all right so this looks like oh so
these are the umbrellas all right these
look kind of professional okay so they
open up and you can see Bob goes in
there so those will go up on top of the
pole I guess I've never used anything
like this so you know just just like Oh
probably a lot of you of you guys out
there so looks like we got a little
switch here all right and then this I
don't know what this is
all this looks like it just goes over it
over the top let's see yeah so that
probably just guessing droops over the
top like that so that it can kind of
filter it a little bit i guess i'm not
sure but Tom yeah I'm definitely going
to have to read the instructions for
this thing you know once i get it all
set up i'll continue the video but let's
just finish going through this stuff so
we know that this i'm guessing is the
same thing alright so we got the
umbrellas so let me take a look at the
list right here just so I can make sure
what those things are ah let's see light
holder with reflector that must be it
alright and then we have eighty six inch
tall studio umbrella flash strobe light
stand so I'm guessing that's going to be
these babies long foxes here so let's
check that out alright so it just looks
like a tripod same thing as a tripod I
guess right yeah take that out alright
so able to just open that right yeah
there we go alright so i don't know if
you guys can see that whole thing but i
guess it goes up to 86 inches so that's
pretty good yeah i have no idea if you
guys can see that whole thing but looks
like we got two of those what's this
here alright alright so those are the
stands and again i'm guessing that does
that one go up to yeah okay so that goes
pretty high alright so i'm guessing that
this is the same thing so we get those
stay here
the directions I probably should have
looked at those first but let's see yeah
those are the 86 hitched all stands and
then this box okay so these are the
balls all these official price I'm
guessing they're nice and you know I
don't deal with this stuff usually so
hopefully I'm a little bit of help to
you guys if anything else just to show
you what comes in the box and what it
looks like so these look like really
nice lights um you know from what I can
tell so we get those all right so oh
this is really not that much in here so
looks very easy to put together put that
back in there all right so we get the
bulbs we have the stands we have the
umbrellas and the reflectors so that's
what's in here guys and if you want to
look at that gives you install
instructions just look too difficult at
all so yeah all in all I mean it looks
nice so far so what I'm going to do is
get this stuff all set up and I'll come
back and show you what we're working
with all right so we have both lights
set up and they're both shining on the
green screen behind me they're a little
too close right now and you wouldn't
have them pointing right on you you want
to kind of air them out to the side a
little bit or maybe up but just for this
video I had to bring up a bring an
extension cord out and the cords are
really short i'll show you in a second
that's probably the biggest drawback of
these lights but all in all I mean it
lights up the place pretty nicely I
don't have any other lights on and you
can see it lights the area pretty well
so what I'm going to do now is just show
you guys the lights themselves alright
so let me just zoom out here and let's
go around I don't want to shine it right
in the in the camera you can see they
look really nice really
professional-looking and that one's up a
little higher
there you can see they're shining on the
green screen now like I said the one
huge drawback not huge but pretty much
the only drawback is the size of the
cord all right you can see how small
that is now I don't think I think it's
it was advertised at nine feet that does
not look like nine feet you can see I
had to bring the extension cord out like
that I don't have very many outlets down
here in the first place so that's kind
of tough but all in all I mean I think
it lights up the place pretty nice let
me just shut this one off so I can kind
of show it to you so the front we have
the the filter or I think it's called a
reflector on here we can take that off
it's actually has velcro on it so it's
pretty nice and you can see the bulb in
there and to put this together I can
just tell you real quick it's very
simple so we just extended the tripod
and there's obviously a just like any
tripod there's a knob right here and you
can bring it up or down you have these
two little flaps right here if you want
to bring it down and lock it into place
alright and then up here you have two
knobs so this one when you put it
together you want you want to screw down
all the way just put it on there tighten
it and then this knob on the side if I
go ahead and loosen that up this is
going to fall all right but you can kind
of you know swerve it around and put it
where you need it all right so that I
really like them they're nice especially
for 6999 I mean really can't go wrong
but would I suggest these to you yeah if
you're on a budget and you need
something for your youtube channel I
would definitely suggest these the only
problem that I see is the cord but
that's you know that's not a huge issue
you can just run an extension cord like
I did but yeah so these are really nice
i'll be using them in future videos and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
