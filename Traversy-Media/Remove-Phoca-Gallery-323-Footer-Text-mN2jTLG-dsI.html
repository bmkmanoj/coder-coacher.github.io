video showing you how to remove the
footer and the focal gallery component
for Joomla and keep in mind with every
version that comes out that they usually
change this so what I have written here
now might not work for the newest
version and if that's so I'll try to
keep up and update the page but if you
figure it out please leave it in the
comments for other people this is
actually I'm going to be showing you
focal gallery version 3.2.40 of Foca and
if you click on the category this is the
category view of Foca and you'll see we
have the footer on both so what I'm
going to do is I have this set up on
examp
a local installation a local server but
you want to go to your Joomla
installation and go to components focal
gallery because first we're going to do
this the categories page and you want to
go to views and categories which is this
view okay and then we might want to go
to the template folder at the TM PL and
we want to click on default and I'm just
gonna edit this with notepad plus plus
all right now at the very bottom you see
this little call this little function
call if you just want to comment that
you can either delete it or just comb in
and out with a couple slashes and then
save that
reload and it's gone now when they
update the versions just always check
around the bottom if something looks
like that
that function call right there you know
just test it out
you know delete it reload if it's not
right then put it back try something
else but it's usually something in those
but in the view files so next we're
going to do the category view so we'll
go back to views and category the
template folder and default
and also at the bottom is actually the
vet on both views it's the very last
line so I mean it's very easy if you're
using three point two point three you
shouldn't have any issues so I'm gonna
save that reload and it's gone so that's
it and now you have no more branding in
the footer so if you guys have any
questions or comments or whatever just
leave it down in the comments area and
like I said I'll try to keep this up to
date alright thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
