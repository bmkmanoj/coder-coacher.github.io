looking at let and const which are new
declarations in es6 that allow us to
define variables in different ways than
with the old var method alright and let
is actually set to replace bar so with
let we can have block level scopes
meaning that if we declare a variable in
the global scope and then we go and we
read eclair that same variable in let's
say a loop or an if statement it's going
to be completely different it's going to
be on a totem scope all right which is
something that a lot of JavaScript
developers have I thought was a pain in
the ass for a long time now so this is a
really nice feature and yeah let's just
go over it real quick all right so what
I have here is just my development
environment I'm using chrome 50 which
basically has all the functionality all
the compatibility with es6 we're using
strict mode so you want to make sure you
say you strict up at the top
I do have an index.html file here and
then I have a style CSS if you want to
just copy that but it's not needed at
all because we're mostly be working in
the console alright so let's start with
the global scope all right so let's take
the old way we would say var will create
a variable called a and we'll set it to
test one we can go console.log pay and
of course we get test1 okay now we can
also use let so it will say let B equal
test2 and then let's console log B and
of course we get test2 so on the global
scope var and let are pretty much the
same all right so let's comment that out
and now what I want to do is I want to
create a couple functions okay this one
we're going to call test bar and what
we'll do is we'll use var and we'll
create a variable called a and we'll set
that to 30
okay then what we'll do is have an if
statement so we'll just say if true then
we want to save our a equals equals the
number 50 all right and then what I'm
going to do is consult log a and then
I'm also going to do it outside of that
if all right now if you've been
developing JavaScript for a while you
probably know what's going to happen if
I reload oops I got to run the function
first and if I reload we get 50 and 50
so why is that it's because right here
we set a to 30 on the global scope level
all right now when we said this if true
we set VAR a to 50 okay we console.log a
which is obviously 50 now down here it
was also 50 because basically this I'm
sorry this changed it this changed this
a from 30 to 50 so down here we get 50
again all right and this is this like I
said there's been a pain in the ass for
a long time now so now let's take a look
at what let allows us to do so we'll say
function test let and let's say oops we
want to say let instead of our set that
to 30 and it'll do click if statement
okay if true then we're going to set VAR
a to 50 console.log
okay so let's go ahead and change this
to run test let and you may know what's
going to happen if I reload we get an
error which that was not supposed to
happen oh because I use var reload and
now we get 50 30 okay so let's take a
look at why this happened so we set a to
30 okay right inside the function then
we had an if statement and then we set a
to 50 we console.log this and it gave us
50 now when we come back out of that if
statement and we console.log it it's now
pertaining to this this one because it's
on the same scope okay so then we got 30
so this did not change this all right
and I think that that just makes things
a lot easier and makes it work more like
a high-level programming language all
right now we're not limited to just if
statements we can use things like loops
so for example let's create a for loop
and in this for loop we're going to say
var I equals 0 and we'll say as long as
I is less than 10 then we want to I plus
plus okay want to increment by 1 and all
we're going to do in here is console.log
I all right and then down under the for
loop I'm also going to console.log I
okay now we'll save this and let's run
it and you can see we get 0 through 10
if I don't log this I right here we're
going to get 0 through 9
alright now the reason that this happens
is because this I relates to this I here
even though it's inside the for loop but
if we went and we used let okay if we
run that that's fine we get 0 through 9
but if we try to use it outside of its
scope
reload we get an error saying eye is not
defined alright because this is not now
on the same level as this and that's
what let does alright we'll be using let
throughout these videos so what I'm
going to do now is comment all this out
and I will have the the code available
for you very soon and then we're going
to take a look at Const so the the need
for Const is that if we set something
it's going to be a constant it's not
going to be a variable meaning that if
we try to set it again we're going to
have issues all right so what we can do
is say Const and let's say colors will
set this to an array then we can do
things like colors dot push and it'll
say red oops
colors dot push let's say blue and then
we'll do a console dot log for colors
save that and we get red and blue all
right now if I go and I try to say
colors equals and I'll set it to green
which is just a string all right if we
go and save that and reload we're going
to get an error saying assignment to
constant variable all right because this
colors cannot be changed it can be
pushed too because we're just adding to
the array but if we actually try to
change the whole thing then it's going
to throw an error and it's not going to
work all right so that's the use for
Const so hopefully that's clear to you
guys like I said I'll be using let
throughout the the videos in this course
but yeah so that's it in the next video
we're going to take a look at classes
and class inheritance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
