hey what's going on guys so in this
video we're gonna do something a little
different usually we do some kind of
practical project or maybe a framework
crash course or something like that but
I want to start to do some exercises and
coding challenges or even algorithms now
the stuff that we'll be doing is very
rare in the real world and real projects
but these are the exact types of
problems that you're going to get during
job interviews okay if you were to go to
an interview with Google or Amazon or
something like that these are the types
of problems that they'd have you do
probably on a white board alright it
also builds your just your programming
skill in general and there's a few
reasons why companies do these types of
problems during interviews one of them
is because it shows that that you know
your your programming logic it shows
that you have critical thinking skills
it also shows how you can work under
pressure and and when you're put on the
spot and it can be a very stressful
situation so the more of these types of
problems that you can remember the
better so what I'd like to do is if this
video goes well and we can get maybe
let's say a thousand likes I'll make
this an ongoing series where I'll come
up with different challenges for you
guys and for each challenge you guys can
pause the video and you can try it
yourself and then we'll go over some
solutions okay now a lot of these
problems will have multiple solutions
some will have five ten twenty solutions
I'll just come up with a couple some
some will people will come up with more
advanced and creative and more modern
solutions and some will be more
practical for instance you could use an
old-school for loop for some of these or
you could use a newer higher high order
array function things like that okay so
everyone's different everyone's coding
styles different but I thought it was a
good idea
we have so many like framework type
videos and and stuff like that on my
channel I wanted to do some actual
coding and training stuff that's gonna
really spark your brain and some of this
may seem really easy to guys few veteran
programmers and some of this may just be
complete gibberish for you you guys that
are kind of new to JavaScript alright
either way if you want to try it
yourself pause it and do that that's
fine or if you just want to watch and
look at the solution and and listen to
me explain it we can do that you can do
that as well alright so let's go ahead
and get started so as far as my
environment here I'm gonna be using node
to run my JavaScript file so if you're
following along make sure you have no
js' installed you can download this
exact file as is there's six problems
with some instructions and an example
you can download this from the
description and just open up a terminal
so that we can run the file so the
structure is just a couple functions so
this first one reversed string you'll
see at the bottom here I just have an
output variable set to reverse string
that should actually be a lower case in
there and we just have a string and then
we're gliding the output okay so that's
why if I go and I run node index because
the the name of the file is index dot
JSP cuz that's what I'm returning from
the first function alright but that's
just just for show we're gonna get rid
of that alright now let's go over the
first challenge real quick so what we
need to do is create a function that
will reverse a string so if we put in
hello we should get this back okay or
any any string we put in we should get
the reversed version back and these
first three challenges are very closely
related and you'll see why alright now
this first one I'm gonna have quite a
few different solutions for we're gonna
have five or six solutions just so you
can see that there's a lot of different
ways to do the same thing so the first
way the first method I'm gonna do
actually if you want you can pause the
video and try it yourself and see what
you come up with but the first thing I'm
gonna do is split the string into an
array okay so I'll create a variable
called
see our array and we're gonna set that
to that string that's passed in dot
split because what split does is it
turns a string into an array and it
takes in a parameter of a separator now
since we want each character to be put
in its own array value we're just gonna
put a set of single quotes don't put a
space if you wanted to separate the
words into into the array values then
you would put a space but we want each
character so make sure you don't put a
space okay then what we can do is we can
use the array prototype method reverse
which will take an array and just do
that it will reverse it so we'll say STR
array dot reverse and then let's just
see what that gives us obviously if
you're doing a whiteboard interview you
can't do this stuff you can't test or
anything like that
but I just want to convey you know what
exactly is going on here so let's say
string and you could very well get this
question need all of these are actually
pretty common in these interviews so
let's run this with node index and you
can see we get the word hello in an
array backwards
never mind the undefined it's just
because we're not returning anything
from this function so now that we did
that we need to just turn it back into a
string and we can do that with the join
method so what I'll do is just say
return the string array dot join which
will turn it back into a string and
again we just want to put our single
quotes in there so now if we save and we
go ahead and run this node index we get
hello backwards alright now this is kind
of a messy way of doing it so I would
definitely suggest cleaning it up and if
you're in these interviews I would
suggest doing it this way so you can
explain it and then just showing them
that you can clean it up so they know
that you can write good code so there's
really no reason to have this variable
so we can just return and then we can
just chain on string dot split dot
reverse and then we can just chain the
dot join on to that
so we'll save dot join and now if we run
that we get hello backwards and I would
probably just recommend that you put
these on separate lines just to clean it
up a little bit tab it over alright so
that's the first solution now like I
said I'm gonna go I'm gonna do multiple
solutions here okay they might eat they
would they might even say don't use the
reverse array method so in that case
what I'm gonna do next is just a simple
for loop I'm gonna separate these with
just some slashes all right so let's
create a or initialize a variable we'll
call it Rebs string for reverse string
set it to nothing and then we're gonna
do just a an old-school for loop okay
and I'll show you different types of for
loops we can use and we're gonna set I
here will say let I equals string dot
length okay this is going to be a
decrementing array or a decreasing array
so we'll set I to that and we'll say as
long as I is greater than or less than
zero then we want to decrease I by one
so I minus minus and then all we have to
do in here is take our Reb string and
set it equal to the Reb string plus the
current character so we can get that
with string as STR and the current
iteration because you can use this
format even with strings it doesn't have
to be an array you can go you can access
for instance if we wanted to get the H
we could do we could do whatever
whatever the string is STR is bracket 0
and that will give us H brackets 1 would
give us e and so on ok so we're gonna do
that and then we just need to return the
Rev string okay so we'll go ahead and
run that and ok we get undefined because
let's see why are we getting undefined
oh you know what we're getting undefined
because string-length right now let me
just show you this if we console dot log
I and we go ahead and run this we get 0
through 5 which is 6
okay that's 6 numbers and the string
we're passing in is only 5 hello is 5
letters so what we're going to do is
just from the string length we're gonna
subtract 1 and if we save that and we
run it now we get 0 through 4 which is 5
characters so now that should match
however many characters you pass in so
let's get rid of the console.log
uncomment that and let's clear this out
and run it and now we get hello
backwards alright
I just forgot to do that minus 1 there
now that is a decreasing array meaning
which we set I to the string length and
then we set you know greater than 0
let's let's do an incrementing for loop
so I'll copy this whole thing and let's
just space this out and we'll paste this
in and then we'll instead of setting I
to the string length minus 1 we're gonna
set it to 0 and then say as long as I is
less than or equal to string dot length
minus 1 and then we want to just
increment high by one so I plus plus and
then we can simply take the string I and
put it on this side
oops and just add the Rev string all
right so that should work as well and
there we go so that's another way you
could do it now these these old-school
for loops I mean these will be
acceptable but there's there's better
ways you can do things to kind of show
that you you know more modern JavaScript
you know es6 and so on so what I'm gonna
do now is use a for of loop instead of
using this this type here and when you
use this type of for loop you have a lot
of room for error especially if you're
on a white board and you can't
test you could you could put the wrong
way here you could put a greater than
rather than the less than you could set
I equal to something that's not correct
you could increment instead of decrease
you could do there's a lot of room for
error so this makes it a little easier
as far as not making errors so I'm going
to copy that and what we'll do here is
instead of doing this old-school for
loop we're gonna do four and then just
say let shark HR can be anything but I'm
gonna say let char of the string and
then simply change this string I to char
all right so let's try that and there we
go so this is a little more impressive
than doing it this way all right now we
also have high order array methods we
can use like for each so now I'm going
to show you how to do it that way so
what I'll do is I'll just type it out so
we'll say Rev string we'll initialize it
and let's do let's see now to to be able
to use a for each loop which is a high
order array function we need to actually
turn the string into an array and you
saw how to do that we use split so let's
say STR dot split put in our quotes
there and then we can do for each okay
now for each takes in a function and it
takes in an iterator so I'm just gonna
say char and then we can do the same
thing we did here just take that Reb
string value and equal it to char plus
Rev string and then simply return
Rep string all right let's try that and
there we go and to make this even neater
if you want to impress them a little bit
showing them you know es6 arrow
functions you could get rid of the
function keyword put an arrow here and
you could get rid of the curly braces
and get rid of this semicolon here and
just put this on the same line like that
and yeah that should work and it says
there's only one parameter you don't
even need those parentheses so let's try
that out
all right so that does the same thing so
this is a much more impressive way and
then the most I think the most
impressive thing you could do is use a
reduce which is a more difficult high
order array method so let me show you
how to do that oops so for this we don't
even have to initialize a variable first
we're just gonna say return STR dot
split to turn it into an array and then
we're gonna call reduce and just like
for each reduce takes in a function and
this function will take a Reb string
okay instead of initializing it up top
we can do that and then we'll put in
char it also takes a second parameter of
what we want to begin with which will be
just an empty string alright and then
all we have to do within the function is
simply return char plus Reb string okay
because with reduce along with other
high order methods like map and and
filter it actually returns another array
you can return from it unlike for each
so we're gonna do that I think that
should work let's try it out and there
we go so then if we want to clean it up
of course and use some es6 we can get
rid of the function get rid of the curly
braces and the return statement and we
can put an arrow here
that and just get rid of the semicolon
and move this up okay so that looks very
very neat let's make sure it works and
there we go so that would probably be
the most impressive to them if you did
that okay and and don't be afraid to do
multiple examples either all right so
that's quite a few different examples if
you came up with something different
great if you want to share it that's
fine the next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna validate a palindrome and
the palindrome is a word or a phrase
that's the same whether it's forwards or
backwards so for instance race car is
the same if you spell it if you you know
read it forwards or backwards
so what we want to do is return true if
it's a palindrome and false if it's not
and what I'll do is is let you pause the
video now if you want to try it but I'll
give you a little hint all we really
have to do is reverse the string and
then compare it to the original string
and then return true or false so with
that information if you want to pause
and try it then go ahead and do that
alright so let's do the solution now we
need to reverse the string so we could
choose any of these I'm just going to
choose the first one which is kind of
the most practical in my opinion I
wouldn't say the best but probably the
most practical so we'll create a
variable actually we can use Const here
so we'll say Const and let's say Reb
string and we'll set it to the string
parameter split turn it into an array
and let's reverse it and let's join to
turn it back into a string okay so now
that's the reverse string and then what
you could do is an if statement saying
if the Rev string is equal to the STR
return true else return false but a
better way to do that would be just to
return Rev string equal to triple equals
to string and that will give you true or
false all right so it's actually a very
simple solution once you know how to
reverse a string so let's save that
let's go down here and change the
function so it's gonna be is palindrome
and we're gonna just pass in let's try
it with hello and see what we get
so we get false because obviously this
is not a palindrome but if we say race
car we get true all right if we do madam
which is another palindrome that should
give us true as well
okay and you could get either one of
these or both or whatever and then this
next one is very similar as well we want
to reverse an integer so this brings in
the concept of data types because we
want to pass in a number in JavaScript
there is no actual int int data type or
integer data type they're all numbers
but we want to pass that in and we want
to get back an integer okay not a string
so what we can do is we can take that
int let's see well first let's create a
Reb string and like I said we can take
the int and we can turn it into a string
with the method to string all right I
forgot my equal sign okay so that will
turn it into a string and then we can go
ahead and split and we can reverse and
we can join so what had what's happening
is it'll take the integer that's passed
in the number it'll turn it to a string
and then reverse it just like we did
above and then if we go down here and we
return Rev string that's going to return
a string and that's not that's not the
instructions we need to actually return
a number so we can wrap this in a
function called parse int which will do
just that will take the string and turn
it into an integer so let's save that
let's go down here and let's change this
to reverse int and pass in a number so
pass in one two three four five
and let's run that and we get five four
three two one now let's add something to
this and say if it's a negative number
that should still that should return the
the backwards number the reverse number
with the negative sign now if we do it
now it's not going to so what we can do
it's an easy solution is we can use the
sign method of the math object in
JavaScript so we can just say asterisk
and then math dot sign and we can pass
in the int and now if we do that with
the negative value we'll get negative
five four three two one and of course if
we make this positive again that will
not have the negative value all right so
that'll add the sign if there is one so
that's the only solution I'm gonna do
for that if you guys came up with
something different great and of course
you could use any any of the these these
string of Versalles I just chose to use
this one I think it's just the most
practical so next thing we're gonna do
is Max character so the idea of this is
just to return oh wait no I'm sorry
we're gonna do the capitalized letters
first so for this we need to pass in a
sentence like I love JavaScript all
lowercase actually it shouldn't matter
if it's all lowercase or not but what we
want back is that same string whether
it's a sentence or whatever and the
first letter of each or the first
character of each word should be
uppercase okay so I'm gonna give you a
couple different solutions for this but
if you want to go ahead and pause it and
try it do that now alright so the first
solution I'm gonna do is going to be
kind of old-school we're just going to
use a regular for loop first thing we're
going to do is turn the the string into
an array so we're gonna say string array
and we're going to set this to STR and I
want to make sure that everything is
lowercase to begin with so we're going
to use lowercase
yeah I'm sorry to lowercase so we're
gonna say string to lowercase and then
split it into an array okay once we do
that we could do a simple for loop so we
could say for let's I equals zero and
let's say as long as I is less than the
string array dot length okay so the
length of that array then we also want
to increment and inside the for loop
we'll take the string array index and
we're gonna set that equal to the string
array index and then we're going to use
dot substring okay and substring is a
JavaScript method that will basically
allow you to pluck something out of a
string so we want to pluck out just the
first letter or the first character so
we're gonna pass in zero to one okay
because we want to get from the string
for instance if this is passed in for
each word one thing that I forgot to do
is put a space here because we don't
want each character as an array value we
want each word so this should be a three
value array with I love JavaScript as
each has a value all right and then for
each word we want just the first
character and that's what this is going
to give us and then we want to uppercase
that so we can say to uppercase and then
we just want to add the rest the rest of
the words so let's say plus so we'll
concatenate on string array current
index and then we want substring
we basically just want the rest of the
word so we can pass in one meaning that
it's gonna start from the one value
which is the second character and then
on okay so we're taking we're just
plucking out the first letter upper
casing it and then adding on the rest
and then after the for loop we just want
to return the string array but we want
it as a string not an array so we're
gonna say join and make sure you put in
a space here as well because we're
separating the words into arrays not the
characters all right so now let's go
down here and change the name of the
function to capitalize letters and we'll
go ahead and put in say I love
JavaScript and let's run it and there we
go and even if we add a capital in here
like let's say this s was capital and we
run it it's still gonna be lowercase
because of that to lowercase that we put
here all right so let's go ahead and do
a different solution I'm going to
comment this out and let's separate this
okay now my second solution is gonna be
to use map which is another high order
array function and this will be a little
more impressive than doing a standard
for loop so what we can do is return the
string but we want it to be lowercase so
we're going to say to
lower case and we'll actually put this
on a separate line so we'll say it's
return string to lower case and then we
want to split it into an array by words
so put a space there then we're going to
use map okay and map will actually
return we can manipulate an array and
return another array from it or return
whatever we want from it so in here map
will take a function just like for each
and reduce and all that stuff and it's
gonna take in a parameter here let's
just call it word because that's what
it's going to give us each word if I
were to console dot log word and run
this you'll see I love JavaScript okay
never mind the undefined so within here
I'm gonna say return word and we want
the first character and then we can call
to uppercase and then we can simply add
on the word dot and we can use substring
I'm gonna actually gonna use out sub STR
which is pretty pretty much does the
same thing you could use substring or
sub STR and we're going to just add the
rest so we're doing pretty much the same
thing we did here just in a cleaner way
so now that we did that we're gonna just
add on to this dot join to turn it back
into a string okay
join and make sure you put a space in
there as well so let's run that see if
that works and it does and if you want
to clean this up a little bit and use
some es6 so you get rid of the function
you could get rid of the curly braces
and the return and put an arrow here
and of course you want to get rid of
this semicolon whoops get rid of that
semicolon move this up and since this is
only one parameter we don't even need
these these current these parenthesis
alright so that should work as well and
that's a very clean method this is
probably what I would choose to do all
right I'm gonna give you one more
solution that uses regular expressions
okay and I'm not the best with the
regular expressions
so we could say return extra let's
comment oh shoot I went out I went
outside of the function let's comment
this out and then let's separate alright
so we can say string and our return
string and then we're gonna use the
replace method here and that takes in a
regular expression now regular
expressions need to be within slashes
and I'm gonna put in a word boundary
which we can get with backslash B and
then we want to put in a range here of
lowercase a to Z all right and then
after this slash you want to put a G for
global because if you don't it's only
going to capitalize the first word or
the first letter of the first word so
make sure you put that in there and then
we also want to put an i which is case
insensitive okay
now this takes in a second parameter of
a function and let's just pass in char
here and then we're going to just simply
return
char dots to uppercase all right so
let's see if that works and it does why
oh I don't have an S in my JavaScript
all right so that's another way that you
could do it I personally would go with
this I have the most experience with
this type of code well obviously this
but this is kind of the old old-school
way of doing it but it should be
perfectly acceptable all right so let's
move on to max character now there's a
lot of different ways you could do this
I'm going to show you one way and it's
kind of complicated but I think that it
would really impress them so we want to
return the character that is most common
in the string so for example if we pass
in JavaScript a comes up the most so
that's what should be returned so what
we're gonna do here is we're going to
use an object as a map so we're gonna
create a variable called char map for
character map and we're going to set it
to a set of parentheses so just an empty
object literal all right and then what
we want to do is loop through the string
as an array so we'll take the string and
split it so that it's an array and just
pass in some quotes not not a space just
just single quotes and then we're going
to use the for each method here so we're
gonna say for each and we'll go ahead
and pass in a function
and we'll say char here and then what we
want to do is we basically want to look
at each character in the map or eat each
each key/value pair because this is
going to be a key they're gonna be key
value pairs of the actual character and
then how many of them are inside that's
what we're creating here so it'll be
like j1 a 2v1 and so on so we're gonna
say if let's say if charm map and then
we want to grab the character okay so if
it if it exists then we just want to add
one to it and we can do that by just
saying charm map char + + that'll add
one else if it hasn't been found so
basically if we're using the word
JavaScript if it's gonna start at J
that's not gonna be found yet because it
hasn't it's the first letters and
there's no J that has been found so
we're gonna make it one so we'll say
charm app the char is gonna just equal
one okay and then we hit a that will
also just be set to one because it
hasn't been found V will be set to one
when we hit this nut this other a it's
already gonna see that there's an A in
the character map so it's just gonna add
another one to it so it will then be -
if it hit another a it would then be 3
and so on alright so let's take a look
at our charm map now after doing that
so we'll say charm app and let's just
run this let's clear this out actually
alright and we'll run node index and of
course we need to change the name of the
function here - what is it max character
and we'll just use JavaScript okay so
this is our map it's it's it's an object
with each letter and then the number of
times it occurs you can see a a is the
only one that that occurs more than once
so we have a - if I were to put a bunch
of more T's in here and then run it you
can see for T we have five okay so
that's a character map but now that we
have that we're not done of course we
need to we need to return whatever the
highest one is so the solution I'm going
to use is to do a four in loop and a
four in is used to loop through an
object rather than an array so let's do
four and we can say four let char this
could be anything but I'm going to say
let char in charm map okay and then what
we want to do actually you know what I'm
gonna I'm gonna do real quick is just
show you how to use the nodejs debugger
I'm just gonna put a line in here called
debugger and put a semicolon and this is
kind of just kind of a side note but
let's go over here and clear it out and
this is kind of an alternative to just
using console.log and i don't do a lot
of debugging I don't think I've ever
made a video on debugging which I
probably should but just to show you we
can say node inspect index dot JSP file
and we just want to put a C to continue
and then it should stop where it hits a
debugger so we'll do C enter and you can
see it's stopped at the debugger all
right now from here if we want to
examine let's say the char or the char
map or any variables we can go into
repple mode so repl which stands for I
believe read of read eval print loop and
then we can look at variables so if we
want to look at char we can see we're at
J
if we look at the charm map that will
give us the charm map all right now if
we wanted to loop through and go to the
next iteration what we could do is
escape the repple with ctrl C go back
into debug and do C again so we want to
continue and now we should be on the
second iteration so if I now go back
into the repple and we look at char now
we're at a okay and if we look at let's
say charm map char we're at 2 so there's
two A's so it's just a nice way to kind
of examine your code and this really
helps if you run into issues so I just
figured I'd mention that all right now
hopefully you'll kind of understand
what's going on here
but we still need to continue and we
need to return the letter or the
character that returns the most so I'm
gonna add two more variables up here one
is going to be called max num and that's
gonna be set originally it's gonna be
set to zero and we're also gonna have
one called max char and we're gonna set
that to nothing by default so max char
is going to be the actual number that
has the most occurrences max num will be
that number so a would have two so max
num in this case we already know is
going to be 2 and max char is gonna be a
but we need to figure that out so let's
go down here I'll just comment out that
debugger and let's simply do if char map
char and we and we looked at that here
and this in this current iteration it
was two because we were looking at a we
were looking at the char a so if that is
greater than the max num which is set to
0 by default so the first iteration it's
always going to be greater then we want
to say max num we're gonna set it to
this actual value okay the char map
value
and then we want to set the max char to
the actual char to the character it
should be an equal sign all right and
then all we have to do is go outside of
the for loop and then return the max
char okay so I know this is kind of a
long solution but hopefully hopefully it
makes somewhat of a little bit of sense
now let's go down here actually we
already did but let's let's escape the
debugger so control C a couple times and
then let's do node index and we get
undefined let's see what do that oh wait
a minute tonight screw something up here
max char
oh you know what my issue is I used
Const max num and Max child these are
getting redefined so this can't be Const
this should be let both of these okay so
that should work so let's try it and we
get a okay so let's add in a bunch of
T's here and now the max char should be
T good all right so that's that now the
last challenge here is fizzbuzz and this
is actually a very popular challenge
with in interviews and stuff like that
a lot of you have probably know what
fizzbuzz is and if you do you probably
know that the answer it's it's more of a
memorization for this once you memorize
it it's it's pretty easy but we want to
write a program or loop that prints all
numbers from 1 to 100 for multiples of 3
instead of the number we want to print
the word fizz for multiples of 5 we want
to print the word buzz and for numbers
that are multiples of both 3 &amp;amp; 5 we want
to print the word fizzbuzz okay so let's
go ahead and let's create a for loop
here and in this for loop we're gonna
set I to 1 we want to start up 1 and
we're gonna say as long as I is less
than or equal to 100 and we want to
increment okay now if we were to console
dot log and by the way if you want to
pause this and try it on your own you
can do that we want a console log I so
if we run that you guys probably know
what's gonna happen we're just gonna
look forget to change this to fizzbuzz
and it's not gonna take any parameters
so we want to just scare rid of this all
right so let's run this and it's just
gonna print 1 to 100 so what we want to
happen is every multiple of 3 so 3 6 9
12 15 we want to print the word fizz all
right
actually not 15 because that's a
multiple of 3 and 5 that should be fizz
buzz buzz every multiple of 5 5 10 all
that stuff anything that's that's a
multiple of 5 but not 3 we want to print
buzz so all you really have to remember
for this problem is is how to use the
modulus operator okay so if we say if
let's say if I the current iteration
modulus 3 is equal to 0 and modulus will
just give us a remainder and if there's
no remainder then it's a multiple ok so
if that's true then we want a console
dot log fizz ok else we want a console
dot log just whatever the number is
which of course is just I now that takes
care of the 3 so if I were to run this
every multiple of 3 we get fizz so for
the 5 as you guys probably know we just
have to do an else--if ok we'll move
this up here and inside this if here
let's say I modulus 5 is equal to 0 then
what do we want to do go on a console
log buzz
all right so let's run that and there we
go so you can see if we go to the top
here three is fizz five is buzz
six is fizz fifteen is fizz and that's
not what we want remember if it's
multiple of three and five we want
fizzbuzz so I'm actually going to I'm
going to make this right here in else/if
because I want the first if to be the
multiple of three and five all right so
we'll go like that and then we'll say if
I modulus three is equal to zero and i
modulus five is equal to zero then we
want a console dot log fizzbuzz all
right let's try that okay so there we go
if we say one two three is fizz five is
buzz get to fifteen it's fizzbuzz we get
to thirty fizzbuzz we get to forty-five
fizzbuzz and so on now you could even
shorten this up and just do instead of
doing both of these you could just put
fifteen in here okay because if it's a
multiple of 15 it's gonna be a multiple
of three and five so if we run that
there we go we get the same thing all
right so this is pretty simple to
remember guys and this is something that
is very very popular so I mean I would
just suggest remembering this you know I
mean it's Princeton it's easy logic to
understand as well but just remember
that code okay especially if you're
looking for a job and you plan on doing
white board interviews so that's gonna
be it for this this one guys if you if
you liked this please leave it a like
and if you want to see more of this type
of stuff let me know we could do easier
stuff harder stuff or just you know I
consider this to be pretty intermediate
but I think it really it
really builds on your skill your your
your coding logic skill of course it's
not as fun as well maybe it is to some
people but I'm sure to a lot of people
it's not as fun is actually building a
project that you can see but it does it
really helps with your knowledge okay so
that's it for this video guys and I will
