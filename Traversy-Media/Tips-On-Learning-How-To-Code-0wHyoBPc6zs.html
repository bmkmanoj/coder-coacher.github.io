talking about some tips when learning
how to program okay whether you're
learning a language or a specific
framework or whatever it may be now if
you haven't watched my healthy tips for
programmers video I would suggest
checking that out as well put a link in
the description that covers more of the
physical and mental health areas alright
so first thing we're going to discuss is
how to remember all the code you learn
and how to retain that stuff this is
something that every programmer battles
with people ask me all the time how do
you remember all these different
languages and frameworks and constructs
how do you have that much space in your
mind well ironically the first thing to
do is to not remember you don't want to
simply remember the characters that
you're looking at on the screen you want
to understand and comprehend it there's
a huge difference in cramming remembered
information into your mind and really
comprehending what's happening and how
the logic is working and you have to
remember that all code is different so
if you just remember let's say some kind
of helpful function and then later on
you run into some code where that
function could be used to solve a
particular problem but one little thing
has changed from what you've remembered
so you're going to get stuck because you
simply remember the structure of the
code but you didn't really understand or
grasp the concept if you had then you'd
be able to test other ways of doing it
and you'd be able to adopt to this new
change it's kind of like reading a book
and just memorizing the words but not
really understanding the story behind
them and you want to be an active
learner not a passive learner a passive
learner basically listens and takes
notes to try to retain the information
for the next test and an active learner
is aimed at creating similar situations
and solving problems so it's a much more
dynamic way of learning so you want to
put what you've learned into use into
common use something you would actually
face in the real world first you want to
just run the original code exactly as is
exactly as you read it or saw it on a
video and then you really want to
understand the logic of every single
line and everything
character okay so if there's one piece
of code or function that you don't know
or you don't understand what it does
Google the shit out of it every function
every expression figure out what that
line does and how it does it because
you're you not knowing that one line of
code could make or break you using that
function or whatever it is in the future
future situations and then once you
really understand a piece of code you
want to try and make some changes start
small and start by adding an extra piece
of functionality or you don't even have
to do that you can just clean it up
maybe maybe there's some code that is
very similar in the script and you can
put put those into a custom function so
you don't have to repeat yourself and
you save yourself a few lines just
something small like that to start with
and once you made some small changes try
and recreate something completely new
using that same type of logic this is
where active active learning really
shines if you just remember the code
then you're not going to be able to
create something new you only be able to
repeat the same thing over and over if
you truly understand the logic then
everything else is just a variable okay
this makes you a much more dynamic
programmer now when you're learning
something new you're going to make
mistakes and probably a lot of them
you're going to get strange errors of
all different types and this is actually
a good thing fixing errors is one of the
best things you can do to learn in
programming and Google is your best
friend in these situations search sites
like Stack Overflow for all the
different types of error messages that
you're getting and it might take a while
but eventually you're going to find what
you're looking for okay so as I said
earlier you don't want to just remember
code you want to understand it but
sometimes you do need to go back and
check the correct syntax especially if
you're working with more than one
language sometimes I'm writing
JavaScript and then all of a sudden
they'll start going into PHP I'll start
adding you know money signs of my
variables I won't use var and so on it's
easy to get the syntax with multiple
languages can
used so if you have multiple references
that you can go back and check the exact
structure and the exact syntax that's
really helpful and there's a couple ways
to do this so one is to keep small text
files with common snippets for each
language
I'll keep it right on your local machine
or you could use a cloud service like
Dropbox so you can access them from
anywhere I have a folder called snippets
and then I have subfolders with each
language and then another level for
certain frameworks of that language okay
there's also a lot of online tools that
you can use to store and look up
snippets just box is a really popular
one you just need to github account and
you can sign up for free you can
categorize snippets into color-coded
folders and you can label them search
for them and so on
see snip is another really cool snippet
manager you can sign up with your github
account and I've heard lots of good
things about snip leaf but I've never
actually used it and for most of these
snippet managers they allow you to set
your code to private so only you can see
it or to public if you want other people
to be able to use your snippets another
great resource is documentation whether
it's the documentation of a language
like PHP net or Doc's for specific
framework or library you'll be able to
find all the functions the class names
and so on okay you also have
informational sites and blog posts I
have about a hundred different blog
posts bookmarked that I use to to go
back and look at examples and references
to certain blocks of code another tip
when learning to program is to write
code every single day even if it's only
for 20 or 30 minutes you want to stuff
fresh in your mind if you stop coding
for a month or two or even less than
that sometimes your mind is going to
stop working in that particular way of
problem-solving you're going to forget a
lot so forgetting is is much easier than
learning people have actually forgotten
full programming languages from not
using that part of their brain for so
long
you know it's usually pretty easy to get
back but it does take that extra time
where if you just practice it more often
you wouldn't have lost that knowledge
all right now try to learn something new
every day even if you have to wake up a
half hour earlier to watch a couple
tutorials that can help you a lot
all right you also want to stay
up-to-date with trends current trends in
technology and more specifically in
programming this is for any programmer
or developer not just people learning
and if a co-worker starts talking to you
about a common trend you want to be able
to respond and it also gets your brain
going and gives you that much more
knowledge all right so there are some
common principles in computer
programming and web development that
apply to a lot of different situations
we even have fancy acronyms for them so
kiss or keep it simple stupid doesn't
just apply to programming but it
definitely does apply you don't want to
make things more complex than they need
to be don't try to show off and make
something complex just to make it
complex remember it's not just writing
code that you need to think about you
also need to think about maintaining it
and the more complex the harder it is to
maintain so dry or don't repeat yourself
is another really helpful principle to
stick by when you're learning so if you
have two or more pieces of code that are
pretty similar and they just have
different variables you want to put
those into a single function or method
or class or something like that make
your code as simple and as short as you
can while keeping the same functionality
okay it'll help you and anyone else who
uses for your code in the future
okay there's also yeah Guinea or Yagami
and not exactly sure how to pronounce it
but it stands for you aren't going to
need it and what this means is you
should only implement what you actually
need especially if it's a big project
and you're just starting out focus on
the key features that you a school we
need and then later on you can think
about the extra bells and whistles
okay now this doesn't always apply
sometimes you do need to plan for future
growth but just try to stay focused on
the absolutely
accessories if you can so this last
slide is probably the most important
there's going to be times when you get
stuck and you start to really question
if this is what you want to be doing are
not want to be but if this is what you
should be doing you want you start
thinking that you're not smart enough
even if you've ever felt like that trust
me you're not alone especially if you're
like me and you didn't grow up in front
of a computer screen and you may think
since you weren't a tech geek all your
life that this isn't the place for you
and you don't fit in I can't tell you
how many times that I felt like that
myself but the most important thing is
that you stick with it and have
confidence in yourself all right you you
can't be doubting yourself and you can't
beat yourself up okay we all get to that
place where we get stuck and it seems
like it's impossible to find the answer
all right but if you do fall and you get
into a slump just make sure you get back
up and that may sound cliche but if that
doesn't make it any less true okay it's
also important to do what you love if
you love design and front-end stuff try
to do as much as that as you can if you
love logic and algorithms and back-end
stuff then do that alright just whatever
you do don't give up all right so enough
with the self-help stuff that's it guys
for this video hopefully you enjoyed it
and you'll use some of this stuff to
keep learning more and more and that's
it thanks and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
