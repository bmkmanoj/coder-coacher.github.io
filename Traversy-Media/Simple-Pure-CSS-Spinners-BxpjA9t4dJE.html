been a few days since my last video
which is a little unlike me but a lot of
you know that I've been moving so I bet
I've had to tear down my entire studio
and office and rebuild in the new place
so it's been taking a lot a lot of time
and energy and money and everything so I
did want to do a video though even
though I don't have my main setup up and
running yet so I'm doing this on my
macbook pro hopefully it comes out
alright I'm also using a new mic which
is actually a better mic so hopefully it
sounds ok but we are going to be
building as you can see in my last video
here the angular 6 what to expect the
first comment here by Mahmood Fahim
sorry if I butchered your name he asked
to do a video on CSS loaders and
spinners and I needed something simple
to do so I figured that that was a good
a good topic or a good project for today
so that's what we're going to be doing
if we go over to this tab here we just
have just a basic h1 and in paragraph
but if I reload you can see we have this
little spinner here and it's gonna stay
there for 4 seconds and then it's gonna
load in the paragraph okay so what we're
going to focus on is building the
spinner in pure CSS okay it's not a gif
or Jif however you want to say it or
anything like that it's a pure CSS
spinner and we're actually going to
build three different versions and it's
gonna be really easy it's gonna be quick
and painless so let's head over to vyas
code and if you want to follow along I
have two files in index.html and main
dot CSS and that's in a folder called
CSS spinners all right so the mark-up is
going to be very simple we're gonna go
ahead and just use Emmet to create our
boilerplate here and let's take the
title and we'll call it CSS spinners and
let's link our style sheet so we want
main dot CSS alright and the body is
going to be very simple we're gonna have
a class of main we're gonna have an h1
and we'll just say hello
welcome to my website obviously you guys
can put whatever you want here and then
a paragraph and I'm just gonna do lorem
50 tab which will give me 50 dummy text
words all right and we're gonna do some
a little bit of JavaScript later on but
right now I want to focus on creating
the spinners so we're just gonna save
this file and let's see let's go back to
Chrome oops
and let's uh let's close this up and I
can close that up as well and then what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to open this
up using live server which is a vs code
extension which I would highly recommend
if you use vs code or you could just
open up the end at the HTML file but if
you have live server then you can just
right click or command click and you can
do open with live server and that should
open it up oh I already have something
running let me just stop that real quick
and then we'll go ahead and do it again
open with live server and there we go so
this is this is our version and we're
gonna head over to the CSS so let's go
to main CSS and this is actually gonna
be pretty simple guys
we're just using a simple keyframe but
we're gonna first create our class now
like I said we're gonna create three
different spinners so this will be
spinner one they're all going to be very
similar they're just gonna have a slight
change in each in each one but we're
gonna say spinner let's call it spinner
one that'll be the class and then we
want to use the pseudo selector of
before all right now when you use before
or after you can actually insert content
but we don't want to insert any actual
content so it's just going to be a blank
string and then we're gonna add a box
sizing if you're hearing like drilling
or hammering and stuff next door I
apologize that they're still working on
the next the next door condo or next
door apartment and you might hear a
little banging so I apologize for that
so we're gonna set this to border box
because if there's any padding or
anything like that
what the heck why is this I put a comma
here all right so that's just gonna make
it so if we add any padding or anything
like that it's not going to go outside
of the box model okay so let's add a
position of absolute now the reason I'm
doing I'm doing this let me just kind of
explain what I am doing when we have our
spinner I want it to be smack dab in the
middle of the page so what we're going
to do is we're going to bring it down
from the top 50% and from the left 50%
and I'm gonna make it 60 pixels height
and width so we also have to make up for
that so we'll add it we'll have a margin
top of negative 30 pixels which is half
of 60 and a margin left of negative 30
so that it's actually in the middle and
it's not you know 30 pixels down or 30
pixels to the right okay hopefully that
makes sense
so position:absolute let's add top so
from the top it'll be 50% and then from
the left it'll also be 50% and let's add
that let's add the height and width so
we'll say height 60 pixels and with 60
pixels and let's add our margin top and
we want that to be a negative 30 because
we wanted to move up okay same thing
with margin left we want that to be
negative 30 to move it to the left all
right now we want this to be a circle so
we're gonna say border radius and that's
gonna be 50% and now for the border so
basically this spinner the way it's
gonna look you saw it in the beginning
it's gonna be just a gray circle with an
orange piece going around and around and
that's going to be the border top but
the main border is going to be 3 pixels
solid and you can change up the the
width you can change up the colors
whatever you want but I'm gonna make
this light gray
and then let's do the border top color
and let's change that I'm gonna make
that coral okay and obviously you can
use whatever colors you want and then
the last thing of course is the
animation which we're gonna call spinner
we're going to create the keyframe in a
second and then the the speed I'm gonna
set is 0.7 seconds and then the movement
is going to be in a linear fashion and
it's going to be infinite we wanted to
keep going okay so let's create our
keyframe so this key frame is very very
simple we're just going to say at
keyframes and we're gonna call it
spinner and then what we'll do is we'll
say to have some curly braces and we
want the transform property to be set to
rotate and we want it to rotate 360
degrees so we can say 360 deg alright
and that's it that should create our
spinner so what we'll do is we'll save
this and we'll go back to Chrome I'm
sorry no we don't want to go back to
Chrome we want to go to our HTML because
we want to implement that spinner class
somewhere so for now I'm just gonna hard
code it right here so we'll say spinner
one and save that and go back and there
it is
so the gray you see is the border and we
made it gray and then the this spinning
a spinny pot is the border top which we
made the coral color okay so it's as
easy as that to create a CSS spinner
obviously you can make it bigger or
smaller you can make it thicker change
the color do some experimentation with
it now what we're going to do is do our
second one which is going to be very
similar so what I'm gonna do is copy
this whole thing and we're gonna call
this one spinner two so we'll change the
class two spinner to and all we want to
change here really is the border let's
see so the border will say let's say two
pixels solid and instead of a color here
whoops want to do that instead of this
color we're gonna say transparent okay
because we want the the the complete
border to be transparent but I want the
top and bottom border to be coral so
what we'll do here is we'll just copy
this down and we'll also add border
bottom color of coral and then the last
thing we're going to do is just change
this from a linear motion to an YZ
motion which is more of it's less of a
smooth circular effect and it's more of
like a jerky like you know one spin to
spin so let's go ahead and save that and
let's go to the index.html and change
this to spin or two and let's see what
that looks like so we'll go to Chrome
and there we go so you can see that it's
not a full circle now it's like two half
circles and it has a different kind of
motion all right so that's our second
spinner and obviously you can experiment
with it if you want change the thickness
or the color or the size all that stuff
so let's go back now to vias code and
let's add our third spinner all right so
what I'll do is copy the entire second
one that we just did and let's paste
that in and we'll change this to spin
our three make sure you change the class
as well and as far as what we're going
to change down here let's see so we want
the we actually don't want a border at
all the the straight border property I'm
going to get rid of that and then we're
gonna have a border top okay you're not
aboard a top color but a border top and
then we're also gonna do a border whoops
a border right so let's do border right
alright so for the border top we're
gonna do two pixels solid coral
and for the border right let's do two
pixels solid and then we're gonna do
transparent all right and this gives it
this is going to give it kind of a cool
effect so border right should be
transparent and then as far as the
motion goes here I'm going to change it
back to linear and that's it so let's
save it let's go back to our index and
let's change this to spin our three and
we'll save that we'll go back to Chrome
and there we go so now this it doesn't
have the full circle it's basically just
one line and it has kind of a kind of a
point on the end of it okay so it almost
looks like a like a tail or something
like that and I think it looks pretty
cool so that is the third style of
spinner alright and we've done all this
was just CSS and it's pretty easy stuff
you know we had one line in our keyframe
so it's it's pretty easy to do now what
I'm gonna do is just add a little
JavaScript to have it kind of give it
that effective it's loading in the
paragraph okay and usually you'd use
this for like some kind of Ajax requests
whether it's through fetch or however
you're you're doing it but let's go back
and let's add a little bit of JavaScript
to our index.html file alright now we
don't want to just hard code the spinner
class in here so we're gonna get rid of
that and then down here we'll add or
right here above the body we'll add in
some script tags and I'm gonna first of
all hide the paragraph so I'm not gonna
use jQuery you could if you wanted to
but I'm gonna use vanilla JavaScript as
usual but we're gonna use document dot
query selector and we're gonna choose
the class of main and then the power
graph within it and then we're gonna set
the style dot display to none so it
hides it by default
so if I were to save this and we look at
our page you can see that the paragraph
is an
gone alright the next thing we're going
to do is add the spinner so we'll say
document dot query selector and we're
going to choose the entire main class
and we're gonna use class list dot add
okay which is the same as jquery's add
class and we're gonna add the class of
spinner - one or two or three whatever
you want to add and if I save that and
we take a look now we have the spinner
alright so now we want the effect of it
of it loading in the paragraph so for
that we're just going to use set timeout
so basically we're just going to mimic a
server request that takes whatever four
seconds so we're gonna say set timeout
and set timeout takes and it's going to
take in two things a function and then
the time that we want it to take so for
the function I'm going to use an arrow
and we're gonna I guess we could just
copy these I'll make it easier and we'll
put that in here all right I'm actually
gonna move this up and for the main
class we're going to remove the spinner
so we want to say class list dot remove
spinner one and then we want to set the
paragraph from none to block okay so
that will bring it in alright and then
the last thing we need to do is just add
in our parameter so right after the
function we'll put a comma and then four
thousand which is four thousand
milliseconds or four seconds and
obviously you could put this to whatever
you want so if we save this and go back
to Chrome it should take four seconds
for the spinner and then the spinner
disappears and the paragraph shows
alright guys so that's going to be it if
