going to show you how to add facebook
connect to your drum social site in this
tutorial we're using joomla 3.1 and
we're using jomsocial three so first
thing I'm going to do is log into my
admin area and we want to go to
components jomsocial and then
configuration now this is the front end
of the site I'm actually using the
register page as the landing page so
it's quite customized but it's basically
it just looks different it's basically
the same programming we have the the
name and an email and password fields
when we activate jumps I'm sorry when we
activate facebook connect we should get
a little facebook button so what we need
to do is once we're in the configuration
you want to click on facebook connect on
the left hand side here if you're using
joomla 2.5 or an earlier version of
jomsocial this might be at the top but
you just want to find facebook connect
now we can't just enable it we have to
actually create an app in facebook and
we have to input the facebook api key as
well as the application secret so i'm
going to go to facebook and you might
need to register as a developer i did
this quite a while ago so i'm not
exactly sure the steps to be able to
create an app but i know it's pretty
easy but once you've done that you want
to just go to you want to go to
developers dot-com and click on apps up
here at the top and what we want to do
is create a new app
and i'm going to call this responders
own login because responders own I'm
sorry responders zone is the name of the
website you can call your app anything
you want that's the actual name this
will be the namespace this we don't
really need this because this isn't
going to be a canvas app but I'll just
do it anyway and that has to be lower
case I believe you can use an underscore
and that's it app category will say
I'm just going to keep it on other and
I'm not going to click the web hosting
option and we just click continue we
need to do the security check
so now our app is created let's see I'm
not sure I don't think we need to enter
you do I think need to enter the domain
so I'm going to put in my domain I think
that's all we need we don't need website
with face actually yes we do website
with facebook login so you want to put
your URL here so I believe we need the
HTTP ok now app on facebook we don't
need we don't eat anything else so that
should be good so if we click Save
Changes ok so now we have our app ID and
higher app secret so all we need to do
now is grab these and put them into our
configuration
and you can always reset your app secret
which is basically works like a password
all right so you can choose different
options here if you want to import
facebook profiles on the site for a sign
up watermarks on avatars I'm just going
to leave everything as yes and that
looks good so now if we save and close
and it says configuration updated so now
if we go to the front end and reload
we now have a facebook login button
obviously I'm going to have to style
this a little bit because it's right on
top of the other but you get the idea
you can click on it it'll ask to access
your public profile and then you can do
what you want with it so this is
basically just a setup video so you can
go on to do whatever you like with it so
thanks for watching and please subscribe
if you can thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
