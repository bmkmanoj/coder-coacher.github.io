you how to login to through FTP securely
and we're gonna use FileZilla and we're
gonna set up a private key because if
someone's sniffing around your network
you don't want to just use the standard
hosts username password because they'll
be able to acquire your username and
password pretty easily so what we want
to do is I'm in cPanel
and we want to go to SSH shell access
and manage SSH keys and then we want to
generate a new key and the default name
is ID on the score DSA so we'll just
leave that and then you want to do a key
password and this is a weak password
it's fine I'm going to delete this after
you can leave the type and size and then
just click generate key go back and now
you can see we have a public key and a
private key first of all with the public
key we want to go to manage
authorization and click authorize ok and
now what we want to do is download the
private key
now you want to use this option here you
want to get in a PPK format because
that's what FileZilla requires so
entering your passphrase convert and
then we want to download this key and
I'm just gonna save it - I'll just save
it to my desktop because I'm gonna
delete it anyways but you want to put it
in a safe place probably most likely put
it in you use your users file alright so
now that we have that let's go to
FileZilla and we want to go to site
manager I'm just gonna delete this and
create a new one all right so I'm gonna
say new site I'll just call it TGS for
tech ty staging um and this is very
important you want to you want to choose
SFTP and then in most cases you'll
select normal and then just put your FTP
ru cPanel username and password
actually I don't think that was right
all right
so that's good all right so now we could
actually log in securely here but we
want to take it a step further and use
the the the private key so what we want
to do is go to edit settings and down
and you want to go to SFTP and then add
key file we want to grab that key that I
put on my desktop
so it's saying it's password-protected
it has to be unprotected for filezilla
to support it so we're gonna click yes
passphrase all right so now you want to
you want to create another key I'm just
gonna save it to my desktop and I'll
just call it my key
okay so now you can see that we now have
our key okay so just click OK in TG g GS
now it's gonna ask us it's gonna tell us
that the server host key is unknown you
have no guarantee that the server is the
computer you think it is well yes we do
so I'm gonna click to always trust this
host and up here you can see that we've
connected securely and now we're we're
in so that's how you can connect using
SFTP and you you really want to do that
instead of typing your you know
credentials into this bar and it's
always here for it's easy access it's
not like you have to do that every time
the key is there we're logging in
securely so it's just a good idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
