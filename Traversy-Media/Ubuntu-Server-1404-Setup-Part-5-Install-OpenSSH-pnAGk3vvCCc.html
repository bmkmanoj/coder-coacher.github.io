is we want to install open SSH and
configure it well there's not that much
configuration to do but basically we
want to be able to log into the shell
from another computer all right so we
want to log in remotely and if there's a
bunch of different tools you can do that
with but what I use is putty alright so
I'm going to open up putty and basically
you just want to put in the host and
connect and then you can log in alright
from anywhere at all
now by default this isn't gonna work
all right so let's try 10 this is the IP
address of the test server ok so go
ahead and we get a network error
connection refused ok so if we want to
allow incoming connections we can use
open SSH
so to install that is really easy you
want to say sudo apt-get install open -
- SSH
actually that might not be the right
command okay it's actually open SSH
server that's this h-dash server yes
all right so it is installed but if you
get some kind of error about
dependencies it may be because you don't
have your DNS name server set up and if
you do get that then you just want to
edit the network interfaces file so sudo
nano and just add in this line down here
this DMS slash name servers and then I
have Google's public name servers and
then restart the network service and
that you're doing alright so now we
should be able to log in remotely with
putty
okay so 10.13
alright so the first time you try to log
in you're going to get this message
asking if you trust the host or whatever
so we're gonna click yes and then we get
this window now this window is is in my
Windows machine it up.this this isn't
coming from the server I'm gonna log in
to the server okay so your login is Brad
password and we're in all right so we're
remotely connected to the server so if
you have if you have a machine that's
dedicated for your server whether you're
at home or the office or whatever it
doesn't have to have a monitor anymore
you can just log in through open SSH and
do what you need to do all right so it's
completely headless and it's just a big
help to be able to do that all right so
really really easy that's how you can
install OpenSSH and connect remotely to
your server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
