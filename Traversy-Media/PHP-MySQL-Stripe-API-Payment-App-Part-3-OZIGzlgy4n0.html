pay page application with PHP MySQL and
the stripe API so up to this point we're
able to make a payment and it goes
through our stripe dashboard it also
gets saved in our database we have a
customers table and a transactions table
now what I want to do is create two
pages one for viewing the customers one
for viewing the transactions so in my in
the root of our application here I'm
going to create a new file called
customers dot PHP and from here let's
copy what we have in the success dot PHP
not that we don't actually need the PHP
code but just the HTML we need bootstrap
and all that so I'm just going to grab
that and put that in here let's change
the title to view customers and let's
see we're gonna have we're gonna have a
table let's get rid of everything in the
container and then I'll put let's see
let's put in h2 and we'll say customers
and then we're gonna have a table
and I'm actually going to give this it's
this table a class or a couple classes
one of table one of table - striped
which are bootstrap classes there's only
one peon striped and let's do a heading
so a tea head area with a table row and
then some table headings okay so we're
going to have the customer ID we're
gonna have the name the email and let's
do the date and then we'll have the tea
body under the tea head and then we're
gonna have to loop through our customers
here so I'm gonna stop with the HTML and
then we're gonna go up top and we need
to do a couple things with PHP so we're
going to bring in C we're gonna first of
all bring in our database config which
has the parameters so config slash DB
PHP then we want to bring in our library
database library which is Lib / PDO
underscore DB and then we also want to
bring in our customer model so that's in
models slash customer alright so let's
go ahead and instantiate a customer
by creating a variable called customer
and setting it to new customer and then
we want to get a customer now we haven't
created this method yet but we will and
it's really easy so we're gonna say
customer is equals customer and then
we're gonna have a method called get
customers like that so let's go into our
model now customer model and let's go
under the add customer which ends right
here and let's say public function get
customers all right and then for this
this is gonna be pretty easy this
library I really like this PDO library
I've been using it for years I think
it's it's simple but it does everything
you need it to so we're gonna say this
DB so we're gonna use that library that
class and we're gonna call query and
inside here let's say select all from
customers and we want to order them by
the created at ok and we want to order
that we want it to be descending so
that's our statement and then all we
have to do is say results equals and
remember in our in our library here in
our database library we have this result
set this is what we use when we're
returning more than one results okay if
we were fetching a single object or a
single record we would use single but
all we have to do is say results equals
this DB result set
actually I think it's all lowercase
this DB results set and then we just
return that and that should give it to
us so if I go to customers PHP and just
to test it out let's do a print R which
prints out an array and we'll pass in
customers and let's see what we get so
if we go to our application slash
customers dot PHP and there we go it's
printing out Tom which is the only
customer we have in our database so now
we want to get Tom down here into the
table so all we have to do is go down to
our body the body of our table and let's
do a for each so I'm gonna use a
shorthand by saying for each colon like
that and then we can say PHP and for
each like that okay and then what we
want to loop through we want to say for
customers as C or whatever I'm just
using C and then we can put our table
rows so for each customer a table row is
going to be created and then for the
columns let's do the ID so we'll say PHP
echo C ID all right and then we'll just
copy this down let's see need for all
together then we have the name so we're
gonna do the first name and then let's
copy this
and then we'll do the last name
so it'll be first name space last name
then we want the email and then we want
the created at all right so let's save
that let's go back and then we see let
me just get rid of this print R and save
and there we go so now we have our
customers and I'm just going to put a
link under the table that goes back to
the pay page if we want so I'll just put
a line break and let's put an a tag
going to index dot PHP all right and one
other thing I want to do is just have a
button group at the top so we can switch
to the transactions page if we want
which we haven't actually created yet
but we'll go ahead and create that that
button group so right under the
container div let's do a div with the
class of BTN group and we're gonna say
role equals group and inside here we're
gonna use links so we're gonna have an a
tag with the class of BTN and let's do
BTN primary since we're on the customers
page and this will go to customers dot
PHP
customers alright and then we'll copy
that down this one will go to
transactions dot PHP we're gonna change
the class from primary to secondary like
that and let's see what that looks like
let's put an HR underneath the button
group div and there we go now
transactions isn't going to work because
we haven't created it yet so let's do
that so I'm gonna copy everything in the
customers dot PHP that's in the root
create a new file called transactions
dot PHP and paste that in and this time
we want to bring in our transactions
model we want to instantiate a
transaction customer let's see it's to
change all these
so that'll be transaction that should be
lowercase T alright so transaction
equals new transaction and then
transactions equals transaction get
transactions which we have to create and
then down here let's change the title to
transactions and for the button group
here all I'm going to do is change the
classes I want transactions to be
primary so that we know which one we're
on and this will be secondary all right
we'll change this and then as far as the
fields we have a couple more than we do
for customers so we will have a
transaction ID we're going to have a
customer that'll be the customer ID
we're gonna have the product we're gonna
have we will have a date so what I'll do
is just bring in the amount like that
alright and then we're going to loop
through our transactions it'll say as T
okay so this first one will be the
transaction ID so T ID second one is
going to be the customer ID so it's
gonna be t customer ID we don't need
this
and then let's see we're gonna have the
amount right is that the next one no the
product okay but that should be T naught
C then we have the amount so T amount
and then we have the date right yeah all
right now if we save that and go to
transactions which we have a link here
it's not going to work because we
haven't created yeah it's this should be
transaction the models are singular but
it's still not going to work because we
don't have the get transactions method
so what I'm going to do is go to the
customer model and copy the get
customers method and then paste that
into the transit transaction model right
here okay but we're going to change it
to get transactions
okay and then all we want to do is
change the table name order by creative
that everything else can be the same
that's good let's save let's reload and
there we go so there's our transaction
now for the amount that it looks like
five thousand so what I'm going to do is
just use a little bit of PHP and go
let's say we want to go to transactions
PHP and where we have the T amount right
here we can actually change this - we
can get a decimal point in here by using
the S print F method which is a
replacement method and we want to pass
in here we want to pass in a % dot 2f
for a first parameter and then pass in
as a second parameter the amount which
is T amount and we want to divide that
by 100 so if I save that and reload now
we have 50 we have the dot the decimal
places and let's just put the currency
in here as well so after that we'll put
a space and then we'll do actually want
to go after the PHP tag and then open
another one and say echo T currency
so 50 USD let's make that all caps so
we'll just wrap the cut T currency in
str2 upper which just makes it all
uppercase oops what I do and there we go
so customers and transactions so once
and for all let's test let's delete I'm
gonna delete everything from our
database and from stripe so that we can
just do one file test all right and then
we'll go to stripe we'll go to our
business settings data delete all test
data
okay so we have nothing in stripe we
have nothing in our database tables so
let's go to our pay page and let's do
John Doe submit all right let's do one
more say Maggie Smith all right so two
people have bought in the react course
now let's go to transactions dot PHP and
there's our two transactions and you can
see the customer ID is different if we
go to customers we have our two client
our two customers okay and if we go to
our dash stripe dashboard and reload we
should have two payments okay there's
our two payments and we should have two
customers Maggie and John so there you
have it we have a pay page we can check
out our customers and transactions like
I said I might continue on with the
authentication because obviously you
don't want these pages open to the
public
you'd want to have some kind of login
system if you watched my you to me PHP
course we implement a log in with this
PDO class and you could easily add that
and even if you wanted to do that and
make a pull request to the git
repository feel free to do so I'll check
it out and approve it if it looks good
and yeah I might do a video on on
authentication but that's gonna be it
for now guys hopefully you enjoyed the
series I know a lot of you guys have
been asking me for PHP videos even
though the majority of my audience are
more towards JavaScript there are a lot
of PHP developers so I don't want to
leave you guys hanging so hopefully you
enjoyed it and thanks for watching
hey guys so as I mentioned a few times
in the series I do have a udemy course
called object-oriented PHP and MVC where
we actually build a complete
model-view-controller framework from
scratch and then we build an application
with that framework so this course uses
a lot of the same concepts like I said
it uses the exact same PDO class it has
authentication and login so if you like
what you just watched in this series and
you want to you know take your knowledge
further then check out this course I'll
put a $10 link in the description below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
