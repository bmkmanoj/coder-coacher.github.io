front-to-back
in this video I'm going to show you how
to get PHP set up along with Apache and
MySQL now we're going to be using a
software suite called xampp or sometimes
pronounced zamp and it comes with all of
that stuff and you'll see it says maria
DB and not mysql it's basically a
drop-in for mysql it has all the same
functionality plus some extra stuff so
it's the same exact thing for what we
need it for now xampp is cross-platform
so you can install it on Windows Linux
Mac if you are on Linux though it
probably suggests that you just go with
the lamps vacuum that you install PHP
Apache and MySQL separately and probably
PHP myadmin as well which is also
included in xampp because it gives you a
more realistic server environment
alright but if you're on Windows or Mac
I would suggest xampp there's also lamp
for Windows and then there's also MAMP
for Mac which are basically the same
thing they all give us those three
things Apache PHP in MySQL so you want
to go to Apache friends org and you can
click one of these buttons if you want
to install PHP version 5.6 at this time
but I want to use the latest version
which is 7.1 so I'm going to click on
this green button here ok and then if
you look over here it shows you the
different versions this is all for
Windows this is 1x this is Mac so we
want 7.1.1
so I'm going to click download and save
that okay and that's 120 megabytes so it
might take a minute or two alright so
that's all set let's go ahead and open
that up
now if you get this message it's just
telling you that if you have user
account control enabled it might give
you some issues but I've actually never
had an issue with it so I will just
click OK okay and then we're going to
just get an installer window like this
we're just going to click Next and then
here you can pick and choose what you
want from this software suite we have
Apache MySQL FileZilla which is an FTP
server I don't want that I don't want
the mercury mail server or Tomcat ok I
do want PHP and I'm going to keep Perl
as well and then down here with PHP
myadmin which is used to basically
interact with your with your MySQL
database in in a graphical format ok
webalizer which have to do with
statistics and then sake send mail so
I'm just going to keep all those enabled
ok it's going to by default if you're on
Windows it's going to install it in the
C Drive I'm just fine I'm going to
uncheck this bit Namie thing and now
it's going to install all right guys
that took about a minute or so
now it's going to say do you want to
start the control panel now I'm going to
uncheck that and I'll show you why in a
second so let's click finish and now it
should be installed so if we go to C
I'll go to my C Drive and you should now
have an X amp folder and if we go down
here you'll see there's this xampp
control D X eval the reason that I
didn't start it after the installation
is because I want to right click and run
as administrator ok you want to make
sure that you do that ok all right so
let's go ahead and just stick
all right so now you're going to get a
window like this now the reason that I
had to run it as administrators because
I want Apache and MySQL to run into
service
she's been meaning I wanted to run in
the background and I wanted to run
automatically so to do that you just
need to click this red X and click yes
and then this one and yes and if we
didn't run this as administrator we
wouldn't be able to do that this would
be grayed out okay so that's why I need
to do that and then we can start up
Apache and we can start up MySQL okay so
those two things are now running as a
service in the background on our system
okay PHP as well so now let's open up a
browser window and I'm going to go to
http localhost okay so when you do that
you should see a screen like this this
is just the xampp welcome page notice
that when we went to localhost we got
redirected to slash dashboard okay they
actually set it up so that it does that
now when you're working with your server
the folder that you want to work in is
in the xampp folder right and then
you're going to go to htdocs and this is
basically the root of your web server
okay it's loading this index.php file
just like when you work with HTML you
need an index.html for it to be
basically the root same with PHP name at
index.php and it will load automatically
all right now if we look at this real
quick okay basically you can see that
this code here I'm not going to explain
all of it but it's redirecting us to
slash dashboard which is the page we
just saw okay if you want you can just
get rid of all this keep the PHP tag and
then we'll just go ahead and echo it
works okay because there's not much to
that dashboard it's basically just
informational so if we save that now and
we try to go to localhost
we just get it works okay it's just
loading this index.php file now we can
go ahead and start writing PHP now
you're all set up but one thing I want
to do is I want to go to PHP myadmin
which will be at localhost / PHP myadmin
okay from here you can manage databases
if we click on the database tab and see
there's some sample ones here but what I
want to do is I want to add a password
because you saw we could just come right
to this without entering a password and
if we built the script where we were
using MySQL we could connect without a
password and we don't want that we want
to be more secure so we're going to go
to user accounts and you want the root
user and the hosting local localhost you
can see right here it says no for
password we're going to click Edit
privileges and we're going to click
right here change password let's go
ahead and add a password here okay and
then we'll click go and if we try to go
back to databases we're going to get a
whole bunch of errors here okay
basically access is being denied because
we never enter that password so now what
we want to do is edit a config file and
just add that password in it so if we go
to xampp and then PHP myadmin and then
we want to go to this config Inc PHP
file I'm just going to open that with
sublime text and we're going to go to
this line right here this password and
put in that password that you used okay
and then we'll just save that go back
here reload and now it's all set okay so
now we're using the password in this
config file and then when we use MySQL
and our script we'll have to add that
password alright so you now have PHP and
Apache and MySQL setup on your system so
now in the next video we can start to
write some PHP code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
