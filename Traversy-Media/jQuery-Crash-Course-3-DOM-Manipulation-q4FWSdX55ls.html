part 1 and 2 of this jQuery crash course
in this video we're going to get into
Dom manipulation okay we're going to do
some stuff that we've already done just
a little bit and then we're going to
learn about some other methods that can
help us manipulate the document object
model so let's start in the container
here that we have we're going to create
button so we'll say button and we'll
give it an ID BTN 1 Save button 1 and
let's put couple paragraphs underneath
so say P we'll give it a class of power
1 say this is a paragraph okay and then
we'll do one more paragraph okay so we
have a button we have two paragraphs and
then I'm just going to put a div as well
so we'll say div we'll give it an ID of
my div oops
alright now let's go down to our script
and the first method we're going to go
over a CSS now we've used this already
quite a bit but I just want to make sure
we do cover it here so we'll say we'll
take that paragraph with the class of
power one call dot CSS and let's say
color will set to red
alright let's reload and you can see we
get our elements and the paragraph is
read alright now if we want to add
multiple CSS properties here I'm just
going to copy that
what we need to do is throw in an object
so we'll wrap that with curly braces and
it's an object so we want to put a colon
there and we can get rid of these quotes
here and then let's say we want to add a
background as well so we'll put a comma
there and then we'll say background and
we'll set that to hexadecimal value
forward gray so now if we reload you can
see that it now has those two styles
alright now we can also add and remove
classes so what I'm going to do is go up
here and create a class we'll say dot my
class not that and we'll say color we'll
say color blue and background background
will say black okay and now what we'll
do is just take a second paragraph so P
dot power two and say dot add class and
then just pass in the class name in this
case it's my class so let's save that
reload and now you'll see that it now
has the class my class and we can look
at it I can examine it here and you'll
see that it was in fact put in now at
the same time we also have removed class
so if we want to remove it we'll just go
like that and then if we reload the
class is now removed so pretty easy
stuff now we can also toggle classes so
what I'm going to do is add an event
here for that button
so he has an ID of BTN one say click and
what we'll do is we'll let's take this
put that in there and then we're just
going to change this to toggle class
okay so I'm going to comment these two
out and now if I click that you'll see
that it's going to toggle that class
okay now we're going to move into
actually adding and changing content
from within the Dom so let's take that
div we have an ID of my div okay and
then we're going to say we'll do dot
text and let's say hello world okay so
if we save that we reload you can see
now that that div is outputting hello
world so that's dot text we also have
dot HTML so let's comment that out and
if we were to change this to dot HTML we
could then add HTML tags in here
okay so now we have an h3 that says
hello world now at the same time we can
set these we can also get the values so
for instance let's say alert and we want
to alert my div oops
my div dot text okay so we reload and
you see we get hello world okay so we
can get values as well we can also get
the HTML so that's text in HTML now we
also have append and prepend which do
just that and let me give you an example
I'm going to set up a list up here so
we'll say Li and we'll say list item 1
and we'll just copy that 2 3 4 ok we'll
reload that and we get our list down
here okay and I'm just going to comment
out this stuff up here okay so what we
want to do here is we're going to take
that ul and I'm going to say append and
here we'll put a li and we'll say append
list item so let's see what that does if
we reload you'll see that it got added
to the end ok so it puts inside of the
UL at the very end now at the same time
we have prepend which I'm sure you can
think of what that's going to do so if
we change this to prepend and let's
change this prepend and reload and now
you'll see that it put it at the
beginning of the list we also have a pen
too and prepend too we can take one
element and append it to another so for
instance let's take power one and then
we'll do dot
a pen - and we'll pass in here I think
we just need that the selector so dot
power - let's see what that does
all right so it says this is another
paragraph and then it appended to this
this is a paragraph all right and then
we also have prepend - so if we go
prepend - and reload you'll see that now
it's reversed the other way around now
we do have before and after because when
you append or prepend you're actually
putting it we're taking the Li and
putting it inside of the UL with before
and after you can put stuff after the
well not inside it so for instance let's
say actually will use the UL example so
you L dot before and in here I'm just
going to put an h4 I'll say hello reload
and now you'll see that it's before the
UL it's not inside of it and then we can
also do after okay we'll change that and
it will say world and now we reload and
you get world after the UL okay so very
easy to manipulate the Dom another
method we have is empty so if we were to
take the UL oops and say dot empty
reload now if we look at the actual HTML
you'll see the UL is actually still
there what empty does is it takes all of
the inner elements out okay we also have
one called detach so let's see what that
does
save that and now if we look at ul it's
not there okay it's been detached from
the Dom now we can also work with
attributes so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go up below the list here
and create a link
okay so we'll create a link and let's go
down here and we'll take that a tag and
say dot adder attr and let's say we want
to add a target attribute because we
want it to open up in a new window so
we'll say adder and then we'll pass in
target which is the attribute and then
we'll pass in the value which we want
underscore blank so now if we reload
click Google it's going to open another
window and you can see if we look at it
it has a target blank okay so we did
that from jQuery now we can also use a
door to get the attribute so for
instance if we want to alert we could
say a dot adder and then pass in
whatever the attribute we want so in
this case a to F so now we reload and we
get google.com we can also remove
attributes so we know that we do have
this target attribute now let's remove
it down here so this will be dot remove
adder and we'll say
target okay
think that's right so let's save it
reload and now if I click it's in the
same window because the target attribute
is now gone all right so let's comment
this stuff out I shall just do one big
comment okay so next thing I want to do
is wrap and what that will do is it'll
wrap specific elements in other elements
so for instance let's take our
paragraphs and say dot wrap and in here
we want to place the tag we want to wrap
in let's say h1 ok don't need to put the
the ending tag it'll actually do that
for you
so let's save reload and now if we look
at these paragraphs both of them are
wrapped in an h1 now we also have wrap
all which will just use one h1 and wrap
both so we'll say wrap all comment this
out and let's see the difference ok it
looks the same but if we look at the
actual markup both paragraphs are
wrapped in one h1 as opposed to them
having their own h1 so that's the
difference between wrap and wrap all now
before we move on to arrays I just
something that I'd like to show you I
want to have an input where we can
actually add an item to this list all
right so let's go up to our HTML and
we're going to go right above the list
and put in an input give it a type of
text and let's give it an ID of new item
and we'll go down here and we're going
to use the key up event here because the
idea is I just I want to be able to
click enter or hit enter and then have
have that be appended to the list all
right so we need to use key up and we
need to do a we need to check the key
code because each key has its own code
so let's do a new item which is the
input and then we're going to do dot key
up okay
key up I'm going to pass in a function
and pass in our e right there and then
we're going to save our code and set
that to e dot which that'll get the key
code and enter is actually the code of
13 so if we say e if code is equal to 13
and we want to prevent the default value
on the default behavior prevent default
and then let's append
say ul dot append and we want to append
a list item and in here we'll go ahead
and concatenate Yi dot target dot value
all right so let's save that and we'll
say test item and enter and there we go
gets added test item to enter and we'll
be able to keep adding to that list now
obviously when we reload it's going to
disappear because it's not persisting to
a database or anything like that all
right so now what I want to do is move
on to arrays and some of the array
methods so what I'm going to do is
create variable called my
or myarray and we're going to set it to
just a bunch of names say Brad Kelly
Nate and Jose okay so we have this array
of names now if you want to loop through
an array you can use the each loop or
the each method so it's going to be
dollar sign dot each all right and then
in here we're going to pass in my array
and then our function okay and this
function is going to take in two things
it's going to take in an index and a
value all right and then in here we'll
have access to each iteration so let's
say console dot log Val so now if we
look down here you can see we get each
name now if we want to output them up
here we can do that let's create we'll
go under the link here and we'll say ul
and then give it an ID of users
okay now instead of just console logging
let's do ID users dot append
okay and then we'll just say users are
not users Val
okay we'll reload and let's see dollar
signs not defined alright and now you
can see we have the names output in our
application now if we want to take let's
say these list items and put them into
array and array we can do that as well
so I'm going to comment to so and what
we'll do is let's say console dot log
and then we'll take actually no I'm not
going to do that I'm going to set a
variable called new array and set that
to ul and let's give that ul an ID of
list so then we'll say ul with the ID of
list and then we want the list items
okay we want to turn that to an array so
we'll say to array all right and then
we'll just console.log that see what
that gives us
okay now you can see we have an array
and each one has the list item along
with all of its information okay so for
instance if we want the innerhtml
let's do an each loop which I'll just
copy from right here
and we'll pass in new array will loop
through it get rid of that say console
dot log Val dot enter HTML
and you can see we're getting all the
list items and if we wanted to somehow
edit that that content somehow and then
reapply it to the list we could do that
but I'm not going to get that far into
it all right so that's basic Dom
manipulation ok so just adding stuff to
our document object model removing it
updating it things like that
all right so in the next video we're
going to get a little bit into effects
and animation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
