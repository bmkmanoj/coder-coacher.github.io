to be taking a look at meteor Jas
okay so meteor Jas is a full-stack
JavaScript framework and it uses a
collection of libraries and packages
that are neatly bound together to give
us the ability to quickly prototype an
app but also build powerful production
applications now there's a ton of
JavaScript frameworks out there many of
which I've done videos on but I think
what separates meteor from a lot of the
other frameworks such as angular is that
it runs on both the front end and the
back end all right and not only that it
uses the same API in the front end in
the back end
meteor can be used for web applications
as well as mobile apps all right so
another big difference that meteor has
is that it uses subscriptions as opposed
to requests and response
all right so most frameworks will make a
request to a resource and then send back
a response well with meteor users will
subscribe to certain events on the
server through a WebSocket and the
socket constantly serves the subscribers
whether it's rendering a template or
fetching data whatever it may be and
this makes it very fast and it also
makes it instant okay so meteor uses
MongoDB and as far as I know that's the
only database that it you all right but
what's really cool is that you have
access to the database from everywhere
on the front end and the back end all
right it's on the server of course and
then it's also runs in the browser in
something called mini Mongo all right
and meteor somehow magically keeps these
in sync all right you can access data
using your client console just as you
would on the server alright so if you're
in Chrome you open up Chrome tools go on
the console and you can just run queries
from there when your application needs
to change or display data that all
happens asynchronously on the client
first and then those changes are sent to
the server and that's called latency
compensation all right and we'll take a
look at this
so data is stored in MongoDB collections
and if you are not familiar with no SQL
databases and collections it's basically
a table a collection is kind of like a
table and honor in a relational database
alright so if it's a blog you may have a
post collection in a categories
collection this is the primary
persistence mechanism of the data in
media and you can see to create a
collection is really easy we're just
saying to do is equals new manga
collection and then whatever you want to
name it to do is okay when this runs it
does two different things on the server
it does what you would expect it just
creates a MongoDB collection and an
interface to that collection when it
runs on the client it creates a
collection but that is a client-side
cache of the MongoDB database and this
is achieved using the mini Mongo library
and what mini Mongo is is an
implementation of the MongoDB API and
this is all held in memory all right so
this is what the server basically
consists of okay it's an ojs app with
certain libraries that communicate with
the front end over DDP and a Jason kdd P
stands for distributed data protocol
which is a simple protocol for fetching
structured data from a server alright
and it receives live updates when that
data changes and then a Jason is just an
extension of Jason which with some
additional data types ok it also uses
the Kinect Kinect module which is an
HTTP library for request and response it
uses the Mongo driver which is just a
simple Mongo interface driver it uses
live query which streams out Mongo data
reactively and then it also uses fibers
and fixtures which is a wrapper library
for nodejs and makes it synchronous now
if all this sounds like absolute
gibberish to you don't worry about it I
just want to explain how it works this
isn't real
it's not the most important thing for
you to know I know that you're probably
here to learn how to how to create a mom
a media application and we're going to
get to that I just want to kind of let
you know how it works all right so let's
take a look at what the client side
consists of of the browser now a lot of
the code uses jQuery and underscore J s
as the foundation we have tracker which
provides reactivity on the front end
okay space bars which is the template
library that's used in the front end and
this is how we can insert dynamic data
into our application all right right
into the HTML and the view it's extended
from handlebars so if you know
handlebars then you shouldn't have any
problems with space bars which is easy
to learn anyway blaze is a reactive
library that uses tracker and space bars
to create a live updating user interface
all right mini Mongo which we've talked
about that's the client-side MongoDB
library which syncs up to the server and
then sessions which this is a library to
handle reactive user interface state
variables alright again this this stuff
here isn't really you don't need to
master it to to be able to build a
meteor app alright just kind of want to
go over what it is all right and like
with any good framework we have a
package manager okay meteor has its own
package manager that is used to install
small libraries or add-ons that can
bring in new functionality all right and
this can range from from anything from
authentication and authorization to
routing to social functionality and
pretty much anything you can think of
all right and atmosphere is a really
popular package repository that we'll be
using all right so we'll get into that
later on but for now we're going to
stick to just the core core meteor
functionality all right so enough with
this boring slide stuff let's go ahead
and jump in and just you know install
meteor and see where it takes us all
right so let's go ahead and get
ATR installed now meteor can run on
pretty much any platform out there
Windows Linux Mac I'm using Windows here
so what we're going to do is go to
meteor comm and click on install meteor
alright now if you were using Mac or
Linux you would install it using curl
and you can you can also use curl in
Windows but there is a Windows installer
that we can use that's that's a lot
easier so let's click on that and
download it alright so install meteor
exe let's open that up ok it's going to
take us through a little wizard here and
I will be pausing the video through you
know if it's taking a while so if it
seems like mine is a lot faster than
yours that's why alright so now it's
asking us if we want to create a meteor
developer account alright now I would if
you plan on using meteor a lot I would
suggest doing it because you can
actually deploy apps with their free
service so I think I have an existing
account but I'm not sure what what
password I used or anything like that so
I'm just going to create a new one here
so just going to put in one of my email
addresses ok user name I'll say just
password all right
okay meteor is now installed on your
computer open a new command prompt and
type meteor if you're running Windows
you may need to restart your machine so
let's go ahead and open up a command
line okay I'm going to run as
administrator and you want to go to
whatever the folder where you hold your
projects alright so I'm going to go into
my projects folder alright now when you
create a new media application it'll
create the folder for you alright so you
don't want to actually manually create
the project folder alright so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say meteor
create and just going to call this task
list okay and that's going to go through
and create all the folders and files for
us alright and if I go to sublime text
and let me add that folder to as a
project
let's see task list okay so if we look
over here we have a folder called meteor
this this holds like everything all the
media stuff MongoDB all that crap that
you don't need to touch alright so don't
even pay attention to that what it does
is it gives you an HTML file CSS file
and a JavaScript all named whatever you
called your application all right now if
we look at the HTML it gives us a little
sample app and I guess we can run that
just to show you all right now it says
to run your app go into task list and
type in meteor all right so let's go to
task list and meteor okay so see it's we
need to allow access through the
firewall and now it says what does it
say okay looks like it's still going
alright you can see what it did started
proxy started MongoDB started your app
okay and now it's at localhost port 3000
so let's go there alright so this is the
sample app that they give you by default
and it's not much it doesn't look like
much basically we have a button if we
click it it's going to increase this
number by one all right and if we reload
it goes back to zero
so let's take a look at the code that
runs this all right so the HTML here you
can see we just have an HTML document
inside of our body we have an h1 and
then we have this thing here alright so
this is using the space bar syntax which
is very similar to handlebars if you've
ever used that all right so it's just a
way of using dynamic content in our view
in our HTML all right so what we're
doing we have this greater than sign
here this is telling it that we want to
render this template ok so a template
named hello and if you look down here we
have a template tag with the name
attribute of hello okay so it's going to
render this right
here now inside the render inside the
hello template we have a button and then
we have a paragraph but in the paragraph
you can see we have this counter
variable okay and we're using space bars
so this counter is coming from if we
look in the JavaScript we have this
right here template hello helpers that
counter is coming from here okay so
we're returning something here which is
session get duck counter okay so there's
a variable set inside of the session
called counter and that's what it's
returning now right here you can see we
have template dot hello dot events so
templates can have helpers which are
just functions and then events okay in
this particular event is going to be a
click event and it's going to be on a
button okay and then it runs this
function and what it's doing is its
setting that counter okay it's setting
it to whatever the counter is plus one
okay that's why every time we click it
it adds a new one all right so just
remember that that templates have
helpers which are just functions they
also can have events and if we look up
here we have session dot set default
counter zero so we're setting the the
counter to zero right here all right now
as I've said media runs on the client
and server now in this particular case
we're using one file and we have server
and client code in the same file and if
you do that you can use this right here
if meteor dot is client and then
anything that's inside of this is only
going to run on the client all right and
then down here we have meteor dot is
server anything that's in here is going
to run only on the server anything
outside of these is going to run on both
okay so just remember that normally if
you have if you're building a real
application you'll have a folder called
client or whatever you want to call it
which will hold all the client stuff and
then a folder called server that will
hold all the server stuff all right but
most of your dynamic functionality is
going to run on both okay
things like the collection and queries
things like that all right so what I
want to do now is just get rid of this
altogether all right so everything
inside is client let's get rid of okay
and then everything in is server okay so
what I want to do is create a collection
called tasks all right
so up here we're going to say tasks now
this code needs to be run on both so you
don't want to have it inside either of
these so we're going to say tasks equals
new Mongo dot collection tasks and
before I even type anything in here in
our code I just want to show you that we
can access the collection from the
browser from the client all right just
by having this so we save that and
actually let's go to the HTML and let's
get rid of this for now actually know
what we'll do is let's put right here I
guess we can call the template to do's
and then we'll change that to two do's
and for now I'm just going to get rid of
this alright so let's go ahead and save
that and reload okay so we still have
the h1 that's that's fine now remember
we created that task collection so what
I'm going to do is go down here and
we're going to say tasks ok whatever you
name your collection dot find and then
dot fetch all right and it's going to
return whatever we have in the task
collection which of course is nothing
but you can see it gives us an empty
array alright now we can actually add
tasks from here so let's say tasks task
dot insert
all right and we're going to pass in
some curly braces here and we'll have a
name for the task alright in this case
let's just call it task one and then we
can have a date so let's call this field
created at so we'll say created at and
then we can actually say new date ok we
can run the date function which will
give us right now
all right and we'll run that now you can
see it gave us back this ID all right so
let's run that again the fetch method
and it gives us back an object which has
a nun ID it has a created at and it has
our name task 1 all right so you can
actually create tasks from right inside
the browser all right let's run it one
more time will create one more task I'll
call it task - ok and now if we fetch
now we have two objects ok two tasks so
this right here is an example of what
sets meteor aside from a lot of those
other J's frameworks now if we want to
display these in the browser we can
we'll go to our JavaScript file and we
know that we now have a template called
tasks so let's say template template dot
tasks is that what I called all I called
it - duze oh that's wrong let's call it
tasks
okay so template.dot tasks dot helpers
all right and then let's say tasks is
going to be a function and what we want
to do is return tasks dot find all right
and then in here let's just pass in
empty curly braces and then we can also
sort so let's say sort I mean another
set of curly braces and we'll sort it by
created at so sort it by the time and
we're going to say negative one okay and
let's save that alright so this is going
to give us all of our tasks now to
actually get this and iterate through it
we're going to go to our HTML right in
here and we're going to use our space
bars and we're going to use in each loop
okay so you want to go each and then
tasks okay so this here is this okay and
we know that this is returning an array
of tasks so we want to iterate through
it using each and will end the each like
this alright now in between here
actually know what I'm going to do is
create a ul okay and inside here we'll
have list items
all right and let's output the names all
right so let's save that and reload and
there we go there's our tasks all right
and it's persisted to our Mongo database
so we can still add them down here let's
say we want to add three and it
automatically gets added all right if I
reload it's still there because it was
persisted into the collection in on the
server and MongoDB now what if we want
to be able to add tasks from our
application which is probably what you
want you probably don't want your users
to have to open up a console and add
them all right so what we'll do is let's
say add tasks and down here we're going
to have an h3 that just says tasks ok
and then we'll put a simple form here
okay I realized that this isn't going to
look too good I don't really care about
the design and what it looks like I just
want you guys to grasp the functionality
and then you can go and add bootstrap or
whatever you want to do with it all
right so let's see in our form what are
we going to need we're going to need
let's put a label and it'll say task
name all right and then we'll have an
input type will be 'text name is going
to be name and let's we can put a
placeholder I'll just say add task all
right now I actually don't want to put
this here I want to put this inside of
tasks all right so I'm going to grab the
form you know what let's let's grab
everything that's here and put that in
okay we'll just cut that
all right just fix this a little bit
all right so we have our form we have an
input now we need a button all right
so we'll say input type is going to be
submit okay value submit all right so
let's take a look at that all right so
we have our little form here now what
we're going to want to do is make the
submission the submission for this form
and event so let's take this form and
let's give it a class of add tasks all
right now what we'll do is go back into
our java script and instead of in our
helpers we're going to need to set up
our events so template.dot tasks dot
events okay so the way that we're going
to set this up is we need the actual
event which is going to be a submit and
then we need the element which is going
to be add task alright so then we'll run
a function okay I'm going to pass in an
event parameter here and then what we'll
do is create a variable called name and
we're going to set this to event dot
target dot name dot value okay and that
will give us whatever we put in the form
and just to test this out let's do
console dot log name
okay so we'll reload alright and we'll
say test submit and oh you can see that
it did flash down there what we're going
to want to do is return false all right
so let's see we're going to go down here
and return
balls all right so now we'll try that
again test submit and now we get test
down here so we know that this is now
calling this event all right so let's
get rid of that so what we want to do
with this is we want to submit it to our
collection
all right so to do that we can say tasks
dot insert all right and then in here
we're going to do the same thing that we
did from within the console earlier all
right we'll say name and that's going to
be name it's also going to have created
at and that's going to be new date all
right and then we just want to clear the
form so we'll grab this and we're going
to set it to nothing all right and that
should do it so let's save that and
we'll refresh the page
all right and let's say task four and
there we go
task 5 I can reload and it should be
persisted all right now what if we want
to delete one from here all right so to
do that let's go to right next to the
name here and we're going to put in a
span we'll give it a class of delete
tasks all right
actually no let's this will be an a tag
so a class delete task and let's put an
ending a tag and let's actually put an H
ref just not going to go anywhere though
and then I'm just going to put an X in
here
all right so we'll save that alright so
now we have these X links okay so it's
delete tasks so we want to create an
event in here
okay so where this ends we want to put a
comma all right and then let's just put
in click and dot delete task okay that's
going to run a function pass in event
okay at the bottom we want to return
false and let's do a little confirmation
okay so we're going to say if confirm
and then this will say
delete tasks and then all we have to do
here is say tasks dot remove and then we
can pass in this dot underscore ID all
right so let's give that a shot all
right now if I click task 5x delete task
ok and it goes away ok it's as easy as
that if I reload we still only have
three now chances are if you're building
an application and you're able to add or
remove data from a database you don't
want just anybody to be able to come to
the app and do that all right so we can
easily implement some authentication
here our user accounts in meteor all
right we can do that with a simple
package so let's go back to our command
line all right I'm going to ctrl C and
just get out of everything all right and
what we're going to do here is we're
going to say meteor add and then you can
add your packages all right so we want
one called accounts UI and we also want
one to call it accounts password ok just
like that so we'll run that
alright guys that took quite a while to
about five minutes or so for some reason
I don't know if yours is going to take
that long or not but once it's done you
should see this screen and your command
line okay so what I want to do now is
now that we have those installed we're
going to go back to our HTML and we just
want to put in a simple placeholder for
our login all right so I'm going to go
actually that server's not running I'm
going to go right above the heading here
and what we're going to do is going to
use our double unjust on curly braces
and then a greater than and then what we
want to put in here is login buttons
alright just like that so we'll save
that and now let's go ahead and run the
app
all right so that should now be running
and now you can see above everything we
have this sign in if we click that we
have this little email password input we
also have a create account link right
here okay so we obviously don't have an
account so let's go ahead and create one
and we'll put in our email password
create account and once we create the
account we're actually logged in okay if
we click that we could change our
password and we can sign out all right
so that is extremely simple to setup
just our basic authentication now we
have the authentication but it's not
actually stopping us from doing anything
all right if we sign out we can still
add a task which we don't want so first
thing we're going to do is when we
insert a task here we're going to want
to have our user ID as part of the
object alright so let's say user ID and
we're going to set that to meteor meteor
dot user ID which is a function alright
just like that so we'll save that let's
go to the form where we have the form
and we're going to put in an if
statement here okay so we want our
double curly braces and we're going to
say if current user okay and then we
want to end that after the form all
right so let's see what that does
all right so now the forms not there
actually let's we don't want the heading
to show actually you know what we could
do is let's put an else and if they're
not logged in whips we'll put a
paragraph will say please log in to add
tasks
all right now we also don't want them to
be able to delete tasks either so we're
going to do that same thing down here
okay we'll put that and then we'll end
it here all right so now this task this
application is completely read-only if
we're not logged in alright so let's try
logging in and now you can see we have
our form back and we can delete all
right so that's how we can add very very
simple authentication now even though we
have authentication to show certain
elements it this still isn't secure this
isn't ready for production because the
way we have it is that anything in the
database on the server can be messed
with by the client alright and we don't
want that we want to specifically
subscribe to certain stuff on the server
now when we deploy when we set up an
application like we have there's
something there's a package called
insecure that it uses and the reason
that it's set to true when you first
create an app is to just to be able to
quickly prototype it to not have any
boundaries and be able to do whatever
you want from the client from the server
but when you're ready for production
you're going to want to remove that
package and then you're going to want to
use what are called methods media
methods and it's just a more secure way
to run your your functionality or your
queries or whatever it is that your app
does alright so what we're going to do
is go into the command line and I'm
going to stop this from running and then
we're going to say media remove insecure
ok that will remove that package all
right now we'll go ahead and run meteor
all right let's go back reload okay now
we're still logged in if I click the X
you'll see that it's not it's not
deleting anymore all right and if I try
to add it's not letting us if you look
down here we have removed field access
denied all right so let's go back to our
javascript file and we're going to go
all the way to the bottom outside of the
client or server code all right and
we're going to say meteor dot methods
all right and then we're going to open
up curly braces inside there and let's
think about the functionality that we
want to have as a method so in our
application the two main things we can
do is add a task and delete a task all
right so let's do one for add task
okay so we'll call it add task it's
going to be a function okay it's going
to get passed in a name and what we want
to do here is we want to check for the
user so we're going to say if there's no
meteor dot user ID then they're not
they're not going to be allowed to run
this add task function okay so we'll
just we'll throw new meteor dot error
and then you can put whatever text you
want we'll just say no access all right
so that'll at least check to see if the
user is logged in so we're going to want
to grab this the insert and I'm just
going to copy it for now and then we'll
put that right under the if statement
all right so add task is going to check
to see if we're logged in if we're
authorized and then it's going to run
the insert okay
so underneath that we're going to have
our delete task okay and that's going to
do where is it this right here task
remove all right so we'll just grab that
copy it for now all right now this
delete we're not going to be able to use
this anymore so we're going to be
passing in a task ID and then we'll put
it right there
task ID so to run this add task we're
going to replace this right here and
what we can do is say meteor dot call
okay it's going to take in two things
it's going to take in what we want to
run which is add tasks and the second is
what we want to pass in and that's going
to be the name okay which is coming from
here and you can see it's being passed
in here and then that's being inserted
along with the date and the user ID if
you had more fields in your tasks you
would be sued add more into the
parameters all right and then same thing
for the remove or the delete we're going
to replace that with meteor call
delete tasks and we're going to pass in
what was I think it was this actually
let me just check this dot underscore ID
just like that okay and that's being
passed in as the task ID now not only is
using methods more secure but it also
allows you to keep all your functions in
one place which is a lot easier than
have them scattered everywhere
alright now if you were building a
production application you would have a
different file structure you would have
a client folder for your client code a
server folder and probably a methods
file a file that's dedicated to your
methods all right and not in this in
this mini-course or whatever you want to
call it I'm not going to be doing that
but I will be doing a more in-depth
application with meteor very soon
alright so we'll look into that for for
another time alright so let's make sure
that this is saved and we'll go back and
reload and now if we go and delete now
we're able to delete and we'll say task
four and we can add okay so our
application is more secure now now there
is something else that we need to do now
and if you remember back when we when I
started this video I talked about
subscriptions okay and how media works
on subscribers instead of request and
response well right now we're still in
the prototyping stage we're getting
there but we still have auto publish on
and that's going to make it so that no
matter what when we add something to our
database it's going to it's going to
automatically published and everyone can
see it
alright now we will if we're going to
create a production application we don't
want auto publish on what we want to do
is remove it first of all and then we
need to create our subscriptions to let
the application know what the user is
able to see or
not all right so let's go back to our
command line and we're going to stop
this and we're going to say a meteor
remove photo publish
okay so now let's go back and run meteor
okay so let's go and reload
and now you can see that we can't see
any tasks anymore
all right there they're still in the
database but the way we have our
application now we're not subscribed to
see the tasks
all right so even if I say if I had
another one we'll say my tasks and
submit I mean it did submit but we can't
see it because we're not subscribed to
it okay so we need to do some stuff so
in our JavaScript we're actually going
to now need to be in the is server all
right because we're going to call our
publish function from there so we want
to be inside here and then we're going
to say mediated we're going to say
meteor dot publish okay we want to
publish tasks and then the second
parameter is going to be a function and
then what we want to do is return tasks
dot find all right just like that
so that'll publish them but it's only
the parts of the application that are
subscribed to it are actually going to
be able to see the tasks all right so we
want to go up here back into the client
and let's say meteor dot subscribe and
we want to subscribe to tasks okay
so let's save that and hopefully that
works
all right good so now we can see our
tasks again you can see this is the one
that I actually added when we couldn't
see them if I try to delete okay we can
also delete them if I try to add we can
also add them all right so now we're
subscribed to tasks now I want to try
something and we're going to sign out
okay we can't access anything now let's
create another account
okay so we'll say create account and
we'll just say I don't know John at
gmail okay and then password create
account okay so now we just created a
new account as John and we logged in and
you can see that we can see all of our
tasks all the tasks that were created by
Brad's account and I can go ahead and
delete them all right and that's not
really what we want you don't want
people to be able to touch your stuff
okay we want Brad to have his own task
list and then John to have his own and
anyone else who registered for this
application now if you remember we have
a filled in in each task for the user ID
so down here I'm just going to say tasks
dot find dot fetch ok so we have our
objects here and actually I don't think
the first two have the ID or wait a
minute none of them do
we have ID created that name let me just
check this real quick okay we should
have user ID as well all right so you
know what I'm going to do is just delete
all of these
okay so now it's empty so let's add
another one we'll say my task I'll
actually let's say what are we John will
say John's task one submit okay so now
let's find okay so now we have our user
ID right here so let's create another
one for John okay so each one of these
has John's user ID so we're we're
publishing the task which is in the
server which is right here inside it is
find let's add some curly braces and
we're going to say user ID and that
should equal this dot user ID actually
now just like that okay and let's save
that
okay so this is exactly right we're John
we see John's tasks now let's go ahead
and sign out and let's log in as Brad
okay so we're now logged in as Brad and
you can see we have no tasks so let's
say Brad's tasks one
Brad's tasks - okay so we're only seeing
our own tasks which is what we want so
let's check again make sure John can't
see those and there we go so we're only
seeing our own tasks all right so I
think I'm going to end it here we
covered all the basically all the
fundamentals of meteor j/s and hopefully
you guys liked it you'll learn something
from it I apologize it did get to go a
little longer than I had planned but
yeah so that's it please subscribe leave
it a like if you liked it and thanks for
