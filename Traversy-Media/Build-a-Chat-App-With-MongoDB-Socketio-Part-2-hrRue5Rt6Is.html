DB socket IO chat application video or
videos I should say now what we're going
to do here is we're going to build the
client we're going to build an HTML file
that's able to connect to the server and
we'll be able to send chats and get the
status back and all that now there is
there's two very small errors in the
server J's file that we created so let
me just show you those before we move on
so one where we said client dot on
connection here this connects to socket
IO then we move on to do everything we
actually need to pass in socket right
here okay because it's going to throw an
error because it's not going to know
what this is you know where we use
socket dot e mint so make sure that you
put that in there and then the second
error is right here I actually put 3 R's
okay so if you've been following along
you probably notice that a while ago but
if you did for some reason copy that
just go ahead and get rid of that extra
R all right so now this has been fully
tested I know that this the server-side
actually works so what I'm going to do
now is create an index dot HTML file
this can be actually be created anywhere
because we're just going to connect to
our external server it's not really
integrated so what we're going to do is
just create our basic HTML structure I'm
using Emmet which is a visual studio
code plug-in it's also available for
atom and sublime text but I can just do
exclamation tab and it's going to give
me a basic HTML layout all right so
let's go ahead and change the title to
Mongo chat I'm also going to use
bootstrap 4 so I'm going to just do a
search for a bootstrap for CDN and click
this first link here and grab the CDN
for the CSS file which is this link
right here and we'll just go ahead and
paste that in alright and I'm just going
to wrap this so you guys can see
everything toggle word wrap alright so
there's the head area now we're going to
do is build out the UI which is going to
be very
simple let's create a div with the class
of container we're also going to have a
div with the class of row oops okay
because we're going to use the grid
system and then our column div we're
going to say div class we're going to do
call MD six and that's going to put it
into a six column div but I want it to
be pushed into the middle so we're going
to set an offset
- MD - three okay and then for small
screens we're going to say call SM 12
because we just want a single 12 column
div on small screens so that it's
responsive okay and then in here let's
go ahead and put an h1 and I'm going to
give it a class of text center and then
we'll just say Mongo chat alright so
let's go ahead and open up the index
file I'm just going to open it up on my
filesystem
okay so it should look like that now
we're also going to have the Clear
button in the heading so let's go right
here and put in a button I'm going to
give it a class of BTN also a class of
BTN danger like that and then I'm also
going to give it an ID because we're
going to need to grab onto that later so
let's give it an ID of clear I guess
okay now I do have the code from the
MongoDB course in front of me but I am
changing up a few things to make it a
little more I guess make the code a
little bit better so next thing we're
going to need is the status div right
below the h1 so we're going to have a
div with the class of status and that's
going to be empty by default and then
under that we're going to have a div
with the ID of chat okay and then this
is where we're going to put our username
in put the chat output as well as the
message input so let's start off with
the username input okay so type text and
let's give this an ID name or I guess
we'll give it an idea of user name
and let's give it a bootstrap class of
form control and we're going to give it
a placeholder and we'll just say enter
name all right take a look at that oh we
forgot the text in the clear button all
right
so underneath sorry about that
underneath the input let's go ahead and
put a div and we're going to give it a
class of card oops
which is a bootstrap for class we also
want a div with the class of card block
okay and then let's see we also want
card block that div is also going to
have an ID of messages because that's
where we're going to output the messages
let's put a line break to right above
the card and then right below the card
we'll put another line break and then
we're going to have our text area say we
don't need all this stuff
we do need an ID and I'm just going to
give it an ID of text area let's give it
a class of form control okay we're also
going to give it a place holder of we'll
say enter message all right let's take a
look at that good now I want the the
card to be bigger so what I'm going to
do is just put in a script tag up here
another script I'm sorry style tag
all right and we're just going to say
the ID of messages messages let's set
the height to 300 pixels okay so there's
our interface now we need to move on to
the client-side JavaScript so we're
going to go down right above the body
tag first thing we're going to want to
do is is include socket IO we need that
library to work with so let's say source
equals and let's go ahead and just do a
quick search for socket IO CDN and let's
grab this first one here put that right
in there and then we'll create our
script tags all right so what we're
going to do is we're going to put
everything inside of a function so let's
put some parentheses and then here we're
going to say function and everything we
do will go in here now in order for this
to run we need to put another set of
parentheses right here at the bottom
okay and then what we're going to do is
I'm going to write a custom function
called element two to select all of the
things we need to select so let's create
a variable called element I'm going to
set that equal to a function okay and
that function is going to take in an ID
and then we're just going to return
document dot get element by ID and pass
in the ID this way we don't have to keep
reusing get element by ID okay you don't
have to do this it's just kind of a
shortcut I guess so let's say get
elements so first thing we'll get is the
status so let's create a variable called
status now instead of doing document dot
get element by D and all that we can
just say element and we can pass in
status
alright let me just make sure we have
that it's a class you need to change
that to an ID okay so that gets the
status element now let's get I'm just
going to paste in a few more of these so
we need status we need messages okay so
we want to get the element with the ID
of messages which is let's make sure we
have it this right here okay which is
this this is where all the messages will
be output from the server we also want
the text area okay remember I gave it an
idea of text area we want the username
which has an idea of user name make sure
that that's there yep and then we also
want the Clear button I think that had
an idea clear yeah all right so that
gets all the elements now we want to
deal with the status so let's say set
default status because we want to be
able to get statuses from the server for
instance if we look at right here we're
sending the status to the client it's an
object with message message sent and
then a clear value initially we want the
status to be blank
okay so let's set say status default and
we're going to set it to status element
and then text content okay so we're just
saying whatever is in here is the status
okay which by default is nothing and
then we're going to create a function
called set status so set that to a
function okay and that's going to get
passed in a value we'll just call it s
and then say set status so we want to
set the status to whatever is passed in
or the status text content to whatever
passed in yes okay so for instance when
this is called from the server
it was the status will get turned to
this object and then what we want to do
is a couple seconds later we want to
clear that status out okay because we
want it for instance to say message sent
but we want that to clear out so what
we'll do is we'll say if the if the s
value is not equal to the status default
if it's not equal to the status default
then we want to just clear it out for
seconds later so we'll create a variable
called delay and we'll set that to set
timeout step timeout and set timeout is
going to take in a function and we're
just going to set it back to default so
we'll say set status okay which is a
function we created right here okay
we're actually in it so set status and
we want to set it to status default and
we want that to happen
four seconds later so this set timeout
function right here takes a parameter of
milliseconds so we're going to say 4,000
all right so hopefully this makes sense
I know it's a little confusing
basically we're if we get us we get a
status sent from the server four seconds
later we want to we want to basically
wipe it out and go back to the default
all right so that is all of our
variables and functions and stuff now
we're going to work with socket IO okay
with the library so let's go under C
we're going to go right here and let's
say connect to server'
or we'll say connect to socket dot IO so
we're going to create a variable here
called socket we're going to set it to
IO dot connect now we can access this IO
object because we brought in socket IO
up here okay so if you make sure that
you brought that in our wall
now in here we need the address of our
server which is going to be on our
localhost so 127.0.0.1 and remember it's
4000 if we look at server j s we used
port 4000 right here so that's what we
need to connect to all right now once we
do that let's go ahead and check for
connection so say if if socket is not
equal to undefined then that means
everything is good so let's just do a
console dot log and I'll say connected
to I will just say connected to socket
now we're going to need to run our
server so let's go to server J s and to
open up our terminal from NPM start ok
and then over here let's reload our
index file and open up our console here
and we get connected to socket all right
so so far so good
hopefully I haven't lost you guys yet
I'm just going to make that smaller I'm
going to leave the server running and
then actually no I'm not actually I am
so what we want to do is if everything
is good and we're actually connected we
want to basically get the output we want
to get the chats and if we look at our
server we're looking at output which is
right here ok so from our server we're
emitting the output and it's the result
from this query ok so that's what we
want to fetch on to ok so to do that
we're going to say socket dot on and we
want to say dot on output so that's
going to allow us to hook into this emit
right here called
output ok we could have just as well
called this something else if we wanted
to and then put it here but we called it
output now we need to
function here and we can actually get
the data that's being sent from the
server so the response right here that's
being sent as this data so what we'll do
just for shits and giggles let's just
console.log the data
okay so reload and we get just an empty
array okay because there is actually no
chats in the in the collection now just
as a kind of a side thing here let's go
ahead and open up our Mongo shell so you
guys don't have to do this I just want
to give you to show you that you can do
this so I'm going to go to my MongoDB
bin directory and I'm going to just open
up a command line there bring this down
and I'm just going to say Mongo
you know what for some reason get bash
doesn't work with that so I'm going to
just go to my standard Windows command
line I can fix it but I'm not going to
go through it right now so I'm just
going to navigate to MongoDB slash bin
bin Mongo alright so now we're in the
Mongo shell to clear this out and let's
say show DBS okay so you see we have the
Mongo chat database there and that was
created because we just we created it
right here
okay so just by running connect into
Mongo chat that created it so let's go
ahead and insert a chat I mess up a chat
so we'll say use let's say use Mongo
chat and then we'll say DB dot and then
the collection which is going to be
chats dot insert okay and then each chat
is going to have what is the name same
name
Brad and let's say message hello all
right so that insert is a chat let's go
back over here and reload and now if you
look down here
there it is named Brad message hello so
that's pretty damn cool I just wanted to
show you guys that but of course you
know you don't have to follow along and
do all that but let's go ahead and add
one more I will just say hello there
and we'll change the name to say Mike
all right so now if I reload over here
we look in the console we now have two
objects so let's go ahead and exit the
Mongo shell and then we're going to take
the response that's being sent from our
server and put it into the chat with the
messages window here so let's go back
down I mean let's go back to index.html
we'll just comment out the console log
just in case you want to use that again
and then we're going to just check to
make sure that there is some chats so if
data dot length and then we just want to
do a loop here okay so we're going to
loop through we're going to say for var
let's call it X and then we'll say as
long as X is less than data dot length
then we want to X plus plus we want to
increment by 1 and then what we're going
to do here is we're going to actually
build out we're going to use Java
knowledge JavaScript to build out the
div or the div to to display the name
and the chat and the message so let's
put a comment here we'll say build out
message div so for that we're going to
save our message and we're going to set
it to document dot create element we're
going to say create element and we want
to create a div
okay and if you guys are new to
JavaScript this this is a really good
thing to learn to actually create Dom
elements from within JavaScript so we
created a div now we want to do is we
want to set an attribute so we're going
to take that message variable which is
our new div and we're going to say set
attribute and I'm going to give it an
attribute which is going to be a class
okay it's going to be a class and we're
going to call it chat message chat -
message all right now we want to do is
add the content so we're going to say
message dot text content and we're going
to set it to data and we want the
current iteration so the current message
so we need to put in our X here and then
the name alright and then let's go ahead
and just concatenate a colon and put a
colon here and then a space and then
over here we want the message so data
current iteration message okay and then
let's go under that and let's say
messages dot append child and in here
we're going to just pass in message okay
and then we have one more line here
which is going to be messages dot insert
before insert before the message and
then we want messages dot first child
okay and that will take care of
inserting the message so let's go ahead
and save that reload and this should
actually be var x equals zero there we
go
alright so you can see that what
happened was it fetched the output and
we're looping through the output and for
each message or each chat we're building
out a div we're building out visited
here and if we look at through the
selector here you'll see it's a
with the class of chat message we
applied that chat message class with
this set attribute all right and then we
want it to insert before the message
that's already there so we want the the
most recent chat to be on top okay so
that takes care of the output now let's
take care of getting the status from the
server okay so we're going to go let's
see let me actually just put a comment
right here we'll say
handle outputs okay that ends right
there and then let's do get status from
server so again if we look at our server
server j/s we have or is it right here
omits status so that's what we're going
to hook into here so to do that we're
going to say socket dot on status all
right so so socket dot on status and
function and then we want to grab the
data which is basically just the status
and say get message status so remember
we have that function we created called
set status can't type so that would be
this right here set status and let's see
we're going to pass in here set status
and we're going to say type of data is
equal to an object so this should be an
object okay and then we're going to use
a shorthand ternary operator I can never
say that right and we're going to say
data dot message if there is one else
data all right
and then what we'll do under the set
status is we're going to check to see if
it should clear so we'll say if status
is clear clear text so we'll just do a
simple if statement here and we'll say
if data dot clear then we want to just
set the text area dot value equal to
nothing all right now this data clear if
we look at server j/s when we're sending
our status right here so this would
actually be after the input which we
haven't done yet but it will send clear
true if that's true then we just want to
clear the text area value here okay but
I probably should have did this after we
handle the input but whatever that's
fine so let's now handle the input all
right now I'm going to go right under
the status thing that we just did here
and let's say handle input so basically
we want we want an event for when we
start to type in the message and we hit
enter all right so what we'll do is
we'll say text area okay because
remember we we added text area as one of
the elements here so we're going to say
text area we're going to put an event
listener onto that and we want to listen
for key down okay so when we start
typing and then we're going to run a
function and that's going to take in an
event parameter and then basically what
we want to do is we need to we only want
this to happen we only want to submit to
our server when we hit the enter key
okay not just any key so we're going to
do a test here if we're going to say if
I would say if event dot which dot what
is it yeah if event dot which equals
triple equals 13 now the reason I'm
using 13 is because if we say key code
teen in JavaScript this is a
stackoverflow question keko keko 13 is
for which key and the answer is it's
return or enter okay so when the user
hits return or enter we want this to
happen now I'm going to put an extra
condition in here and we're going to say
yeah and event dot Shift key which is
another property we can access is equal
to false meaning that if they hit enter
and they're not holding shift while they
hit enter okay then we want to proceed
and what we want to do is we want to
emits to the server input and if we look
at our server j/s that would be right
here okay so we're hooking into this
input and we need to pass in our data
which is going to be the name in the
message so let's go ahead and do that so
say socket dot emits we want to emit to
the input and we want to pass in an
object this is going to be our data
which will be the name we can get that
from username dot value and then also
the message which will be what is a text
area text area dot value all right so
we're emitting to input and we're
sending our data and then the last thing
we're going to do is just prevent the
default behavior event dot prevent
default and save all right so let's
reload this will open up our console
make sure there's no going on and
let's go ahead and put in a name we'll
say Tom and we'll just say hi there we
go and we get our status right here
message sent should disappear in four
seconds and that's what is going on
right here
okay the status changed it displayed and
after four seconds we set it back to the
default so that way message sent doesn't
just sit there all right I hope I'm
explaining this clearly to you guys it's
kind of difficult you know it is kind of
difficult this definitely isn't
something for you know absolute
JavaScript beginners
all right so the last thing we want to
handle is clearing okay we want to be
able to clear all of our chats so let's
go under the event listener and let's
say handle chat clear alright so
remember we have our Clear button I
think it's clear BTN let me just make
sure yep clear BTN we're going to add an
event listener to that okay add event
listener we're going to listen for a
click when it's clicked it will run a
function okay and let's see all we want
to do is omit to the clear event on our
server which is right here and what
that's going to do is it's going to
remove all of our chats so let's go
ahead and say socket dot emits and we
want to emit to clear and that's it that
should clear it now we also want to so
you want to make sure the text clears
from here is wild so it's a clear
message and we'll say socket dot emits
I'm sorry socket dot on cleared because
if we look at our server we have right
here it's a mating cleared all right so
stalking it cleared and then function
and we just want to make sure that the
messages text content is going to be
equal to nothing all right so let's
reload and let's hit clear and
everything goes away cool try it one
more time we'll say Harry hello there
okay let's so let's copy the link here
let's open up another tab and let's say
John you can see Harry's messages there
we'll say how the hell are you Harry
there we go how the hell are you Harry
if we go over here you can see it's
displayed here as well so we now have a
very simple chat application on the
surface it is very very simple but you
can see it is I mean I wouldn't say
complicated hopefully I mean if I
explained it right it's not that
complicated if you guys get stuck on
anything you know leave it leave a
message or a comment you know message
comment whatever and I'll try to help
you out but hopefully it's clear I just
want to show you guys you know this is
one of my really popular videos build an
html5 website with a responsive layout
and I thought this was funny I just got
a comment that says could you please
mark could you please more clear videos
on web design and development and I said
could you please more clear when asking
a question like I don't know I think I
explained things pretty well especially
simple things like you know an html5
website and div tags so that I mean
that's just part of being a youtubers
you got to deal with people like that
you know they want you to be clear but
they're even less clear in their
questions so you know more 95% 96 7% you
guys are awesome but you know you do
have to deal with freaking morons
occasionally so thanks for watching guys
