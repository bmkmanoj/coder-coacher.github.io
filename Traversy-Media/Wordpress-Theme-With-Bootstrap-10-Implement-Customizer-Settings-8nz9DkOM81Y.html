last video for this series in the last
video we went ahead and created our
fields here in the theme customizer now
we want to do is implement them we want
them to actually make a difference in
our theme in our showcase so we're going
to go ahead and let's open up front page
dot PHP because that's where the
showcase is all right and we're going to
do the image last because that's the
most difficult it's not really that
difficult but it's more difficult than
just the text so let's start with the
heading so if we look at our HTML here
we just have static text so we want to
completely actually know what we'll do
is sit well copy it and then cut it out
all right and then we want to replace it
with PHP echo get theme mod alright and
then in here we want to paste in which
theme mod we want
so it would be showcase heading all
right now if we leave it as it is now
there's not going to be a default now I
realize that in our customizer file we
set a default right here or rather right
here but that's for the back end that is
for this right here to be filled in if
we want to default on the front end then
we just need to add that as a second
parameter so right here we're going to
paste what we cut what we cut out all
right so let's go ahead and save that
and if we reload we see the same thing
but let's do the test and see if it's
actually taking effect so we'll change
it to hello world all right and you can
see in our preview here it's changing
okay which is awesome now if we save it
and we go back to our front-end and
reload there we go okay so that's how
you can implement settings in the theme
customizer
all right I'm just going to put that
back okay so let's move on and do the
same thing with the text I'm just going
to copy what we have here and we'll
replace this and change this to showcase
text and whatever we had let me just
grab that
okay so that'll be the text and then we
want the button text and URL so first
thing we'll do href paste that in change
this to BTN URL default will just be
HTTP test comm and then we want the
button text as well
okay and just to show you the default
works let's say get started okay save it
and let's go to the front-end reload and
you can see it says get started okay now
for the last part it's going to be the
the background image so right now we
have in our style CSS the showcase class
so what we're going to want to do is
let's get rid of the background here
alright and save and then we're going to
go to our front page and we're going to
put us some style tags up in the head
area alright and this is where we're
going to take care of the image so we'll
say dot showcase and we'll put in
background URL alright and then in here
we're going to say PHP echo get theme
mod pass in showcase underscore image
alright and then we're going to need a
default here again so what we'll do is
we'll say get blog info we want the
template URL okay and then we're going
to just add slash image slash showcase
dot jpg okay make sure that we end the
PHP correctly
like that alright so let's go ahead and
save it and let's go to the front end
reload and as our image let's add our
centers to it though okay we're going to
add no-repeat and there we go alright
now the bigger test is to see if we can
actually switch it from the back end so
let's reload this now I have a test
image on my desktop so I'm going to
click Change image and let's upload a
showcase test and choose image ok it
uploaded here fine let's save it go to
the front-end and reload and there we go
so we know that we can now change the
showcase image if we want to go back we
can say remove and then default that
will bring it back save it
reload and there we go alright so our
website or our template or theme
whatever you want to call it is complete
ok we have all the correct functions we
have customization as always the series
took a little longer than I wanted to
but hopefully this gives you guys a
foundation and you can go and start
creating your own bootstrap or whatever
type of WordPress theme that you'd like
alright so thanks for watching I really
appreciate it and if you could subscribe
give it a like that'd be great and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
