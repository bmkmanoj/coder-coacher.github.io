we're gonna create a complete WordPress
website from scratch without even having
to write any code and the reason that I
want to do this is because I wanted
something practical to show you guys how
to build things really fast for your
clients and this is the type of work
that I started with when I was
freelancing so this is geared more
towards the beginner type of developer
that is freelancing that's building
websites for their own clients now
WordPress is great because it allows you
to have your clients update their their
own content so they can just log in and
and create a blog post or whatever they
don't have to bother you with it now
when we build this this website I'm
going to be using Photoshop a little bit
because I want to do everything kind of
how I would normally and we're gonna
create like this simple logo and this
this logo here and just add our own
images background images and stuff and
if you don't have Photoshop or you don't
want to do that part of it that's
absolutely fine I'm gonna include the
images in the description so you can
just grab them and upload them you don't
have to create them along with me
alright so we are using a premade theme
and if you do use a premade theme with
your clients I would highly suggest
telling them that and not passing it off
as your own design I think it's highly
unethical to do that what I used to do
is just give them a choice say you know
if it's if you want me to create a
custom design create the HTML create the
WordPress theme it's going to be about
four times as expensive and it's gonna
take twice as long and most of the time
they would choose the pre-made theme
because there's a very slim chance that
anyone is going to notice that it's a
pre-made theme so what we'll build is
this digital marketing company website I
called it market one labeled it after
the theme name which is called parallax
one and it's a free theme obviously and
we're going to create a couple pages
which I'll go into we have this main
area here which has kind of a parallax
effect and it's a little logo here we
have some social icons so if we hover
over these they'll change color some
marketing services
some font awesome icons and this is all
built into the theme we can actually go
into the customizer and edit these if we
want the About section our team so if we
hover over these we'll see their names
and positions testimonials with this
little area right here and then we have
some of our posts well actually there's
only one post but it shows down at the
bottom and we could scroll through them
if we had more than one and some contact
info so that's the basic homepage now
the about us and services page are very
very simple I mean if you guys want to
add images and stuff you can do that we
have the sidebar you can obviously
disable some of these widgets if you
want
same thing with services very simple and
then the blog page which is pretty nice
it as this little date overlay has the
featured image if we click on it takes
us to the post where we can have
comments and stuff and then we also have
a contact page that uses pirate forms
which is actually recommended with this
theme and this will be a work in contact
form and then once we're done building
this we're going to actually deploy it
to and I've already done it so we're
going to go it's going to be code code
demos comm and you can see that we have
it deployed and all the pages work okay
we can go into the backend oops
figured it would autocomplete so here's
our dashboard and this is a live site
now for deployment we're going simple
we're just going to use FTP with a
cPanel shared hosting account I'm not
gonna go into any special plugins or any
special WordPress cloud hosting or
anything like that this is this is
geared towards beginners so we're gonna
stick to the basics we are going to
however export our SQL and import it
through cPanel stuff like that but you
don't have to do that if you don't want
to at the end if you just want to do the
site and that's it that's fine too
alright so let's get started guys
hopefully you enjoy this this little
video here this project
and let's do it alright guys so now
we're going to set up our local
WordPress installation now there's a few
ways you can do this if you know about
WordPress you know it needs PHP to run
it needs MySQL and there's different
software suites you can use locally like
xampp WAMP WAMP basically any of the amp
stacks but what we're going to use is
this desktop server from server press
comm and it's basically xampp they
actually call it xampp light and then it
has this program that runs on top of it
called desktop server where you can
easily create WordPress installations
through a graphical user interface it's
kind of like those 1-click installs that
come with certain hosting packages and
it will it'll make it so that you can
easily remove or move your WordPress
installations you can create it without
having to manually create the database
it'll map a local domain it's really
it's actually really cool and it's
really easy to use so if we go to server
press calm and then download and by the
way you don't have to use this if you
want to use something else that's fine
this is just what I recommend and there
is a premium version will obviously be
using the free version I would never do
a video where you guys would have to buy
something to follow along but with the
premium version what I think is really
cool is that you can direct deploy to
your live server ok you can't do that
with the free one you'll have to do it
manually or through some other method
but we're going to go ahead and download
the free version so down here you just
have to put in your name and email and
agree and then free download and then
this should take us to a page where we
can choose our download package alright
so I'm on Mac so I would download the
latest version here I wouldn't suggest
getting the release candidate I'd get
the latest version whether you're on Mac
or Windows I already have it installed
so I'm not going to download and install
it it's basically just going through and
clicking next so it's it's nothing that
you really need to see me do all right
now once you have it installed you can
if you're on Windows it should be in
your C Drive I think it's in your C
Drive in your X
folder if I'm not mistaken if not it
might be in your Program Files but if
you aren't you could just search for it
but if you're on a Mac it's going to be
in your Applications folder and then in
the xampp folder you so you actually get
an ex amp folder and you have the
control panel you have the htdocs it's
basically xampp light and you have this
desktop server program that's what we
want that's what we want to run so let's
open that up since of automatic it's
going to ask to restart with privileges
and then we're just going to put our
password in okay so from here it's going
to ask if we want to create a new
development website okay so we can also
stop or restart services we can remove
our or copy existing websites there's
also this sites button here if I click
it it's going to open up this page here
where basically it has a list of all all
of our websites and you'll see I have my
development one here and I can visit the
website the dashboard or the database
itself okay so it's it's a pretty cool
interface so we're going to say create
new development website and click Next
and then you want to name it okay it'll
actually map a local domain so I'm just
going to call this wwm market one and
it's going to be dev CC and this doesn't
even have to be WordPress you could do a
custom PHP blank Outlook application if
you wanted and then the site root is
actually going to be in your Documents
folder in websites and then in the
domain name or you could change it if
you want which is really cool because
you don't have to actually have it in
your htdocs folder so let's click create
it's going to create the source folder
it's going to map the virtual host and
server name it's going to create the
database so we don't have to go into PHP
myadmin and create the database or into
the shell or anything like that and it's
done so let's click Next and now it
shows us our admin URL if I click Next I
think yeah so if I click Next it's going
to go back to the start screen what I'm
going to do is just close this and then
I'm gonna go to the
I could have clicked on that link but
I'm just going to go to not you to me
obviously
well what do they call it market one
market one dot dev dot CC and it's going
to automatically take us to the admin
because we need to finish up the install
so let's click continue
let's give it a site title we'll say
market one user name admin password I'm
just going to do one through six I don't
care if it's a weak password and I'll
just put an email in here and install
WordPress
alright so now it should be all set
WordPress is set up on your local
machine on this domain or whatever
domain used so if we click login it'll
take us to our back-end we can login and
there we go so this is our back-end if
we want to look at the front-end we can
go to visit site and there it is so it's
that easy there's no manually creating
databases downloading WordPress from the
the website and uploading the files or
any bringing the files over or anything
like that so I would highly recommend
desktop server and again I have no
affiliation with the company it's just I
think it's really cool so now what we
want to do is we want to implement our
theme that's the first thing I want to
do because right now we're using the
default WordPress theme so what I did to
actually find this theme I just searched
for free wordpress themes and I went to
this post where is it sixty-five best
free responsive themes and then I just
looked through them and where is it I
saw right here parallax one so this is
the theme we want so what we want to do
is download it so we'll say download now
for free you're gonna have to put in an
email it doesn't even have to be valid
and you'll be able to download it so
I'll go ahead and save it and let's go
ahead and show that in the finder and
it's a zip file so I'm just going to
double click to unzip it and there's our
theme so these are all the theme files
so what we want to do to install this is
we're going to take the parallax one
folder and then I'm gonna go into my
website which is in documents websites
and you'll see right here Market Market
one dev CC I'm gonna go into that go
into wp-content themes and I'm gonna
bring over that parallax one theme okay
now what we'll do is go back to my
back-end in WordPress and go to
appearance themes and you should see the
theme right here so we're gonna go ahead
and activate it all right now right here
you're gonna see this theme recommends
the following plugins into Intergeo maps
and pirate forms so it'll actually give
us the option to install these so we'll
say begin installing plugins
I'm gonna check both let's choose
install and apply and you might get
these warnings but it's not going to
matter it's not going to do anything
so right here all installations have
been completed let's return to the
plug-in installer now we just want to
activate them so again we'll choose them
and we'll go activate apply and there we
go so now we should have those plugins
activated now let's go back to
appearance themes and let's see alright
so this is already activated so let's go
back to our front-end and reload and now
we have basically the default theme
alright and we just have our one sample
page this just comes with WordPress but
obviously we're gonna create our own
pages and so on our own menu so let's
start to customize this theme and this
theme actually makes it really easy as
with most good themes they have good
customization panels so if we click on
customize we have all these different
set all these different sections that we
can edit alright so let's start off with
let's go to let's see what did I want to
do and there is a pro version that
enables a couple extra things but if we
go to headers and we go to let's see I
want to I want the logo appearance
general oh yeah appearance general
options and this is where you can
actually upload a new logo which you're
gonna want to do your clients are going
to want you to upload their logo so what
I'm gonna do is open up Photoshop let me
just fit this to my screen
you see I actually already have like the
that logo here and some of the other
stuff because I've already done this
obviously I'm not just doing it right
off the top of my head but what I would
do and I'm just I'm going I'm going by
what I would do in a real situation if I
were to really put this together so I
would copy this or grab this image
rather not copy it but grab it so I'll
say open a new tab whoops not open a new
tab open image a new tab and we want to
grab this image I'll save it because we
want it to be the same exact size so
we'll save that and then let's go back
to the finder and go to downloads and
open that logo now you don't have to do
this especially if you don't have
Photoshop claps I wanted to open that in
Photoshop if you don't have Photoshop
you can simply grab the files in the
description but I'm just showing you
what I would do so I'm just going to
choose the text tool and we're gonna say
mark it 1 and this is a huge font I'm
gonna change this so let's see let's
change it to 24 maybe a little bigger 30
and actually let's make it 24 because I
want it to be all caps
so market one and then I want it to be
the same colors so I can actually zoom
in here oops let me just fix this real
quick
whatever that's fine so I'll just zoom
in and I want that blue right there so
I'm going to click the eyedropper tool
which is right here grab that blue and
then what I'll do is I'm going to
highlight mark it and I'm going to click
on this color here and just dab that
blue and by the way this came up off the
screen so I'm just going to click OK and
now we have that blue for the word
market now I want the parallax one to go
away so I'll hide that layer and then
I'm just going to move market one down
into the middle actually a little
further up because I want to put a
little black line under the word one so
I'm gonna actually grab the square tool
and let's change this color from blue to
black I'll actually just use the
eyedropper here and then let's just do
kind of a line under it and then we'll
just rasterize the layer and we can
click this this tool right here and we
can move it around with our arrows so
we'll go like that alright and I think
that's good if we choose both layers
over here I can move both layers around
so we'll make sure that's in the middle
see yeah that looks good all right so
now that's gonna be our logo logo so I'm
gonna go ahead and save this as and what
I'll do is put let's see I'll just put
it in let's save it as logo but we want
to save it as a PNG not as a PSD okay so
we're going to choose PNG and save click
OK and now we should have that logo
alright so now let's go back to our
WordPress site and let's choose change
image ok remember we're in customization
appearance general options change image
we're going to upload the image I'm
going to click select files and we'll
grab that
go PNG all right let's click Choose
image and there we go so it gives us it
shows us what it looks like right here
now it's not gonna be on our front end
yet until we hit publish so let's go
ahead and hit publish and then we'll go
back to our actual site and reload and
now we have our logo okay so it's as
simple as that so we'll go back now
colors you could change the colors up if
you want for instance if you are if the
company you're building this floor has
certain branding colors you're probably
going to want to choose you're gonna
select those but we're gonna leave that
and now we're gonna go to background
image so for the background image
actually you know what we're going to
keep this this isn't the background
image I want I think that's for the
entire thing what we want I'm gonna go
back and click the X oops I don't want
to go out here I want to go back here
and then go to the header section okay
this is the background I want to change
but first let's go to content and you
see how we have this little image here
we can change that as well
so again what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to grab that image say open image in new
tab and I'm gonna save this logo too
I'll just yeah I will save it as a logo
too and then let's open that with
Photoshop
okay so we can't really see this so what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna grab the
square tool and I already have I have
the black color selected right here so
I'm just gonna kinda go like that and
rasterize it and then move the layer
under the logo and then what I'll do is
take that square tool again and I want
to keep that border but I'm just going
to cover this whatever this is
so we'll rasterize that and then we have
to move that over the logo itself okay
so now we just have blank black and then
what I'll do is put the text tool and
I'm just going to put an uppercase M
it's black right now so we can't see it
so I'll change it with this up here to
white and then let's increase the font
size let's see 72 and then we'll go
ahead and move that in the middle like
that's good enough okay now we don't
want the black background so I'm gonna
get rid of that and actually you know
what I should have done is not put a
black background over that whatever that
is that upside-down V thing I should
have just deleted it so I'm gonna get
rid of that that I did I'm gonna hide
the M for a second and you can see that
the original I'm just gonna go ahead and
take this tool this selection tool make
sure I don't get the borders just that
logo there and delete all right then
I'll put my M back and then we should be
all set so we'll go ahead and save this
and we'll save it as a PNG I'll save it
as logo to replace okay
and now we should be able to upload that
so let's go back to our site our
back-end here and let's go change image
upload files and we'll select that new
logo - okay and we'll say choose image
and there it is all right so now we can
edit the actual text if we want so let's
change this to digital marketing company
and then we have some subtext here we
can edit I'm just gonna say for small
business websites and mobile apps and
then instead of get started we'll say
find out more just to kind of
differentiate from the original theme
and then the button let's have that go
to our domain and then slash about which
we haven't created yet but that's where
I want it to go all right so now we'll
go ahead and publish and I do want to
change that we will change the
background but let's check that out
first so I'll reload and there we go
okay so now let's hit the back and logos
bar we're going to do that after that's
the this down here we actually want
these to be social icons for the
background what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to go to pixels com p exe LS not
pixels pixels and I'm gonna search for
marketing and I think I chose this image
right here so I'm going to download the
nineteen twenty by twelve eighty go
ahead and save that and then we'll go
back over here and let's say add new
image and we're going to grab that
pixels the image
and let's select and crop and you can
move this where you want that's good
crop image and there we go now what I
want to do is I don't want this to be
like a dark and it's cool that it gives
you the overlay by default you don't
have to actually manually add that to
the image you don't have to edit the CSS
yourself it just does it but what I'm
going to do is change the color so I'm
going to click this right here select
color and I'm gonna choose the blue and
then it should change might take a
second it should change well there we go
alright yeah that looks good well let's
make it a little darker yeah alright so
we'll do that I actually think it's a
different image than I had in my
original but that's fine that works
anything that has to do with like
marketing and analytics and if you guys
want to choose a different image from
pixels you know there's tons of them
this site is awesome so that looks good
to me I'm going to click publish now and
we'll make sure it updated here alright
so that looks good and go back let's
click this little arrow and now for the
logos bar so for this we can upload
different icons or images for each of
these ok so what I'm gonna do or what I
did is I just searched for blue social
icons and it was this right here that
came that I chose this image it's a it's
a transparent PNG so what I did is I cut
each one out and I use that it's it's
nice if you can find a site where you
can I mean that you probably could just
go to like icon finder but I don't know
I just did this so what I'm going to do
is grab this whole image and again all
the icons are cut out and saved in the
description if you don't if you don't
want to do this yourself in Photoshop
so let's see we'll go to our finder and
open with Photoshop and then what I did
is just grab this this selection tool
and just kind of went over one of these
like that move this up a little bit and
then I'll go ahead and copy so control-c
or command-c whatever and i say new file
new you guys can't see it it's
off-screen but I just went to file new
and create and then it's going to give
us that size and then I'll control V or
command V to paste it in alright so now
we have our logo we want to make sure we
get rid of the background the white and
then I'm gonna save this so I'm gonna
say file save as and let's save this as
Facebook and we're going to choose PNG
okay so now we'll go back to the whoops
we can actually close this out actually
yeah we'll close that out am i doing
clicking the wrong damn thing so I'm not
gonna save that and close this one out I
just want the icons so next thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna grab this actually
I don't want that I want the Twitter
bird so ctrl D or command D to unselect
or deselect and then we'll grab this
just make sure you have the whole icon
and then ctrl C I have my Mac actually I
have it programmed to use control
instead of command just because I was a
Windows user for so long and I'm gonna
paste that in I'll hide the Facebook
layer and then I'm gonna save this as
Twitter
let's save it as Twitter PNG okay so
next thing we'll grab is let's grab
youtube so copy that paste it in and I
know I didn't have to do this part but I
just want to kind of go through the
entire thing with you guys the whole
step so I'm gonna save this as YouTube
dot PNG okay we also want LinkedIn save
that as a PNG or ping and then finally
let's grab the Google+
okay let's save save it as Google okay
so now we have all of our logos or icons
whatever you want to call them so now
we'll go back I can close this up we can
close that and let's go back to the
customizer and the first one I want is
the Facebook so I'm gonna click upload
image go to upload files select and then
I'm just gonna grab all of the icons to
upload at least upload them to WordPress
so we'll click open and that should
upload all of them
alright but we only want to select the
Facebook one so we'll keep that and then
we'll say insert into post and it should
show up here now hold on upload image
Facebook oh did I not insert into post
there it is now it's going to be gray
but when we over when we hover over it
we get the blue color so that's that's
the effect that we want and for the link
we would say HTTP facebook.com and then
you would do slash whatever your clients
Facebook pages okay next one we're going
to do Twitter so
it should actually be HTTPS but that's
fine all right so the next one is going
to be LinkedIn okay so next we'll have
YouTube
and lastly we will have Google Plus
which I don't know who uses all right so
that looks pretty good
let's click publish and let's take a
look at our sites reload and there we go
alright so next we're gonna move down to
the services so if we go and there
should be a back button why don't I keep
staking me back here I'll click
customize again and let's go to services
section and from here let's let's just
change it to marketing services ok we'll
change this dummy text here and we'll
say these are our oops main services
that we offer or whatever whatever you
want to put alright and then for each of
these boxes here we have these
selections these options and what's
really cool is we can use an icon here
first of all I'm going to change this to
SEO and we have the we it's using font
awesome icons but you'll notice if I
just click in here we can actually
choose an icon from here so this is kind
of cool so I'm going to search for
search because I want the magnifying
glass thing here for SEO and let's go to
the next one so the next one is going to
be email marketing
and I'm just gonna leave the dummy text
you got I mean if you guys really want
you can change that but I'm gonna leave
that for email marketing I'm going to
search for envelope grab that icon and
then for the last one here oops for the
last one let's change this to
pay-per-click and then for the icon I'm
gonna search for money and grab that and
there we go so that's done so we'll
click on let's click publish and good so
that takes care of the services this
part here this is actually the About

we'll go and click this tool here and
we'll just move this up I'll just
actually you know what hold on that's
fine I guess we'll just leave it like
that so let's go ahead and actually
they're kind of low I'm actually just
going to I'm gonna step backward
I think I cut it off somehow um you know
what let me just alright so we're just
gonna start over here I don't know what
the hell happened there so I'm gonna
just copy this whole thing paste it in
ctrl T to resize I'll go like that and
then we should be able to bring it up
like that
alright you know what it is is most of
the most of my Photoshop editing I've
done on windows and the keys are a
little different so it's kind of
screwing me up a little bit but that
should be good so let's go ahead and
we'll save this as about us PNG or place
it and then let's go back here and we'll
change the image upload the file which
is C about us and we're going to choose
that image and there we go so now I have
a different image so now for the team
let's go back actually let's click
publish first and go back and let's go
to the team section and see our team
will change I guess we'll change this
here will just say meet the market one
team and then each person here gets an
image a name and a subtitle or position
and you can do social icons and a link
if you want so again I'm gonna go to
pixels and I'm just gonna search for
person but person
and let's see let's grab we'll grab this
dude here so we want to get the small
school save him let's grab this girl
here and we'll grab this girl here
alright so now we have three people and
then we're gonna go back to this the
template here and I want to grab this
image now it has this overlay so if I
try to like right click or command click
whatever control click I can't save the
image I can't like view the image so I'm
going to inspect with my chrome tools
and in this div I'm not in that div
where the hell is it
see ya right here so here's the actual
image so I'm gonna go ahead and choose
open a new tab so we're gonna grab the
image save as and it's just called 1 I
guess so we'll save that and then we
want to open that in Photoshop or just
grab it from the files whatever you want
to do
actually this this particular guy this
image won't be in the file that the the
three we downloaded will be but I'm
going to now open up one of the images
that I just downloaded so this girl here
but I want to open it in Photoshop and
then what we'll do is we will copy and
paste her in ctrl T and then just resize
and let's move her over okay so that's
one I'm just going to use this same the
same image here to bring in all of them
I'm gonna close these other tabs up
because they're just gonna confuse you
guys
okay so now let's grab the other two
people I keep doing that
I gotta make Photoshop the default for
this machine so again we'll just select
just doing kind of a weird thing here
but that's fine
she's the company kook so we'll move her
to the middle here and let's grab the
last one the dude again I keep doing
that the reason I keep doing that is
because usually I have it set to
photoshop to open by default which I
probably should do but I just am lazy I
guess so we'll go ahead and grab him
ctrl T command T whatever and we'll move
him over to the middle and now we have
our three people we have our three
layers we need to save each one as a
separate image so let's go ahead and say
file save as and we'll save this as
person 1 PNG all right now I'm gonna
hide his layer save her as person to PNG
hide that layer and then save this one
as person 3 dot PNG and these will be
the files that you guys can get in the
description alright so now that we did
that let's go back and let's go ahead
and upload image upload files and we'll
just grab all of them so person one two
and three
all right but we only want to select one
and we'll select person one okay Albert
Jacobs I guess we'll just keep that name
and we'll keep the position and then
let's go to the next one
so obviously you would be replacing this
with pictures of your clients team you
wouldn't be searching for images random
people let's go ahead and upload the
second one all right Tanya Tanya Garcia
we'll just leave that I guess and then
the last one here let's upload her and
Linda will keep that as well and you can
see the name and the position will show
when you hover over each one so that
looks good let's click publish and we'll
go back let's check our site let's
reload and all those changes should be
made okay so our services are about our
team good now for the testimonial
section I'm just going to change I'll
change the heading from happy customers
why can I select this I'll change the
heading from happy customers to
testimonial testimonials and we'll
change this right here what is going on
why can I not select this
so we'll change this to this is what our
clients had to say and I'm not gonna I
mean you could go ahead and change like
the images and stuff but that is just
gonna get repetitive it's the same stuff
we've been doing but if you really
wanted to you could go and change the
names and images and stuff obviously
this would be your real clients
testimonials
okay so let's publish that and we'll go
back let's see what else we have so this
area right here this is the ribbon
section so I'm gonna actually this image
makes sense this is like a analytics
type of image so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to say you found us on Google
right and then we can actually put HTML
in here so I can put a line break and
then let's put in some small tags all
right and then in here let's say Google
ranks us as one of the top ten SEO
companies around okay and get started I
guess I guess we could have that go to
our domain and then slash services which
will create all right let's publish and
let's go back so this will be our posts
our wordpress posts we want to leave
that this section here let's edit that
so that would be the contact section so
I'll just change this to like sales
we'll say sales at market one dot tests
I'm sure there is a market one calm so
I'm not going to use that and then this
one here company address we'll just say
five five five Main Street Boston Mass
and then for the phone I don't know
we'll just do like six one seven which
is Boston's area code and all fives
okay so we'll publish and let's see we
want to change this right here the name
of the theme which is where is that
footer options and we'll just change
that to will say market one 2018 all
right so that is our homepage okay I
make sure everything's published and you
can see how easy that was to do and it
looks pretty good it's a decent looking
theme it's not I mean it's not the best
but it's it's clean you know it's a
clean theme so now we want to do is we
want to create the other pages so we're
going to now exit the theme editor
customizer whatever that is and let's
actually add a post because all we have
is a hello world so if we wanted to add
a new post close that up and let's just
say this is the first post so we'll say
market one website is live yay and then
we'll just put some sample text in here
so I'm gonna go to larom or what does it
lips um like it's lip simcom yeah and we
can just generate some dummy text if I
click this button here and then we'll
just grab like three paragraphs
and we'll put that in our post and we
could also do an image so what I'm going
to do is go back to logo - yeah logo -
and then I'm gonna put just a black
background like that we'll rasterize it
and then we'll bring it under that logo
like that and I'm gonna eat I'm gonna
use this as my image but I want it
bigger so you guys can't see my taskbar
but I'm gonna go to image image size and
we're gonna change this to 200 pixels
now notice the M is like out of focus
it's all blurry let's say but we want
the border so what I will do is just
again have the square tool I'll just
cover this M so we'll rasterize this and
then we'll move that above the M and
then we'll just take the text tool and
we'll put a brand-new hem in there we'll
make it white and let's make it a lot
bigger so I'll change the font - I don't
know let's try like 150 or maybe 170
there we go I will just kind of put that
in the middle I'm just doing this very
quick guys and then we'll save it let's
save it as logo - large PNG alright now
let's go back to our post and let's use
this as the featured image so I'm gonna
say set featured image upload files grab
that m and set that as the featured
image and as for categories I'll add a
new category called news and we'll use
that tags we could say
market one I don't know press release
something like that it doesn't really
matter and that should be good so we'll
publish okay let's go back to our posts
and let's delete the hello world put
that in the trash and then if we go back
to our site and we go down there's our
post I click on it it takes us to the
actual page if I wasn't logged in as
admin I'd have to put like my email
address and stuff like that here but I
can just leave a comment it will say
great post post comment and there we go
alright so next thing we want to do is
create our pages so in pages we're gonna
say let's actually just trash the sample
page we'll say add new about us and our
let's just do a bout now we'll do about
us but I want to change actually you
know what I'm gonna do I need to change
the permalink in the section in this ad
settings in a second I'll show you that
in a minute but let's just grab some
sample text for this and paste it in and
then over here I don't think we need to
change anything we want to use the
default template depending on which
theme you use you'll have different
options here for instance the contact
and blog they have their own page full
width if you don't want the sidebar
things like that and some themes will
have a ton of these these different
templates but let's go ahead and publish
that and then I'm gonna actually edit
the URL to just be about okay so we'll
change that and I think we have to click
update I'm not sure and then let's go to
settings and then go to permalinks
because right now we have our posts they
have the like the date and stuff I mean
that was a page but I want our posts
just to have the post name so let's
choose that and click Save Changes
alright and then we'll go back to pages
and let's click add new and let's do
services and they'll just paste that
text in except I'm just gonna add some
headings here like SEO and obviously you
could make this look better you could
put in some images in here and make
lists and stuff like that but you guys
you guys know how to do that I'm gonna
make these h3s
and that should be good let's publish
all right now if we go back and reload
you can see that we have our pages up
here but let's go to appearance and then
menus alright because by default any
page we create is going to be in that
menu and we don't want that we want to
create a custom menu so right here I'm
gonna say primary menu and create and
then we want to choose four menu
settings we want to choose the these two
locations in the steam footer and
primary we want to choose primary okay
and then we'll choose the pages we want
we want services and about us so we'll
add those to the menu I'm actually going
to switch the positions though we also
want a home link so I'm gonna go to
custom links the link text will be home
and then I'm just gonna use the domain
here as the link like that and we'll
move that to the top let's save the menu
and then let's go back and reload and
now we have our home page we have our
boat and our services awesome so next
thing we want is the blog okay we want
any posts we create we want a page that
lists all those posts so to do that we
want to create a page so let's go to
pages and let's add a new page call it
blog and with this theme what we can do
is just choose the blog template we
don't even have to put anything in here
and publish okay now let's go back to
our menu so appearance menus and let's
add the blog to the menu okay and we'll
save and then if we go back and reload
now we have blog if I click on that
you're gonna see all your posts and they
look pretty nice actually I like the way
the date looks and stuff okay so les
Engh les page we want to add a last menu
item is the con
so with this we're using pirate forms so
if we go to pirate forms down here
you'll see that we can actually put this
shortcode in to put our form in and if
we go to field settings we can have name
address and stuff we can choose not to
display some of this you could do an
attachment you could add its a spam trap
if you wanted to enable Google reCAPTCHA
but I believe you have to get an API key
and stuff like that and if you want to
do that that's fine but I'm not going to
do that in this video but that's you can
change the labels of the the form as
well so you can customize it you can
customize your alert messages and all
that stuff I'm just going to keep all
the defaults okay and then I'm just
gonna take this shortcode right here
it's just brackets with pirate forms and
then we're gonna go to pages add a new
page
we'll say contact contact us put in that
shortcode
avakov it we don't want to do that we
want to type it so pirate forms okay and
over here under template we're going to
choose contact because we don't want any
sidebars or anything like that so let's
click publish we have to add it to our
menu so we'll go back to menus contact
us add to menu and save and then we'll
go back and reload and then we have our
contact us if I click that there's our
form alright so that's it our website is
complete now as far as deployment to the
internet you have a lot of options like
I said with this desktop server if you
have the premium version you can you
basically can automate it what I'm going
to do is just do a very simple FTP to
cPanel server okay now you're gonna have
to export your database manually and
import it so I'm gonna show you how to
do that real quick now if you're using
desktop server or xampp or MAMP or
anything then you should have PHP
myadmin
installed so if we go to localhost / PHP
and if you look over here it should be
this right here market 1db
this is our database so it should it
should relate to the whatever you called
the site so what we're going to do is
click on that and we're gonna click
export okay I'm gonna try to do this
quick we want to choose quick and let's
click go and we're going to download an
SQL file ok so it's gonna be called this
dot SQL so we'll save that and now we
have basically a dump file an SQL dump
of our database now I have a hosting
account with in motion hosting which I
highly recommend in motion hosting
comm and I have an affiliate link in the
description so if you guys are
interested they actually have
specialized wordpress hosting as well
this I actually have a VPS so I have an
account with the domain code demos com
if I go to code demos comm and it's
going to show a listing of subfolders I
really don't care if you guys this is
just for testing and stuff like that
most of this stuff like DJ outlet that
was a video I did Kitana site that's a
static site generator video I did but I
want to put it in the root of code demo
so I'm going to go to my cPanel
and let's see it's login okay now we're
gonna need a database on our on our
remote host and then we're going to
import that SQL file into it so we can
easily create a database by going - we
could do it manually but let's do it the
database wizard and cPanel makes it
really easy so we'll call this market
market one it's gonna be code demos or
whatever your username is underscore and
then whatever you name it so the user
I'm just gonna say code demos underscore
Brad password I'm gonna delete this
after anyways must be at least 20 oh I
need a stronger password alright let's
do ABC one two three exclamation does
that work
okay so we'll create the user and we
want to choose all privileges next step
all right
so user Brad was added to the market one
so we have that user and it's added to
that database okay so now let's go back
to cPanel and let's go to PHP myadmin on
the remote side so this is now gonna be
our server okay this is known we're no
longer on our local machine so if we
look at code demos underscore market one
it's empty so what I'm gonna do is
import I'm gonna go to choose file and
I'm gonna choose that SQL file so this
right here and we're gonna import we're
going to click go hopefully it doesn't
take too long no those really quick and
you can see all of our wordpress tables
over here alright so now what we need to
do is actually upload our site and we're
going to use FTP for that so for the
hosts I'm gonna say code demos dot-com
obviously you will you'll use your own
info for your own hosting and use your
name
code demos at code demos comm password
connect all right so I'm gonna go to my
public HTML which is my front-facing
folder here and this is where I want to
put all my files now before I do that
I'm gonna go to my documents web sites
and let's go to our market one site and
we want to edit something here we want
to edit the config file so I'm going to
open that up I'll use vs code and we're
gonna want to go down and change the
database parameters because right now
it's set to our local database stuff so
we want to change it to the remote
alright so let's go back to Chrome and
what did I call it what was it the code
demos underscore market one yeah so we
actually I don't need to go here so the
database name that we chose was code
demos underscore market one and the user
was code demos underscore brad and the
password was ABC one two three
exclamation and that should be all we
need to change I believe yeah so let's
go ahead and save that actually you
should have made a copy of your you know
the one we just had with your local
database parameters but whatever it's
fine so now I'm going to take my entire
serve my entire website here and I'm
going to select everything here and I'm
going to bring it into my public HTML
folder alright now this is going to take
quite a while to up
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pause
the video and when it's done I'll come
back and we'll check it out alright guys
so everything has been uploaded as you
can see so now if I go to code demos
dot-com we're gonna see our homepage now
any link that I click if I go to about
us you'll see it's not going to work
because of the domain it goes back to
market one dev CC so one thing we can do
is we can edit our config file to
include the correct domain so let's go
back to that file and we can add a
couple lines we'll just put it right
here and we'll say define and we want to
do WP underscore site URL and then we
want to add right here HTTP and then
let's do WWE demos com okay and then
what I'll do is copy that line down and
we just want to change this from WP site
URL to WP home so let's save that and
let's see if that works so we're gonna
have to just reach up load this one file
so let's go to FileZilla and let's grab
the config which is right here don't
bring that in and we want to overwrite
though the current one okay so let's
reload this and let's click about us
alright so now we get an error it's you
can see it's still code demos slash
about what we get an error 404 we should
at least be able to go to our admin so
let's go to admin WP admin and let's
login I didn't show you but before we
wouldn't have even been able to go to
the admin page now once we're logged in
let's go to settings and
let's see so we have our WordPress
address URL let's go to permalinks and
we're just going to want to click Save
Changes alright so now we're going to go
back to the front-end
let's click about and now it works
alright so you just need to cut you need
to resave that permalinks file in order
for it to work so we now have a deployed
WordPress site whoops oh ok so home
doesn't work because when we created our
link let's go to menus we actually
hard-coded this right here so we want to
change this now back we want to change
it to code demos comm and I think we
might've did that somewhere else too I
think it was in the theme so if we go to
theme customize and I think it was the
he was at the header content yeah right
here so we want this to go to code demos
dot-com ok so you just want to kind of
make sure that everything matches up
with your with your actual domain and
then I mean there's easier ways to
deploy there's actually services that
are built for deploying WordPress as
plugins you can use there's all types of
stuff but this is just the very basics
but we do have a deployed site now for
the contact form if you want this to
work you'll need to have an SMTP server
which we can actually set up will
actually is set up already on my hosts
so if I go to cPanel and go to email
accounts I have an account here test at
code demos comm so I'm going to say
setup mail client and then if we go down
here you'll see our SMTP settings so
this would be my SMTP server and this
would be the poor so if I go back to our
and we don't want that we want the code
demos and we're just gonna close all
this stuff up so if we go to coat our
code demos back-end and our code demos
domain and go to prior forms and go to
let's go to options and we don't want
this is the the notification address we
want test at code demos comm and then
the recipient I want to be my tech guy
info which is kind of like my junk mail
email address you can also store the
store them in the database but let's
save that and then let's go to SMTP and
this is where we want to put our info so
we wanted to make sure that's checked
yes the host is gonna be this here so
I'll grab that put that right in there
the port is 465 I'm gonna try it without
authentication and let's Save Changes
okay so now if we go to our front-end
I'm just going to reload and let's try
to send an email so I'll say John Doe
hello this is a test so we'll send the
message
okay thanks your email is sent
successfully now what I'm going to do is
go off screen and I'm gonna check my
gmail alright and there it is I don't
want to show my whole my email my emails
on on video so what I'm gonna do is just
have it come up from the bottom so you
can see the very first one which is
right there so John Doe subject is hello
contact form submission from market one
and then you see the name and the stuff
that they entered so the contact form is
working it's also not even going to the
spam which I kind of thought it would
but it didn't because we didn't use
authentication or anything like that but
yeah so I think that's it
we now have a deployed WordPress website
with a blog with a contact form with a
theme so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
and hopefully it wasn't too long but if
you if you look at it we've created this
website in a little over an hour and
deployed it so that's not too bad
so hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
please leave a like and I will see you
