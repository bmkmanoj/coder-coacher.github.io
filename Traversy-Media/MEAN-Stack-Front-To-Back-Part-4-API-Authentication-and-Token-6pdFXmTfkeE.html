the mean stack front to back series in
the last video we set up our user model
and we also added the registration
functionality for the backend alright so
now what we want to do is we want to be
able to authenticate and we also want to
get our token system working and and
make it so that we can protect certain
routes so we're going to use passport so
in our app GIS file we need to add a
couple lines of middleware
I'm going to go right down here below
the body parser and let's say passport
middleware and the app dot use and in
here we're going to pass in passport dot
initialize and we need another line and
that's going to be passport dot session
ok you just need to have those two lines
so and that should be a function so
let's save that alright now what we're
going to do is create a strategy so
we're using cough support GWT that's
what it has a ton of different
strategies you can use I do have a
series where we use the local strategy
which is similar to what we're doing
except there's no token involved but
with this what we're going to have to do
is create a config file with code
similar to this right here so we're
bringing in the strategy with passport
JWT dot strategy and we also need to
extract JWT utility and then we're
creating our options right here ok so
basically we're saying we want to
extract it from the header from the
authorization from the header that's how
it actually fetches the token and then
we're saying we want to use a new JWT
strategy pass in the options then we get
a callback
ok and in that callback we get a payload
and that payload should include the user
information now when I did this right
here JWT payload sub I wasn't getting
anything I actually had to do dot on
describe
so we may need to experiment a little
with this and actually see what's in the
payload and get the ID now right here
they're using directly to find one
mongoose function and i don't want to do
that i want to keep all that stuff
inside the model so we're going to call
our get user by d function that we
created in the model and then we'll just
pass in the ID not an object all right
and then this stuff will all be the same
basically if there's an error we return
done and we're going to pass along false
and then if there is a user we're going
to pass along the user if it doesn't
match the user we'll pass along false
okay
so let's go ahead and go in the config
folder we'll create a file called
passport dot JX and let's see and here
we want to bring in a bunch of stuff
we're going to bring in the JWT strategy
so we want to set that to require
passport JWT
strategy we also want to bring in the
extract JWT
okay that's also from passport
that's going to be dot extract JWT let's
also bring in our model
so we'll say cost user and that's going
to come from dot doc slash models slash
user and then we also want our config of
database config
okay so set that to require and this is
going to be dot dot slash config slash
database okay so those are the requires
and then we're going to say module dot
exports because we want this to be
accessible and we're going to set it to
a function and they're just going to
pass in here you guys out into pot three
of the means alright so now we want to
start to create our options we'll say
let box equals an empty object and then
let's add to it will say ops dot JWT
from request and we're going to set that
to that extract JWT dot from auth
Heather okay because there's different
ways that you can pass the token back
and forth we're using the authorization
in the Heather alright then we need to
add our key so it's off dot secret or
key and that's going to be set to the
key that's in our config so T dot secret
ok then we're going to do passport dot
use and we want to say new JWT strategy
and then pass in the options and then a
callback
okay and then this callback is going to
give us the payload so JWT payload and
then done all right and then right here
we want to call our model function get
user by ID and let's see we're going to
pass in JWT payload and I'm going to do
dot underscore ID because that's what
worked for me last time if it doesn't
then we'll just do all to do a little
debugging okay I'm going to use an arrow
function here okay and that's going to
give us an error possible error and a
user so now we want to check to see if
there's an error so if there is then we
want to return done along with the error
and false and then we want to check for
the user okay if the user was returned
then we want to return done set null for
the error and then from user okay we
want to pass him along if he's found if
not then we're going to just return done
no for the error but false here all
right and that should do it so let's
save that now we want to make sure we
include this inside of our app J s so
down below where we initialize passport
let's say require
dot slash config slash passport and then
we just want to go like this
another parenthesis and passport okay
because they're passing that in so let's
save that make sure we don't have any
weird errors okay looks like we don't
now we want to do is go to see when I go
to our routes and we want to start to
work on the authenticate okay so we're
getting a post request to slash
authenticate and the very first thing we
want to do here is get the username and
password that's being submitted
so we'll do Khan's username we'll get
that from request dot body dot username
it's coming in from the forum and then
the password or the possible password
alright and then what we want to do is
you want to get the user by the username
so we already have that function created
so get user by user name and that's
going to obviously get tapped in the
user name and then it's going to get a
callback ok so this is going to take
error possible error and the user so if
there's an error then let's just do
throw error and it does not we're going
to check for the user so first we're
going to say if there's not a user
returned if there's not a user returned
then we want to send our response to the
client so return reg Jason and we're
going to send success false and also a
message just like we did with the red
registration false comma message
and we'll say user not found ok because
there's no user now if there is a user
then we're going to keep going and we're
going to check the password so we'll say
user dot and we're going to have a
function inside of our model called
compare password okay and that's going
to take in the actual or the password
that the user is entering in the form
and then the actual hashed password
which we can get from the user that was
that was sent back to us so we can get
it with user dot password all right and
then we have our call back and this will
have an error and then is match which
should be a boolean to tell us if the
password matches or not all right
so let's go ahead and test for the error
and then we'll just throw error and if
there's no error then we want to test
for the is match so we'll do if is match
then we're going to create our token
okay so Kant's token and we can get this
with JWT sign and here we want to pass
in the user and then our secret which is
in the config file so confidant secret
and then an object with any options we
want so it has an option called expires
in so you can set this to whatever you
want in seconds you can make it so that
the user will have to login every half
hour or what
I'm going to actually put it to a week
so let's say 604 800 okay look that up
and I think that's supposed to be a week
worth of seconds okay and then we want
to go under that and then our response
to the front end so the response is
going to include success true because it
worked they validated and then we also
want to send along the token back okay
so say token and we're going to prefix
it with JWT space and then concatenate
token all right and I also want to send
the user data so we're going to create
an object here to send back which will
have an ID and we'll set that to user
dot on the score ID now remember this
user was given back to us or the up here
okay when we did the get user by
username so that's the user in the
database now the only reason I don't
send it like that like just send it as
users because I don't want to send the
password so we're just building our own
object here to send so ID name username
username and email and you can choose
what you want to send back I'm just
sending back the whole thing basically
besides a password that way they can
have some profile data you know so let's
see if is match ends right here so we
want to say else so if there's no match
then what do we want to do we just want
to send a response like this so
successful and then we'll say wrong
password
okay so we're checking for the username
if it exists it exists then we're going
to match the password if that matches
we're going to go on to send this
response if it doesn't we're going to
send this response so now what we need
to do is create this compare password
function inside of our model so let's go
to models user GS let's go down to the
bottom here module dot exports start
compare password okay and see this is
going to take in if we look at it what
we just did in the route it takes in the
password that the user types which is
the candidate password then the actual
hash and then the call back okay so
that's what we need to add in here
candidate password hash call back and
this call back let's see oh no we don't
do that here we already did that we just
got to do call back okay and then inside
here we need to run bcrypt dot compare
now a lot of times you'll see that
you'll see developers use this outside
and the routes use this out in the
routes and i don't like that i want to
keep everything and capsulated that's
why i'm doing it this way so that's
going to take in again the candidate
password the hash and then we put a
callback here okay and then that's going
to be error is match check for the error
and then our callback captain no and is
match all right and that should do it so
let's save that now that was quite a bit
of code we just wrote so I will be
surprised as it works on the first shot
but hopefully it does okay so our server
is up and running now let's go to
postman and we already registered a user
John so now what we want to do is open
another tab make a post request to
localhost 3000 slash users slash
authenticate and let's see we're going
to do headers add the content type I'm
going to submit it as application slash
Jason and then the body will choose raw
and let's say use your name John
password change moment of truth let's go
ahead and send and nothing all right
let's take a look over here config is
not defined so this is route users and
let's see it's looking at this right
here
config is not defined and that right so
we just need to bring that in
choir these can be dot dot slash config
slash database alright I'll be happy if
that's the only problem let's try again
and there we go look at that success
true token which starts with JWT and
then has our token and it gives us all
the user information so that's a
successful request so what we would do
on the client side in angular 2 or
whatever you're using you would store
this token and this user inside of your
either cookies or local storage it's up
to you how you want to store it we're
going to use local storage and then when
you want to make a request to a
protected route you have to include that
token within the header ok and well I'll
show you how to do all that in angular 2
but let's test it out here we can
actually test it out let's open up
another tab and before we do it we have
to protect a rope so let's take this
profile route protect it so the way that
we do that we have to add right here as
a second parameter let's say passport
dot authenticate and we're going to pass
in JWT and then we just want to set an
options object here and just say session
false because we're not using a session
and then I think that's it that should
protect it so any route that you want to
protect you just put this in as a second
parameter all right now for the response
let's say res dot Jason and let's get
them the profile data so we'll send a
user and we can get that user with
request dot user all right so let's save
that and then what we want to do is grab
the token that was sent to us okay and
in a real application this would be
stored in your local storage or
something
I can I can't coffee I have to go to raw
so make sure you grab from the JWT all
the way to the end here and copy and
then let's open up another route here
it's going to be a get request and it's
going to go to localhost 3000 slash
users splash profile now let's first try
it without the key and see that we get
unauthorized so not just anybody can go
to this now to include it we just need
to go to headers and we're going to add
authorization and paste in that value
once we do that let's send we still got
unauthorized oh man why did that happen
authorization
users profile and see that should have
worked something must have gone wrong
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to pause the video because I
really don't want to start this over so
I'm going to pause I'm going to check it
out and they'll be back alright guys so
I'm going to try to explain what's going
on here
so when we submit this this request it's
going through our GWT strategy right so
if we look at our passport j/s which is
in the config folder it's it's running
this right here when we submit that ok
now if we go inside this function right
here and we say console dot log and
let's take a look at what this payload
is giving us ok so I'll paste that in
and then let's go and make that request
they'll get authorized but if we look in
the console this is what that payload is
giving us now I have right here
payload underscore ID so that's not
being found the way that we can access
it is in this underscore doc and then
underscore ID and it's I don't think
it's supposed to work like that I think
that there's some kind of bug now it had
us doing if you remember from that
documentation it had us doing dot sub
and I just looked at that and that's
undefined so what we're going to try
here is underscore doc dot underscore ID
all right and just try this out see what
you get for the payload because
depending on what version you're using
of passport JWT this may have changed
you just want to make sure that you have
the user ID in this field from the
payload basically so let's go ahead and
save that and then we'll go back over
here and let's do a send and there we go
now it works ok because it got the
correct ID for that token and it gave us
our user information ok so that's how
you can protect routes you authenticate
you get the token you store it and then
you use it for any
routes that are protected such as this
profile one okay so our back end is now
complete at least for now until we you
know move on later later on down the
line but the next video we do will be on
our front end will start to create our
angular 2 website our application
alright so hopefully you guys could
follow along with this I really hope
that I explained it well enough and I
promise it won't be a month before the
next video I wanted to bang out the
whole back-end today and it may be a
couple days or so but we'll get it up
soon alright so thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
