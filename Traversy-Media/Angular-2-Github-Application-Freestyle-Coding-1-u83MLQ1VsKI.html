freestyle code now the point of this
series is going to be to around once a
week go ahead and build an application
from scratch and I'm not going to do any
kind of planning I'm not going to build
it outright and then record I'm just
gonna do it all in one shot I'm just
kind of winging it all right now there's
a couple reasons I'm going to do this
one is because I think it's good to show
your mistakes and show and to show your
debugging and how to fix issues that
come along rather than just having a
tutorial that's absolutely perfect where
no issues arise doesn't show you how to
fix something if you know if it's not
working right so that's one reason
another reason is for time because I do
this in my spare time between projects
so you know it's it's it's a lot quicker
to do it this way than to plan out a big
application and build it and then go
back and record and build it over again
so I'm just gonna do it all in one shot
hopefully you guys can bear with me I'll
try not to make too many mistakes but
yeah so let's get started now what we're
gonna build is we're gonna build an
angular 2 application that implements
the github API alright with the github
API you can pretty much get anything you
can get any user profiles with their
repositories with their gist's pretty
much anything so what we're gonna have
is an application where we can search
for github users and get all their
profile information along with all of
their repositories with links to their
repositories alright I chose github
because their API is really easy to use
and you don't have to have any kind of
API key or anything like that alright so
let's go ahead and get started what
we're gonna do is go to angular dot IO
and if we click get started it's going
to take us to a page like this and what
we want to do is grab the QuickStart
okay so right here you can see we have a
link to download the QuickStart source
I'm not gonna actually download it from
this
Paige what I want to do is get this
command here so that we can clone it all
right oh and you will have to have no
js' installed so if you don't have that
just go to node.js org and download it
and install it all right now I'm going
to do is open up a command line as
administrator and we want to go to the
folder where we want to create our
project folder which in my case is going
to be a folder called projects alright
and then what we want to do is paste
that in that clone that git clone
command and just gonna change this to
let's call it just called github search
I guess yeah that should do it
alright now if we go see Dee github
search there we go alright now for my
editor I'm using Visual Studio code
which is a really nice clean editor it's
free so if you want to use that
feel free or feel free to use you know
whatever you'd like so I'm going to open
folder let's open github search and now
we have our angular application or
angular 2 application so in the app
folder is where all of our components
are going to go our github service
things like that if you don't know
anything about angular 2 I would suggest
watching the little series I have I
think it's 9 or 10 videos explaining all
the fundamentals of angular 2 all right
because I'm not going to do that we're
just going to kind of build the
application now at this point we should
be able to run the app so if we go npm
start that should go ahead and look oh
we got to run npm install first and what
that'll do i guess i could show you the
package adjacent file that's going to
install all of our dependencies so if we
look at our dependencies we're using
angular 2 rc4 at this time and it has a
whole bunch of different modules the
compiled
the core the HTTP module all that stuff
and then down here we have system J s
that's going to allow us to load modules
we have one else reflect metadata this
has to do with the angular 2 polyfills
for browser compatibility rxjs is
reactive extensions that allows us to
use things like observables and promises
what else
bootstrap this is not Twitter bootstrap
this is the angular to bootstrap that's
responsible for loading the the core app
component alright then we just have a
bunch of dev dependencies we have a
light server and that's what allows us
to actually run the application Taipings
which is our typescript definitions and
of course typescript which is a superset
of JavaScript that allows us to use a
couple additional features all right so
let's go ahead and run that npm install
and that'll get all that stuff set up
and you also may want to change the name
of the application in this file I'm just
going to change it to github search ok
we'll wait for those to install alright
good so no issues now we should be able
to run NPM start you can see it's
starting up typescript and light server
alright and it opened up in another
monitor let me bring it over here and
there we go there's our first angular 2
app so if we open up the console we
should have no errors that's good so we
know that it's up and running and it
works alright so we're gonna want to
create a component let's take a look in
the app folder and you can see we have
all of these app component files now the
app component es that's the typescript
file that's what we're going to be
working in the jas is the compiled
I'll type script okay so this is
compiled into JavaScript and it looks
like a bunch of gibberish all right do
you want to use typescript with angular
2 okay this looks a lot more easier to
deal with than this all right so we have
that the main app component we also have
a main dot ts file that's where we use
the bootstrap you can see we're using
that bootstrap command to to initially
run that app component what we want to
do is create a new component for our
github alright so let's go ahead and
create a folder called components and
inside there is where we're gonna have
our github component so we'll say new
file github.com opponent dot TS all
right and you'll see that automatically
it compiled our j/s file ok but we don't
want to work in that we want to work in
the TS so let's look how the core
application the app component is set up
all right so we have an import of the
main component package
we have this act component this is a
decorator this allows us to attach
metadata to our component alright and
then we have a selector inside the
decorator this is basically the HTML tag
that we want to use to include our
component on the page alright and then
template is just the actual content you
can see that that's what we have here
all right we can also link to a separate
file for our template which is what
we'll be doing and then we have our app
component class all right so what I'm
going to do is copy this and go to our
github component ts file paste that in
and we're going to change a couple
things let's change this to a github and
let's see the class name we're going to
change to github component all right now
for right now I'm going to just change
the the actual template content
I'll just say github for now and save it
now before we can have it show up here
we need to do a few things we need to go
back into the app component file and we
need to import that component so we want
to say import github component from and
we're gonna go into the components
folder slash github.com ponent alright
so that imports it and then what we need
to do is add it as a directive a
directive is basically a custom HTML tag
and angular alright so right here we're
gonna put a comma and then say
directives which will be an array and we
just want to put in github components
okay and then we should be able to use
that the selector that we chose which is
right here github alright so in here
let's go ahead and just put github save
that and now you can see that we're
getting our github this is coming from
our component now I don't want to have
this heading right here so I'm going to
get rid of this okay and then if we go
to our github component I don't want to
just put all of our content in here
because that's going to get kind of long
it's going to make the file look really
messy so what we need to do is change
template to template URL now in order to
use a relative path yeah I'm sorry an
absolute path here we need to add
another piece of metadata called
module ID and we're going to set that to
module dot ID all right and then in here
let's say github.com ponent dot HTML all
right so it's going to look
this file so let's save that and then
create that file so in our components
folder we'll say new file github.com
ponent dot HTML and then in here let's
just say let's see we'll put an h1 will
say github test save that and there we
go so now we know that it's reading it
from that file so the next thing we want
to do is we want to create a service
that's going to interact with the github
API all right whenever you're dealing
with a third party API it's a good idea
to put it in a service so that you can
use it in multiple components you can
use it wherever you want we don't want
to just have it in in this particular
component all right even though this is
the only one that we'll be working with
in the future you may want to add more
all right so what we'll do is in our app
folder we're going to create a folder
called services and in that services
folder we're going to have a file called
github dot Sarris dot TS all right first
thing we're going to do is import the
injectable package because we want to be
able to inject this as a dependency and
that's going to come from hat angular 2
slash core or actually you know what
it's just what is this it's just angular
not ignore - all right and then we want
to use the injectable decorator so at
injectable and then we'll create our
class so we want to say explore class
github service
and let's put a constructor here okay
constructor is going to run whenever we
use the service all right so what I'm
going to do is just to console dot log
github service started okay we'll save
that and now in order to use it we have
to import it into our application so we
want to go to
I'm sorry into our component so in app
component es we're going to go up to the
top here and say import github service
from services slash github dot
all right now we also have to add that
to our component but not as a directive
it's a service so we need to add it as a
provider
all right so we'll save that let's make
sure everything is still showing up all
right now we want to go into our github
component and we also want to import it
here so I'm actually gonna just copy
this okay and we're just gonna have to
change what that's not right we want the
component and we're gonna have to just
change the path a little bit because
right now we're in the components folder
so we want to say dot dot slash to go
outside of it and then into services all
right now dependency injection with
angular 2 is much different than angular
1 what we have to do is inject it in the
constructor so long to say constructor
and we want to inject it right here
we're gonna say private underscore
github service and this could be called
whatever you want I like to put
underscore and then a lower case and
then upper case every every other word
all right so private github service and
then github service okay this is going
to match whatever we have up here so
let's go ahead and save that and if we
reload now you can see down in the
console we get github service started so
we know that the service is now
connected to our component in our
application now we're going to want to
use the HTTP module because we need to
fetch data from another URL from a third
party
so before we use that in our service
let's go to app component ES and we need
to import our HTH CDP providers so HTTP
underscore proxy
at angular slash HTTP all right and then
we need to add that to the providers
array down here just like that
save it and then let's go to our service
and let's see we're going to port it up
here and port HTTP and headers angular
slash HTTP okay now in order to use it
we have to inject it in the constructor
so in here we're going to say privates
underscore HTTP HTTP all right so in our
class we're going to have a property for
the username so that's gonna be private
username and for now we're going to
explicitly set it here later on we'll be
able to change it from within the
application but for now I'm just going
to put my own and then let's go under
our constructor and create a function
called get user and we're going to
return we're going to use an observable
so we have to also use reactive
extensions so up here we want to import
when import rxjs
I think that should work and then let's
return this dot underscore HTTP and then
we want to use the get the get method so
in here we're going to put the URL we
need which is HTTP API dots github.com
slash users slash and then we want to
concatenate
this dot username okay so that'll be
whatever is right here all right and
then we want to get rid of that and
we're going to say dot map okay they're
gonna map and observable we want res to
res dot Jason okay because it's
returning Jason all right and that's all
we need for the get user functions so
let's save that and then we're gonna go
into our github component and let's add
a property right here called user set
that to actually go like that we're not
going to set it to anything actually
that's gonna it's giving us an error
what I'm going to do is say user any
okay saying it can be any kind of data
all right and then what we'll do is in
the constructor we're gonna save this
this dot underscore github service you
don't get user alright and this is going
to be an observable so we want to
subscribe to it dot subscribe and in
here we're gonna say user and let's set
that to a code block and then say this
dot user equals user all right so it's
going to assign the user property to the
response from get user for now what I'm
gonna do is just do console dot log this
dot user all right so let's go ahead and
let that reload okay so it looks like
we're getting an arrow with the rxjs so
what I'm gonna do is instead of just
importing rxjs let's just get the map
operator because that's all we're using
so I we should be able to do rxjs slash
add slash operator slash and map
there we go alright so down here in the
console you can see that it's logging
that user so we have login Brad Travis E
we have the ID we have the avatar URL
and then if we go down we have the bio
the blog link company all this
information is now available to us we
have links for let's see for the HTML
URL this is the profile link we have the
gist's link followers all this
information we can now use in our
application user should now since we did
right here this dot user we can now use
that in our view in our template so
let's go to github component HTML and
let's do put a div and we want to test
to make sure user is available so we're
going to say asterisk ng if user okay so
if there is a user then whatever we put
in here will will run so let's do an h1
that and we should be able to say user
dot name save that and there we go
that's it's pulling the name from github
now before we go and add a bunch of more
data I want to set up Twitter bootstrap
just to make things look a little better
all right and I'm just going to use the
CDN
okay so we just want to grab this link
copy it and then I'm going to go to
index.html and we're going to put that
right here we'll say link rel equals
stylesheet H ref yeah let's just paste
that link in okay we'll save that and
now bootstrap is activated all right so
let's go back to the template and before
actually before we add anything here I
want to the main app component I want
that to also have a template right now
if we look at right here we're just
including the github tag here or the
github directive I want to provide a
file for this as well so let's say
template URL half dot component dot HTML
and we have to add that module ID thing
up here alright and then we'll create
that file so it's a new file app dot
component dot HTML alright and then in
here let's say test and then we'll put
that github directive back not fit up
save that and now you can see that we're
getting that test now what I want to do
is put a nav bar up here so I'm gonna go
to get bootstrap comm getting started
and examples and then the starter
template if we do a control you I'm
gonna grab the nav tag here and also the
container div copy that come over here
and let's paste that in okay now for the
navbar I'm going to get rid of this
class here navbar fix top and then I'm
going to change navbar inverse to navbar
default that'll make it a light color
and then for the project name let's say
github search and I'm going to get rid
of all the Allies we don't need any of
these save that and let's go back and
okay so that doesn't look right and I
think it's because we aren't we have a
stylesheet included in angular down here
we have Styles dot CSS I'm gonna just
get rid of everything in there and save
it alright so now we have a normal
navbar okay so let's go back to our app
component HTML and in the container
we're going to use the grid system a
little bit so let's do a row class okay
and then in that row we're gonna put a
column let's say div class equals call
md 8 i want to add an offset because i
only want it to be 8 columns but i want
it in the middle so we're gonna say call
md offset to
just like that and then I will say div
save that and now you can see it's
pushed more in the middle now what I
want to do is create a panel in our
github component so let's go to get
bootstrap and go to see components and
then panels and we want the panel with
heading so I'm going to grab this right
here copy it and paste that here and
we're gonna take the user dot name right
here copy that and then we can just get
that out and I'm going to put it in the
panel heading like that oh wait a minute
do I have to hear oh okay so I have to I
want to get rid of this no I want to get
rid of this one yeah let's get rid of
that and then put that user name here
all right let's see what that looks like
perfect okay so we have the user name in
the piano title now I want to have this
split as well I want to put the avatar
over here and then some other
information over here so in the body
we're going to have another row okay and
let's see let's do div class will say
call MD for yeah we'll try that for
and then we'll do an 8 column div now in
this column we want to have the avatar
so what we want to do is put an image
tag and then source all right and then
for the source we're gonna put in our
curly braces and say user dot avatar
underscore URL that should give us the
image all right there's a handsome guy
so we want to fit that to the div that
it's in so I'm going to give this a
class
let's give it a class of github avatar
and also IMG - thumbnail open input
class in here
there we go all right now on this side I
want to put some info now I'm gonna
paste this in because it's kind of a lot
and I'll just go through it push this
over a little all right so first we have
a bunch of labels and what I want to do
here is we want to show the number of
repositories and the number of gists
followers and following and we can get
that with these simple calls all right
now down here we're getting some more
information the user login name the
location the email the blog link and the
date that they use are joined so all of
this stuff comes in to us from that API
alright so let's go ahead and save that
alright so let's just put a line break
under the labels and there we go now
underneath here I want to have a list of
the users repositories so we're going to
need to make another call for that stuff
so let's go back to our service and
let's copy the get user and then change
that to get repos and then what we want
to do is just with this URL here after
the username we want to just add on to
it once they slash repos okay and that
will get all the repositories save that
let's go back to the github component
and let's copy this actually we don't
need the console log anymore
okay we'll copy that and then change
this to get repos okay I also want to
add a repos up here say any change this
to repos and change this as well
okay so now the repos should be
available to our view so let's go back
to our github component HTML and I want
another panel down here so I'm just
going to copy this one okay and then
we'll change the title here to actually
we'll keep the user name and then we'll
just do s and then repos okay and then
let's just get rid of everything that's
in this row so that four column div with
the image and then this a column div
okay let's look at that so far alright
so now we want to list all the repos and
I'm just going to paste this in and go
through it so basically what we're doing
is we're using ng four to loop through
those repos alright and then for each
one we're gonna have a row we're gonna
have a nine column div that's gonna have
an H for that has the repo name along
with a link to that repo and then right
under it we have a paragraph with the
description then in the third in the
three column row we're gonna have we're
going to show the number of Watchers and
the number of Forks this is all coming
in from that API alright let's go ahead
and save that and now you can see it's
listing all of those repos alright and
if we click on one of them takes us
right to the github page
alright so the functionality for showing
the user info is complete what we want
to do now is we want a way to be able to
switch the user alright so we want to
put an input box that will allow us to
put in a username so let's go to the
very top and above this div and let's
put
a role class okay we're gonna have
another div here which will be a twelve
column div let's put form and let's put
another div here a form group what would
I do that for it should be a dip alright
so in here we're gonna have our input
this will have a type of text we're
gonna give it a class of form control
which is a bootstrap class
let's give it a placeholder it'll say
add a username I'll say github username
and let's see we're gonna want to put an
NG model here because we want to bind it
so let's put brackets and then
parentheses and ng-model
okay we're going to set that equal to
username alright now we want an event
here when we start to type we want to
run a function alright so for an event
you want to use parentheses and it'll
say key up that's the the event we want
and then we'll run search
alright let's go ahead and save it okay
so that's that looks good now if we open
up the console and I click in and start
to type we get an error and that's
because that search function hasn't been
created so let's go back to our github
component ts file and we want to go
right under a constructor and create a
function called search now when we type
the user we want the service to update
with the new user all right so right
here let's say this dot underscore
github service dot update all right
we'll say update username all right and
then we're going to pass in this dot
user name and we have to define that up
here as well all right now we're getting
an error here because this doesn't exist
yet all right so let's save it and go to
our service and say update username okay
that's gonna take in username alright so
what we'll do why is that giving us an
error it's looking for our type so I'll
just put any actually notes to string
that should work alright and all we have
to do here is say this dot user name
equals user name
all right so this is giving us an error
let's just change this to any has to do
with the typing of it alright so that
should work let's save it and then go
back to the component to yes and what we
want to do is these two things get user
and get repo we want to run that when we
change the username so let's copy it and
just paste it right here save it and
let's see if we go ahead and start to
type okay so it changes as we type okay
so whatever username if we want to go
back to mine we can start to type Brad
traversÃ©e I'll just put my own name one
wrong and there we go alright so if you
don't want it to change like that like
as you're typing you could go back and
instead of the KeyUp event you could do
key up dot enter and then you can see as
I type it doesn't change but let's say I
want to search for Bob and I click enter
then it changes to that user alright so
you can do either way so that's
basically it I mean now if you don't
want to have a default like when we go
to the application if you don't want to
load a default profile what we could do
is in our component let's just get rid
of this in the constructor instead we'll
just say this dot user equals false
because remember in our template we're
checking for the user to be able to load
that stuff so if we save that now we
just get the input okay and if I type in
my username and click enter brings us to
that user
alright now the very last thing I want
to show you is if you do a certain
amount of requests in a certain amount
of time you're gonna start to get an
error and it's not gonna work so what
you need to do is create an application
in github and then just add the your
information and then get a client ID all
right so really quickly I'll show you
how to do that
alright so let's say create new github
app I'm not sure the exact URL alright
yeah this right here register new OAuth
alright so you'll have to log into
github once you do that let's say we
want github search and homepage URL you
can put anything you want here I'm just
going to put localhost
3,000 application description I'll say
get a search app and then the
authorization callback we can also click
localhost 3,000 so click register all I
guess we can't put that all we need to
put HTTP hopefully that works
there we go
all right so now you can see we have a
client ID and a client secret all we
need to do to implement this is to add
it to the request URLs so let's go to
our service and I guess the the cleaner
way to do it would be to put those as
properties so we could say client ID
equals it's a client secret and then
we'll just grab these yours will be
different okay I'll put that there and
then all you want to do is down in these
URLs we're going to let's see we're
going to concatenate question mark
client ID equals and then we're going to
concatenate this dot client ID and then
we need the hamper stamp client secret
equals and then we can do this dot
client secret all right so then what
