templates dotnet i'm here to show you
how you can download any of our
templates absolutely free and actually
get it installed and setup on your
website along with the actual content
and configuration of the template so we
can get your website a standard joomla
installation to look like any of these
templates you see here including the
images the content everything so on the
homepage we have some feature templates
but if you go up top and you click on
templates on in the main menu it'll take
you to a lot more and you can these a
categorized if you want to look at the
business we have all our business
templates health templates health and
fitness and sport which are all very
very nice especially for for a free
template so let's just say that you want
I don't let's say you want this be
healthy template so you click on the
link icon which will take you to the the
template information page and you click
the big red download template button and
that will immediately open up for you to
download the zip file so there's no
there is no rigmarole of registering on
our site or subscribing to an email
newsletter or something like that we
just give you the template so you want
to download that zip file I'm going to
download it to my desktop and let me
open up that file and show you what it
contains this is it's a basically a
joomla template if you've worked with
templates in the past or done some
template development we have the
index.php the component PHP the template
details xml file all the files and
folders you find inside of a joomla
template package
and I but we also include this data
folder and this includes an XML file
which has all the configuration and all
the data for the template and we'll be
able to import this after we install it
so what I'm going to do is they have a a
brand-new joomla 2.5 installation I
haven't touched anything at all it
doesn't have sample content installed so
what I'm going to do is log into the
back end of this i'm going to show you
how to set up this template in about
maybe three minutes or so look if i can
get in
alright so we want to just go to
extension manager and we're going to
install this just like any template I'm
going to choose the file and we want the
be healthy zip file so we upload that we
get a template success message now we
can go to the extension template manager
and if we click on the be healthy
template you want to check that and
let's make that the default template so
now if we go back to our front end and
reload we can see that the templates
changed now it doesn't look like that
that picture it doesn't look like this
that's because we haven't imported the
data yet all we need to do to do that is
go back to our template manager and
click on the be healthy template
and over here you can add a headline or
a slogan but then you see this button
import content from template that's what
we want to do so if we click that it
says this option will import articles
extensions and menus and will create a
new homepage so that's what we want so
we're going to click import
and it says that the content is
installed successfully so if we click
continue and then we go and visit our
home page and reload look at that we
have a beautiful content full template
that is just ready to go all you need to
do was is replace the text and the
images if you want you can add your own
info most of our templates come with a
main page and then a contact page the
contact page doesn't have a form it's
just an email and address page but if we
go back to our administration you can
see if we go to article manager you can
edit these pages we have the main page
in the contact us page obviously you can
add obviously you could add more pages
and you could also add new modules
you'll see these three down here these
should be modules the programs and clubs
services and updates so if we go to
module manager
content horizontal menu actually you
know what those are part of the main
page those on modules but it did give us
the footer modules for the one through
four to four which are these here and
different templates will have different
modules and different positions but that
is an extremely simple way to implement
a nice template and get something up and
going quick if you guys have any
questions at all you can email me at
info at free joomla templates net thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
