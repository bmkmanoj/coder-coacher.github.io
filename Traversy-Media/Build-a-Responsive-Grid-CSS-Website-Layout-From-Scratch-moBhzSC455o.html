video we're gonna create a responsive
grid CSS website or grid CSS theme and
it's not the prettiest thing in the
world but it's gonna teach you about the
fundamentals of the grid in a real
project which seems to be lacking on the
web and in tutorials but one great
resource is West bosses new grid CSS
course which is where I got the idea for
this project so I will put a link to
that course in the description ok we'll
also be looking at and using CSS
variables REM units things like that so
modern CSS techniques so basically just
to go through a real quick we have a
simple nav at the top which uses the
grid we have basically four different
sections for fractional x' then this
part here is the top container and we're
actually going to be using grid template
areas for this part which I actually
left out of my grid CSS crash course
because we ran out of time in that video
but we can basically assign named named
template areas to our grid which is
really cool and I actually created some
images to give you a visual
representation of how that works all
right and then underneath that we just
have some simple boxes here using some
font awesome icons will actually be
using font awesome 5 which was just
released these are actually SVG icons
and then below that we have the info
section which is basically just two
fractional Zoar to grid columns very
simple and then some images here coming
from unsplash these are just just some
gallery images and then a very simple
footer alright now we're not going to do
the inner pages if you guys want to take
it upon yourself and try to create those
pages on your own that would be a really
good learning experience and just to
show you the responsiveness of this
website if we go bigger you'll see that
it still looks good if we go down down
until we get about 700 pixels which is
right here you'll see that everything
changes so basically the menu goes
vertical
we have the showcase is now on its own
column on its own line and then the two
top boxes are side by side and then
these boxes are all side by side this
area the info area is just one big box
or one big area and then we have the
gallery images which are two side by
side and then if we go down to 500
pixels
okay that's 700 once we hit 500 you'll
see that everything is just in a single
row so this would be like on small
mobile devices okay we're gonna change
the grid template area up in the media
queries to make this responsive so
that's what we'll be building guys
hopefully you enjoy it let's jump into
it all right so we're gonna get started
now with most projects it's it's a
really good idea to follow along and
actually open your text editor and code
along with me it gives you a much better
learning experience than just watching
but it's up to you how you want to do it
if you do want to code along then just
go ahead and create a folder I called
mine grid biz and inside that folder you
want an index.html file and a style dot
CSS file and you can see they're both
completely empty and then I also have an
image folder an IMG folder with two
images one is showcase JPEG and one is
pik-wan dot JPEG and if you want to
download these directly you can go to
pixels comm and search for web and you
can see this image right here I grabbed
the medium and i named it showcase jpg
the other one I searched for business
and it's this one right here and I
downloaded the medium version as well
but if you want you can also get them
from the code pen in the description and
if you noticed my showcase is a little
darker because I made I faded it out a
little so that the text is a little more
prominent on top of it okay so let's go
ahead and get started
now we are going to be using font
awesome as well and then font awesome
just upgraded to version 5 which uses
SVG icons so we will be using that
but first let's jump into our HTML file
and let's add
our HTML had body tags now I'm using vs
code which comes with Emmet which allows
us to do shortcuts for HTML and CSS so I
can just do exclamation tab and that'll
give us our base layout and I'm just
gonna close this sidebar up if you are
using a different text editor I'd highly
suggest installing em it makes things
much much quicker so we'll go ahead and
change this title up to let's say grid
biz and then we're gonna want to use
font awesome so I'm gonna go to get
started and we're gonna use SVG with
JavaScript which is recommended so we
just want to grab this script tag right
here and we want to put this in the head
just like that and then here I'm just
gonna link our style sheet so style dot
CSS and save and we should be all set
for our head area now if you want you
can open up your index.html file or if
you're using vs code you can do what I'm
doing and use live server which is an
extension and if you want that you can
click on this icon search for a live
server and install it once you do that
you'll be able to right click and just
say open with live server and this gives
you auto reload so every time I save
it'll update I won't have to keep
reloading it alright so let's start in
the body now so everything is going to
be wrapped inside of a wrapper so I'm
gonna create a div with the class of
wrapper you want to make sure you stay
within this actually I'm gonna put a
comment right here that just says
wrapper ends ok so inside the wrapper
let's create our navigation I'm gonna
try to keep this commented for you guys
so navigation we're gonna use a nav tag
and give it a class of main - nav and
inside here we're gonna have a UL and
some allies let's put an a tag in here
these aren't actually gonna go anywhere
so I'm just gonna put a hash and then I
want a couple more of these so we're
gonna have four different navigation
items so this one will be about
this one will be services and this one
will be contact all right so that's our
navigation if I save that that should
show up it's gonna look ugly but it
shows up now notice how my HTML change
when I saved it that's because I'm using
an extension called prettier which
formats your whatever HTML CSS
JavaScript when you save I don't really
like having these on separate lines but
whatever it's fine
so it doesn't because it fixes a lot of
other stuff as well if you miss for
instance semicolons and your javascript
or css
so under the nav we're gonna do the top
container alright so the top container
is this right here it's the showcase and
these this is the top top box a and top
box B so let's go ahead and do that so
we're gonna do a section here with the
class of top container and inside here
we're gonna have a header the class of
showcase okay so the showcase is gonna
have an h1 and it's gonna say your web
presence your web presence and
underneath that we're gonna have a
paragraph now with Emmet you can do
lorem and then a number I'm gonna do 15
and then hit tab and it's gonna give me
15 words of dummy text okay under that
we want to have an a tag and I'm gonna
give this a class of BTN which is going
to be a custom button class that we
create so that we can make our links
look like buttons okay and we'll just
say read more and then that's it for the
showcase if I save it it should look
like that now still within the top
container section we're gonna do the
first top box so it's going to be a
class of top box and then another class
of top box a
okay and then inside here we're gonna
have an H for will say membership and
underneath that it's gonna have the
pricing that's gonna be in a paragraph
called price and this is gonna be $1.99
per month and then underneath that we'll
have an a tag and let's actually give
this a class of BTN and we'll say bye
now
all right so we're gonna have two of
these so I'm going to copy this whole
top box div and paste one right
underneath and we're going to change
this to top box B and then change this
to pro membership and then this is going
to be $2.99 per month okay so we can
save that and that's it for the top
container so next is going to be the
boxes section so I'll just say boxes
section and we're gonna use a section
tag with the class of boxes and then
each box will have a class of box okay
and then each one of these we're gonna
have an icon so let's put an eye tag
with the class actually I'll just show
you let's go to font awesome
and go to icons this first one is going
to be a chart icon so I'm going to
search for chart and I want this one
here and if we go down it gives us the
class of FA s and then FA cha chart Pi
so I can actually just copy that and put
that there
alright now if I save this and we take a
look you'll see that the icons are very
very small by default so I'm going to
add another class in here called FA - 4
X and save that'll make it basically
four times the size okay so that's our
icon underneath that we're going to have
an h3 and it's gonna say analytics and
then under that we're gonna have a
paragraph I'm gonna do lorem 10 tab
which will give us 10 words and then
we'll basically just let's just copy
that whole box div and put it in 3 more
times we want for that
things and save and now we just want to
change up the icons so the second icon
is gonna be a globe fa globe and then
the heading here is gonna be marketing
okay and then this icon here
this is gonna be FA - cog it's gonna be
a little gear icon and for the the
heading we're gonna say development and
then this last icon is gonna be FA users
FA - users and then this heading is
gonna be support ok we're going to leave
the same paragraph text that doesn't
matter so that's it for the boxes
section now we're gonna move on to the
info section so for this we're gonna do
section with the class of info and
inside here we'll put our image the
image is going to be in the IMG folder
and it's going to be called pic 1 dot
jpg ok underneath that we're gonna have
a div and inside the div 11 h2 and we're
gonna say your business on the web
underneath that will have a 30 word
paragraph so I'm gonna do lorem 30 tab
and then under that we're gonna have an
a tag with the class of BTN and the text
will just say learn more alright we'll
save that and that's our info section ok
and the image is going to be huge don't
worry about it all the stuff is going to
look very ugly until we get to our CSS
alright so next we have the portfolio
section
okay so in here we're basically gonna
have nine images and the images are
gonna come from unsplash.com which just
kind of generates random images for us
so it's gonna be HTTP source dot
unsplash.com slash random slash and then
the size which is going to be 200 by 200
okay 200 X 200 now I'm gonna go ahead
and copy this and put it in 8 more times
so that's 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 all together
and save and now you'll notice that all
the images are the exact same and I
don't want that so to change the image
all we have to do is change the size so
the second image I'm just gonna put the
first 200 I'm gonna make 201 and save
and notice that now that's a different
image so I'm gonna go to the next one
and do 3 4 5 and the size doesn't matter
because the images are contained within
the container within their parent so
that really doesn't matter so 7 wait 0 1
I forgot to I mean it doesn't really
matter but I like it 1 through 9 or 1
through 8 sorry alright so we'll save
that and now if we go down here we have
all different images okay so that's that
next thing we'll do is the footer that's
the last thing on the page so I'm just
going to do a footer tag very simple
we're just gonna put a paragraph and
we'll say what is this grid biz let's do
a copyright symbol so ampersand copy
semicolon 2018 oops
okay and that's it that's it for our
HTML so now we're gonna go to our CSS
which is the hard part in the long part
and we're only to start off by creating
some CSS variables why can i spell
variables okay so if you guys have never
used CSS variables don't worry about it
it's not difficult at all if you want
you can go and check out my video on CSS
variables I did about a month ago or so
but basically what we're gonna do is
just define a scope of route so any
variables that we create in here we can
use throughout this whole stylesheet
throughout anywhere we're not restricted
to certain elements so we're just gonna
have four variables one is gonna be
primary so each variable is prefixed
with a - - primary color is gonna be ddd
in hex which is just a very light grey
we're also gonna have one called dark
which will be three three three will
have a light which will be white which
is just triple F and then also for the
shadow if you notice if we look at the
final theme here all of these boxes they
all have this box shadow so I want to
put that in a variable so that we can
easily access it so it's going to be
zero one pixels five pixels and then RGB
a and the color we want is going to be
104 three times and then for the Alpha
the opacity is going to be zero point
eight all right so that's it for our
variables so we can use these throughout
our CSS now so let's go and create our
HTML CSS so we're gonna say box sizing
and we're gonna set that to border box
that'll make it so that if we use any
padding or anything it doesn't affect
the width of the element we're also
gonna set the font family here to arial
helvetica sans-serif but of course if
you want to use something different
that's fine and then the base color I'm
going to use
is a variable so I need to save var and
then pass in the variable I want which
is gonna be the dark all right so now
I'm gonna do the body so for the body
I'm gonna give it a background of CCC
which is a very light grey I didn't put
that in a variable because this is the
only time I'm using it so it would be
kind of redundant let's add a margin now
I'm not using a container I'm not
restricting the the wrapper of our
website I want it to be full width but I
do want to have a little margin on the
all sides of the website so we're gonna
do let's see we'll do 30 pixels top and
bottom 50 left and right okay and then
we're gonna give it a line height of 1.4
all right there we go so next thing
we're gonna work on is the button the
BTN class because that's kind of a
global class we're using it all
throughout the site so I'm going to give
it a background color of our variable
are dark variable and then the color
which is the text I'm gonna give it the
light color okay and then we're gonna
give it some padding now I'm going to
try to use REM units rather than pixels
just because it's more responsive so
we're gonna do 0.6 REM on the top and
bottom and 1.3 on the left and right and
one REM is just a multiplier for the the
root HTML font size which by default is
16 pixels so one REM by default is going
to be 16 pixels
okay 1.3 is going to be whatever 16
pixels x 1.3 is and I have a whole video
on remand m units if you want to check
that out all right so let's see we also
want to remove the underline so
text-decoration we're gonna set to none
and then also border we're gonna set
that to 0
okay and there's our buttons and let's
see we're gonna go ahead and say that
all the images we want the width or
we'll set a max width rather to 100%
because we want the images to stay
within their containers within their
parents okay and then for the wrapper
that goes around everything we're gonna
display that as a grid and we want to
give it a grid gap okay which is the
spacing in between everything that way
we don't have to manually assign all of
our margins and stuff so we'll say 20
pixels for that okay so that's kind of
the core styles now we're gonna work on
each section we're gonna start with the
navigation up top so I'll put in the
comment here say navigation and that has
a class of main nav and we want the UL
okay so this is gonna be display grid
just like most things and we're gonna
say grid gap 20 pixels and let's set
padding to zero because by default you
ELLs have padding and then set the list
style to none we don't want any bullets
and then we're gonna set the grid
template columns okay now for the
columns we have four links right so we
can do one fractional four times like
this and save and it'll do that it'll
spread it at spread it apart basically
for different sections a shorter way to
write this though would be to use a
repeat and say repeat four times one
fractional and save and it gives us the
same thing okay now we want to style
each individual link so we're going to
go down here and say main nav
and we want the background to be the
primary color so we're gonna use our
variable of primary okay then we're
gonna set the display to block and we're
gonna set the text decoration to none we
don't want any underlines we're gonna
set some padding I'm gonna use REM so
we'll say 0.8 REM and let's make them
aligns to the center so text align
Center and for the color of the text
we're gonna use the dark color the
variable we have okay and then let's
also make an uppercase so we'll do text
transform uppercase and let's do font
size 19 pixels actually it's not used
let's do one do one point one REM see
what that looks like and then box shadow
we're gonna use our shadow variable that
we created above all right we'll save
that and that looks good now I do want a
hover State so what we'll do is we'll
say main - nav a:hover
and all we're gonna do is reverse this
so I'll just gonna copy this background
here and see yeah so wait a minute yeah
primary alright so we're just gonna make
the background doc when we hover and
then the color and grab this the color
we're gonna make light
so if we save that we hover there we go
so now we get the dark background so
let's move on to the top container by
the way if you guys don't know to make a
call up to make a comment like that I
just do control /and vs code I don't
know if that's an Emmet thing of what I
think I don't think so but that'll make
the comment for you before you actually
type it all right so let's create a
class of top container not create but
style it and we're gonna display it as a
grid and we're gonna do a grid gap of 20
pixels all right so this is where we're
gonna do our grid template area so let's
type out grid - template areas and we
don't want to do that I'm gonna go on
the next line here and I'm gonna first
type this out and then I'm gonna explain
it and I'm gonna give you a visual
representation of it so I'm gonna say
showcase showcase top box a and then I'm
gonna go on the next line put another
set of quotes and say showcase showcase
and then top box B okay and then we just
need to end that with a semicolon now if
I save that I mean it's it you can see
it's set as a grid but it's not really
doing anything yet because we just set
template areas we didn't actually assign
them but let me just bring over an image
real quick to show you that if we look
at this I have this yellow overlay over
the showcase and over the top boxes and
it's the exact same format as this right
here as this text we have our showcase
showcase top box a and then our showcase
showcase top box B okay so we basically
want the showcase to take up two columns
this way and
and have one of the top box a we also
wanted to take up two rows this way okay
the grid system is two-dimensional
unlike flexbox which is just one
dimensional so we can make this take up
that we can make it go this way too and
then we have our top box B over here so
you can use these grid template areas as
just that as templates and you can kind
of see how your content is gonna look
just within your CSS all right and I
also have some images for when we change
this up for the responsive versions as
well all right so what we need to do now
is we need to assign out our grid area
so let's put let's do showcase so we
have our class of showcase and this is
what we're going to assign we're gonna
say grid area and assign it to showcase
because if we don't do this it doesn't
know what this means showcase so we're
assigning it here alright and then we're
gonna go down here and we're gonna
assign our top box a to grid area top
box a and we want to do the same thing
with B so I'll copy that we'll change
this to B and also change this to be
okay let's add our semicolons and save
and there we go so now we have our
showcase going this way all the way over
to here and then our top box a and B
okay just like this image now we just
need to add our separate styling to each
thing so let's go back to our showcase
and let's go ahead and add a min height
of 400 pixels okay and I could set this
to to anything if I set it to 800 pixels
and save you'll see that this the top
boxes will also extend along with the
showcase okay but we're gonna put that
back to 400 and then we're gonna add our
background
all right so this is gonna be a URL and
it's gonna be in the image folder and
then it's gonna be showcase dot JPEG all
right now I don't want to just zoomed in
on the laptop like that so I'm going to
change the background size to cover and
we're gonna set the background position
to center and save and there we go all
right let's see let's also add some
padding so we'll say padding 3 R M so
that's 16 times 3 and when you use REMS
you can you can see the the pixels if
you want if you go down in your
development tools here whoops into
elements and spring this up and if we go
down here let's see where's font size
wait and I'm not looking for font size
I'm looking for padding which is right
here 48 pixels all right so three REMS
is 48 pixels because 16 times 3 is 48
all right so next thing we want to do is
align this stuff you can't you can
barely see it because we need to change
the color but the heading the paragraph
and I'm actually gonna use flexbox to do
this now one misconception is that if
you use grid you can't use flex blocks
at all now what I like to do is use the
grid to layout the site layout all the
boxes all the areas of the site or the
the UI of the application and then I'll
use flexbox to align things inside of
those elements all right if that makes
sense so we're gonna say display flex so
if I do that automatically it's gonna
just make it go everything go horizontal
so of course I want that as a column so
I'm gonna say flex direction we're gonna
set that to a column so it goes back
down the other way all right and then
just some alignments we're gonna say
align items to the start and let's say
justify content to the center which will
move it down all right and then I'm also
going to add a but the shadow to the the
showcase so we'll say box shadow and
we're gonna use our variable that we
created of shadow all right so now let's
do the inner elements the h1 and the
paragraphs so we're gonna go down here
and say showcase each one and let's add
let's say font size I'm gonna make it
bigger so I'm gonna use for R M and
let's do margin bottom zero so that the
paragraph and the heading can come
closer together and then let's do the
color of
light so VAR light okay there we go now
let's do the paragraph so go right here
and say showcase paragraph and let's do
font size and I'm gonna say 1.3 R M
let's do margin top zero and let's do
color and we'll use our light variable
and save and there we go selects pretty
good so I'm gonna go down here and I'm
gonna put a comment here for top box so
we already have our styles for top box a
and B now we want for just top box
because both of them have that class we
want to add a background of primary
which is the color that these the navbar
items have so we'll say background is
gonna be var primary we'll save that
good and then let's also display grid
okay so everything and it will be
displayed as a grid and we'll align the
items to the center and let's justify
the items to the center and then I'm
also gonna give it that shadow so we'll
say box shadow and set it to the
variable of shadow all right and then
we're gonna do padding which will be 1.5
REM and Save and there we go now the
price needs to be much bigger so we're
gonna go let's see I guess we could do
all right here we'll say top box price
and let's set the font size to 2.5 REMS
and there we go so that's the top
container that's all set now we're going
to go down to the boxes and just to show
you if I make this smaller the
responsiveness hasn't kicked in yet
you'll see it's and it's not responsive
at all whatsoever we need to add our
media queries and we're going to do that
in a little bit but let's move on to the
boxes so remember we have a section with
the class of boxes we're going to
display that as a grid and we're gonna
give it a grid gap of 20 and then we're
gonna do our grid template columns all
right now you have a few options here if
you know that these are gonna be for
across all the time you could do what we
did with the nav which is right here
just for one fr-s but I want to make it
kind of I guess more responsive where
you could add more boxes if you want I
also want to make it so that we don't
have to keep changing these the grid
template columns when we get to a
certain size because obviously four
across is too many when you get down to
it a small width so the solution to this
is going to be to say repeat and then
we're gonna say
autofit and then we're gonna use this
min/max
function that comes with the grid and
inside here we're going to say we want a
minimum of 200 pixels and then one
fractional max of one fractional okay so
that's gonna put it all put them four
across and if I make this smaller
if I make this smaller you'll see that
it'll actually they'll go on the next
line so we don't have to specify the
template columns for each media query
for each size it'll kind of do it itself
alright so I think that that's a good
way to do it so now what we want to do
is style each individual box I want to
give it a background and stuff so let's
say box and it's going to have
background and we'll use the primary
variable we also want to align
everything to the center and let's add
some padding so I'm going to do 1.5 rim
on the top and bottom and two on the
left and right and then let's add a box
shadow and we'll use our shadow variable
and save and there we go all right so
let's move on to the info section which
is really easy so we're gonna say dot
info and let's add our background we're
gonna use the primary I'm just gonna
copy this and we're also gonna have the
Box shadow whoops
copy that and then we'll do display grid
let's add a grid gap I'm gonna use 30
here just to push it apart a little more
and then let's do our grid template
columns and I'm gonna this is going to
be really simple I just want to do two
fractional Zoar one fr one fr I'm just
going to use repeat so we'll say repeat
twice one fr and that will just split it
in half okay and then finally I just
want some padding which will be three
REM and save and there we go so it's
just split into basically two columns so
now we need to do the portfolio so
portfolio is going to display as grid
and let's give it a grid gap of 20 and
then for the grid template columns I'm
gonna do the same thing I did here and
autofit except actually is out so what I
want
yeah that should do it so if we save
that good and display a grade' grid gap
all right so for the images for the
images I'm gonna make sure that the
width is a hundred percent of its
container and then we also want the box
shadow which will be our variable and
Save and there we go
all right good so now we just need the
footer which is very simple I'll just
use the footer tag as our selector and
we're gonna say margin top to REM
background is gonna be the dark color
and then the color will be the light
color okay let's make sure it's text
aligned to the center and let's add a
padding of one rim okay and there's our
footer all right so that's the just the
the regular website now we need to work
on the media queries okay which isn't
too difficult so let's do that down here
so we're gonna do a 700 and a 500 media
query so let's say media so for the max
width of 700 pixels so anything we put
in here will only be ineffective for 700
pixels or less so first thing we'll do
is the top container okay we want to
change up the grid template areas all
right what why keeps doing that so let's
take a look at this now I have another
image that we can look at so this is
what I want it to look like and remember
that the the format of our text is gonna
look just like this so we want showcase
showcase should take up the whole thing
and then top box a and top box B so
let's go ahead and do that okay I'm
gonna make it so this still shows so we
can see this and let's put in showcase
showcase go on the next line and you
guys probably know what I'm gonna do top
box a and top box B oops that should
have a slot I - all right so if I save
this and we go down to 700 pixels right
there it changes okay so that should
this grid template areas makes it now
change to this style this format all
right now some other things I want to do
is I want the h1 to shrink up a little
so we're going to say showcase h1 and
we're gonna set that font size to 2.5
remm all right let's also do the menu I
mean I guess it looks okay here but when
it gets smaller you can see that and
also if we were to add more links so
we're gonna actually make this we're
going to chain
the grid template columns right now it's
for 1/2 hours across we want to make it
just one fr for each one so each one
goes all the way across alright so we'll
say main nav ul and we'll say grid
template columns and just simply one fr
and there we go
alright so let's see what else we want
to do this stuff is fine the info I want
this to be one fr as well so what I'll
do is just copy this and I'm gonna
change this to info so that way info is
also one fr and it's just you know one
big block all right now the button here
I want this to go all the way across and
be displayed as a block level element so
I'm gonna say info dot BTN and we're
gonna display it as a block and let's
see let's make it with actually we don't
need to do that I'll just say
text-align:center and let's do margin
Auto and save and there we go so that
looks a lot better and that should be it
for 700 pixels that looks good now when
we go down to 500 just so when we go
down like this you can see that this
it's it no longer looks good so we want
to again change the grid template areas
so I have one more image to pull over
and this is what we want now so we want
showcase top box a top box B so let's
create another media query
this is going to be for max with 500
pixels and what I'll do is just copy
this and paste that in and then I want
to change it to this showcase top box a
top box B so on this top one we just
want showcase the second one we want
just top box a the last one we want top
box B let's save and go back and there
we go so now everything is in a single
line it's all stacked and it's
completely responsive even on very small
mobile devices alright guys so that's
