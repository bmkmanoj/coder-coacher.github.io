we're going to create a simple REST API
using the go programming language and
this is also going to be kind of an
intro to the language and how to get
things set up now I know a majority of
my subscribers are JavaScript developers
PHP developers Python and so on but if
you're looking to learn a new language
go may be a really good idea I've been
studying it for a while and I really do
like it I'm actually thinking of doing a
course on it it's very powerful for
things like Network and web applications
it's incredibly scalable since it's a
new language it which it was basically
created to run on newer hardware it has
really rich support for concurrency it's
just a good choice if you're looking to
learn a new language alright so with
that said even if you've never written
the line of golang if you understand the
principles of how restful api is work
then you'll be able to follow along with
this just fine and like I said I'll also
explain some of the the language syntax
and things like that as we move along
now since this is an introductory level
tutorial we're not going to implement a
database we will be using hard-coded
mock data but it will be a full crud API
we'll be able to create read update and
delete books and we're going to use
postman to make our request to the API
alright so the point of this video was
really to show you how to set up a goal
in project how it works look at some
basic syntax and how and show you how it
works with HTTP so we can create a REST
API alright so with that said let's go
ahead and get started this video is
sponsored by GPD host they offer a
variety of affordable hosting plans with
flexible billing cycles these plans
include a free ssl certificate a free
domain name website builder and many
other services including free website
migration with no downtime to find out
more visit GPD host com or click the
link in the description below alright so
I already have go install it's very easy
to install no matter what you're on
Windows Mac or Linux just go to
golang.org click download go
and just go ahead and follow the
instructions for whatever OS you're
using Windows it's just a simple
installer which I've already done I've
already gone through all right I'll also
be using Visual Studio code as my text
editor which also has a really nice go
extension and some go packages to help
your development since I'm using Windows
I'm using get bash is my terminal
because I don't like the standard
Windows command line and will also be
using a third-party router called MUX
which is very popular for the go
language and to install it we just
simply run this go get command alright
so those are basically the tools that
we'll be using so I'm going to go ahead
and just open up my terminal like I said
I'm using git bash so I'm gonna open
that up I'm gonna run it as an
administrator and we want to create a
project in our go path okay so you're go
pass by default is gonna be in your
users slash your user name slash go
directory and I just want to pull up a
page real quick in the docs if we go to
documents and we go to how to write go
code you want to is this shows you how
to structure like your big applications
we're just gonna basically have one file
but we want to create a directory in our
go path in source github.com slash and
then your user name slash and then your
project alright so we're gonna go ahead
and do that so let's say MK dir so make
directory - P and then we're gonna use
our go path variable on a sign go path
slash source slash github.com slash my
username which is Brad Travis e slash
and then I'm gonna call the project REST
API REST API
alright so now I'm just gonna use the
Windows Explorer to show you real quick
if I go to my users folder so C drive
users Brad and let's see it's not there
I guess my go path wasn't set so to set
my go path if your
on Windows you can do export go path
equals and then money sign home slash go
okay and that should set it and I'm just
gonna run that command once again
alright so now you can see there's a
folder called go we have source github
calm
Brad Travis II and rest API so this is
our project folder so I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm just gonna open this with Visual
Studio code alright now like I said you
should definitely install the go
extension so if I click on the
extensions icon you can see I already
have it installed it's the one by Luke
Obon there's 2.1 million downloads it's
very popular and it's very very helpful
as in terms of intellisense and just
code hinting stuff like that so let's
see what we'll do here is create a new
file and we're gonna call this main dot
go now once you do that if you're in vs
code you'll get this drop down about
different packages to help you out I'm
gonna go ahead and click install all and
that's going to install all these
different packages which are just kind
of like helpers to help you along with
your development ok and as far as my
terminal I'm using my integrated
terminal in vs code you can go to view
integrated terminal or you can just hit
the control backtick and you can toggle
it that way
alright so we're ready to start writing
go so I'm gonna do just a little
introduction first so every main file
you want to define package main and then
we can import packages from there okay
so you can kind of thing I'm going to do
a lot of comparison with JavaScript and
no js' you can kind of think of this as
importing node packages you have local
packages like HTTP and path and then you
have remote packages so we're gonna
import first just a package called fmt
which is the formatter
and this basically has a bunch of print
command so we can print to the console
because I just want to give you a simple
example of running an app alright so in
addition to this we need a
function called main now in go when you
define a function you need to use the
func keyword so func main and we don't
have to call this explicitly like that
it just runs on its own and in here I'm
just gonna say format our dot print Ln
and then we want to just put in double
quotes okay you want to use double
quotes with go and we'll just say hello
world and we'll save that okay so now to
run this to test this file out we can go
to the terminal and we can say go run
and then the name of the file which is
main go and you see we get hello world
alright now if I want to compile this
and build this out I can say go build
build if I can spell it right and now if
you look up here you'll see we have a
REST API dot exe file okay so that
simple command created an exe file from
our program and to run it we can just
say dot slash and then the name of the
file which is rest API and it runs our
file
alright so that's what we'll be doing to
actually run our server when we create
it okay so none of this really has
anything to do with the rest API I just
want to give you a little introduction
of how to set up a file alright now
we're not going to need the formatter
we're not going to use that we can get
rid of that and get rid of that line but
there are a bunch of other things we
need to bring in so we're working with
Jason so we want to bring in encoding
slash Jason okay which is basically a
core package we don't have to install it
or anything we're gonna bring in log
which will log errors and stuff like
that we're gonna bring in our net slash
HTTP package to work with HTTP and
that's what you use to create api's and
stuff I'm also going to bring in a small
package called math math is actually its
own package but I want to bring in Rand
because when we create a book ok we're
using books for our resource I want to
add the ID as a random number so we're
just going to use this to generate a
random number
and then I also want to convert that to
a string so I'm going to bring in a
package called STR Co and V so string
convert alright and then we also want to
bring in a router called MUX which is a
third-party router I can't remember if I
showed you that at the beginning I think
I did but basically this is the github
page and we can install it using this
command here so let's go get - you and
then the github page or the github link
so I'm gonna copy that and we'll go down
here and just paste that in and then
once that runs and installs if I go to
my go path and go to source github calm
you can see we have a bunch of stuff
here now but if you look we have
guerilla and then MUX
so that was installed in our go path so
now we can bring that in by just saying
github.com slash guerilla slash MUX
alright so that's all of our imports I
figured we just get all of those out of
the way alright so now what we're gonna
do is go to our main function in first
thing we're gonna do in here is a knit
the router the MOX router so we're gonna
create a variable you can call it
anything I'm going to just call it R you
can call it router and we're gonna say
colon equals MUX dot new router alright
now if you've never worked with go
before this colon equals may look a
little weird and basically what this is
doing it's its type and inference
because go is a statically typed
language like Java c-sharp typescript if
you've worked with angular and
typescript then you've worked with types
but basically if I were to create a
variable called age we could save our
age yes far just like JavaScript and
then we would say that this is going to
be an int and then we'd set the value
now there is something called type
inference where we could actually just
do instead age colon equals and then the
value and then this is just going to
look at this and see that this is an
integer and it's going to give it that
time
so you'll see this quite a bit in going
alright so now that we have our router
variable what we're gonna do is create
our route handlers which will establish
our endpoints for our API and we do this
using the router and then a method
called handle func
alright so in handle func it's gonna
take in two things make sure you use
double quotes that's one thing that
threw me off because I usually use
single quotes in JavaScript also
semicolons you can use semicolons and go
but most of the time you're not going to
see them they're automatically inserted
after you know when you run your code
but in here we want to put our route so
it's gonna be slash books actually let's
do let's do slash API slash books and
then second parameter is gonna be the
function we want to run which I'm going
to say get books okay and then we need
to do dot methods because it needs to
know it needs to know which type of HTTP
method to use and we're gonna use a get
so this will be a get request alright so
let's go ahead and let's just copy this
five times I think and this next one
will also be a get but it's gonna call a
function called get book and it's also
gonna have an ID so we're gonna do slash
curly brace ID and that's gonna get a
single book this next one will be to API
books and it's gonna be a function
called create book and this will be a
post request so I'm gonna change this to
post alright this will be the update so
this will be a put request and the
function name will be update book and
the endpoint is gonna be books slash and
then we need the ID in there so it knows
which one to update all right same thing
with the delete that's gonna be books
slash ID
gonna call a function called delete book
and then the method is going to be
delete as well all right so now we have
our endpoints and our route handlers now
to run the server we're gonna do that in
the main as well to run the server we
take our HTTP package and we have a
method called listen and serve so this
is similar to app dot listen in node and
Express ok it's gonna take in the port
so we'll stay : 8,000 and then we also
need to pass in the router which we gave
the variable of our ok now in addition
to this I'm going to just wrap it in log
dot fatal that way if it fails we get a
we throw an error alright remember we
brought in that log package that's what
you're using that for alright and that
will start the server now it'll it'll
throw an error now because we defined
all these route handlers with functions
but we don't have the actual functions
yet ok but before we create the
functions we're gonna actually set up
our model so we're gonna go above the
main and we're gonna create our strux
ok so book struct and that's basically
our model now a struct that should have
an iron it struct is is kind of like a
class it's used for object oriented
programming in golang it can have it can
have properties and methods it works
very very similar to an es6 class or a
Java or C sharp class so to define a
struct we say type name it and call it
book and then struct and then we're
going to set our properties so we're
gonna have an ID and we're gonna set
that to a string and then what we want
to do is set our jason so we're gonna
put some back ticks and say Jason colon
and then ID in lowercase so this will be
the jason field that we fetch okay this
is basically
the property of the field or the struct
and then we have the Jason field okay so
what I'm gonna do here is just copy this
four times we're gonna for these and
then we're gonna have an ISBN okay these
will all start with capitals just tap
that over and then inside the Jason this
will be lowercase
ISBN alright and then this here will be
the title of the book and then we're
gonna change this to title and then down
here this is gonna actually be the
author so author and then this is gonna
have its own struct author so we're
gonna do asterisk author and change this
to author
okay so let's create a separate struct
for the author and basically I'm just
gonna have a first name and last name
but you can add other stuff if you want
the author's company or whatever it may
be so let's say type author struct and
we're gonna set let's say first name
which will be a string and we'll say put
in our backticks jason lowercase first
name
all right and then we'll do the same
thing for last name this will be last
name and that should be good so that's
basically our model so now what we want
to do is create these functions all
these get books get book and so on so
this one will get all books so we're
gonna say func get books like that now
any route handler function has to take
in a response and request
just like in nodejs we do app get and
then we have whatever our route and then
we have a function that has request
response we're kind of doing that same
kind of thing so we're gonna put in a
variable of W here and it's gonna have a
type but it's going to be a special type
from the HTTP package called response
writer all right and then the second
parameter will be R and that's gonna
have a type of asterisk HTTP dot request
okay so that's kind of like our response
and request so every function that we
create that as a route handler has to
have these two properties are these two
parameters so I'm gonna go ahead and
just copy that and let's just create all
these I think there's five of them all
right and then we'll just change them up
so let's see this one here will be
to get single book and this is gonna be
get book instead of get books this one
will be to create a new book so this one
will be called create book create oops
create book can't spell today and this
one will be to update the book so update
book and then this one will be to delete
so this will be delete book like that
alright so I'm gonna save this and we
shouldn't have any errors now we can
start the server so I'm gonna go down
here and I'm gonna say go build and then
we're gonna run dot slash REST API all
right you see how it's just kind of
staying there that's because the server
is running and if I were to open up my
browser and go to localhost oops
localhost port 8000 we get 404 page not
found because that's not a row remember
our routes are slash API slash books and
we get nothing and that's fine because
we we have basically it's calling get
books which there's nothing there
alright now we're gonna add some mock
data just to test things out so we're
gonna go down to the main function we're
gonna put this right under where we
initialize the router so just say mock
data and we need let's see we're gonna
define a variable up up top here under
where we created our Struck's
and see it will put it right here and
we're gonna say in it books variable as
a slice book struct
okay now a slice if you've never worked
with goal before a slice is basically a
variable length array because arrays are
you need to define the length so you
need to say this array is going to have
five values or three values or whatever
a slice however is variable so that's
what we want to use so we're gonna
create a variable called books we're
gonna say it's of the book type or the
book struct but it's also a slice
because it's gonna be a collection of
books all right so now we'll go down
here to the main and in the main we're
going to set books and we want to append
to it so we're gonna use the append
function and I'm just gonna put a to do
right here I'll say to do implement
database so we'll do that at some other
point
so append two books and we want a book
okay so this is basically the struct
kind of like a class and we want ID of
one should be a string
ISBN so for that I'm just gonna make
something up and let's see what else it
gets a title so for the title I'm just
gonna say book one you just put a space
here all right so we have ID
ISBN in title now we want the author so
author is gonna be a little different
we're gonna just going to say author
because it's it's own struct and then
what we want to do is set it to
ampersand author and in here I'm gonna
put another set of curly braces and then
put our first name which I'll say John
and then last name
I'll say Doh this should actually be
capital L all right so when we're
defining these you want to use your
property name so the capitalized version
when we output the Jason it'll be the
lowercase version so that is a single
book so what I'm gonna do is just copy
this and we'll go ahead and just change
some things
here so we'll change the ID to two let's
change the ISBN to just something we'll
call the title book two
I'll change the author I'll say Steve
Smith okay so now we have some mock data
so now we're gonna do is go up to let me
just save this make sure we have no
errors all right so I'm gonna go up to
the get books and this one's gonna be
really easy we're just gonna take Jason
and we're gonna say new encoder so Jason
new encoder and we want to pass in the
response writer so that's the variable
of W and then we want to do dot encode
and then we're gonna pass in our books
variable okay now one other thing we're
going to do right above it is we want to
set the header value of content type to
application slash Jason or else is just
going to get served as text and we can
do that by taking that W and calling a
header dot set and then inside here we
can say we want to set the content type
and we want to set it to application
slash Jason all right and that's it we
should be able to fetch our books fry it
from what we have in here so I'm gonna
save this and I'm gonna open up postman
which actually don't have installed on
this
virtual machine so I'm gonna grab that
real quick I'll say postman client I'm
gonna go to get postman com grab the
standalone version for Windows 64 and
download that
sorry about that guys I thought I had
this installed alright so now that
that's downloaded we'll go ahead and
install it okay so I think I have an
account but I'm just gonna go straight
to the app and close this page out and
now let's make a request actually you
know what before we make the request we
need to rebuild it so what I'm gonna do
is stop with control see stop the server
and I'm gonna say let's clear this out
and I'm gonna do go build double
ampersand and then dot slash rest API
that way we can do both at once we can
rebuild it and we can run the server
alright so now let's go to postman and
let's do a get request to HTTP localhost
port 8000 slash API slash books and
let's send and there we go so now you
can see up here we have a status 200
which is good that's okay and we have
our data so we have our ID 1 book and
our ID 2 and you can see we have our
author which is an embedded into that
object with the first name and last name
so that works now we're gonna move on to
do the single book so it would be this
get book function which is going to be a
little different we're gonna still use
this we want to make sure it's Jason
Jason content type but we want to get
the ID and the way that we get that is
we're going to define a params
we're going to set it
mucks okay which is our router and we
can use VARs and then we're gonna pass
in the request so the R and this will
get any params and then we basically
need to loop through the books and find
the one with the correct ID so let's a
loop through books and find with ID so
we're gonna say 4 and this is gonna look
a little weird if you've never used go
we're gonna say 4 underscore item and
then we're going to use a range so we're
gonna say equal to range books and range
is used to basically loop through other
data structures it could be a map or in
this case a slice or something like that
remember books is a slice so once we do
that we want to do an if statement and
we want to see if the item so item is is
basically our iterator
so for each books book it goes through
we can access it with item and we want
to check to see if the item ID is equal
to the params ID okay so the ID that's
in the URL if it is okay so if it is
then we're gonna say Jason dot new
encoder and pass in our response writer
and then call encode just like we did
above and the other and the other one
and we're gonna just output that item
the single book okay and then we want to
make sure we just return from this and
then we're gonna go down below the for
the for loop here and say Jason dot new
encoder W dot encode and then we're
gonna pass in here sorry about that bang
and man this is their really aggravating
me and then we're gonna say amber stamp
book and then some curly braces all
right so this should
turn just a single book so let's try it
we'll save it and we'll go to our
postman actually first of all we're
gonna restart the server so ctrl C and
then we'll run go build and our REST API
again and then let's make a request I
get request API books slash one and send
and there we go we get our single book
if we do two and send we get book 2
alright so that's all set now we want to
work on creating a new book so we're
gonna grab this again application Jason
and we're gonna go under that and create
a variable called book set it to the
book struct and then we're gonna just
set up an underscore equal to jason dot
new decoder whoops not encode our new
decoder and in here we're gonna pass in
the body so we can get that from the
request dot body and that we want to do
dot decode and then pass in our amber
sam book like that okay now what we want
to do is set we need to create an ID for
our new book so we're gonna save book
dot ID and this is where we're going to
use both of the the math rand that i
brought in which actually is gone the
reason it's gone is because the tools
that are built in with the go extension
if you're not using the packages you
import then they disappear which I
really don't like so we're going to make
sure we bring in math Rand and also the
other one was STR CO and V so string
converter alright so we want those and
then we'll go back down here and we're
going to set the ID equal to R and and
then what we can do to generate an
integer is we can say int
and we want to generate an integer
between one and ten what are we gonna do
ten billion ten million so we'll do 10 1
2 3 1 2 3 like that now this needs to be
a string so we're gonna wrap this in the
STR CO and V dot and then that has a
method called eye TOA so this will
convert an integer to a string so we
make sure we want to wrap it in that so
that'll create an ID now this this is um
this is a mock ID this is not I'm just
gonna say not safe this isn't something
you'd use in production because it could
it could generate the same ID I mean
it's it's a you know it's very slim
chance but it could and it's not
something you'd want to do in production
but this is just for example so now what
we're going to do is say books talking
about our global books variable right
here and we want to set this equal to a
pend because we want to add to it so we
want to add on two books we want to add
our single book ok and then we simply
want to do this once again ok because
we're just gonna output that single book
except this should just be book so what
should happen is it should add the book
and there's no database is just gonna be
adding it basically to memory and then
it'll output it'll give us a response of
that new book that we create so let's
try it we'll save it and we'll go down
and restart this let's see our dot body
undefined why is that now this should
actually be an upper case B
all right so let's open up postman and
now what we're gonna do is make a post
request actually I'll open up a new tab
here so we'll make a post request to
localhost port 8000 slash API slash
books and then we're gonna go to headers
and we want to add the content type of
application slash Jason and then let's
go to body I'm going to choose raw and
then we're gonna make a request so we're
gonna put in our curly braces and eat
this is Jason so the keys and the values
need to have double quotes so we want an
ISBN
so for that I'll just put whatever and
we want a title I'll say book 3 and see
what else the author
now let's see the author is actually
gonna be its own object so we're gonna
put a cut some curly braces and we'll
say first name and let's just say I
don't know Carol and then last name and
we'll say Williams all right
so hopefully this works let's go ahead
and send and there we go we get a 200
response back with the new book and it's
it's still gonna be in memory so if I go
back and I go make a get request to API
slash books there it is there's our new
book right there Carol Williams book 3
all right so that's good now we're gonna
work on we're gonna do the delete before
we do the update all right so for the
delete let's see we're gonna set the
content type and then what we'll do is
get the parameters okay
again we need to make sure we get the ID
so we're gonna say params equals we're
gonna use the Mocs router call VARs and
pass in our request and then we're gonna
do a loop here again so we're gonna say
for index item and we're gonna do we're
gonna use a range to loop through the
books and then we need to check for the
ID so if item dots ID is equal to the
params ID you can see a lot of this is
very similar to what we would do in
other languages when dealing with
breasts api's but what we want to do is
say books equals append and then we're
gonna pass in books and we want the
index so we're going to do colon index
and then we want another parameter of
books and then want to do index
plus one : and then we want to do three
dots like that and then break out of
this loop like that okay and then just
respond with this so we'll go outside of
the loop and we want to pass in books so
what's going to happen is it's going to
delete it this particular book and then
just give us a response of all the books
so this here is kind of like a slice
doing a slice in JavaScript if you were
to loop through an array and then slice
it out all right I know it's kind of a
weird looking syntax and I don't really
fully understand it but this will get
rid of the book okay and I just realized
I put this in the wrong function this
should actually be in the delete all
right so let's try that out so we're
gonna go down here and we're going to
restart it syntax error so this line
here let's see what I do wrong append
books colon index books index plus one
dot dot dot
oh I forgot my curly braces so this
needs to go like that there we go all
right so let's try that okay so that's
running now let's go to postman and
let's do a delete and let's delete our
new one actually that's not gonna be
there anymore because we restarted the
server you'll see if I do a get we just
have one and two so let's do a delete so
API book slash one and send and there we
go so now if I just do a get request to
books let's see what we get and we just
have the two because we deleted the
first one all right so one more function
to do and that's the update now the
update is basically going to be a
combination of what we did in delete and
what we did in create so I'm going to
copy everything we did and delete and
put that in update and what we want to
do is inside the four we're going to
check for the ID and then we're gonna
get rid of the the basically gonna slice
it out and then add a new one so we'll
slice it out we'll get rid of the break
and then I'm gonna copy this from create
book so we'll copy that
and we'll put that right in here I don't
know if this is the best way to do it
but this is the way that I figured out I
figured so and then we just want to
return all right so that should update
hopefully let's try it out okay so we'll
go back to postman and I'll open up a
new tab for this one this is gonna be a
put request and we're gonna do HTTP I'm
gonna do API books slash let's do two
will update two and then we're gonna go
to headers
content type will be application Jason
and then we're gonna go to body raw and
let's put in here let's see I'm gonna
say ISBN will change that to having a
bunch of sevens I'll change the title
let's just change it to updated title
and then what do we have author so this
will be first name say Jeff last name
Thompson all right so let's see oh I
figure out my comma here so hopefully
this works making a put request to API
book / - let's send it in and if we look
down here alright so we I messed up
something the ID I still have set to a
random ID which I don't want where is it
right here no where is it right here I
don't want it set to a random idea I
want it set to the ID of the params so
I'll just grab this and replace this
like that and then let's restart
and if you guys have a better way of
doing this please let me know that's
fine let's see so we're gonna just let's
just rerun this and there we go so now
you can see the ID is still - so we
updated the same one and we have updated
title Jeff Thompson if I were to now
make a get request to books you can see
ID - updated title and Jeff Thompson so
we now have a complete crud restful api
so hopefully you guys enjoyed this I
know it was a little long but like I
said I will think about doing a part two
where we can actually implement a
database and then maybe even adding a
front-end on to it okay but I just
wanted to kind of introduce you guys to
the goal language if you've never used
it and show you how to use HTTP as well
as the mucks router to create an easy
restful api alright so thanks for
