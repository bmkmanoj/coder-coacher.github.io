hey guys in this presentation we're
gonna be talking about starting a
project and I don't mean just a quick
project for an idea you had yesterday or
a tutorial that you're following that's
fine to just jump in and start
experimenting I'm talking about a
professional paid project or even your
own really serious project and this
could be any programming project but
I'll mostly be talking about web
development whether it's a website a web
application or a mobile app and with
every fret presentation like this that I
create you should take everything with a
grain of salt because there's no one
path to take for everybody there's not
even ten or twenty paths there's there's
a lot it all depends on the developer
the project the situation and so on so
the purpose of me making videos like
this is just to give you some insight
and experience I did client work for
about five years or so so I'll be
talking a little bit about my experience
with that as well as what I've
researched on you know what works in
general for most people but again
something that works for me may not work
for you so just keep that in mind
alright so this this is kind of a tough
video to make because there's really
three main situations for building
projects at least three that I could
think of so one is you're a freelancer
or you run your own company and this is
where you're you're actually dealing
directly with the client it's it's
basically all on you to get all of the
requirements and get the client vision
etc then you have the situation where
you're working for a company and chances
are you don't even talk to the client
you probably have some kind of project
manager or tech lead that is giving you
your requirements and then third you may
be building your own project maybe you
have a great idea for a web app or
you're building a website whatever it is
in this
you're the only one that you have to
deal with this is obviously the easiest
of the three but you also have a lot of
choices to make because things aren't
just being thrown on your desk or being
told what to do by a client all right so
my approach in this video is to kind of
stay general but freelancing and running
my own company is where most of my
personal experience lies so I may tend
to talk about that situation a bit more
but you can just replace the client with
the project manager both of them are
sort of your boss in either situation
and even for your own project just - the
boss part all right so we're not going
to go into finding clients or finding a
job or even brainstorming a project
we're gonna pretend that we already have
a solid project that we know we need to
build so the first step is to be
completely clear on all of the
requirements and know exactly what
you're doing you don't want to go into a
project with a half-assed idea of what
you're building and you don't want to
start without the materials that you
need okay so you want to get the
objective and the scope of the project
unless this is your own then you should
be able to get all of the information
from your client or your project manager
now if it's a project manager it should
be pretty easy they if they're a good
project manager they should already have
a plan for you all laid out what you
need to code a client is tough because
they don't always know what they want
even if they think they do a lot of
times they don't so working with a
client is a tough thing to do it when
it's it's part of the reason why I do
what I do today you also have to be a
good communicator and not only
understand what they want but also be
able to convey what you're going to do
what's possible things like that so make
sure you have the scope of the work are
you going to be building the entire
application or website or part of it are
you going to be deploying it what
features are going to be included do
they already have a design or is that
something that is up to you as well
are you adding the content are they
going to add the content these are all
questions that you should be asking and
you should actually have a complete list
of questions that you're going to be
asking especially if you're dealing
straight with the client all right you
also want to know
things like the purpose of the project
is it to sell something is it to connect
people together whatever it may be this
will help you craft certain aspects and
features that will help make that app or
that website successful all right same
with target audience you should know who
will be using this app or website if
it's geared towards like teens and young
people you can usually have a more
advanced interface but if it's for older
people that aren't as technically
inclined then you should have a really
easy to use and an intuitive interface
and that's just one example of why you
should know the your target audience all
right another thing that you want to
make absolutely absolutely sure of is
the technology requirements now if
you're working for a company you
probably have a standard for full stack
applications and things like that for
instance maybe your company uses c-sharp
on the back end and angular on the front
end
most companies stick to one or two
stacks unless for instance that the
client asks for something different now
with freelancers and people that have
their own businesses it's usually up to
you unless the client specifically wants
let's say a WordPress website
typically clients won't request like us
framework or anything like that
unless they themselves our developers
and they're basically outsourcing to you
because either they don't have the time
for the project or they don't know
enough to complete it now if it's your
own project you have all the freedom in
the world to choose your technologies I
would suggest going with something that
you're very comfortable with something
that you've used before and also
something that's pretty popular so that
you know so you have a bunch of
resources that you can refer to if you
get stuck ok I wouldn't suggest using
some new framework you found on github
that came out a month ago where there's
no documentation for because if you get
stuck then you're you're pretty much
screwed all right so you'll need to
think of things like the language you're
going to use the framework database
maybe a UI framework like bootstrap or
materialised you may have someone that
does the design for you or you may do
the design your
alright another thing to think about his
external api's and services if you're
gonna be using let's say Google or
Google OAuth for authentication or
you're gonna be using some external data
API make sure that you get all that
stuff down and any extra costs that come
with that okay a lot of for instance
data API is a lot of them are free until
you hit a certain amount of requests and
then you have to pay make sure you have
all the all that stuff down and if
you're dealing with a client make sure
they know those costs okay now your
budget is really something you're only
going to deal with if you're a
freelancer or you're running your own
company it's really important to
document exactly what you're gonna do
for exactly what price it's also up to
you to set either a fixed or an hourly
rate
I'd suggest going with a fixed rate
because you have value in your knowledge
and your experience
it may take you five hours to complete a
small project that would take someone
else with less skill thirty hours should
you be paid less of course not you have
that experience which allows you to do
it faster so I'm not a big fan of hourly
pay unless you're actually working for a
company I wouldn't suggest doing it with
clients in most situations so one thing
I can say is is you want to make sure
you put everything in writing so from
the budget to the entire project scope
you want to put that in writing print
out some documents and have the client
sign it that way there's no confusion
later or later down the line and they're
not asking for extra stuff all right you
also want to think of deployment if it's
a wordpress or a basic web site for
instance you could basically host it
anywhere even on a shared host for a
couple bucks per month if it's like a
ruby on rails app or a node.js app you
may want to look into options like
Heroku or a VPS like digitalocean
but again if you work for a company
chances are they have their ways already
and you basically just need to conform
to that and you probably don't even have
to worry about that yourself there's
probably a DevOps guy that does
that stuff alright so once you get all
the requirements you should map out a
timeline based on everything that we
just looked at in the last slide so the
scope the objective the technologies
you're gonna use and so on use all of
that to form a timeline of specific
points okay so when will you be done
with the wireframe and the UI layout
when will you create the database and
when will you get the backend coding the
front-end coding obviously the more
complicated the project the more
complicated timeline you're gonna have
and the longer it's gonna be now a mean
stack app for instance will have a
fairly complicated timeline based on the
components and the functionality of the
front-end the routing and the models and
the backend so if you're building let's
say a wordpress website which is a bit
easier then I'd suggest breaking it up
into like UI design and template so when
will the the HTML and CSS for the front
end be done when will you start to
install WordPress and configure your
database and all that when will you
start building your theme any custom
plugins you may need or maybe pre-made
plugins you're using when will you
configure those how long until all of
that's done and then once you have that
all mapped out show it to your client
and basically just have them review it
and see if everything's okay
alright I'm sure there's some nice
software out there to do that I always
kept it simple and just pretty much used
a word document and my Google Calendar
so that may be another thing that you
want to do is look for some nice
productivity software that can really
improve your workflow all right now a
good piece of advice if you're dealing
with clients directly always tell them a
date that's a bit longer than you expect
because it's much easier or not easier
it's much better to give them a longer
wait upfront than to try and sound good
by giving them a sooner date and then
not making that date okay it took me a
few times to learn that and if you're
done before they expect then it's just a
nice surprise for them alright so once
you have all your requirements and
you've created your timeline now it's
time to get to work but no coding just
yet
with just the information we have up to
this point if we go and open up vias
code or whatever text editor you use
very few people will know exactly what
to do so you basically want a visual
representation of what you're creating
before you start to code okay you want
to know what the final result will look
like and in most cases it won't be
exactly what you come up with now the
final project won't match what you come
up with now exactly but you want a
general idea so that you can create
mock-ups wireframes
it's up to you years ago I would create
Photoshop mock-ups that would be pretty
much identical to what I wanted the end
result to look like now that usually
takes a while I'm not gonna say you have
to do that in many cases a simple
wireframe is okay there's a lot of wire
framing software out there as long as
you know for instance where the nav bar
is going what links are included where's
the main form going where are the
results that come from that form gonna
go some kind of visual representation of
that whether it's a perfect replica in
Photoshop or sketch or something like
that or it's just a simple wireframe
with no actual graphics all right now
once you get that mock-up complete you
most likely want to send that to the
client or show your project manager to
get approval okay you don't want to
start coding and then find out that you
have everything all wrong and I realize
that in the company environment someone
else may be doing this for you someone
else may do the wire framing the
mock-ups and then just kind of throw it
at you and say here code this but if
you're running your own company or
you're freelancing and you don't have
people working for you you have to do
freaking everything and I did it for
years and it's it's really hard you know
when you're handling everything from
client communication to design to coding
to deployment it's much easier when
you're when you're on a team and you
have basically different tasks are
broken up between different people that
specialize in those certain things okay
now when you're finally ready to start
coding you should now have a folder on
your development machine dedicated to
this project with every
thing we've talked about you should have
the requirements the timeline the
wireframe and/or mock-ups comments from
your manager your client all that stuff
and then you can set up your dev
environment now if you're building a
full-stack react app for instance you
want to install nodejs MongoDB web pack
or create react app whatever else
whatever else you're using for this
application your text editor you should
set it up with any plugins that you're
going to use terminal that you're
comfortable with and I'm sure that you
have most of this stuff already set up
if you're a you know if you're a
developer and you've created other
projects now if you're creating
WordPress or PHP you probably want to
install something like xampp or lair
agon something that is gonna give you an
Apache server or MySQL things like that
alright you also may want to research
some other similar projects not to copy
but to kind of get an idea of what your
code will look like so I'd suggest
searching github and just browsing
through some sample projects before you
start coding set up a git repository
that you can push all your code to set
up branches when you're adding new
functionality merge those branches when
each task is complete if you're working
with a team they'll also be pushing so
make sure that you pull their changes
etc and you probably if you're working
with a team if you're working for a
company you probably don't have to set
this up yourself you'll just be pushing
to the main repository alright so these
are just some general steps everyone has
their own workflow that works for them
you may be reading this and saying that
it's and your way is better
which may be the case for you I'm just
trying to give you a very general
overview and just some pointers from my
own experience
alright so communication throughout the
project is very important it may be
strictly with the client if you're a
freelancer or it may be with your
project manager and team members but
make sure that you're all on the same
page if you're working remotely with
other people which is something that I
didn't really talk about too much
you you want to set up a Google hangout
or something like that maybe one or two
times a week so you can all get caught
up and actually talk rather than seeing
each other's github pushes and having
that be the only communication or
interaction project management software
may also be a good idea I used to use
Basecamp a lot I'm sure there's newer
and better things out there it's been a
while since I programmed with other
people remotely for clients you probably
want to interact at least through email
a few times per week and let them know
how things are going don't make them
feel like they're in the dark maybe have
a weekly phone or video chat as well
this is just the stuff that I dreaded
but it had to be done so if you're
working with a team you want to get
feedback on your code I know it's hard
to hear that your code sucks but
sometimes it just does
I'm told that quite a bit putting most
of my code out there publicly on YouTube
and in courses and stuff I always get
you know mostly good responses but I do
get some negative feedback from people
but it's usually in a respectful way
which is fine I can I can respect that
I've just learned from it you know see
what they're saying and see if it's
actually helpful and useful or if
they're just being a troll which I'm
sure your clients are being trolls but
I'm just kind of speaking from my
perspective now once your project is
finished and you've met all those
requirements you want to test every
function Kay every piece of
functionality you may have been running
unit tests all along from the beginning
which is a great idea it's something I
really slack on I've always hated
writing tests and I'm not very good at
it even though it can make your code
more efficient and make it faster or
make your development faster it's just
something that I've always slacked on
but if you don't write tests then you
want to be testing manually throughout
your whole project for every milestone
that you complete every piece of
functionality and at the end you want to
do kind of more rigorous testing for
every situation so every browser every
operating system may be test multiple
deployments
on different platforms and after your
final deployment do some more testing
okay then once you know everything is
running flawlessly I'm sure it'll break
again that's just what happens in
programming but once you've finally
fixed everything that needs fixing hand
it off to the client or to the project
manager usually your revisions are going
to be given to you before the final
deployment so by this time you should be
good unless something really goes wrong
all right guys so that's it and again I
can't stress this enough everyone is
different and not everything works for
everybody hopefully you took what you
can and you can apply it to your
workflow into your life where possible
and hopefully you enjoyed this little
presentation and that's it guys thanks
