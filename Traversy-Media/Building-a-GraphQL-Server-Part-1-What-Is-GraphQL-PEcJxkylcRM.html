series we're going to be building a
back-end graph QL server now I will warn
you that some of the concepts in this
series are a bit advanced compared to a
lot of my recent videos but if you're
comfortable with REST API s and jason
nodejs you should be able to follow
along even if you've never used graph QL
before okay this is going to be kind of
a graph QL introduction project and
we're going to be using Express which is
a node.js framework along with a module
called Express graph QL and this will
allow us to send and receive data
through graph QL all right so let's go
ahead and get started
all right so before we get started with
the project let's talk a little bit
about what the hell graph QL actually is
so in simple terms it's an application
layer query language or a query language
for your API and it was open sourced by
Facebook in 2015 now I'm sure most of
you have heard of SQL or structured
query language it's a language built for
querying and getting data from an SQL
database or relational database like
MySQL well SQL is a data level language
so you query the database directly but
with graph QL we query the application
layer on the server which allows us to
use virtually any kind of database or
data store that we want we can even use
just hard coded data we could use an SQL
database no SQL like MongoDB just about
anything all right another huge benefit
to graph QL is that it provides almost a
blueprint of your data in your API and
it gives clients the power to ask for
exactly what they want one problem with
a standard REST API is that you may only
want for instance a user's first name
but with the way that a REST API is
usually set up it forces you to fetch
all the user data which is virtually
wasting bandwidth and other resources so
with graph QL we can just ask for
exactly what we want and nothing more so
this is incredibly powerful we can also
make multiple requests at once which
saves even more on resources all right
so let's take a look at a very simple
query so on the right here we have an
example of our data on our sir
so we just have a user it's in JSON
format has an ID a name and an email now
if we look at the query it looks very
very similar to the data which is really
nice okay so we're saying we want a user
with the idea of 100 and we're saying we
want just the name and the email okay so
this is very valuable that we can just
request just the name and email you can
imagine if there were you know dozens or
even hundreds of fields and you know
with a standard REST API a lot of the
times we'll have to get all of that data
but graph QL allows us to specifically
ask for just the name and email all
right so we can also fetch multiple
resources so over here we have our user
with the ID name and email and then the
user has an array of posts okay and we
have a bunch of objects in this case
there's just a title but just imagine
that there's you know a lot of post
fields here so if we look at the query
again saying we want user 100 we want
the name email we also want the posts of
the user and we're saying we just want
the title from the posts ok so again we
can just specifically you know request
what fields we want from the posts array
so graph QL does also use a typing
system so here we're saying we have a
user with the type of user which is us
because type that we defined over here
ok so we have a user which is an object
has a name which is a string and age
which is an integer and then Friends
which is an array of users all right
we'll get more into types along the way
so graphical or graph iql is a very
handy tool for interacting with your
graph QL server it's an interactive IDE
or integrated development environment we
can test we can run queries mutations it
runs right in the browser it has things
like syntax highlighting error reporting
hinting and other things so this is what
we'll be working with to test all of our
queries and mutations all right now you
can use graph QL with just about any
popular modern language will be working
with JavaScript of course and in nodejs
and Express
but there's clients for C
Java Python PHP just about any language
you can think of
all right so even though graph QL is a
relatively new technology it is
something that's becoming extremely
popular among some of the biggest
websites on the internet Facebook mobile
apps have actually used graph QL since
2012 it's popular for mobile apps
because we can send much lighter
requests from being able to specifically
request things instead of you know
getting a giant payload back with a
bunch of stuff that we don't need all
right so let's take a look at the plan
for this project in this series it's not
going to be too long I would estimate
maybe three four videos we're going to
bang them all out at once so you're not
going to have to wait a week between
each video and again we're building the
backend this is going to be a back-end
server we're not going to have any kind
of UI we may do that in another series
and of course you can use anything for
the UI you could use standard JavaScript
and Ajax anything that allows you to
make HTTP requests react there's
actually a really popular library for
working with graph QL called Apollo
there's actually a few of them Apollo is
the one that I prefer but we will
definitely look into building a
front-end but this series are
specifically building a back-end no UI
or anything like that alright so we will
be setting up and Express which is a
node.js back-end framework will be using
Express graph QL which is a node module
will be creating a schema file and
that's where we'll put all of our
queries and mutations now as far as a
mutation this just means that we're
we're building a response that's going
to change the data in some way so if we
want to make a post request to our API
to update I'm sorry to add data to the
server that would be done through a
mutation okay same thing with update and
delete we're also going to be
implementing something called JSON
server which I actually did a video on I
think a couple weeks ago and it gives us
a mock REST API so basically like a fake
REST API and that's going to act as our
as our database okay so like I said you
can use any kind of database you want
with graph QL you can use MongoDB and
use
juice you can use you know MySQL
whatever it doesn't matter so we're
going to be using JSON server we're also
going to have complete crud
functionality so we'll be able to create
read update and delete okay it's going
to be a customer system a customer
management database and we're going to
be doing all of our testing with
graphical okay with the graphical
interface alright so hopefully you guys
enjoy this series like I said it is a
bit advanced so I know I've been getting
a lot of beginners lately that was just
getting into front-end web development
so this may be a little tricky for you
but I would still suggest watching it
just to see you know how things come
together and you know you may not
understand every line of code but I
think it's a it's a good introduction to
graph QL for anybody alright so thanks
for watching guys and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
