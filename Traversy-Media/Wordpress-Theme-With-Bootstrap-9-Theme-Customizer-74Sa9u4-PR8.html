going to show you how we can implement
the theme customizer to be able to edit
this showcase area from the backend of
our WordPress installation so first
thing we're going to do is go to
functions PHP and I like to put the
customizer stuff in a separate file
because this is quite a bit of code
depending on how many different options
and settings you have so what we're
going to do is we're going to include a
file here okay so let's say require
actually I'm going to say require and
then we're going to use the function get
template directory and then we'll just
concatenate slash Inc slash customizer
dot PHP all right now save that and
we're going to create a new folder in
our theme called ink for includes
alright and then we'll create our file
called customizer dot PHP so let's go
ahead and create a function and we're
going to use our prefix here WP B
underscore and we're going to say
customize underscore register okay so
this is going to be a function and then
we need to do add action and the hook we
want to use is customize register
okay just like that now just to show you
what the customizer is I don't think
I've done that let's go to the backend
and you can either click on customize or
you can go to your themes and click on
customize for that theme okay so this is
the customizer by default we have some
options the site identity menus menu
locations widgets okay that has the
different widgets we can access them
from here static front page okay so this
is all stuff that you can basically
access in your settings as well what we
want to do is create another section
here for our showcase and then be able
to edit stuff all right so to add a
section I don't know why it does that
okay before we do that we have to pass
in an object we have to pass in an
object called WP underscore customize
alright and then in here we're going to
take that WP underscore customize and
we're going to call a function called
add section all right now in here the
name of the section we want is showcase
all right and then we can pass in an
array of options okay we want to have a
title okay so for the title we're going
to use our localization function and
then we want the text to be showcase and
then you want your theme name which in
our case is WP bootstrap alright so
that's the title then we're going to
have a description
okay for this we're going to use the
sprint f function okay then we'll use
the localization and we're going to say
options for showcase all right and then
a second parameter which is going to be
the template name okay so that'll be the
description and then the last one we
want is the priority I spell that right
priority okay and priority we're going
to say 1:30 so that should add a section
now if we save it now and go back and
reload you won't see it because we don't
have any settings or controls all right
so we need to add a new setting so this
will be for the heading alright so what
we need to do is take that WP customize
and say add setting ok now the name of
the setting is going to be showcase
heading and then we're going to pass in
an array and we're going to set a
default
okay whatever we put here is what's
going to be in the in the input field
initially we're going to use the
underscore X localization function and
let's put in this as our default all
right and then we want the theme name
okay and then the next option we want is
the type now you can have type either B
option or theme mod okay and in most
cases you're going to want theme mod
those other things here these ones are
all options but we want this to be
specific to our theme all right now that
adds the setting but we need to also add
a control okay so we're going to say WP
customize add control all right and the
control is going to be called the same
thing showcase heading then we'll have
our array it's going to have a label
okay label is going to be heading
then we need to specify the section that
we want this to be in which is going to
be the showcase section all right and
then we can also set priority and we'll
set that to one okay so let's go ahead
and save this and go back and reload and
now you can see that we have a showcase
section click on that we have a heading
option with the default text now if we
change it it's not going to do anything
yet
all right the theme does flash but
nothing changes because we haven't
implemented anything yet we're just
creating the fields for now all right so
that's the heading now we're going to
want this this text here so for that
we're going to need another setting and
control so what I'm going to do is just
copy these two paste it in and then
we'll change to showcase text for the
default we'll choose what we have here
okay this one is going to be showcase
text will change priority to two okay so
now if we go back we should have a text
option as well
all right now we should probably have a
link URL option for the button as well
so let's copy these two again and we'll
call this one button URL and for the
default will just say HTTP test comm
okay down here we want to change this to
the button URL change that to three now
we could do the text as well for the
button so copy that and just change this
to button text and we'll have read more
okay
so let's take a look at that okay so we
have heading text button URL and button
text now we're also going to want an
option for the image right so I'm going
to put that up at the top so right under
the add section alright we're going to
paste in we'll copy this and then paste
that in alright so for this this is
going to be called showcase image
alright and the default this is going to
be a little different we're going to get
rid of let's see we're going to get rid
of this first parameter and we're going
to put in a function called get the log
info because what this is is the default
path to an image all right so get blog
info and then we're going to use
template directory alright and then from
here we want to concatenate /img /a okay
dot jpg okay so that's not there yet
we're going to have to put that in
alright and then for the control this is
going to be different as well what I'm
going to do is just get rid of this
whole well I'm not going to get rid of
it but let's see actually you know what
just to avoid confusion let's clear that
out alright so add control and then
we're going to do new WP underscore
customized underscore image underscore
control okay and then in here we're
going to pass in that WP customize and
then add another parameter
with the name which is going to be
showcase image okay then the next
parameter will be the array
okay so we'll have label and I can just
copy this
okay so label will be showcase image and
what else do we want
section showcase we also want to add
settings which will also be showcase
image alright and I think that should do
it for the priorities I want the image
to be at the top so we'll keep that as
one but then I'm going to just kind of
add one to the rest of these that'll be
three four and five okay
so let's save that take a look hopefully
we have no syntax errors which we do
let's see I expected double arrow line
twelve so right here did I not put it
and I put a comma alright I'm just going
to make this a little bigger oh you know
what this actually shouldn't be here
it should just be like that and then we
have one a nineteen okay that's just
missing a comma alright now just in case
you have some errors I'm just going to
show you this so you can make sure you
have all the correct code okay pause it
if you need to
okay now if we look at the customizer we
have the showcase image and we have the
option to change it or remove it now
there's nothing here because we don't
have that default image which is which
should be in our theme folder an image
showcase all right so let me just open
my theme folder up alright and what
we're going to want to do is create a
folder called image and I'm going to
take the image from the HTML folder the
showcase copy that paste it in there and
then let's go back to the backend and
reload and now you can see we have the
image showing now right now none of this
matters we can change it and save it but
it doesn't make a difference because we
haven't implemented it on the theme yet
excuse me so we're going to do that in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
