want to do now is I want to be able to
show a list of the tasks that are in
that particular list all right so we
have to do a few things we have to make
a join so we can join the list and the
tasks tables together so if we go to our
list controller so let's let's dot php'
under controllers and we go down to the
show method that's this view right here
we're showing the list with the ID of
two and you can see that I did comment
out some things here earlier and now
we're going to tackle these and make it
so we can display all the tasks all
right so we have two values in this data
array here that we want to uncomment
ones completed tasks one is uncompleted
tab so basically we'll have two sections
in the list that will show completed
tasks and uncompleted tasks so the first
thing we need to do is create this model
these model methods the first one is get
list tasks which takes an ID which is
coming from the URL so that's the idea
of the list all right so let's see let's
copy that go to the a list model
and see
all right so we got function get list
tasks and this here the second parameter
is going to be active all right so this
is going to tell us if if the task is
active I'm meaning complete or not so
the default is going to be true
all right so if the task is uncompleted
then it's going to be active if it's
complete then it's not active all right
so we have to do things a little
different here because we're going to be
doing a table join and I can actually
show you that syntax if we go to the
documentation the active record let's
search for join so this is how we would
do it we're gonna select something in
this case it select everything from the
blog's table alright now we have a blog
stable and the comments table and the in
the comments table each comment has a
blog ID field okay so what we want to do
to bring these two together is do this
DB join and bring in the comments table
and we want to match them comments dot
ID so the ID field in the comments
should match the blog's ID all right and
then we can just do what we usually do
and grab that so you can see this active
record code is the same as this standard
SQL alright so we're gonna do that and
up until now we've been just using the
this DB get we haven't actually said
select because we have a need to need it
too alright so what we're gonna do here
and say this
dB select now since since these two
tables both have Nied field things could
get a little confusing if if we just say
select all alright so if we just say
select all then it's we're gonna have
issues later on when we're trying to
separate the task ID from the list ID
because they're both named ID so we have
to select the actual fields that we want
by name all right so let's say we want
to select the task name from the task
table so we can just say tasks dot task
name you should be in quotes
all right let's take a look at the table
the task table you can see we have task
name so we do want to select that
because we're going to be displaying it
actually you know what
these don't need coats quotes comma and
we want the task body as well so we're
saying the table tasks we want to grab
the task body filled
column all right we also want the ID but
like I said we don't want to mix it with
the list ID so what we can do is say
tasks dot ID as task underscore ID so
now when we're in the view we can use
this and it'll know that we're talking
about the ID and the task table and not
the list table all right so now we also
want to get lists in the list table we
want to get the list name and we want to
get the list body as well all right so
that's how you can select individual
rows or columns instead of just saying
select everything
all right so what we need to do doubt
now is have a from when you say this DB
from and the main table that we're
trying to get here is tasks alright so
I'm going to say select all select these
tables from tasks so now that we're
selecting these fields or these columns
from tasks now we want to join in the
list table all right so here we're going
to say this DB join and the first
parameter that we're going to put here
is the table which is list all right so
the next thing we want to put is where
we want to relate these two tables and
let's just go back to PHP myadmin for a
second
I mean you probably already understand
this but just in case so we have it's a
list table all right and we have some
fields for each list and we have a task
table with some fields and in this table
we have a column called list ID all
right so this list ID is an integer all
right so you can see we have ones and
twos here and if we go back to lists
that field that lists ID field I just
showed you relates to the ID field here
alright so we have to claim that in this
model and that's what we're going to do
right here basically we're going to say
lists list dot
ID equals tasks dot list ID all right so
we're saying that the ID field in the
list table is equal to the list ID field
and the task table so hopefully that
makes sense all right so now we need a
where clause I'm gonna say this DB where
you know let's say where tasks dot
list ID is equal to this variable list
ID all right actually we have to change
this up here let's change this to list
ID because that's where this is coming
from okay now we're going to also use
another where Clause but it's going to
be conditional if you remember we have
this active here which basically says if
activists true that means that the task
is not complete if this is false then
the task is complete
alright because of its if it's complete
then it's not active so we're going to
say we're going to put in a conditional
here and say let's say if active is
equal to true
alright and this is going to be an
if-else
so we'll say if active is equal to truth
then let's just grab this here's way our
clause and we're gonna say this DB we're
tasks dots is complete is equal to zero
all right because if it's true if it's
active then it's not complete so that is
complete will be a zero and that is
coming from tasks that's coming from
this field right here okay which all of
them are not complete right at the
moment we'll add a link that will allow
us to mark them complete or incomplete
alright so the same thing then if if
it's not active so if active equals
false then we're going to say that it is
complete so we want that one okay so
down here we want to say this a DV yet
and before when we've used this this
this D be get we would pass in the table
name but we're not going to do that
because we use the Select statement up
here so we're saying select these from
tasks and then we just leave this blank
but we do get a set
a variable here okay so now what we want
to do is check and see if there's any
rows so to check and see if there's any
tasks basically so we'll say if say if
query query num rows is less than one
all right so if queries if the number of
rows is less than one so basically zero
then we want to return false else we are
going to actually know what we don't
need an else we're just gonna go right
under here and return query result all
right
so in foal this this method get' let's
test is just gonna get all the tasks in
a particular list alright
and let's see where did we set that get
this task
alright so they'll go we put in this
this value here completed tasks so next
we have this uncompleted tasks is equal
to the same function get list asked
except we're going to pass in false
instead of true so that'll give us both
completed and uncompleted
and we can then use them inside of our
view which will be the show view so
let's do that save and we want to go to
lists and show
so under all this I'm actually just
going to paste in a loop so we're saying
if completed tasks which is coming from
here completed task which is coming from
this function in the model get less
tasks all right and then we're putting
out an li tag which has a link to the
actual task by ID and it's using the
task name as the anchor alright and
we're saying if else so if there are no
completed tasks then we're just going to
spit out this paragraph so let's make
sure that that's working
all right so it's saying that the column
ID and our where clause is ambiguous
which means that it can't tell the task
ID from the list ID and it's not in the
method we just created because our where
Clause says where tasks dot list ID is
list ID so it's got to be it's got to be
in this here this in the list model to
get list method so let's go to this list
model get list yeah we're just gonna
we're gonna mom we're trying to return
the row even if it's not there so we're
gonna edit this a little bit this get
list method so we're gonna say this DB
select
and we're going to select all alright so
now we need this DB from and this is
going to be from the list table and now
for the where clause will say this DB
where let's see where I D
is equal to ID
query equals this DB get and we don't
need anything inside they get because
we're using select from alright so now
what we want to do is check the number a
row we want to see if a list actually
came back
so we'll say if so if query the num rows
is not equal to 1 then we want to return
false because because we should only be
getting one record back because what
we're getting it by the ID and I'm going
to say else then we want to return query
row
okay so let's save that reload alright
so now we're in our family stuff list
which shows all the tasks if we go to
our work stuff list we see our work
stuff tasks if we click on it
alright so we're having a little issue
because everything we click on goes to
pick up kids for some reason
that's strange
let's see
all right I know why this is going this
is happening we need to go to our task
model and get tasks what we need to do
is we need to have a join here as well
we need to join the lists and the task
table so you're pretty much going to get
rid of this and we want to do something
like we did right here where we select
the fields and then we join in the list
table all right so let's see this
TV select
and we're gonna select the fields
manually so we wants let's see tasks
dots past name
and TAS start ID
createdate
body
is complete
all right so that's all the stuff in the
task table now we want sum over the list
field we want list ID but we're going to
say as list ID so there's no confusion
list dot let's name and finally lists
dot list body okay so we want to select
those from from tasks
and now we want to join in a list table
so we'll say this DB joined and the
table we want to join is less and here's
what we want to we want to specify the
field so list dot ID is equal to tasks
dot list ID and so that looks good now
we want our where clause so we'll say
this DV where
I'm going to say where tasks dot ID is
equal to ID
get
now we want to check and see if any rows
were returned
so if query but if query num rows is not
equal to 1 then we want to return false
else we want to return the query row all
right so let's see what that does
so if we go back to my list all right
let's see we have a syntax error in the
task model number 19 out we need a
semicolon here
all right so I'll click on family stuff
pick up kids parents dinner alright so
now it's working dinner with wife and
the task view shows the date the status
and the due date and then a description
all right
so we should be able to delete a task
all right we didn't set that up yet all
right so let's set up the delete we can
add a task I know that
okay so that works we can edit the task
okay so we can head it so all we need to
do now is we need to be able to delete
to delete the task because right now
it's it's not doing anything so we want
to go to our task controller and I'm
going to paste in the delete function
all right so it's calling this task
model delete task so let's go to the
task model and we need our delete task
so public function delete and that's
going to take in a task ID
and say this DV where
this DV where ID is equal to the task ID
and we're gonna say let's see this DV
delete delete queries are very easy
tasks and then we're just going to
return alright so now we should be able
to delete let me just make sure we get
our messages so we get this task deleted
should be in the show the list show view
and we have it right here so that should
be all set
all right lists will go to a task and
delete
undefined delete tasks
whoops you want tasks
all right delete
list ID task ID oh I see we're calling
task model delete task and in the model
you can see we're calling just to leave
not delete tasks so change that let's
reload and try to delete it and it's
been deleted alright alright one thing
that I do notice is if we go to our
tasks all our tasks are not complete
alright so that's set to 0 in our view
in our list view where we're displaying
our tasks we have if completed tasks and
that's wrong it should be if active
because active tasks mean that they're
not complete so we're going to change
this inside of the list controller
and right here where we have this
completed tasks let's change this to
active tasks all right and then here is
going to be the the inactive tasks all
right I just want to change that because
it doesn't really make sense all right
so then back in the in the view all we
need to do was change this to active
tasks change this to active tasks all
right and above this I'm going to put in
a heading
all right and then below this I'm just
gonna copy copy this and we're going to
say completed tasks and this is going to
be inactive same thing right here and
then down here I'm going to say there
are no completed tasks and here I'll say
there are no active tasks
okay so let's see its reload all right
so let's actually go to the other list
which has a bunch of tasks and let's set
one of these will say pickup Sun will
change this to 1 which means it's
complete and then if we reload that's
under the completed tasks alright so one
of the the main thing that we have left
to do is we need to be able to mark a
task complete all right so if we go in
we want to be able to click mark
complete and have it switch which we
don't have implemented yet so we'll do
that in the next video and then we
should be all set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
