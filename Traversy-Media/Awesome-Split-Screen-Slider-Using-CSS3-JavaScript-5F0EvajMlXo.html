cool project for you today using HTML
CSS and JavaScript so we're gonna be
building a split screen slider I guess
you would call it and this was actually
inspired by the Corsair website which
I'll show you in a second but basically
we have this page where we have two
different images and we have some text
on two different layers two different
HTML layers and if we hover over it we
can actually switch from one layer to
another we can make this sliding effect
which is really cool and we have two
different images now these images are
copy written so when you get the code
it'll look like this I'm just using some
images of some circles so you can
replace that with whatever you want but
I can't use those those Corsaire images
if you want to use them to test out of
course you can't use them you know on a
website or anything like that but if we
just search for Corsair 600 T which is
an awesome case I own one it's really
nice these two images right here what I
used okay so they're basically the same
size they're just different colors so if
you want to grab those and use them to
test that's fine just know that they're
not stock images and you can't use them
anywhere all right so this is the
Corsair website where I got the idea now
of course I didn't just grab the code or
anything like that I looked at it and I
rebuilt it in my own way but I thought
it was really cool so I wanted to make a
video on it all right and the way that
we're doing this is really by CSS is
using the CSS transform property and
using skewed so if we if we search for
CSS transform you'll see that we can do
like rotations and scaling and stuff
like that but if we look at skew it'll
just basically you know twist it how we
want it so 30 degrees we could do that
and if we want to go the other way we
can do negative 30 degrees so that's
what we're gonna do with the handle
which is this this yellow part in the
middle
all right and then we'll add the
JavaScript to have to create the most
events occur sir and you know move it
where we want so that's what we'll be
doing guys I thought it was a pretty
cool project so hopefully you enjoy it
and let's get started

patreon.com/lenguin
this is where we're gonna create our
project and I'm gonna create a folder
here called IMG and if you want to get
these these PC images if you just search
for Corsair 600 T its these two images
here so this one you want a view image
and save it as PC one and then this one
view image save it as PC 2 okay or you
can just you can well yeah just do it
that way because I'm not going to be
including these images in the actual
files but I'm gonna bring them down here
okay so I'm also gonna bring down the
just the placeholder images so these are
the two that'll be included in the
actual project if you download it ok
these will not be these are copyright
and you do not want to use these in any
kind of website or you know application
or anything like that just for testing
alright so now that we have our IMG
folder let's go ahead and get rid of
that and let's um let's go to visual
studio code and I already have the split
screen let's see I don't want this to be
too small I already have the split
screen folder open and we have our IMG
folder so let's create the rest of our
files so we want an index dot HTML let's
also create a CSS folder with a
stylesheet in it we'll call this style
dot CSS and then let's also create
ajs folder and we'll create a file
called mange s all right and let's open
up our index page and we're gonna get
started with the HTML which is pretty
simple so we're gonna go ahead and just
add in our base body tags I'm using
Emmet so I'm going to do exclamation
ctrl and let's change this title just
say split screen split screen slider I
guess and we're gonna include our CSS
file so let's say the link if you're
using Emmet you can just do the linking
tab and we're gonna just put in here CSS
slash style dot CSS and let's see down
here in the body let's just include our
JavaScript so we'll put in a script tag
with a source to jf / main j/s alright
so now we have all of our files linked
I'm gonna save this now of course you
can just open it on your file system if
you want but I use a plugin called live
server if you want that you can just
click on the extensions icon search for
it and just install it alright once you
do that you can just go on the HTML file
and right-click and you can say open
with live server and that'll open it on
your localhost okay and it's auto reload
so you won't have to keep keep reloading
it alright so let's get started on our
HTML so inside the body here I'm going
to create a section tag and I'm gonna
give it an ID of wrapper I'm also gonna
give it a class of skewed okay is that
how you spell it
yeah skewed okay so we have our main
section everything that's going to go in
here now we're basically gonna have two
layers we're gonna have a top layer and
a bottom layer okay so the bottom I
should probably open up the project yeah
let's do that real quick
all right and you'll see this is
actually pretty responsive to and small
screen like this it still works well but
basically the bottom layer is gonna be
the black and then the top will be the
gray all right so we need to create
those two divs so let's create a div
with the class of layer and we're also
going to give it a class of bottom okay
and then in here we're gonna have
basically two more divs we're gonna have
a content wrap and a Content body that's
going to go around the the text so it's
a Content - wrap and then content - body
alright and then we're gonna have an h1
in here and we're gonna say look sharp
and then let's put a paragraph and I'm
gonna say lorem 20 tab which will just
give us 20 words of sample text all
right and then we just want the image we
want the image to go under the content
body so it'll go right here so I'm gonna
just put in an image and let's let's
bring this to PC 1 dot PNG okay and you
know if you're downloading the the files
from the description it'll be image 1
PNG which will be the circle all right
so let's go ahead and save that and this
is what its gonna look like
let's see oh I forgot the IMG there we
go alright so it should look like this
so far I'm actually going to close that
and then make this a little bigger all
right and then what we need to do is
basically the same thing we just did we
want another layer so we'll just copy
this div right here and we'll go ahead
and paste that in and then we're just
going to change this class to talk okay
so this will be the top layer and we'll
change the heading here to stay cool and
we'll leave the same text that's fine
and let's change the image to PC - all
right so we'll save it and it's gonna
like this so now what I want to do is
just add the handle okay so we need a
div to represent the middle this middle
part here which is the handle so that's
actually gonna go right right above the
ending section tag so we'll just put a
clasp here of handle and that's it
that's our HTML it's as easy as that so
now we're gonna move to our CSS okay so
this is where most of our work is going
to go let's start off with just some
body styles so for the body we're gonna
zero out the margin and padding all
right so next thing we want to add is
the font size we're gonna say we want it
to be a hundred percent and we want the
line height to be let's say one point
six and then the font family I'm gonna
set that to arial helvetica sans-serif
all right so that's the body next we're
going to do the wrapper okay so that's
the section that wraps around everything
and we're gonna set that position to
relative and let's set the width of a
hundred percent so it should cover
everything and then we're gonna set the
min height so min height I'm gonna set
this to 55 V W so for those of you that
don't know V W is a CSS unit it's
viewport width and it's basically if you
take the width sorry about that if you
take the width of the browser window and
you slice it into a hundred different
you know a hundred different slices
we're taking 55 of that and then we're
setting that to the height not the width
all right so if we look at the original
script here and we were to extend this
you'll see that the height changes
depending on the width and that's what
that's what I want all right and if I
make it you know full size it looks
really nice so I think 55 is a good
Jesus let me just put this on vibrate
guys
sorry about that so yeah we want to set
that 255 with the 55 viewport width
alright and we're gonna set a the actual
layer to the same thing so for the
rapper the last thing I want to add is
the overflow and we're gonna set that to
hidden all right so now we're gonna do
the layer class of layer so both the top
and bottom images are not images but I
guess the content areas have a class of
layer 1 has bottom on its top the black
is the bottom the white is the top I
should say that gray so for layer we're
going to set the position to absolute
okay so you want to make sure the rapper
is relative but the layer inside of it
is actually absolute and then we're
gonna set the width of the layer not to
100% but to a 100 viewport widths
okay viewport width VW because we want
it to extend all the way across we want
to take up all 100 slices and then the
min height is gonna be the same as the
as the rapper it's going to be 55 VW
okay and then we're also going to set
the overflow to hidden all right so
that's the layer next thing we're gonna
do is the the content wrap which is
around the h1 and it's around the
content body if we look at the HTML so
content wrap and then we have in the
inside of that the content body so let's
say layer content wrap okay and then
we're going to set the position of that
also to absolute and let's set the width
we're going to set the width to 100 VW's
and we're gonna set the min height I'm
gonna set that to 55 VW's and we're
gonna set the let's see yeah well we're
gonna initially set the color of the
text to white actually let's not do that
just yet
just so we can see it so let's save and
it should look like this so far which
looks very awful but it's gonna change
so now what we want to do is the content
body which is inside of the content wrap
so content - body all right and we're
gonna set the width of that to 25% okay
and we're gonna set the position to
absolute and then we're gonna set from
the top 50% so we want to push it down
50% all right and then let's set the
text aligned we'll set that to center
all right so let's see we also want to
just add in a transform property to move
the to move the text up a little so
we're gonna say transform and then we're
gonna set translate why because we want
to translate on the y-axis and we want
to move it up a little so it's going to
be negative 50% okay now we're gonna do
the image so we're gonna say layer IMG
just bring this up a little and for the
image it's going to have a first of all
it's going to be positioned absolute
okay we want to set the width of the
image to 35% let's go ahead and save
that so it should look like that and
let's see we want it in the middle so
we're gonna say from the top we want it
to go 50% and then from the left we want
it to go 50
since so let's save that and then we're
also going to add the translate
transform translate so transform set it
to true just translate for x and y is
going to be both negative 50% so
negative 50% whoops
save that and that puts it right in the
middle all right so I just want to
change the heading sizes so we'll say
dot layer h1 and I want to set the size
of those to 2m okay and then we're gonna
work on the bottom and top okay remember
the black that's that's the bottom
that's the top so for the bottom we're
going to set the background to 2 to 2
which is very is a very dark gray almost
black alright so if we save that now the
the gray or the white which is the top
we want that to go over the bottom so
what we're going to do is we're going to
set the Z index here so Z - index - 1
and then when we do the top we're gonna
set the Z index to 2 which will bring it
bring it more forward ok that's what z
index does it's basically the placement
of you know what's in front what's in
back alright so let's see the content
body for the bottom which is the text we
want that to go over here okay if we
look you'll see that the text is on that
side so what we'll do is we'll take the
bottom class and say dot content body
and we're gonna set that to 4 B from the
right 5% and save okay now for the text
we want that to be white obviously so
let's set the initial color to white so
we'll go to the content body and say
color
white there we go and let's see what
else
now the bottom h1 when I say bottom I
mean this is this whole area I want the
h1 to be that yellow color so we'll say
dot bottom h1 and we're gonna set the
color it's going to be a hexadecimal
value of FDA it's gonna be FDA b00 save
that and now that the heading is yellow
alright so that's it for the bottom now
let's do the top so say dot top and
let's set the background color we're
going to set it to a really light gray
so it's gonna be Triple E and we're
gonna set the why does it do that
I'm gonna set the color of the text to
triple two and then remember I said for
the Z index we want to set that to two
so it goes over and we're gonna set the
width to 50 V W so 50 viewport width
alright so if we save that you'll see
that it's basically split in half okay I
said that's I set the width to 50 so it
takes up 50 of the hundred slices and
that actually looks pretty cool split in
half like that so if you guys even
wanted to just use something like this
and your CSS that's pretty cool alright
so for the content body right here we
want to do two things we want to move it
over a little so we're gonna say from
the left we want to go five percent over
we also want to change the color so
let's say dot top and we want to style
the content body so we're gonna say from
the left go over five percent and then
for the color is gonna be triple -
alright we'll save that and there we go
so it looks pretty cool
alright so now we're gonna start to
style the handle and we're gonna make
that skew effect
okay so the handle is basically just a
div at the bottom here okay we're doing
everything in CSS so let's say dot
handle okay and for this we're going to
position this to be absolute and we want
to set the height I wanna set the height
of it to 100% okay we also want it to be
displayed as a block and we're gonna set
the background color let's set the
background color to that yellow which is
this right here all right and we're
gonna set the width to five pixels so
that's the width of the yellow bar all
right and then we want the position to
be from the top 0 and we want from the
left we want it to be halfway through so
50% okay and then the z-index for this
we're actually going to set to 3 because
it should be on top of both all right
save that and there we go now we have a
nice little yellow line in the middle
okay so now we want to deal with the
skew we want it to go you know sideways
and I showed you that the translate I'm
sorry the transform skew property we can
do that in CSS it's kind of advanced I
am planning on doing an advanced CSS
course crash course on YouTube soon and
it will have stuff like this but don't
worry about if you don't understand
every single line but basically we're
gonna take the skewed class and we want
the handle okay so skewed and handle and
then we're gonna set from top top we're
gonna say 50%
okay and then we're gonna set the
transform and we're gonna set rotate and
we want to set that to 30 degrees so 30
deg and then we're also gonna set
translate Y and we're gonna set that to
negative 50%
all right so let's save that and it's
going to give us that slant all right so
now what I want to do is set the height
we set the height to 200% so it's gonna
go you know all the way across the whole
thing and since its diagonal we had to
increase the height and then we want to
set the transform origin so transform
- origin we're going to set that to top
okay so now it's in the middle like that
so now we want to handle the top class
which is the gray so we're gonna say
dots skewed and dot top and we're going
to set the transform let's set that to
skew and we're going to set it to
negative 30 degrees save that okay so
that looks kind of weird now we're going
to set the margin left and we're
actually going to set that to negative
1000 pixels
okay so we'll save that and then what
we're going to do is we're going to set
the width here and we're going to use
the calc function okay so we can
actually do a calculation here and we're
going to take the 50 viewport widths and
then we're going to add that 1000 pixels
all right save that and it should look
like that
okay so right now we just have we don't
we don't see that the actual content
wrap okay the text so we want to add
that so down here we're going to say
skewed top and then we want the content
wrap right which has the h1 and the
paragraph and the content body and we're
going to say transform and then we want
to also set skew on that and we want to
set that to 30 degrees okay and then
we'll set our margin left to 1,000
pixels and save and there we go so that
looks pretty cool even without
JavaScript that looks cool and then the
last thing I want to do is if it gets
too small or this is responsive so if it
gets too small I want the text to be I
want to decrease the text the size of
the text so what we'll do is add a
little media query in here we'll say at
media and let's say first for screen
sizes that are less than 768
so we'll say max width 768 pixels then
we want to set the body text or font
size number we initially set it to a
hundred percent we just want to set it
to 75% all right we'll save okay so that
makes it a little more responsive cool
all right so that's it for the CSS now
we're gonna add the JavaScript all right
so let's go ahead and go into our main
j/s and first thing we want to do is
basically wait for the content to load
our wait for the page to load so we're
gonna add on to the document we're gonna
add an event listener by saying add
event listener and we're gonna pass in
here what we're waiting for is Dom
content loaded okay so when the Dom
loads basically we're saying
and then we're gonna run a function okay
and we're going to just create some
variables here we want our wrapper we
can set you can get that with document
dot get element by ID okay it has an
idea of wrapper and then we're going to
set the top or till yeah top layer and
we'll set that to our wrapper and then
we want to do query selector okay so
basically query selector works like
jQuery we can put anything in here IDs
tags whatever we want we're going to
grab the class of top okay we're going
to put that into a variable called top
layer and this query selector you don't
have to just you don't you don't have to
use this on document you can use it
wherever you want in this case we're
using it on the wrapper so any class of
top that's inside the wrapper we're
gonna grab alright and then we also want
the handle alright so we'll say handle
and again we're going to use wrapper dot
query selector and we want to get the
class of handle okay and then I'm going
to set two more variables one is going
to be skew and we're going to set that
to zero and then one is going to be
Delta and we're going to set that to
zero all right and then down here what
we want to do is we want to test to see
if if wrapper has a class of skewed okay
if it does we want a set of we want to
set this skew variable to 1,000 because
remember it's a thousand pixels so we
want to match that okay so let's say if
wrapper dot and then we're gonna get say
class name so if wrapper class name dot
index of skewed
okay because remember we have that
skewed class in here right here so we're
looking for that so if that is not equal
to negative one because if it's not
found it'll actually be equal to
negative one so we want to make sure
it's not equal to negative one and then
we're gonna set the skew variable to
1000 all right so let's go ahead and
save that now we're not gonna see
anything yet because we hadn't we
haven't added our mousemove event so
that's what we're gonna do now so let's
say wrapper dot add eventlistener and we
want to listen for a mouse move which
just means anytime that the mouse is
being moved inside that element and then
we're going to run a function alright so
in this in this the parameters of this
function we're gonna pass in an event
parameter alright and then we want to
get the Delta or the position between
the mouse and the center point so we can
do that by setting let's set the Delta
variable to the event dot client X and
let me just show it actually let's just
show you real quick that you can you can
grab the position of the mouse if we say
console dot log and we say e dot client
X let's go ahead and save that and let's
open up a console f12 and you'll see
wherever I move it's going to track my
mouse it's going to track the x position
we can also do client Y to get it on to
get the y-axis position all right but
notice if I move from the side it'll
start over here at zero and it'll keep
going and it'll keep going up if we did
client Y it would do the same thing but
going down so what we want to do here is
we want to take this variable and we
want to set it to the client X and then
we want to take away the window okay
from the main window object there's a
property called inner width okay so we
want to say
window dot inner width and we
to divide that by two and then we want
to multiply that by zero point by half
by 0.5 all right so let's save that
still not going to do anything what we
want to do now is move the handle so we
want to take that handle variable and we
want to say style dot left okay using
this dot style we can change any CSS
properties we want in this case we're
changing the left property and we're
going to set it to the client X so e dot
client x plus that Delta and then we
just want to add on pixels or
concatenate px so it knows that it's
pixels alright so we'll save that handle
is not defined
why is handle not defined we have let
handle equals wrapper dot query selector
handle spelling mistake here and div
class handle that's kind of weird
Hindle is not defined oh you know what I
did all of everything we're doing down
here should be within this function
right here this is not right so this
should actually be within this function
sorry about that all right so now if I
save there we go alright so now the
handle is moving just fine it's doing
what it's supposed to so we want to do
one more thing here we want to adjust
the top panel width to go along with
this handle so we're going to take that
top layer right and we're going to set
these start the width so we can say dot
style dot width and we want to set that
to e dot client X okay so the most
position of the X access and then we
just want to add that skew variable
which is 1000 and then we want to add on
that Delta variable which is this right
here this formula and then we just want
to add the pixels we want to concatenate
px like that
all right so we'll save it and there we
go so now the width is adjusting along
with the handle now if you want the
effect like if we look at I don't have
it open anymore Corsair but the Corsair
site didn't have one single yellow bar
like that it kind of had two separate
ones but what you could do is you could
set this to something different like 990
like set it off an offset of 10 pixels
and now you can see that it kind of
offsets the yellow the yellow bar so you
may like that that kind of effect if you
want to do that but I like I like having
it be just a single yellow bar all right
so that's it guys hopefully you enjoyed
this project I think it's something
that's pretty cool and pretty rare
there's not much JavaScript at all I
know the formula here the stuff math and
it's kind of confusing at least for me I
hate math I've always been horrible at
math but this if if you don't if you
don't have any issues with math this
should be pretty easy to understand all
right but most of the work was in the
CSS ok and
and the transform property is very very
powerful so I would suggest looking at
that more we're gonna look at that in
the advanced CSS crash course whenever I
get around to it alright so that's it
guys hope you liked it please leave a
