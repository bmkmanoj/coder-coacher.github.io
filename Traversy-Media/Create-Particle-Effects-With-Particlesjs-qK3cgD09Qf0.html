we're going to be doing something a
little different a little fun and we're
going to be using particles GAF's which
is a javascript library for creating
particles or particle effects and what I
mean by that is if we look down here
this is the github page if we look here
you see all these little specs here
these are a little particles that can
animate they can interact with each
other they can interact with your with
your mouse you can set speeds and sizes
and images and it's really cool so I
would imagine you can do some really
advanced stuff with this like create
games and stuff like that but we're
going to look at the basics we're going
to set it up basically once we include
the library we just have to create a
JSON file with with all of these
different values okay I mean you don't
have to use all of these but these are
all the different things that you can do
as far as changing the number of
particles the shape you can use you know
circles triangles images you can use
custom images size how it interacts with
your environment so there's a lot of
things to configure here now what we're
going to be building is this right here
and I wanted to do something aside from
just the particles so I put this login
form over the over the the overlay here
now notice when I hover over the
particles they'll kind of move out of
the way so that's a really cool response
feature that it has and if I click it
will create more particles all right so
you can do cool things like that and
it's actually really easy to set up I
just learned about this probably a week
ago I've had maybe three or four people
requests for me to do something on
particles j/s so I looked into it and
it's easy enough so I think you guys
will enjoy it and let's go ahead and get
started with it this video is sponsored
by dev Mountain if you're interested in
learning web development iOS or UX
design dev Mountain is a 12-week design
and development boot camp intended to
get you a full-time job in the industry

click the link in the description below
alright guys so we're going to get
started now one thing I want to mention
is if you're using Chrome you're going
to want to have some kind of server and
not just open the HTML file on your
filesystem because if we do that let me
just show you real quick
let's see so if I open up my index.html
this is the finished product you'll see
that the particles are not showing if I
open up the console here it's saying
that it can't load particles Jason which
is the JSON file that we include now to
get around this you can either use a
different browser but I would suggest
using some kind of server anyways now
what I'm going to be doing is using atom
the atom text editor with a plug-in
called atom live server now if you're
not using atom another another nice
option is to use live server which is
actually an NPM module so as long as you
have no js' installed you can simply
just go ahead and install this this is
what I have running right now I'm going
to just stop it and you can do NPM
install - g4 global and then live -
server okay so this is a really nice dev
server now once you have that installed
you can simply run live server in the
diff make sure you're in the directory
and it will go ahead and it'll open it
on port 8080 so it's a very simple
solution and if you have xampp or MAMP
or something like that of course you can
use that just any kind of server really
all right so I just wanted to mention
that before we start but I'm going to go
ahead and close that up so what I have
here in atom is I have a folder called
particles login okay just create that
summer on your machine with an
index.html file so I'm going to just add
some basic structure to my HTML file
okay I'm using Emmet so I'm able to do
exclamation and then tab and it gives me
this basic structure so for our title
will just say particles login all right
now we're going to need to create in
Cluj so I'm going to use a CDN and it's
from jsj is deliver let's see can we
search let's see so it's jeaious I just
it's not on the github page I don't
think I don't know why
and it doesn't look like it's on here I
mean we could install it with NPM oh
right here right here
so it's this link right here we're going
to grab that and go ahead and put in a
script tag we're going to give it a
source and we're going to paste that
link in all right so now we include the
library now we're going to have to have
some kind of element to hook on to so if
we look at the documentation and see
they have a div with the idea of
particle J s so we'll just go ahead and
copy that we'll put that right in the
body that's that's going to act as our
canvas okay so basically the whole thing
where all the particles float around
alright so now that we've done that we
need to call this we need to do this
particle J s load and then pass a couple
things in so let's create another set of
script tags alright and we are going to
say particles J s dot load and we're
going to pass in here this ID which is
particles
- J s that's going to be the first
parameter second parameter is going to
be the JSON file where we put all of our
configurations so we'll call that
particles dot jason and then a third
parameter of a callback that's going to
fire off when the json file is loaded
correctly so let's just do a console log
whoops I didn't say console dot log and
we're going to say particles dot jason
loaded alright so let's go ahead and
save that now I'm going to open this
with Adam server so let's say packages
Adam live server start server and of
course if you're not using Adam you can
use what I showed you live server or
just just any kind of server all right
so let's open up our console here all
right so we're getting an error here
because it's looking for a file called
particles Jason and we haven't created
that yet so let's go ahead and do that
we'll say new file
particles dot Jason okay we also want a
CSS file so I'm going to create a file
called style dot CSS all right and then
for the CSS what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say ID particles
- J s I think that's what I called it
that we called it yep
so we're grabbing on to this and all I
want to do here is I want to add a
background alright so I'm going to add
the background color of of firebrick so
it's saved that and let's actually give
that a height of 400 pixels all right so
we need to include that CSS file so
let's go to our head area put a link tag
and we're going to include style dot CSS
save it and there we go so this is going
to be our canvas now we're going to go
to our particles JSON file and we're
going to add a we're going to add a
bunch of stuff here there's a lot of
different configuration options all
right now for Jason we need to have some
open parentheses
I'm sorry curly braces and then each
key/value pair needs to be wrapped in
double quotes okay it needs to be
standard Jason syntax so the first one
we're going to do here is we're going to
say particles okay we're going to set
that to a set of curly braces and then
we're going to say number okay so number
and then that takes a value and for the
value I'm going to say 100 okay so let's
go ahead and save this and there we go
so we don't get that error anymore
because we're getting particles Jason
loaded and it's reading this config so
now we have here is a hundred different
particles floating in our canvas okay
and and by default if I click it's going
to create more particles alright so this
is this is the default now we can change
this we could do let's say 10 particles
and save and we'll have 10 floating
around all right if we do I would say a
thousand and save it's kind of look like
that but I
I think 100 is good for now alright
until at least until we change the size
of them because they're pretty big by
default now we can also change the color
so what we want to do is go under number
and put a comma right here and we can
set a color we'll set that to a set of
curly braces and that can also have a
value and we can make it whatever we
want we can use hexadecimal so if we
said black it's going to change them all
to black all right but I'm actually
going to keep them white okay so we have
number we have color next we can do
shape so right here let's say shape all
right now shape can actually take in
quite a few things first thing it can
take in as a type okay so the default is
circle but we can have square save that
actually that's not going to work just
yet why not
actually it's square one now this
documentation the github page will
actually show us all the different
values I get square isn't one you see
right here if circle edge maybe edges
square I think that's yep edges square
all right so we have edge we have
triangle save that triangle I think that
I think this looks kind of stupid though
with these shapes triangle what else do
we have
with polygon star let's try star star
yeah that looks kind of dumb we can also
use custom images so let's do a quick
search we'll just do a search for let's
say white icon as you can see I've
already done this and let's grab this
right here this user icon
so we'll say view image I'm just going
to grab the link and then what we'll do
is change the type to image and then we
can go right under it and we can say
image set that to some curly braces and
then this is only going to be in effect
if the type is image okay and this can
take in a source which I'm going to just
paste the link in that I just copy
let's go ahead and save that and now we
have these little user icons floating
around so you can use absolutely any
image you want here we've actually going
to change this back to circle okay so we
can also add a stroke or which is a
border so it's a stroke we'll set that
to some curly braces make sure we put a
comma here and we can set the width so
let's say a width of 4 and we can set a
color let's set a color of black save
that and now we have a black of 4 pixel
black border around each particle
alright I don't really like how that
looks it looks really cartoony so I'm
going to change the width to 1 and I'm
going to change the color to a light
gray okay and I'm also going to make
these a lot smaller later on so we also
have opacity we can change the
transparency of the particles so we're
going to go and save I'm going to really
follow the structure of the Jason
document here so we're going to go right
under the shape okay so the shape ends
right here so we'll put a comma there
and we'll say opacity and this can take
quite a few things first we have the
value all right so the value we're going
to set that to actually it's a number so
it's going to be 0 will do 0.5 let's
save and now you can see you can
actually see through them when they go
over each other you can see the one
behind it now you can set a value of
random or key of random and you can set
a value of either true or false I think
false is the default but let's set it to
true and then what that does is it'll
make some of them transparent some of
them are not or at least change the
range of transparency okay so we can do
that let's see so we can also add a key
called annum for an animation and that's
actually an object and we can set that
to we could set an able
let's say true see if that does so now
you can see that they were actually
blinking so they're kind of animating
and we can change the speed so speed
will say 1 ok so that's 1 let's see what
happens if we put it to 10 so now
they're going really really fast kind of
flashing let's see what else I think
that's all that I'm interested in with
this I'm actually going to change enable
the false flow because I don't want that
alright so that is opacity now for the
size we're going to go under opacity so
that ends right here so we're going to
put a comma and then we're going to say
sighs okay so for size let's do the
value so I'm going to set the value to 5
and let's save and now you'll see
they're a lot smaller so I like this
better I think it looks cleaner so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to increase
the number to what did I do
400 change it from 100 to 400 and save
all right so that looks pretty damn cool
and so we have some other stuff we can
do with size we can do random so random
I think is is by default false but we
can set that to true and now you'll see
that there they change in size this
one's smaller than that one so they'll
go from I think 1 to 5 since we set the
max to 5
all right so but I'm going to change
that back to false just know that you
can do that
now we can also add an an improper T to
the side just like we did to the opacity
so we'll say annum and let's set enable
to true save that and now they'll
fluctuate in size you can see they're
kind of changing you can set the speed
as well I'll set the speed to 10
or can we not do speed oh we can do
speed it doesn't really look like it's
much different what if we did 30 there
we go so that's going much faster but
I'm going to set this to enable false
I'm basically just putting these in to
show you guys it is an option but I
don't want that option alright so see
what else we want to do here let's go
ahead and use line linked so now all
these options you can see I'm grabbing
from the github page I'm not using every
single one because some of them aren't
that interesting we just did sighs let's
do the line linked and then down here
you can see all the different options
for each one for instance the shape type
we have all the different options here I
think I already told you that though so
let's see let's do line linked I think
that has to do with see how they connect
to each other I think it has to do with
how that works so to put a comma here
and we're going to say line blinked okay
so let's say we'll add enable so enable
true save doesn't what I don't know if
that looks any different see we have a
distance value remember guys I'm pretty
new to this as well so distance we're
going to do 120 save so it kind of
separates them out a little bit I think
and we can also set the the the color I
guess that's the color of the lines say
color and we'll set it to black see what
happens with that yeah so we can change
the color of the lines but we'll keep
that at white all right and we can also
set the width so let's say with I
believe the default is 1 so let's change
it to 4
and it looks that looked actually looks
really blurry but we'll keep that at one
all right so next thing we're going to
do is the move so let's put a comma
underline linked and we'll say move so
this has to do with the direction this
has to do with the speed things like
that so first one we're going to set is
enable and we're going to set it to true
let's see what happens if we set it to
false
nothing true huh that's weird
let's see I want to look at move enable
true false so it just makes everything
go away that's we're getting an error
down here I cannot read property are of
undefined alright maybe I'm missing
something I don't know who cares let's
just leave it at true and then let's
let's go ahead and change the speed so
for speed let's say 10 whoa so that goes
pretty fast let's see what the max speed
is move speed doesn't tell us the max or
maybe 4 is the max no what if we change
what if we put it to a hundred whoa that
makes me dizzy actually put the let's
put it to alright so speed 2 we can also
change the direction so for direction
the default I think is none but if we
look here you'll see we have none we've
talked top right right bottom right so
let's try some of these will do top ok
so it just moves up we can do top right
goes to the top right we can do bottom
right
so you can change the way that these go
but I'm just going to keep it at none ok
let's see we can also set straight let's
see what straight does so straight will
set to true and that just kind of keeps
everything in place I guess it's kind of
weird also that's a false all right so
that's moved now we also have
interactivity now interactivity is
actually going to go after particles
okay so if we go up here we have this
main value or this main key of particles
we want to go under that so right here
we're going to put a comma that actually
screwed me up when I was when I was
testing this out I'm trying this I
initially put the interactivity under
here and it just caused issues as you
could imagine because that's not what
you're supposed to do so let's say
interactivity okay so interactivity now
this is where we can define event so for
hover and click so what I'm going to do
here is we're going to say event and we
are going to set four events on hover
and we're going to put a comma right
here and we're going to say on click
okay so let's start with the hover now
we need an enable first of all and then
we're going to set enable to true and
then we need a mode okay so for mode
let's take a look at the documentation
and go to on hover mode so we have grab
bubble repulse and we can also do a
raise where apparently we can do more
than one I think what I have for our
final project our final result is
repulse because
want I want the particles to repulse
away from the mouse when I hover over so
let's do that for pulse go ahead and
save and now you'll see they repulse but
it is like a huge radius which we don't
want so to change those things to change
config options for the events we can go
under events which ends right here and
we can put in modes okay and then for
modes we want to say we want to work on
repulse and repulse has an option of
distance and for distance we're going to
put in 50 okay we can also put in a
duration and for the duration I'm going
to say 0.4 so let's save that and now
you'll see there's not such a wide
radius when I hover over so that's
that's the effect that I'm looking for
all right now let's look at on click so
for on click we're going to say enable
true now I think on click is enabled by
default because we have that effect as I
click by default and I think that's push
okay if we look at the docs right here
on click mode we have push which just
means it's going to push on to the
particles it's going to add particles
all right so let's say mode and by
default it's push but let's see what
else we have
for we have removed so let's try that I
actually haven't tried that all right so
save and now am i clearing it out yep
you'll see that as I'm clicking they're
going away so we can remove them we have
bubble let's see what that does
so whoa so that's a bubble and then if
you want to change the config for
specific modes like we did repulse and
you want to do bubble we can do that as
well so we'll say bubble and let's say
we want to change the distance let's
change the distance let's say a hundreds
if that okay so the size is what I want
the size will say ten so now you'll see
that they're they're bubbling up but
it's not as big okay but I'm going to
keep the the click event to push that
way when we click we can add more all
right so just about there guys now what
we're going to do is we're going to add
the log in okay I have the effects that
I want and I mean this is pretty cool
you can you can really experiment with
this there's more options if you really
want to look through it and you know see
the different effects maybe change the
background color if you want things like
that but we're running out of time here
so let's go ahead and add the HTML for
our login so I'm going to go inside of
the div with the particle j/s ID and
we're going to put another div with an
ID of login and let's go ahead and add a
form and in this form we're going to
have a div with a label so we'll say
username and let's put put a line break
let's put an input type text
let's put a placeholder did I do a
placeholder of username okay so that's
what it's going to look like by default
now I'm going to copy this div and we're
going to put in another one this is
going to be the password
and then we're going to do a button so
right under this div will put an input
it's going to have a type of submit and
give it a value of login all right so
now we're going to add a little bit CSS
so let's go to style.css let's first add
a couple things to the body so for the
body I'm going to say margin:0 and then
let's change the font so we're going to
say font and normal let's do 16 pixels
arial helvetica and stand sarah
alright and then we're going to just set
the color to a dark grey now we also
want to style the login okay the ID of
login we're going to give it a
background of white or give it an
opacity of 0.9 just so we can slightly
see through it and then we're going to
set the padding to 2m let's set the
border to grey two pixels solid flip two
pixels okay
and let's set the position because we
want to move it down and over so we're
going to set the position to absolute
and then we'll set to talk to 100 pixels
and we'll set the left to 50 pixels
save that all right now I just want to
add some margin and padding to the
inputs okay not to all the inputs not
the button just the username and
password so let's say login input and we
want the one that has a type of text we
also want input with the type of
password all right
and then we're just going to add some
padding we'll say seven pixels let's add
margin bottom ten pixels and let's say
border one pixel Brahe solid save and
there we go so I know this isn't
terribly useful but I think it's
something really cool it's something
different
something we haven't really done before
and as far as I can tell it's used
mostly for aesthetics and you know
visual visualization I'm sure you can
implement some kind of like graphing
data which would be kind of cool maybe
show like nodes of a social network or
something like that I don't really know
I'm just getting into this I've actually
heard about it from you guys from a
couple requests so that's going to be it
guys one last thing I do want to say is
when you guys request video request
videos that's absolutely fine I try to
take as many requests as I can but
please don't be a dick about it I
actually had a comment on the last video
I did where someone actually said how
many times have I told you to create a
tutorial on progressive web apps you
know and say saying something like what
is this like the video I put out and
that just I don't know that just rubbed
me the wrong way and I'm not someone
that lets people talk to me like that in
real life so if you want to get your
your requests heard don't talk to me
like that something it's not going to
happen I actually don't want to do a
video on progressive web apps now
because of this dickhead I mean it's
something I do want to do when other
people have asked me so I will do it
eventually but just know that when you
talk to someone like that it's not going
to you're not going to get what you want
by doing that alright and and you know a
lot of you guys actually hooked in on
that comment and said you know don't you
know why don't you just unsubscribe or
go somewhere else or something and
that's awesome you guys are you know
like I always say 99.9% you guys a
friggin awesome and that's why I
continue to put out free content but you
know just be respectful that's that's
all I'm saying all right so hopefully
you guys enjoyed this I am actually
going on vacation with my family for
three or four days so I may not have a
video out for
maybe four maybe four days or so I'm
really not sure but thanks for watching
guys and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
