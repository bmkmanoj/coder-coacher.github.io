pen artists we're able to get the artist
page along with a list of albums with a
button now we want to do is make that
button go to an album component that's
going to give us a list of tracks and
some information so what we're gonna do
first is let's create let's go into our
service and we need one more function
here to get a specific album so we
actually want to add another property up
here called album URL I'll be being
singular and then down here let's copy
this and that's gonna be just get album
and that's gonna take in an ID this will
be the actual album ID and let's take
off the S here and then this URL we're
gonna change this to v1 slash yeah v1
slash albums slash and then we'll add on
that ID alright and then we'll just
change this to album URL and that should
be good so save that and now we need to
do is create in the components folder
another folder called album and then
we're gonna create a file called album
dot components dot TS and then we also
want the HTML alright now let's just
copy what we have in one of these let's
say the about component we just want
that okay and then we're just going to
change this to album
okay now we're doing the same type of
thing that we did with our artist page
where we're using the routers this
activated rope so let's go ahead and
copy that we also need the router
directives and the service I'm just
going to copy this whole thing actually
and then inside the album component
paste it in let's add the router
directives okay and let's see what else
we need here okay so we're gonna need
this constructor an ID we're not gonna
need the artist but I'm just gonna copy
this
paste that inkay we don't need that and
then this will just be album singular
okay Spotify service is being injected
activated route is being injected and
then we can probably just grab the rest
of it an artist this ng on the knit ok
paste that in and then let's see we're
gonna map subscribe ID get rid of that
second one we don't need that and then
this is gonna be Spotify service gets
album okay we're passing in the ID
subscribe let's say album
all right so let's save that and then
we're gonna go into some other files
let's go to our main app component and
we're just going to bring in the album
component here okay and let's see we
don't have the artist component here
either we should bring that in all right
so we're gonna need a rope so let's go
to our app dot routes file and let's see
we'll copy this change that to album
okay we're gonna have to bring that in
up here
save that and then let's go to our
artist HTML and go down to where we have
the link to the album details and let's
see we're gonna say router link equals
let's see what are we put in here /
album / and then we need the ID so we're
gonna say let's see how do we get the
album ID just album dot ID I believe and
that should do it we might have a little
debugging to do now since we're using
the we're using a router link here in
the artist component that means that in
the TS file we have to oh we already did
it never mind we already have the router
directives so let's see where we're at
at this point open up the console and
it's a Aerosmith and if we click on one
of those it takes us to album slash and
then the ID so that's working I don't
think we have anything in the HTML no we
don't all right so let's add some stuff
here let's put a div and let's give it
an ID of album and also we're gonna do
an NG if just to make sure that there
actually is an album
alright let's put in a header give it a
class of album header and this is going
to be pretty similar to the artist
header that we created and then let's do
a div class equals row okay and here
we're going to have two columns we're
going to do a four column and let's also
do an eight column alright so in the
four column we're gonna have the album
image so we're gonna have to check for
that I'm actually gonna paste some of
this in just to save a little on time
same thing we've been doing we're
checking to see if the album images
length is greater than zero if it is
we're going to spit out an image you can
see album image is zero URL and then in
the a column div we're gonna have a
couple things you just paste that in and
make this bigger so basically what we're
doing here is we have an h4 and this is
gonna be the album artist and the way it
the way it gives it to us is in an array
so that's why we're testing to see for
the length and then we're just doing a
for loop to loop through the artist
which in most cases will be just one
just one artist and then we'll have the
name we're gonna have the actual album
name and then the release date alright
and under that we have a link that's
gonna go to the actual Spotify page and
you can use this external URLs dot
Spotify
all right so let's go ahead and save
that and then go back to localhost 3000
and do a search
Arrowsmith let's say this album here and
there we go
if we click view and Spotify that takes
us to the actual Spotify page all right
good
so we also want to list the tracks so we
want to go down under the header and
let's put a div and give it a class of
album tracks and let's put an h2 album
tracks and under that we're gonna do an
NG floor
and we want to set this to let track of
album dot tracks dot items okay so this
is going to loop through the tracks and
then let's put a div with the class of
well
alright and in here we'll have an h5 and
I want to put the track number first so
this will be track dot track underscore
number and then a dash and then we'll
put the track name now we can even even
have a preview link where we can preview
the track so let's put a link here and
that is gonna go to track dot preview
underscore URL and let's set that target
to be underscore blank so it opens up in
a new page and then in here we'll just
say preview track all right so let's
also make the the spotify link go on
another page as well so just paste in
target alright let's check it out click
on album details and there we go you can
see we have a list of all the tracks
if we click preview track opens up in
another page and starts to play and I
don't have the volume up right now so we
get that and close that up alright so
everything seems to be working correctly
now for the about page I just want to
add a little bit of content to that so
let's go to the HTML for that and I'm
just going to paste this in just some
text we have the title the version
number and then just a quick description
of the app alright let's save that and
there we go ok so we are done so this is
a pretty useful application you search
music on Spotify you can open it right
up in Spotify you can preview tracks so
it's pretty useful hopefully you guys
enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next
project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
