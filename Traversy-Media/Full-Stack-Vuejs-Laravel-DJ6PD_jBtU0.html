of requests when I asked last week what
you guys wanted to see a lot of you guys
said view and laravel so I'm guessing
that you want to know how to build a
view Jas front end to a laravel back end
which is pretty easy because view comes
comes basically by default with laravel
you just have to do a few things to set
it up alright so in this video what
we're going to do is take the API that
we built in this video about a month ago
called laravel 5.5 api from scratch
using resources where we basically
created a REST API for articles and we
can create read update and delete
articles through that API so what we're
gonna do in this video is build a view
j/s front-end
alright so I'm not gonna go through
everything if you want to you can watch
this video and build the backend or you
could just clone it from the repository
which I'll put in the in the description
I'll have a repository for just the API
and then a repository for the full app
that I'm building now alright and if you
do clone it you just want to clone this
link here or download it and just
install the laravel dependencies go
ahead and do the migration of course
you'll need to connect your database
parameters into your dot env file and
then you can add the seed data or if you
want if you want to add some sample
articles I think there's like 30 of them
and you may need to just generate an
encryption key if this is empty which it
probably will be alright and then you'll
have you'll have you'll be at the point
that I'm at now alright so I have it up
and running on a virtual host at L
articles app dot test and the landing
page is just the regular laravel landing
page but if I go to API slash articles
you can see that it's outputting 15
articles we have it set to 15 per page
and it's using the API resources which
is really cool because it gives us all
of our data but it also gives us extra
like links for pagination and we're
actually going to add some pagination in
this app which is something that I don't
usually do because I freaking hate it I
hate doing pagination but it is it's
requested a lot so I'm sure a lot of
guys will appreciate that but using the
API resources really makes pagination
easy and we're not going to use a view
component or anything like that we're
gonna do it all from scratch
alright so that's what we'll be building
to show you the finished products real
quick let me just go to let's see I
think it's HTTP l articles dot tests so
this is what we'll be building this is
the view J s front-end and we're showing
five articles at a time and we have our
pagination right here you can see
previous as is disabled if I go to next
you can see previous is now not disabled
this will show the next five the next
five and we have six pages once we get
on the last page this is disabled so
really nice pagination alright and of
course we can add an article it'll say
test two and we can add it just as an
article added and there it is we can
delete article removed and we can edit
I'll just say test and the number one
save article updated and you can see
that updates all right so that's what we
building we're using bootstrap for for
the UI so hopefully you guys enjoy this
and let's get started alright guys so I
am at the point where we were at the end
of that first video where we built the
back end where we built the API so now
we want to implement view j/s on the
front end alright now if you notice over
here in the lerigot files there's a
package dot JSON file it has a bunch of
scripts but if we look at the
dependencies you can see view J s is one
of them so we have view we have lodash
Axios which is an AJAX library laravel
mix is going to take care of building
and compiling our java script so we want
to go ahead and install all of these
dependencies and the first step is to
an npm install okay and that will create
a node modules folder with all of the
these dependencies in there okay and
then once that's done we're gonna run
the watch script which will have laravel
mix constantly watch and build our files
for us all right so now that's done
let's clear this up and let's just do
NPM run watch and that will just that'll
take up your console and just it'll
constantly watch everything for us okay
and you'll get that you may get this
little message here that says build
successful okay so we're gonna leave
this running I'll just make that a
little smaller and then we're gonna go
into resources and then assets j/s and
then that's where our view application
is so the app.js file this is our main
view file you can see it's we're
initializing view j/s it's looking for
an element with the ID of app which
we're gonna have to create in our
template okay it's also bringing in this
example component which is in this
components folder right here and it just
it's nothing really it just says I'm an
example component we're not going to be
using this but that's that's what they
give you as a boilerplate alright now as
it is we're just seeing the this the the
standard laravel landing page and we
want to change that so where this is
located as in the views and then the
Welcome dot blade okay so this is
basically our index file and I'm gonna
go ahead and just kind of clear most of
this stuff out let's change the title
here we'll just say L articles app and
let's see we're gonna get rid of all
these inline styles so just that whole
style tag we don't want that and then
we're going to get rid of everything
that's in the body
all right so you should just have a
clear body like that and let's just put
it in test and save and make sure that
that works so if I reload we just see
tests now when we want to use view it's
going to look for a div with the ID of
app so we want to put that in here so
we'll get rid of this test and we'll put
an ID of app and then in here we can put
any view components that we want so
we're gonna have an articles component
so we're gonna say articles we're just
gonna put in like a custom tag like that
and you know what let's actually wrap
that in a bootstrap container let's see
put that down and we'll bring this up
here alright so we'll save that now
that's not going to show us anything
because we haven't actually created the
articles component so let's go into
components create a new file called
articles dot view and in here we're
gonna put in our template and let's just
put a div and then we'll put an h2 and
we'll say articles
okay so we'll save that now it's still
not going to show up if I reload because
we need to go to our app j/s which is
our main view file and bring it in so
you can see it they brought in this
example component we're not going to use
that so we're gonna bring in articles
from articles dot view and if we save
that we're still not gonna see it
because we haven't brought in this main
app.js file into our welcome dot blade
so let's go down to the right above the
ending body tag here and let's put in a
script tag so we'll say script source
and we're going to use this asset helper
we'll put in double curly braces and say
asset
acet and it's gonna be Jay s slash fjs
and save reload and there we go and if
we open up our console you're gonna see
this SC RF token not found so if you're
going to use the view front end you need
to add this to your head area so we're
gonna go up here and we're gonna add a
new meta tag meta phone no we're gonna
say meta name and set this to CSRF -
token and this just protects against
cross-site forgeries we're gonna set the
content to whoops that should be in here
I'm gonna set the content to CSRF
underscore token I'm gonna set it to
that function then we need to add one
more line which will be a script tag and
inside the script tag we're going to say
window dot laravel and we're gonna set
that equal to an object which will be
CSRF token and we're gonna set that to
CSRF underscore token like that so that
should get rid of that error if we save
that and reload now we don't see that
error anymore okay so now we're ready to
start working with view now as far as
bootstrap I'm not going to use sass or
anything I'm just gonna get the
bootstrap CDN so let's just let's go to
get bootstrap calm go to get started and
I'm just gonna grab this and put it up
here and then grab the three javascript
files we need and put those down here
right above our app j/s
all right prettier is not working inside
of the blade template for some reason
okay so that should there we go so now
we're using bootstrap so we have our
articles component which has nothing in
it yet before we get to that I just want
to create a navbar component so we're
gonna say inside of our components
folder new file navbar dot view and in
here this is actually gonna be very
simple and we're not even going to have
any links it's just really for show so
let's say Neve let's give it a class of
nav bar and I'm using Emmet by the way
will say navbar - expand
- sm say navbar - dark and let's give it
a class of BG - info which will make it
blue and then a class of mb - - to give
it some margin bottom alright and then
we'll put a container inside of it and
then just our brand so an 8 and a tag
with the class of nav bar - brand and
we'll go ahead and put in here L
articles all right so we have our nav
bar now we can go to our blade template
our basically our index file and I'm
gonna put it right above the container
here so right here will say navbar
like that let's just have the silver
alright so if I reload that we're not
seeing anything it says unknown custom
element now about did you register the
component so we're gonna have to just
bring that into app KS just like we did
with articles so say navbar that okay
laravel mix build successful let's see
we're still not and I do wrong here
clear the cache maybe yeah I just said I
did ctrl f5 clear the cache so now we
have our navbar and that's all we need
for that file we can close that up and
now we're pretty much gonna work in our
articles the whole time now if we go if
we look at our API data so if we go to a
lot of L articles app dot test slash API
slash articles we get 15 per page and I
want to change that to 5 so we're
actually just going to edit inside the
laravel file if we go to our app HTTP
controllers and then article controller
you can see I did this in the last video
we did paginate 15 I'm going to change
it to paginate 5 and then I also want to
just change the ordering so that the
most recent is first okay so we can do
that by just going right here and saying
order by should be an uppercase B so
order by created underscore at and we
want to order it we want it descending
so we want to do d ESC and then we just
want to then do paginate all right so if
I save that we go to our API and reload
now you can see we're getting five per
page so that's what I want so that's all
we need to do here we can close that up
and now we're going to go into our
articles dot view file
now under the template we're gonna put
our script tag this is where all of our
component JavaScript is going to go we
want to export default and this is not
an intro to view Jas video I do have a
view Jas in 60 minutes video if you want
to watch that that'll explain everything
I'm just going to assume that you know
at least a little about PJs basically in
our data we want to return our state
okay so we're gonna have articles which
is going to be an empty array to start
with we're going to have article which
is going to represent a single article
which is an object that'll have an ID
blank to start with title and body okay
in addition to that we're gonna have an
article underscore ID set to nothing I
just move that on the next line whoops
and the reason we have this is because
when we do our update well if we do a
put request to our API we actually have
to send this field with it for it to be
a put because if we look at routes API
dot PHP this is all stuff we did in that
first video the put request also goes to
the store method okay
along with the post request they both go
to the same method we don't pass the ID
with the URL so what we pass is that
article underscore ID field that's how
it's gonna know that it's that that's
how it's gonna know which article to
update okay so in addition to that we
want pagination which is going to be an
object and we also want edit which is
our edit state will be false by default
because we're going to be using the same
form to add and edit so that's our data
alright now we want to fetch our
articles so we're gonna go directly
under data I'm going to put a comma
right here and we're going to use the
created method which will run
automatically when the page loads and
when it loads we want to run a method
called fetch articles okay so it's gonna
run this method now this method has to
be defined inside of methods so we'll
say right here
fetch articles and this is where we
actually want to make our call now as
far as making our request we're going to
use the fetch API so in here we'll say
fetch and we put in our URL which will
be API slash articles and then we'll do
our first dot then let's put this on a
new line and with the fetch API we have
to do one dot then which will give us
the response but that's not going to
give us the data we want to say that we
want to map that to Jason and then we do
another dot then and that gives us the
actual data okay
and I'm actually it I'm actually going
to change this to res because what it
gives us is this and if we look at this
it's not just an array of data it's an
object and this object has inside of it
an array called data so to access this
actual the actual articles we have to
access res dot data in addition to that
we can get links okay res dot links will
give us the pagination links and then
res dot meta will give us like the last
page current page total things like that
so what we want to do here or all I'm
going to do here is console dot log res
dot data like that
alright now this should run
automatically because we have it inside
of created so let's save that and go
back and reload the page and then down
here you can see we're getting all five
articles okay remember we're using five
per page so that's what it's going to
give us we're gonna add the pagination
later so don't worry about that so we
need this to output onto our page right
so we want to assign the articles that
are coming in to this articles array
right here so to do that we can simply
say this dots articles equals res dot
data right and then we'll go up here
into our view into our template and
we're gonna put these let's see we're
gonna put these inside of cards
bootstrap cards so we're going to use a
div here and we want to basically just
loop through the articles so to do that
we need to use a v4 directive so V dash
four and we're gonna say for article in
articles like that for v4 now we're
gonna we have this error here because
it's saying that it expects a V bind key
so that's kind of like in react it does
the same thing you want to have a unique
value as a key so we're also gonna add
here V dash bind and we want to bind a
key of a unique value so our unique
value will be article dot ID like that
alright and for this div that we just
created I want to also add
a couple classes one of card and one of
card body so that each article is
wrapped in a bootstrap card which is
basically just a boarder some padding
stuff like that all right and then in
our h3 here we'll put the title
so we'll say article dot title and then
in a paragraph
we'll put article dot body so let's save
that and let's reload and there we go we
get our five articles now I don't want
these squished together so I'm also
gonna add a class here of mb2 margin
bottom two so now there's some space in
between now for the pagination it's
gonna be a little difficult it's kind of
it's kind of hard but I'll try to
explain it the best I can basically if
we look at our API response we have the
page four first okay so this would be
the first page articles and then a
parameter of page equals one that we
have the last page which would be six
and then we have the previous page which
would be two alright so I'm sorry the
next page would be two so we need to get
those values and we need to use those
inside of our fetch instead of just
fetching from this so what will what
will happen is we'll have a parameter
here called page underscore URL and then
right here we're gonna say page
underscore URL is going to be equal to
the page URL if there is one or it's
just gonna be equal to slash API slash
articles and then instead of putting
this inside the fetch we're going to put
our page URL
okay and there are components to do
pagination but I figured that doing it
you know custom would be a better option
and show you guys how to do it alright
so once we get that page URL we want to
how we're gonna have another function
called make pagination okay so I want to
call this dot make pagination but we
need to kind of assign a different
variable for this so we're going to use
VM we're gonna say let VM equals this
like that and then down here inside of
our response our promised response we
can then say VM dot make pagination and
we want to pass in here both the links
okay if you look at our response the
links and the meta okay and we're
getting that from this res so we're
gonna say res dot meta and res dot links
okay so we're gonna pass those into the
make pagination we should probably add a
catch on to this as well just in case
there's an error that alright so now
what we want to do is create our make
pagination function or method and that's
going to go right under the fetch
articles
okay so make pagination takes in the
meta and the links and then what we'll
do is say let's pagination equals we're
gonna create an object here made up of
this stuff that's passed back to us like
the current page the last page and all
that so let's say current page we'll set
that to meta dot current page because if
we look in right here where as let's see
where's meta right here so we have meta
current page which right now is one so
we're assigning that we're also what we
also want the last page which we can
also get from that meta object so meta
dot last page we also want the next page
URL and that comes from the links so
links dot next and then we also want
whoops we also want the previous page
URL so prove page URL also comes from
links and that's dot free v' and we can
clearly see that right here breve next
alright so now that we have that object
we're going to set that to this
pagination value right here so we'll
simply say this dot pagination equals
pagination so that's it that's all we
need for our make pagination so I'll go
ahead and save that should still work
should see any errors or anything good
now we need to display it we need to
display our pagination so we're going to
go back up to our template and I want to
put the pagination above the articles so
I'm going to go right above the card
right here
and we're gonna put this actually you
know what we'll do is just go to get
bootstrap and let's go to components
pagination and yeah I'm gonna grab this
and let's put this here
okay now I'm not going to do the one two
three and all that in between instead in
between it's gonna say like one of six
two of six and so on but for now I'm
going to just get rid of the one two and
three and just have the previous and the
next and then we have some directives we
have to add to this stuff all right so
for this this previous li we're gonna
bind the class to it okay so we're gonna
say V - bind and we want to bind a class
and we're gonna set this to some
brackets and in here we want to say
disabled because we want it to be
disabled if there's no previous page so
we'll say disabled if not and then we're
going to use that pagination object
which has a previous underscore page
underscore URL value let's see why does
it look like that to save oh I didn't
put I gotta put quotes around this
like that all right so hopefully you can
see what's going on here we want this to
be disabled if there's no previous page
URL which is gonna come from down here
previous page URL all right and then we
also want if we click on the previous we
want it to fetch articles but we want to
pass in the previous page URL so I'm
gonna go let's we actually want to put
this on the a tag on the inside so let's
go right here and let's say I click
equals and we want to call fetch
articles and then we'll pass in here the
pagination object and then we want the
previous page URL okay but it will be
disabled if there is no previous page
URL so let's just save this and see what
we get okay so you can see that it is
disabled and that's good because we're
on the first page so now let's work on
the next so same thing here we wanted we
want it disabled if there's no next page
URL so I'm gonna grab this and put that
right here except we're going to say
disabled if there's no next page URL and
we also want the click I want this click
event we're going to put that in the a
tag right here
get a quote in there and then we're
gonna change this to next page URL
alright and we're passing this in as
this right here page URL so let's see
what happens if we try it
so we'll reload and if we click Next
there we go so this is the next page and
now you can see previous works if I go
back it doesn't if I keep going we get
to the last page it doesn't it we can't
go any more
all right so we're just about there now
we just want that middle part that says
what page were on so I'm going to go
back up to the pagination
and go in the middle of the the previous
and the next and let's put another Li so
just I'll just grab like one of these
and put that in here we want the page
item we want it disabled so it has a
class of this is always going to be
disabled it's not a link and then I'm
also going to change the text to dark
bootstrap has a text dark class we can
use and then inside here instead of the
number two we're going to say page and
then remember from the pagination object
we can get the current page okay we set
it up so we can get the current page and
then we're gonna say of and then also
from the pagination we can get the last
page all right so let's save that and
let's take a look and there we go one of
six two of six all right so our
pagination is now complete and I know
it's a lot of steps but it's nice to
have pagination in case you have you
know a ton of articles alright so now
that that's done let's do the next
easiest thing which is probably the
delete alright so we'll go ahead and
we'll go up here into our card okay so
our recurring cards and under the
paragraph let's put an HR and then we're
gonna have a button so let's see we'll
give this button a class of BTN BTN -
danger - make it red and it's going to
be a delete button alright we're going
to add a click event to this so we'll
say
klipsch not client click equals and
we're going to set this to delete
article and we're going to pass in the
article dot ID and then we'll go down to
our methods we'll go under the make
pagination which ends here
we'll say delete article oops I want to
say delete article actually yeah that
was right and it's going to take in ID
so we want to make a delete request to
our API alright but before we do that
let's just do a confirm since it's a
delete so we'll say if confirm are you
sure and then we're going to go ahead
and make our request so we'll say fetch
and we're gonna pass in here I'm gonna
actually going to use back ticks when
you use a template string because we
want to do API slash article okay
singular and then the ID like that okay
then we're going to pass in a second
parameter of an object and we're going
to say the method is gonna be delete and
let's do dot then and it's going to give
us the the article back so let's say res
dot jason
and we'll do a dot catch as well if
something goes wrong all right now
inside this dot then all I really want
to do here is just do an alert and just
say article removed and then we just
want to call fetch articles again so
this dot fetch articles first page
obviously so we don't pass anything in
and that should do it
so it's safe it's reload and now if I
click delete are you sure okay article
removed and you can see it goes away all
right so that's done now let's do the
add form it's actually gonna be the add
and edit form so we're going to create
this right below the h2 we put in a form
here doesn't need an action and let's
see inside here we'll put a form group
which is just a bootstrap class we'll
put input and let's give this a class of
form control and give it a place holder
of title and we want to now map this or
bind this input to this right here the
article title so to do that we use B
model so V - model and we're gonna set
that to article dot title and if you're
familiar with angular or not view or
angular 2 plus this is like ng model
okay and then let's see we'll go ahead
and just copy this paste in again and
this is gonna be the body but it's gonna
be a text area so I'm going to just
replace this with text area and of
course that needs an ending tag
placeholder we'll say body and then V
model is gonna be article dot body all
right and then finally we need a submit'
so we're gonna say button let's give it
a type of submit and let's say save I'm
also gonna give it a class of BTN and
BTN - light and let's also do BTN -
block all right so let's see if that
shows up okay there's our form let's
move this stuff down a little bit so for
our form
let's give it a class of MB will do MB
three and then we also need to add a
submit event to this
so we'll say submit and then we're going
to do submit prevent because we want to
prevent it from actually submitting to a
file or anything
so submit prevents and then we're gonna
call add article alright so down here in
our methods let's go below delete
article and then this is actually going
to handle the add and update so remember
we had that that state value of edit
which is false by default so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say if let's
do if this dot edit is equal to false
then we want to add else we want to
update okay so we're we want to deal
with the add so let's say fetch let's
get rid of that so fetch API slash
article is our end point and we want to
pass in some options method is gonna be
post making a post request and then the
body we want to wrap this in Jason dot
stringify because we want this to be
adjacent string and we're just gonna
pass in this dot article which has the
ID the title on the body okay now we
also have to add headers and we have to
add the content type so we're gonna say
content - type is going to be
application slash Jason
all right and then we'll go down here
and we'll do our dot then okay we take
our response res dodgy s'en do another
dot then and our dot catch
okay so inside the den here let's take
the data and I want to clear the form so
we'll say this dot article dot title
equals nothing and this dot
excuse me article dot body equals
nothing and then we'll do a alert you
don't have to do these alerts if you
don't want to they are kind of ugly but
I just want some kind of notification
and I don't feel like getting into flash
messages and then we just want to fetch
our articles again all right so let's
try that out
so we'll say test
article added and there it is
cool so now last thing to do is the edit
so what I'm going to do is put another
button right above the delete so we'll
take the delete button here and we'll
just copy it up and let's change the
click oops
we'll change the click to edit article
and we want to just pass in the entire
article not just the ID we'll change the
text to edit and we'll change the class
- BTN warning which will make it yellow
alright so the edit article is basically
just going to it's going to change this
value to true and it's also going to add
everything to this ok this article
object so let's go down here after edit
add article it's not going to do the
actual update the update happens here
but it's going to just basically set us
up for the update it's gonna input the
stuff into the form and so on alright so
let's do edit article actually yeah this
is fine I guess so edit article takes in
the entire article and then we're going
to set this dot edit to true we're gonna
set the article this dot article dot ID
to the article being passed in ID and
then remember what I said when we do the
update we have
an article underscore ID field that will
also get set to the article ID that's
being passed in and the title whoops and
the body okay
and that should do it so now if we save
this and we go back and actually let's
add a some margin bottom right here to
the edit button so if I click Edit you
can see it goes right into the form good
now when we save it's gonna now call
it's gonna it's gonna run this code
because this edit is now true so it's
not going to run this it's going to run
whatever we put in here so what I'm
gonna do is let's see I'm gonna copy all
of this this fetch and put that here
except we're gonna do put it's gonna be
a put request and for the body that's
gonna stay the same it's just going to
be all this stuff including the article
underscore ID which is needed for an
update all right and then let's see we
have our headers we need that down here
we'll just change the message to updated
and that should be good all right so
let's try it
so we'll reload we'll say test article
edit let's say test article updated and
save article updated okay and you can
see now it's updated alright so we now
have a complete crud application with
pagination in view J s using laravel as
it backend
alright so whenever you're going to edit
this just make sure you run your watch
script we can just now stop it with ctrl
C and that's our application alright and
maybe I'll go through a deployment with
this in a separate video laravel is
pretty easy to deploy compared to like
nodejs and some other some other
languages and frameworks and
technologies so that's it guys thanks
