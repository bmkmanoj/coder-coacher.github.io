for our angular and firestore
application what we're gonna do now is
take care of the update so basically we
want to have a little icon over here we
click and then it brings a little
drop-down where we can edit the item and
also have a delete button even though we
can we can already delete by double
clicking but I don't really like that
functionality because the user doesn't
really know that unless we we somehow
put it you know have instructions but I
just wanted to quit show you how we
could quickly delete an item before so
you can keep that or you can get rid of
it it's up to you but let's go to our
items component HTML file alright and
then we're gonna go basically we want to
add secondary content to the list item
so let's see we want to go after the
description so right here and we're
gonna put in a tag
let's just say href equals hash and then
we'll give it a class ok so class is
gonna be secondary yes
secondary content this is just Potter
materialized so secondary content and
inside the a we're gonna have an eye tag
with the class of FA and also a class of
FA - pencil which will give it a little
pencil icon alright and then let's see
that pencil icon is going to have an
event just gonna have a click event when
we click it it's gonna call edit item
we're gonna pass in the event and we're
gonna pass in the item itself like that
so let's save that see if it shows up ok
so we have our pencil if we look at the
console we should get an error when we
click it because there is no there is no
edit item
function yet so let's create that so
we'll go over to our items component TS
now we're gonna add a couple properties
here now I'm gonna try to explain this
we're gonna have a property called edit
state our edit state and it's gonna be
either true or false it's gonna start
off as false but when we click this we
want it to go to true because we want to
make it so that if the state is an edit
then we want to show a form here okay we
also want to set up a property called
item to edit because we need to know
which one of these is going to be edited
which one to add the form underneath so
we need those two extra properties so
let's go over here and let's say edit
state and that's going to be a boolean
true or false and we're gonna set it
initially to false okay we also want
item to edit and that's going to be item
all right and then let's see when we
call edit item that's going to take in
the event and item that we click and
we're gonna say this dot edit state
equals true
okay we're also going to set this dot
item to edit equal to the item that's
passed in when we click OK because when
we click this right here this pencil
icon the item that the current item is
gonna go into that function so it's
gonna know which one we want to edit
we're gonna set it to that property okay
so let's go ahead and save this and then
we need to update the interface or the
HTML so we want to go underneath this a
tag right here still inside of the LI
okay very important that we're still in
the LI and we're gonna put a div here
all right so we're gonna put a div and
we want to put an NG if this is going to
be a conditional
okay so ng-if edits state okay we're
gonna check that edit state property so
if it's true or false now remember when
we click on the the pencil icon it's
gonna change the edit state to true okay
so when that pencil icon is clicked
whatever we show in here is going to
show now not only do we want to check
the edit State but we want to check to
make sure our check to see which item to
edit because we need to know which one
you know where to put the form so we're
gonna say edit state and item to edit
now remember the item to edit is the
whole item it's the object with the ID
the tête the title and the description
so we want to check the ID and we want
to see if it's equal to the current item
in the iterations ID okay so going by
this ng4 right here we're gonna check to
see if that's the item to edit okay now
if it is then we're gonna continue and
we're gonna have a form alright so let's
see we're gonna say well actually let's
let's just test this out so I'm just
gonna say test and save and then if we
go over here and I click this pencil
there we go test click this one test
alright so that's that's perfect but
obviously we don't want to just display
tests we want form okay and then this
form let's put an NG submit this form is
gonna go to a function called update
item and then we're just gonna pass in
that particular item okay and then let's
see in the form it's gonna be very
similar to the add form so what I'm
gonna do is go to the add item component
HTML I'm gonna grab this whole row
that's
in the forum like that I'm gonna copy
that and so you go back here paste that
in and I just I don't want the labels
I'm gonna get rid of that that label and
this label and then the rest is the rest
we can pretty much keep because we're a
set we're binding item title and item
dot description and if we look at the
items component TS file we have the
items right here and each one has an
item when we fetch them and we loop
through them they have an item title and
description so those should actually get
filled automatically so let me just save
this and if that didn't make any sense
basically we hey we have the item title
here item dot description they're gonna
get put in the form as well all right so
let's see let's click on the button here
and you can see the form and it's filled
click that item - this is item 2 item 3
this is item 3 good now the submit here
I'm going to change that I'm gonna
change that to update item I'm also
going to change the color so let's give
this a color of orange okay so now if I
click update item good and then I also
want to delete button next to it so what
I'll do is right under the input will
put a button and let's give this a class
of BTN and a class of of red and we'll
say delete item and then all we're gonna
do is call the delete item just like we
did up here at the double-click in fact
I'm gonna just cut that out
okay I'm gonna cut that out so that so
that we don't have the double click
anymore and we'll put that on this
button except it's gonna be just a
regular click all right save that and
now we have our delete we can test it
out now we can't close these yet we can
go from you know from one item to
another but we can't we can't close it
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add
another little icon to collapse it back
but let's just try the delete so item 3
delete and it goes away
all right good so now let's add that
icon to basically fold it back up so I'm
gonna go right under the pencil icon up
here I'm actually gonna copy it okay and
then let's see we're going to set this
click to call a function called clear
state it's not going to take anything in
though and we're gonna change it to FA
compress okay I will save it okay so now
we have the compressed now we only want
this shown when it when this is expanded
okay we don't want it on all of them
just the current expanded one so we're
going to give it the same condition that
we gave this div we want to check the
item to edit and we want to check to
make sure it's an edit state so I'm
going to copy this ng-if and put it on
this icon and save so now when I click
this now you can see the this icon same
thing here all right now right now if I
click nothing happens because we didn't
create the clear state where is it right
here clear state so let's do that real
quick cuz that's pretty easy so I'm
gonna say clear state
and all this is gonna do really is just
set edits date back to false oops
let's see set edit state to false and
it's gonna set this item to edit equal
to null so now click that and if I click
the compress it goes back up good now as
it is when if I were to delete just open
the console just to show you real quick
if I were to delete the item you'll see
we get an error down here now it's
saying update item is not a function
because basically we deleted this but we
still kept the state so what we need to
do is after or web right before we
delete the item in our component we just
want to call clear state so this dot
clear state like that all right so now
if I were to add something here and go
and delete now we don't get that that
error all right
let's add some other stuff here
all right so now we have to do actually
all we really have left to do is the
update okay so when we click this it's
going to call update item and you can
see that right here okay we're gonna
submit to update item passing in the
item so let's go to our component ts
file update item okay it's gonna take in
item and let's see we're going to call
our service function which we haven't
created yet but we will
so item service dot update item pass in
the item and then we're just going to
clear the state okay we want that we
want that form to get folded back up
alright and these items here we can
actually give these all types of item I
don't know why then do that alright so
now let's create the update item inside
the service so we'll go back to services
item service update item okay that takes
an item give it to type
and then this is almost identical to the
delete so I'm gonna copy this paste that
in we're using the item dock setting it
to that particular item and then instead
of doing delete we're gonna do update
and then we're gonna pass in the new
item that's being brought passed in
right here so let's save okay that
should fix all right so let's edit item
two we'll change it to item TW oh I'll
change this to will just say this has
been updated click update item so item
two this has been updated if I reload it
should stay good all right so we now
have full crud functionality with
firestore and since we used angular CLI
we could easily deploy this so I guess
we could do that in I didn't really plan
on it but I guess we could do that so
let's go ahead and stop the server and
we'll just clear this out and let's do
ng build - - prod it's gonna build
everything out into static assets let's
see property five oh you know what one
second
all right so what we're gonna do here is
see how we have Environment TS and we
have our firebase stuff in there we're
gonna put it in the environment dot prod
as well now in if this was a real
production app you'd probably want a
separate firebase for both one for
development one for production but let's
go ahead and stick that in there
and then let's go to app dot module TS
and let's change right here it's going
to be environments vironment dot prod
let's try that and then we'll try this
again so ng build dot dash dash prod
all right so now if we look in our
directory we now have a dist folder with
all the static assets now I have a
domain called code skillet which is
where I usually do my testing for
deployment so I'm going to open up
FileZilla and I'm gonna just connect to
this code skillet where the hell is it
ok we'll go to our public HTML which
there's nothing there and we're gonna
just bring everything from that distal
der into the public HTML and this is
just shared hosting by the way
all right so we'll bring all that over
and now let's refresh code skillet and
here's our application so it's now
deployed let's try to add something here
we'll say item 3 this is item 3 enter
there we go if we look at our fire store
back-end
item 3 ok and just to test the update
update that works let's test the delete
that works so we now have a deployed
angular application using fire bases
fire store platform so hopefully you
guys found this helpful
and maybe it gave you some ideas for
your own applications but yeah that's it
