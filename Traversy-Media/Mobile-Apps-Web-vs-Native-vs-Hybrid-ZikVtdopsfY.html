to do is take a look at the different
types of mobile applications that exist
and do a little bit of comparison from
the standpoint of a company looking to
build or hire someone to build a mobile
application and this is a huge choice it
could make or break a company's success
in the mobile app world so we're going
to compare web apps native and hybrid
apps and we'll talk about the
differences we'll also look at the
advantages and disadvantages of each so
let's go ahead and get started this
video is sponsored by Z car if you'd
like to complete more online tutorials
and spend less time struggling with the
difficult parts head over to zeker and
schedule a live one-on-one video call
with a web development expert of your
choice to get personal guidance and
feedback sign up at zeger comm or click
on the link in the description below so
there's basically three main types of
mobile apps there is a grey area which
I'll get into later but for the most
part we have web apps native apps and
hybrid apps so let's dig in and let's
take a look at what each of these
actually are and take a look at some
advantages and disadvantages of each all
right so first one we'll look at is web
apps
ok so web applications or mobile web
sites are built using standard web
technologies including HTML CSS and
JavaScript
they run inside of a standard web
browser like Chrome Firefox Safari
they're built and hosted just like any
web application or website on the
Internet
the only real difference is that they're
built to look good and to function well
on mobile devices this usually means
that they're responsive and they're
designed with a mobile-first approach
meaning they start with focusing on the
mobile view but also make it work for
desktops as well all right so let's take
a look at some of the advantages of
building a web app so first they're
built using just regular web standards
like HTML CSS JavaScript you don't need
to learn any difficult languages like
Java or Swift or anything like that any
web developer can build a simple web app
or mobile web site this also makes the
app very easy to host and maintain
simply upload to a whole
staying account with a domain if you're
building like a lie guys have standards
like a static HTML site you can host it
absolutely anywhere all right another
advantage is that you can use any type
of web technology and stack that you
want if you want to laravel app or
python nodejs
whatever you want you don't have you
don't have limitations in that aspect
okay web apps are also by far the
cheapest option like by far if you're
not a web developer yourself hiring a
web developer is much much cheaper than
hiring for instance a Swift programmer
all right so price also goes into this
this next advantage which is that you
can build one application for all
platforms so iOS Android the for people
that use blackberry and Windows Phones
your app is going to run on any device
with that head as long as it can run a
browser all right even an old-school
flip phone this year your web app will
run on as long as it has some kind of
browser it may not look right but it
will run it this is obviously much much
cheaper than both native and hybrid apps
not only that but your app is accessible
to two desktop PCs and laptops as well
as long as they have an internet
connection all right so let's talk about
some of the disadvantages and there is
quite a bit to building a web app so the
biggest is that it needs a browser to
run this means that the user has to
actually go into Safari on their iOS
device or Chrome or whatever browser
they use on their phone type in the URL
of the app and this is a really really
poor user experience web apps are also
usually much slower than native apps
the reason being native apps are created
for that specific device they're
optimized to run on that device as well
as possible all right web apps are less
interactive and less intuitive buttons
don't have the same type of interacting
effect as a native app does all right
like I said you need you need to run the
app in the browser so you don't have an
icon on your mobile desktop as you would
if you downloaded it from the app store
which also you know doesn't give a very
well
user experience web apps also cannot be
submitted to app stores so you would
need to turn you need to turn your web
app into some kind of hybrid app and
I'll go over that later all right if you
wanted to put it in a web store so most
web apps cannot interact with device
utilities there's no API for instance
for the camera for a geolocation or any
of those features for the most part all
right so let's talk about native apps so
a native application is the most common
type of mobile app when you search the
App Store and you download an
application it's most likely native
however hybrid apps are growing in
popularity and these can be added to the
App Store as well but a native app is
built for a specific platform and an
Android app is coded in Java and it uses
the SDK for that platform same thing
with iOS it's written in Swift or
sometimes objective-c and it's written
for the iOS platform all right with that
said native apps are very very fast and
that's because like I just said they're
built for that specific platform ok
Android iOS Windows Phones
they all have their own they own their
own language and SDKs native apps are
also very easily distributed into app
stores whether it's the Apple Store
Google Play or the Windows Store native
apps can be approved very easily native
apps are also much more interactive and
intuitive things run much smoother as
far as user input and output they can
also easily interact with almost any
feature of the phone whether it's the
camera location storage the compass
there's an extensive API to work with
just about any part of the hardware and
native applications can really get into
that and do some really awesome things
all right so for the disadvantages there
are actually some pretty hardcore cons
about building a native app so one
they're built for a single platform you
build an Android app in Java and it's
only going to work on Android your Swift
app however will only work on iPhone if
you want an app for both Android and
iPhone or even Windows or blackberry
you're going to you're going to go
bankrupt because you
you have to treat all these as separate
projects that are really expensive all
right now these are also much hotter
languages to learn you know Swift Java
much much harder than learning
JavaScript and HTML and CSS or even some
back-end web stacks Swift and Java are
just much more intricate hiring
developers for these languages are very
very expensive relative to your standard
web developer in addition to being
single platform harder to create way
more expensive they're also harder to
maintain all right so these are some
serious disadvantages when it comes to
building native mobile apps if you're a
startup some of these things make it
impossible for native to be or your
first choice all right so that brings us
to the final choice which is a hybrid
mobile app and a hybrid app is basically
a combination of a web app and a native
app it does use HTML and CSS JavaScript
but it also runs inside of some kind of
container or webview usually through a
framework so on the surface it can
actually be perceived as a native app
all right so there's actually quite a
few advantages to building a hybrid app
so they're built on web technology such
as HTML CSS JavaScript so this makes
them much easier to build of course
certain frameworks have you know you can
use angular with ionic and you can use
react native but under that you have
just basically JavaScript ok they're
also much much cheaper than a native app
if you're going to hire developers a web
developer is way more cheaper than a
Swift developer another huge advantage
is that you only need a single app for
all platforms if you use a technology
like Cordova PhoneGap which is like a
wrapper for hybrid apps they can
actually you can build this you can use
that one code base that same application
for iOS and Android and I believe even
Windows Phone and Blackberry so you
essentially have one code base to
maintain as opposed to multiple apps all
right of course since hybrid apps run in
a web view there's no browser needed
like with a web app ok they can be
published on all of the app stores
there's really not
anyways for a customer to even figure
out that it is a hybrid app and not a
native app all right they can be
installed the exact same way hybrid apps
also have access to device internal
api's and they can access features like
the camera geolocation storage things
like that a lot of this does depend on
the actual framework you use because
there are quite a few but most of them
do allow you to do stuff like that
hybrid app development is also much much
faster than native app development
because you do have that single code
base and you do have you know easier
languages to work with so instead of you
know having a an Android app and iOS app
a Windows app and maintaining all three
of those separately if one code base and
that that really really speeds things up
all right so what about disadvantages of
hybrid apps well they usually are slower
than native apps like I said native apps
are specifically built for certain
platforms in a certain language hybrid
apps do have sort of a middleman to go
through they may feel a little bit more
clunky err but that's getting better as
these mobile frameworks are progressing
all right now hybrid apps while much
cheaper than native apps they are more
expensive than just you know standard
web apps because you have that wrapper
framework to work with and maintain but
there's very very few situations where I
would choose a web app over a hybrid app
and less desktops who are really big
focus okay unless it wasn't truly a
mobile app now they can also be a bit
less interactive with button presses and
things like that but as I said you know
these things are getting better all the
time
hybrid frameworks are relatively new
technologies and they're getting better
every day
now there is an exception or even a
fourth type of mobile app and that is a
built with platforms that use web
technologies but convert the app into
native components rather than just
outputting into a webview okay that's
what frameworks like react native and
xamarin do I don't have much experience
with xamarin but from what I've heard
and seen it does kind of the same thing
unlike ionic and PhoneGap where these
are essentially just web apps wrapped
inside of a webview but in my opinion
react
native a react native app is very very
close to a real native app in terms of
performance so these these technologies
are getting better every day so what's
the conclusion I would say that unless
you have an unlimited source of funds
and highly highly skilled programmers in
Java and Swift
I do think hybrid or you know web-based
native is the way to go
so here's some of the frameworks that
can be used to create mobile apps with
only knowledge of you know technologies
like HTML CSS JavaScript JSX now react
native and xamarin are almost a league
of their own because they do in fact
create native apps and any web developer
that knows the act can actually use
react native you also have other hybrid
frameworks like ionic which is really
nice mobile angular UI which I haven't
looked into very much Cordova and
PhoneGap are basically wrappers that
allow you to turn literally any web app
into a hybrid app and then you have
other frameworks like Sanka touch in
framework 7 which I don't have much
experience with but overall my final
conclusion would be that native is going
to be it's going to perform the best but
the practicality the pricing of the
hybrid app overwrite overrules that big
time at least in my opinion ok you may
think different but that's just what I
think all right so if you guys want to
learn more about creating mobile apps
from web technologies I do have a pretty
big course with a G wanax where we have
five projects in PhoneGap jQuery Mobile
which is basically just a UI library
react native ionic and meteor okay so

hopefully you guys liked this video and
hopefully it's shed a little bit of
light on the differences between the
different types of mobile apps so that's
it thanks for watching and I will see
