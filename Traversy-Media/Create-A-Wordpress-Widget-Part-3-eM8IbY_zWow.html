building a wordpress widget in this part
we're going to create our back-end form
and also our default values okay so
basically if if our options table
doesn't have values for things like our
page URL our height width then we need
to need to set them somewhere and this
is where we're going to set them alright
you can see you can default an example
of this with the title okay so basically
we're saying if the instance is set of
four title so basically if it is in the
database then title is going to be set
to that if it's not then we're going to
set it to and then we had just have a
static text here
alright the double underscore
parenthesis is just for language strings
okay so let me put this on one line all
right so right here we can actually
enter a title and I'm just gonna say
like us on Facebook
okay
so basically I can just copy this and
I'm gonna say if set instincts page URL
then we'll set page URL to instance page
URL except I want to wrap this in that
ESC attr function
okay and if it's not okay so if it's not
in the database if it's not set then I'm
just going to I'm just going to do the
default URL that they give you here
okay
so just copy this again and next we'll
do the width
so for the default with
I'm gonna do 250
so with equals get instance of with
to height
well sorry about that
okay next we'll do color actually we
want to set the default height I'm going
to set it to 500 color
okay so for the color let's just check
out the values I'm going to use Chrome
tools just to see here
looks like
I think it's light and dark
looks like
let me generate actually only generate
the code
color yeah okay so data color scheme
equals light so the other one must be
dark all right well by default we'll set
the color to light
all right so let's see after color let's
do whoa
okay so we'll do our show faces
okay and the default for this let's set
this to true
all right and we get show header
okay that'll be true as well as show
hosts
and then finally show border
actually show posts I'm going to set the
Falls and let's see actually shouldn't
have quotes around these they're boolean
values they're not strings
all right so that takes care of our
default values so now we need to
actually display them using this form
alright so you can see that by default
this this code that we copy it has the
input for title okay so basically we
need to replicate this let me just make
this a little easier to read
all right so basically we have a class
from of wide fat we have an ID which is
where you setting it to this get filled
ID and then passing in the name of the
field which is title and then here the
names
we're doing get field name title and
then here the value we're actually
echoing out title and wrapping it in
this security function so basically we
want to do this for all of our fields
okay so we can copy this
okay so this will be page URL
okay
next we'll be color
oh no this is going to be a little
different because this is a select color
it's going to be a select between light
and dark
so this is going to be different we want
to change the input to its select and
then select need a closing tag for that
yeah let's see clasp will be wide fat ID
get the ID for color and this needs to
be color as well and did I miss
something up here Oh
age URL
this is just the label so color
okay so the select has the st. class ID
name and then
let's see type
I'm gonna just leave type at text for
now and then value we're not going to
have a value this is a select list so
we're going to have options I just
I think I should just get rid of that
okay so now in between the select tags
we want our options so option value is
going to be light all right value will
be lights
wait
dark
now one thing with this if we go ahead
and save our widget all right and then
we go back in we want whatever the color
scheme is to be selected all right so if
it's set to dark if that's what it is in
the database then we want it to we want
doc to be pre-selected
all right so in order to do that we just
have to do a quick if statement and
we'll do the shorthand all right
obviously if you know HTML then you know
if you put the word selected right here
light is going to be the one that's
selected so we just want to say if the
color is light then display selected all
right and then here we'll do if the
color is dark display selected okay so
right here we're going to say PHP echo
and then in parenthesis we'll say color
is equal to light
okay color is equal to light and then we
just want a question mark and then the
text and quotes selected
okay and then a colon and then if it's
not light then we just want a blank
nothing just two quotes and I think that
should do that that should do it for us
okay and now for dark we just want to
copy this put this right here and change
this to dark all right so that should
work okay so next we have the width
field so the width is going to be an
input so I'm going to copy this
and it can get quite tedious when you
have this many fields
and I realized I could just copy and
paste all this in but you've got to
write it so so here I'll write it with
you
okay with
next we'll do height
okay Heights
show faces is gonna be a select
all right now this we have the same
issue here we need to do these checks
and we want to put selected for whatever
is saved in the database the value here
is going to be true and false okay and
then we just want to check show faces if
it's equal to true
if it's equal to false and then we just
want to change this text
alright and I'll show header I'm just
going to copy this
so header
okay
and we got show posts
and finally we have show border you know
that was a lot of typing
all right so that should do it for our
fields here so let's actually save this
and see if it shows up in our backend
okay so we have the like box it's
activated if it doesn't say if it says
activate here just click it make it so
it says deactivate and then we're going
to go to appearance widgets and
don't see it
it should be showing up here
which is form
and I see the issue here is you probably
saw this a long time ago
right here I have widgets in it but it's
spelled very wrong so we're just going
to change this okay so that should be
widgets in it
widget all right save that and now we'll
go ahead and reload and now you can see
we have our like box okay so if we click
on that I'm gonna bring this over to the
main sidebar and there is all our fields
and it has they have all the default
values all right
so header show posts except you know
what these are not right the faces
should be true header should be true
post should be false and I think the
issue here is this
we have default values here these should
be wrapped in quotes
okay the true
false
true ok we'll save that
now if we reload alright so now face is
true alright so now it's correct so
everything looks good
the only thing you have to do now is
create the update function so that we
can change this and save and have it be
displayed so let's see if it actually
shows up on our front-end
okay so it's not showing up yet I'm
guessing it has something to do with the
update function so we're going to do
that in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
