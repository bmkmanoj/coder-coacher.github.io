today's sponsor male tag male tag is a
Chrome extension that allows you to
track your emails in real time for free
it also lets you track other cool things
like link clicks email reopens and even
the device that was used to open your
emails be sure to check out male tag by
clicking the link in the description
below hey what's going on guys so I have
a really cool project for you guys today
I did a grid CSS crash course a few
months ago and I've been asked over and
over to do some kind of layout or
website with the grid system because
honestly there's not a lot out there
there's some other crash course type
videos but nothing where they actually
create something especially something
that's responsive so we're gonna create
this single page layout website for a
fictional company called Acme web
solutions and it's completely responsive
you'll see if I make this smaller once
we get around 700 pixels that kicks in
and you can see everything is now
stacked and looks really nice alright so
we're gonna be using a for fractional
layout for our grid in fact if I open up
my chrome tools here and we hope we look
at the source code you'll see the header
has a class of grid and then inside the
main tag each section here
okay section a B and C which are these
sections also have a class of grid and
you can actually see the outline so
basically we're gonna have four
different sections or what are called
fractional x' if you watch my grid CSS
crash course and we're basically gonna
span for instance the one that I'm
hovering over now we're gonna span the
content from two to four so it's in the
middle all right so we're not using any
containers or anything like that and
we're taking a mobile-first approach
which means just that we're gonna just
we're gonna create the the layout for a
mobile site first so it'll be basically
just all stacked and then we'll apply
the grid system and we'll have these
these columns or fractional x'
now the one part of the layout we're
gonna use flex boxes with these three
cards right here these are actually
lists
items which I gave the class of card
like you would see a materialize or
bootstrap and we will be using display
flex for these okay to align those
correctly but all in all it's just it's
just a really modern layout and you
don't see too many tutorials with with
this kind of markup so I figured it was
a good idea plus I'm getting requests
for it so that's it guys let's go ahead
and get into it and let's get started
all right so we're gonna be starting
from absolute scratch I have vyas code
open with an empty folder called CSS
grid theme and over here is the final
project now as I said we're taking a
mobile-first approach so we're gonna be
building it like this first before we
implement that anything to do with the
grid the grid is gonna go inside of a
CSS media query for only on screen size
is larger than 700 pixels so we're not
gonna get to the grid until you know
closer to the end but like I said I
think I said I like to start from
scratch in in my videos just so people
aren't lost so they can just you know
start fresh so let's go ahead and create
two files here index dot HTML and style
dot CSS all right and the CSS is coming
last so we're gonna do all the markup
first it's usually how I like to work so
we're gonna put in some markup I'm using
Emmet so I can do exclamation tab and
that'll give me my head and body tags
and all that stuff alright for the title
let's change this to Acme I spelled that
wrong Acme Webb Acme web solutions and
we're gonna put our link tag in here and
link to our style dot CSS and I might
I'm gonna try to go kind of fast with
the markup now I am using I'm gonna save
this I am using dev suit live dev server
for a visual studio code if you if you
want that you can click on this icon
here and just search for live server and
you just click the green install button
that will install it and then what you
can do is right click and say open with
server and it'll actually open your HTML
file on your low
host on port 5500 and it also gives you
Auto loading capabilities so every time
I save it's gonna upload so I don't have
to keep our reload so I don't have to
keep clicking the reload button alright
which is good for videos so that's it
for the head now we're going to start on
the the markup so basically we're going
to start with the header or the showcase
which is this area here then we'll move
to section a section B is all of these
all of these images these cards right
here and then section C is our section C
is this right here section D is these
two boxes and then we have the footer so
those are those are the main parts of
this layout so let's start with the
header I'm gonna put a comment in here
and say header showcase so basically
we're gonna put in html5 header tag
we're gonna give it an ID of showcase
and then we're gonna give it a class of
grid okay so I'm using Emmet and that's
why I'm able to do this so header I'm
giving it an ID of showcase a class of
grid I hit tab and it gives us the
markup
alright so I would suggest using Emmet
if you're not using vs code you can
easily install it as an extension for
you know if you're using sublime text or
atom or something like that alright now
one thing that I want to mention is that
for the background it's faded it has an
opacity and in order to do that without
fading out the text we have to add it to
a different element not to the header
okay we're not going to add the
background image to the header so we're
gonna put another div in here with the
class of BG image alright we're not
going to put anything inside the div but
that's what we're going to use to attach
the image all the background properties
and all that and then we can add some
opacity to it all right and then let's
see under that we're going to have an h1
and we're just going to say welcome to
pack me web solutions and then we'll
have a paragraph and let's see we're
gonna do lorem 20 okay with Emmet we can
say lorem 20 hit tab and it gives us 20
sample text words or dummy text all
right and then under that we're gonna
have an a tag with the class of BTN okay
which is a class that will create our
style we'll create and then it's gonna
go to hash section - to dupe B section B
so when we hit read more it'll just
scroll down a little bit all right and
then let's put in read more here all
right so that's it for the showcase now
if I save this and we take a look it's
gonna look horrible because we have no
CSS yet all right now the rest of the
layout is gonna be within a main tag
okay so let's say I'm gonna put a
comment here we'll say main area so main
we'll give it an idea of main as well
and then let's put our section with the
idea of section a and a class of grid
all right now some people ask me why I
do section a section B and all that the
reason for that is because you never
know when you're gonna change things
around for instance I may want to take
this this here this digital needs and
then put that up here all right now if I
had named this something like web app
dev class and star ID and this something
like digital needs as an ID if I go
ahead and switch the content that that
ID is no longer gonna make sense so this
is this is how I like to do it in
sections so section ABC and so on
alright then that's why I do it and it's
all preference if you want to do
something else that's fine but that's
why I do that
so for section a we're gonna have a
class of content - wrap all right this
we're going to use this class later on
with the grid to span our content it's
basically going to be kind of used as a
container
put to push things to the middle let's
see and then inside there we're gonna
have an h2 with a class of content -
title alright and for the title we're
gonna say web web and application
development okay and then we'll have
under that a paragraph and we'll put in
let's say 20 alarm 20 tab and actually
no we need more text than that I think
it was 30 I did lorem 30 nope still not
enough alarm 40 tab okay so that looks
good and then that's it that's it for
section a so if we save it it should
look like this so next thing we have is
section B which includes all of these
cards or these these list items here
with the images so let's go right down
here actually I'm going to put a comment
right here saying that this is section a
alright and then we'll do section B okay
so for section B we're gonna do section
hash section B and it's gonna have a
class of grid and let's see inside here
we're gonna have our UL so ul will have
an Li and then inside the Li we're gonna
have a div with the class of card okay
so in this card div we'll have our image
so this is where our first inline image
will go now to get these images I'm
gonna go to pixels dot-com p exe LS not
pixels and I'm gonna search for let's
search for programming oops
programming and it's this one right here
so this image now if this was production
if you're gonna use this you know live
on the web you're gonna want to download
the image and then you know use it from
your your actual file structure but I
want to post this on code pen so I don't
want to have any actual images
downloaded so what I'm gonna do is click
on free download and I'm just gonna grab
the link all right so you guys can
choose what you want to do we're gonna
put this right in here all right let's
save that and let's take a look and it's
gonna be absolutely humongous all right
and like I said you know if this is
going to be production you're gonna want
to download it you're also going to want
to resize these because this is huge and
it's gonna it's going to take up a lot
of files a lot of resources all right
now under the image we're gonna put a
div just a div with the class of card -
content and inside card content we're
gonna have an h3 with a class of card
title so I kind of formatted this is
like materialized in bootstrap they're
all using cards now and we're gonna say
web development alright and then under
that we'll have a paragraph with 20
words will say lorem 20 tab save and
then underneath that you guys probably
can't even see that because I'm in the
way so let me just open up my dev tools
so that that moves up alright so we have
our text here now what we want to do is
we want a couple more of these list
items so what I'll do is grab this LI
copy it and paste it in two more times
let's format that envious code you can
do alt shift F and it'll format your can
your your markup or whatever let's see
we're gonna go to the second list item
and we want to change the image so I'm
going to go back to pixels close that up
and I'm gonna search for
I think I search for mobile yeah this
one right here click free download and
grab the link put that in here
and yeah and then we're gonna change
this to mobile what was it was it mobile
applications
yeah mobile applications and then for
the last image let's close that we'll go
back to pixels we'll search for what was
it marketing I think yeah we're gonna
grab this image here and you guys can
use whatever images you want so we'll
grab the link that and then we'll change
the title here to tech marketing all
right so now if we look at our project
we have all of these images with the
text underneath mobile applications and
tech muggin all right so that's section
B now we're going to move to section C
so you can see the mark-up is actually
pretty simple so section C we're gonna
have a section tag with an ID of section
- C and a class of grid all right and
let's see in here this is gonna be
pretty simple we're just gonna have a
content wrap inside the content wrap
we're gonna have an h2 with a Content
title and the title is gonna say we
handle all of your digital needs
okay and then for the paragraph will say
lorem 20 tab and that section C section
D is going to be the two boxes so it's
going to be the contact us in the about
our company so let's go under this
section and we'll say section ID section
D class grid all right so let's see
these are actually going to have a div
of box these two right here so we'll say
class box and inside the box will have
an h2 with a class of content title and
this one is going to be contact us we'll
have a paragraph with will say LARM 20
and then we'll put another paragraph
with the email address which will be
sales what I do no contact at Acme web
solutions dot test all right so that's
that's that box let's do another box
underneath that div and for this one
it's gonna have an h2 content title and
this is gonna say about our company
and we'll do a paragraph with 30 words
so lorem 30 and that is section d so now
we want to do is go outside of the main
and we're going to put our footer so
let's say footer I'm gonna give it an
idea of main
- footer and a class of grid all right
and then we're gonna have two divs so
I'll say div x - with Emmet and the
first one I'm just gonna say Acme web
solutions and the second one I'm gonna
say project by Travis E media and I'm
just going to wrap my link around that
HTTP whoops HTTP traversing Mediacom
check it out if you have a chance
shameless plug and we'll also add a
target to that a tag so that it goes off
the page so it opens a new tab and save
all right so let's take a look so let's
say we have this right here which is
section see these two contact us about
these a section D and then the footer
okay so it looks horrible
but that's because we have no CSS all
right so that should be it for our
mock-up that's it so let's move on to
style dot CSS and we're gonna start with
our core styles oops
all right so let's start with the body
so the body is gonna have zero margin
let's give it a font family of arial
helvetica sans-serif let's give it a
background color of dark grey let's give
it a color of white what else font size
I'm gonna say 1.1 m let's save that see
what it looks like okay that's fine so
far
line height let's do 1.5 and then I want
to align everything to the center okay
save that good so that is the body I can
get rid of this I'll just try to keep
you know keep what I'm focusing on up
above myself so in addition to that
we're gonna have some core styles for
the image okay so basically any image is
gonna have a display of block we also
want to make the width a hundred percent
of its container that's going to shrink
down these huge images right here once I
save we're also gonna set the height to
auto all right so let's save and now we
can actually see the damn images alright
so for the headings of h1 h2 put some
spaces in there so h2 h3 for the
headings I'm gonna zero out the margin
and then I'm gonna add a padding of 1m
on top and zero or one M on the top and
bottom zero on the left and right
alright and then we also have four
paragraphs
so paragraphs I'm actually going to zero
the margin and set padding to 1m on the
top and bottom and zero on the left and
right alright so we'll save that not
much difference there and that's pretty
much it for as far as the core styles I
guess we could do the button because
that's that's gonna be outside of any
other elements as well so let's do dot
BTN all right so we want to display the
actually let's add a background of 333
let's make the color white let's take
away the underline so
text-decoration:none let's set the
padding to let's do 1 M on the top and
bottom 2m on the left and right let's
add a border of 1 pixel solid and then
the color for that is gonna be what is
the color for the border its 666 and
save see what that looks like
alright so right now it's displayed
inline so the it's kind of running into
the next element if we were to look at
this see how it's like running into the
next element so we don't want to display
as a block and I'm just explaining this
for you you know you guys that are kind
of new to CSS if we display as a block
it will put everything on on the next
line but it also goes all the way across
the border the the background I don't
want that so we're gonna display it as
an inline block which basically takes
the best of both worlds and then yeah I
think that's good actually we're gonna
add a margin as well so just go save
margin for the top and bottom will do
point 5m and then 0
all right so I also want to add a hover
state for the button so BTN : hover
so for the hover it'll have a background
the background is gonna be a hexadecimal
of EA three times and then color of 333
so now if I hover over it we get this
lighter color alright so now we can
actually start working on the specific
areas so we're gonna start with the the
showcase or the header so let's go down
here I'll put a comment we'll say at our
showcase so let's go ahead and say ID
showcase now this isn't gonna have too
much because remember how I said we're
not putting the background image on the
actual showcase div we're putting it on
the BG image so that we can add some
opacity to it so let's set the min
height to 450 pixels let's set the color
make sure the color of the text is white
and then let's set text align to Center
even though we really don't have to do
that because we added that to the body
but that's fine so we'll save and now
you can see everything is moved down and
has a minimum height of 450 pixels so
now we want to deal with the background
image so we're gonna say showcase and
then we have a class of BG - image okay
remember that so you need to make sure
that this is positioned absolute okay
because it's gonna it's going to go over
the showcase div and we want to add the
background okay so we're gonna say
background first we'll put the color of
333 and then the URL alright so the URL
I'm gonna grab from pixels I'm gonna
search for programming
and it is this where is it
this will image right here so we'll go
ahead and click free download and we'll
grab that link all right we'll stick
that in there good and then we need to
add some background properties so let's
say background background position is
going to be Center okay background
repeat' is gonna be no-repeat background
sighs what took me sure to type it will
be cover so let's save that and we're
not gonna see anything yet because we
haven't added the size the dimensions so
we want a width of 100% of its container
and then for the height we want to make
sure that the height is the same as its
parent so the height should be the same
as the showcase which is 450 because
what we're doing is again we're placing
it on top of it okay so if we save and
you can see that now it's been placed on
top of it literally we can't even see
the text anymore so to fix that issue
with the text is by using Z index and
for those of you that are kind of new to
CSS Z index is where the higher it is
the closer to you it is all right so
right now the Z index for the image is
higher than the text which is you know
the heading and the button and all that
so what we want to do is set the Z index
to a negative number so we're gonna say
Z - index and set it to negative 1 and
save and now you can see everything is
now brought forward okay
and now the whole reason that I wanted
to do this is because I want to fade the
image out a little because I think that
this is kind of unreadable the image is
too it's too prominent and it doesn't
look right especially if you were to use
a different image that could make it
even worse so what we're gonna do is set
the opacity of the BG image class to
zero point
four and save and now you can see that
it's faded out okay so that's that's one
way to do this and if you want to even
more feed it out you could do like 0.2
if you wanted it more more prominent you
could do like 0.7 it's all up to you I
think four looks good alright so now we
want to move this stuff down a little I
want to fix this heading so I'm going to
say showcase h1
alright so showcase h1 let's add padding
to the top I'm just going to do a fixed
100 pixels and then padding-bottom I
want to remove okay so there we go
now when this is really short or short
really thin or small whatever you can
see that the the words are right up
against the edge and I don't like that
so what I'm gonna do if we look at the
header if we look at the header it has a
content wrap class now this is going to
be used later on for our grid to
basically the center everything and span
the content but I'm also going to use it
to add a little bit of padding so it's a
showcase showcase dot content - wrap and
we're gonna just set padding:0 top and
bottom 1.5 M on the sides and that
didn't work did it alright guys so I got
confused for a minute this isn't working
because I didn't add the content wrap on
the showcase which I should have because
we're gonna need it so we want to put
this right below where the BG images
right here we want div class content -
wrap
and we don't want to end it right there
we end it down here right before the
header all right then we'll just tab
that over all right save that now you
can see that padding has been applied
and we're gonna need that later on as
well all right so so that's it for the
header that's done now we're gonna move
to section a which is this part right
here so let's go down and our CSS and
say section a okay so that's an ID
section - a okay so this is going to
have a light background so we're going
to say background and it's going to be
the that ei color so hexadecimal value
ei three times color will be three three
three and then I just want to add
padding padding I just want to add
padding bottom of two and save and there
we go so now we have our light section a
I also want some padding on the sides
for that content wrap I could put that
down here but what I'll do is just copy
this put a comma here and let's change
this to section a go save a couple lines
of code all right so that's it for
section a now section B is with all
these images and these list items so
let's say whoops section
B
all right so section B we want some
padding here so padding is gonna be 2 m
1 m and 1 M that's it for the actual
just section B now we want the UL we
want to remove all the padding and
margin see how this is pushed over like
that we also want to get rid of these
stupid bullet points so let's say
section b UL and we'll say
list-style:none the default should be
without bullets who the hell uses bullet
points in you know you eyes so see we
also want to margin:0 padding:0 and save
and there we go so that looks a lot
better now we want to do a couple things
to the list items themselves so section
- b li and for this we're gonna we're
gonna add a margin bottom of 1 m let's
add the background to be white let's
make the color triple 3 save there we go
now this i have a class of card for this
whole thing right here and then this
part here is card content and i want to
add some padding to the card content so
we're gonna say the dot card content and
the reason I'm not doing Section B card
content is because you may decide later
on you want to use these cards somewhere
else and that won't apply if you add the
section B to the beginning so that's why
I'm doing it
so padding will be 1.5 m
there we go all right so that takes care
of Section B now we're gonna do section
C so I D section C okay and again
section C is this part right here it's
just this handle all of your digital
needs this is very simple we just want
it to have a white background and we
want it to have a dark text and we
wanted to have a padding of two M Save
there we go now section D is these two
boxes here all right so let's see we're
gonna say section D section D itself
doesn't have any styles but we want the
box alright so for the Box padding 2m
color white save okay now this first one
here the contact us I want this to have
a blue background so what I'm gonna do
instead of adding extra classes in the
HTML we're gonna use a pseudo class
called first child
so if we say section D dot box colon
first child it's gonna take the first
box and then we can add color or not
color but background and the color I
want to use is hexadecimal it's two six
nine zero d4 and save and now we have a
blue background all right so the last
thing we need to do before we get into
the media queries and the grid is the
footer
all right so we're gonna have ID of main
footer and we're gonna add some padding
of 2m we're gonna add a background of
black we're gonna add a color of white
and we're gonna that's it no let's do
text-align:center okay now for the link
sorry about that
so you guys can see this let me move
this up the link is purple I don't want
a purple link so we're gonna say main
footer a color I'm gonna make the color
that blue this right here okay I also
want to remove the underline so text
decoration is gonna be none and that's
it save there we go
so that's it that's our mobile version
of our site now if I were to let's close
these up if I were to make this bigger
that's not what we want we don't want
that for the size it's great for a
mobile that's why this is a mobile first
approach okay so now we need to deal
with the grid and making this you know
look good on on bigger screens so what
we're gonna need to do is add a media
query I'm saying media queries but we
really only gonna have one so to do a
media query we do the @ symbol and then
media and it's formatted like a function
okay and we pass in min width and we're
gonna do 700 pixels oops the hell is
that
700 pixels so basically what this means
is that any styles we put inside of here
are only going to be in effect if the
the width is above 700 pixels so to test
this out let's do body will just say
body display:none and save so if I take
this and I make this bigger once we get
to 700 pixels you'll see that the body
just disappears so we know that the
media query is in fact working so I'm
gonna keep it around here while we do
our development now yeah so we'll go
like that and we'll get rid of that that
was just a test now in here we want to
apply our grid class okay so let's go
ahead and add dot grid so we need to set
the display as grid for any elements
that have this class let's save now
we're not gonna see any difference yet
what we want to do is apply the grid
template column property so we want grid
template columns now I would if you
don't nothing about the grid I would
suggest watching the grid crash course
because I go over this a little better
but basically we can split our columns
up into whatever we want we could use
pixel
here so if we said 20 pixels 20 pixels
20 pixels it would give us three columns
of 20 pixels but we also have what are
called fractional z' they'll take the
the space as a whole and divide them
into fractions so if we say one F R 1 F
R 1 F R 1 F R that will give us for
fractional so it'll be basically a four
column grid so if I save that it's going
to look like this and what it's done is
it's taken everything that we applied
grid to and it put it it put everything
into one into the first column so if I
open up my element selector here and I
hover over the head or you can see that
there are four columns for for
fractional z'
okay so what we want to do is take the
content wrap see how we have a class of
content wrap in all of these we want to
basically take that content wrap and we
want to say we want to span it from two
to four so I I wish this would stay when
I go up here but basically this first
line is to okay and we want to expand it
to four which is this line that's going
to be right there we want the content to
be within that area okay so that's why I
said it's gonna kind of work as a
container so to do that what we'll do is
add our content wrap class and we also
we actually also want to do this for our
UL and Section B so we're going to put a
comma here and say section b UL which I
like to put this and put this on a
separate line like that and then we're
gonna say grid
- column and we want to say we want to
basically range it from two to four like
that so let's save and there we go all
right now this still doesn't look right
because well let's let's see so you can
see it's ranging from two to four
but I want that's the two middle this is
kind of hard to explain guys the two
middle columns I want those to be wider
than the ones on the side okay because
we don't want it this and you know we
want it wider we wanted to come out here
so to do that instead of doing just four
of these these one fr-s we're gonna
replace the middle two with a repeat
okay so basically repeat we'll just like
if we say repeat one fr twice save save
that'll do actually alone was that right
no that just went back to normal if we
say repeat to one fr and save it's the
same thing it's just like saying one fr
four times but what we're gonna do is
instead of just doing one fr right here
we're gonna put in a function called min
Max okay min max which we're gonna take
and it takes in a min and the max so
we're gonna say Auto
which is the default so basically if
it's smaller than Auto then we want this
to be the size 25m okay so this is gonna
change the sizing of the middle two so
let's try this let's save it and now you
can see if I hover over header actually
it let's make this a little bigger
because you'll be able to see it a
little better now you can see that the
middle two when the the browser is at a
certain size they're going to be 25 m
wide all right so both of these two
columns in the middle together equal 50
M all right and then you can see the
sides are much smaller and it's the
smaller that this gets the smaller the
side columns get see how small they are
now until you get to a certain point
where they're basically just not well
the mole basically the grid isn't
working anymore because we set the grid
to only be in effect when it's at 700
pixels or less
okay or less than 700 pixels so I hope
that made sense and you can see that
also worked here and down here if we
look at this area this doesn't look
right okay so basically what's going on
here is these are taking up one column
and we need these to span to and what I
mean is that the boxes and also the divs
in the footer all right if we if I make
this bigger and I look at see let's
hover over section D I believe this is
section D and you can see actually I
make it a little bigger so we can see
all the columns alright so they're
taking up one we need these to span two
ok so contact us should come out to here
so it should span two and then about
should be from here to here okay so
that's really easy to fix and same thing
with the footer so what we can do is go
into our CSS and go down to the media
query and we're just going to add our
box class and we're gonna add the main -
footer div okay make sure you put the
div in there and then we're just gonna
set what are we gonna set we're gonna
set the grid column
grid column - - and save I'm sorry
grid column span we wanted to span to
save and there we go so now that looks
correct
they're basically each spanning two
columns of the four okay same thing with
these alright so we are getting there
let's see what do we want to do next now
up at the top this right here if we look
at the original you can see that it's
split the paragraph is split into two
columns so we want to do that we want
that effect so let's go right here and
say actually it's an ID section a and
then we want content - text and
basically for our content text we want
to set it to two columns columns to save
that didn't work you know what yeah my
god I don't add it I forgot to put in
the content content text class so in
Section A this paragraph right here
should be wrapped in a div with the
class of content text I forgot all about
that sorry guys so that should be
wrapped like that all right and then
we'll save and now you can see it's
separate now we still have some issues
here one I want to increase the gap in
the middle we can do that with column
gap we'll set that to 2m save and then
it's also kind of out of whack right
here one is higher than the other so
what we need to do is take section a
content text and then the paragraph
and sorry about that we're gonna set the
margin is a margin top yeah we're gonna
own on margin top padding top sorry
so padding top to zero and there we go
alright so no matter how much text you
put there it's still going to work so
it's scalable all right so that's set
now basically all we really have left is
the the the you ELLs the cards here we
want these to span across three so what
we're going to do is we're gonna set
those is we're going to set the UL to a
flex item so I believe it's section be
ul and we're gonna set display flex and
save alright so just doing that you can
see made them all go all aligned
horizontally now we want to set the
width of the L eyes so we're gonna say
section - BL I I'm gonna set the width
of these to 31% and save okay and now we
just need to justify it so we're gonna
say justify content and we want to use
space around okay
so space around and if you haven't if
you don't know what this is I would
suggest watching my flex what is it flex
box in 20 minutes
space around basically is gonna take any
extra space you see how there's extra
space over here it's gonna put it around
the whole thing and in between each each
flex item alright so I'll save and you
can see that it dispersed that space
into where it needed to go
around and in between alright so
hopefully that makes sense and I think
we're done yeah so that's it guys let's
just take one more look if we maximize
this alright so it looks pretty good
pretty simple but you know I think it's
it's nice and clean and the mobile view
looks good
okay once we get down to 700 pixels
alright so hopefully you guys like this
and hopefully it sheds some light on
using grid CSS you know just using a
more modern approach and in creating
your layouts so if you liked it leave a
