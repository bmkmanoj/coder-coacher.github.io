install Ruby on Rails in Ubuntu and
we're going to use something called our
VM which stands for Ruby version manager
and basically it's used to manage Ruby
environments okay so gems and
interpreters are and things like that so
we want to open up a command line or
terminal
all right and the first thing we want to
do is make sure everything is up to date
so we're going to do a sudo apt-get date
okay once that's done we're going to
install curl which is a command line
tool to send and receive data through
different servers using a specified
protocol so to install curl we want to
do sudo apt-get install curl
okay one do yes
okay once that's done we're going to
install our VM using curls so you want
to do a forward slash curl and tack on
this El tag and then the the protocol
we're going to use is HTTPS and we want
the URL to be get dot RB m dot IO okay
and I'm going to do this pipe character
and then we want to say bash s and
stable
all right
once that's done you want to actually
close out of the terminal and open a new
one and you want to type in source
source and in the home directory we can
use this tilde character and you want
dot our VM slash scripts slashed our VM
all right
and next we can install the dependencies
which is really easy we're just going to
say our VM requirements
and you'll probably have to enter your
password
and this could take a few minutes
okay once that's done we can go ahead
and install Ruby by using our VM install
Ruby
and when you install with our VM like
this you can actually have more than one
version of Ruby installed on your
machine
okay so once that's done we want to
specify the virgin we want the default
version so the latest stable so we want
to say our VM use Ruby default okay and
we're using version 2.1 three okay so
you should have ruby gems installed but
you just want to run our vm rubygems and
current alright and then we can install
rails using ruby gems so gem install
rails
and this could take a few minutes to
so now you can see it's installing all
the documentation which takes a while
all right so that's it now it's just to
make sure everything is installed we can
say Ruby V which is two point one point
three and rails V which is four point
one point six okay so that's how you
install Ruby on Rails on a Linux Ubuntu
machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
