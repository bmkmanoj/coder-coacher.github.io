add some custom post formats to our
WordPress theme so this is a page in the
documentation and it gives us all the
different supported formats that we can
use okay so we have a side which is
basically just kind of like a status
update type post you probably just have
a title and maybe the date and a small
piece of content gallery which is a
gallery of images a link an image itself
a quote status video audio and chat now
I'm not going to get into all of these
because that would be just way too much
but I'm going to show you how we can use
an aside and also a gallery alright
maybe something else as we as we go
along alright so let's go and open up
index.php and i want to introduce a
function called get template part and
what we can do is what this does is it
helps us not repeat ourselves alright if
we look in index.php we have this while
loop and then we have you know the title
the content the author if we go to
single dot PHP same thing the title and
so on archive what else page dot PHP so
what we can do is we can use get
template part to create different
content templates alright so let me just
give you an example so we're going to
create a new file called content dot PHP
alright and then let's go back to index
and I want everything within the while
loop
okay so let's grab this down to this ok
everything within the while loop we're
going to cut it out
I'm going to go to content and just
paste that in okay save it go back to
index and then this is where we're going
to use the get template part function
so get template part and it's the file
is called content.php so in here we're
going to say content save let's go back
to our front-end reload and you can see
it's the exact same so that's good
that's what we want it really cut down
the code in our index file okay I made
it a lot easier to read so what we'll do
now is we're going to use this in some
of the other pages as well so let's go
to single dot PHP alright and we want to
go to the while loop once again and
we're going to replace everything again
let me just copy this in our single and
we're going to get everything in the
while loop and paste this in okay so
save it now if we go up to a single page
you'll notice it's back to being
formatted as if it was in the index page
so what we'll do is in the content page
we need to we need to put some
conditional statements in so we know
that if it's a single page we don't want
the link around the title so let's go
right above here and let's say PHP if is
single
and we wanted else all right so let's
copy this or cut it rather if it's
single we don't want the link so just
paste it in and then we'll remove the
link if it is if it's not single then we
do want the link so let's save that and
now the single page doesn't have the
link so we'll copy this if is single and
then let's go down and figure out what
else we need so if it's single we don't
want the excerpt we want the content so
let's paste that there okay and then
let's take the excerpt put that here but
if it's single then we want the content
okay now if we go back and reload now we
have all the content the last thing we
need on the single page is the comments
okay so let's just we'll take this if
single
and we'll say PHP comments template and
now we get our comments back okay so
it's back to to how we want and the blog
post page looks good looks how we want
so we cut down that that repeating of
ourselves okay and we just have a more
dynamic page and archive we can do the
same thing so we'll grab this go and
archive and just paste this in the while
loop and there's not really any
conditionals that we need to do here
because it's the same as the index page
okay so that's fine so now that we have
that out of the way let's move on to our
post formats so before we do anything we
need to actually enable them so we do
that in our functions dot PHP file and
we're going to go to our theme setup
function here and let's go to the bottom
and let's say add theme support we want
to add theme support for post formats
all right and then the second parameter
is going to be an array of the format's
that we want so we want a side and we
want gallery alright so we'll save that
and now if we go to our post and we say
add new now you should have this box
here with the different formats so let's
create in a side post all right we'll
put that in business
and we'll say side post one and then
we'll just get some content paste that
in publish so right now if we go back
and look our side post is formatted just
like our other ones there's no
difference okay so to change that what
we can do is in our in our theme folder
we'll create a new file and we'll save
it as content - aside dot PHP okay and
then remember where we use that get
template part we now want to add a
second parameter to that which is going
to be a function called get post format
alright and we want to put that I want
to put that in all of the get template
parts so we have one an archive and we
have one in single okay so in our side a
content a side PHP let's just write the
word test and then go and reload and now
you can see that that aside post now is
just spitting out test because it's
looking at this file so let's go ahead
and edit this say div class we'll still
give it the blog post class but I want
to give it a also a class of post side
all right and then let's give it div
class well in bootstrap the well class
gives it a gray background and some
padding all right now in here let's say
small within a small tag and let's do
PHP the author
and we'll put an @ sign and then let's
do the date okay and then under that
we're going to say PHP the content okay
so if we go back now and reload there's
our a side post okay which you can see
is formatted very differently than the
other ones all right so that's that now
let's do a gallery okay so we're going
to go to add new post and let's say
photo gallery and let's say add media
create gallery and I'm just going to
grab these images create new gallery
link - let's say the media file alright
so we'll insert gallery and publish all
right now in our theme folder let's
create a new file called content
- gallery dot PHP alright and let's say
div class blog post and let's do
actually well you know what we'll just
do the content
all right we want to make sure we put a
special class in here as well save it
now if we go back and reload whoops oh
we got to choose gallery and there we go
so now we have our photo gallery X let's
put the title and we'll do an h2 we will
say PHP the title okay and if we go to
our style sheet
we'll say post gallery and let's give it
a background so you'll give it a dark
background
we'll say adding 10 pixels and text a
line to the center let's see what that
looks like
all right let's make the h2 white all
right so just gives you an example of
how you can set different different
formatting and this will just go to the
file all right so that's post format so
we're pretty much there as far as the
blog goes in the next video I'm going to
show you how we can start to create a
custom home page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
