do is move an entire Joomla website to a
new server alright so we're gonna be
using a component called akeeba backup
which is a great backup and restoration
component which will transfer your
entire website file structure along with
your database all right so you don't
have to do these two things separately
basically you install a component on
your Joomla site which you want to move
and you just run a backup and it'll
it'll create this archive file and then
you go to your new host upload the
archive file and run it and then it will
basically just restore the site on the
new server so what we're going to be
doing is I have this this site movies
dot June digi comm which is basically
just a demo of my Joomla movies
component alright so I want to move this
to this which is my new server okay so
it's my new VPS and I've created a user
account or hosting a shared hosting
account just for this site alright you
can see that there's absolutely nothing
there right now so what I want to do is
login to my GD movies website okay it's
a joomla 3 site
and this is just a demo site huh which I
forget my password too
so we're gonna log into the demo site
all right now I have a Kiba already
installed okay so you can go to
components Akiba now to install it you
just want to go to the website which is
a kiva backup calm and click on download
and there's two things you want to back
up you want to get the core component
which is right here alright so looks
like the current the latest version
right now is 3.11 alright so I clicked
that and then there's a zip file pops up
actually we don't want
okay all right the way my my pc is set
up it just opens the zip but this will
give you a file to download which is a
zip file which is the hell is it right
here all right so you'll download this
component zip file and then I also want
you to download the kickstart file which
is right here Kiba kickstart
all right and that should just be a zip
zip package and there's all different
languages here I don't know about these
languages but for the for English you
just want to grab this kickstart PHP
file alright so I'll actually just pull
that onto my desktop
all right so basically to restore the
site we're going to need that the
archive file that we produce with Akiba
and this kickstart file alright so once
you do that once you install it on your
Joomla site by going to extensions
extension manager and then just upload
it and then go to components Akiba back
up and you'll see a screen like this now
if there are files or database tables on
your server that you don't want to
include in the archive you can go to
this files and directories exclusion and
it'll show you a list of all the folders
and files on your server ok or on that
domain name and you can just choose to
skip them or to exclude them or whatever
in this example we're going to get
everything so I'm not going to do that
and we just need to click on backup now
you can put in a little comment here if
you want it gives us the date of the
backup ok I'm gonna click backup now and
depending on how large your site is this
could take from 20 seconds to 10 minutes
or so
or maybe even more I'm not sure usually
takes me about about 2 minutes or so
so I'm gonna pause it and I'll come back
when it's finished
alright so the backup has completed all
right so you'll see the success message
and you just want to click on manage
backups now basically you can download
your backup archive file through the
browser like this or you can actually
log in to your site through FTP and
actually let me just show you where the
backup file would be all right so I'm
going to connect to my site
okay it's in the JD movies folder
alright so this is the root of the
Joomla site and where you want to go to
get the archive is in the administrator
folder components comm akeeba backup and
here it is
alright so by default we have it's a JPA
archive file so you can just take this
and drag it to wherever and you'll have
that archive file
alright now for the browser all you need
to do is click on this button here under
manage and download make sure it's the
correct backup and just click that it's
gonna warn you that sometimes files
things can happen and you won't get the
whole file through the browser but I
always do it this way and I've never had
an issue so I'm gonna click OK it's
gonna ask you to save it all right it's
gonna download that my particular
archive file is 92 megabytes so it's
kind of big relatively so looks like
we're gonna wait about two minutes so
I'm gonna pause this and come back
alright so that finished downloading so
I'm gonna open that location alright so
I have my site movies doomed is calm so
basically it'll have the name of your
site and then the date after it alright
so now what we want to do is go to our
new server which is right here all right
so I'm gonna FTP into this into my new
server
okay so to login I'll put in my username
the IP address
password
okay looks like something
all right there we go so I'm gonna go to
the public HTML folder and there's
nothing there okay so what we want to do
is grab the archive that we just created
and bring that in and also the kicks PHP
file I'm gonna upload both of those
all right so now we have the archive in
the kickstart file on our new site on a
new server now what we need to do is
create a new database on our new server
all right this this archive includes the
files and the database to all the
database data but you need to create the
actual database for it to go in all
right so to do that
if you're using cPanel I'm just going to
go to my cPanel
okay so pretty easy to create a database
we can actually use this database wizard
okay give it a name I'm just going to
say
password
okay so basically we created the
database and the user now we're gonna
link them together and that's it so now
that we have that uploaded we want to go
to our site we want to go to the
kickstart
script script pH kickstart PHP okay so
basically to get some info here if you
want to read right now it's gonna select
the archive file if you have more than
one on your server it's going to show
them and you want to choose the correct
one we only have one this other stuff
we're just going to leave and then we're
gonna click on start
all right so we want to run the
installer which is nicknamed Angie all
right so this screen just pretty much
gives us an installation check looks at
the server that it's going on and things
like that so we're going to click Next
and here is where you want to put your
new database information the database we
just created ok so the database name and
the user name is this so I'm going to
copy that
that the host is going to be localhost 9
times out of 10 username database name
password alright then we click Next
and it's basically just gonna restore
your database
okay successful you can see this it all
happens very fast next step and this is
just gonna verify your site name your
site email address things like that
configuration options you can change
them here if you want I wouldn't
recommend it though because it's usually
what you already had at your working
site so we're just gonna click Next
okay if you've ever installed Joomla
than you know you need to you need to
delete the installation directory you
can actually do it here by just clicking
this red button and then it just gives
you basically a link to your sites for
an end ok so now you can see up in the
URL bar when we're on the new server
alright everything looks good if we
click on a link you can see it goes to
that link
all right so that's how you can very
easily migrate your site your Joomla
site to a new server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
