from scratch in the last video we played
with the routes a little bit and we
created a pages controller with some
views okay so we can now go to our home
page loads the index view we can go to
about and we can also go to services
okay now if we look at the templates for
these that we created are the views they
all have repeating HTML okay the head
tags body tags and so on so what we want
to do is create a layout so in the views
folder we're going to say new folder and
then layouts and you can create multiple
layouts but we're just going to have one
and we're going to call it app dot blade
dot PHP okay and then what we'll do is
grab everything that's in the index and
paste it in that layout and then where
we want to put out the the the view the
content here the h1 in the paragraph
we're going to just replace that and
we're going to say we need the @ symbol
and then yield and then here we're going
to say content now I want to install an
extension for blade 4 vs code so to do
that we can do we can do a control P and
here we're just going to start to type
ext will say exp install and I think
it's laravel - blade and then over here
yep laravel blade snippets and we'll
click install let's reload and now you
can see we have our highlighting for
blade syntax good now we want to extend
this in all of our views so make sure
that that's file saved and then we'll go
down to our index page here and we're
going to actually get rid of everything
except the h1 and the paragraph
and then up at the top here we're going
to say at extends and here we're going
to save content okay I'm sorry not
content the name of the layout which is
going to be app or layouts app now the
reason I put layouts app is because it's
in the layouts folder and then the name
of the file is app blade PHP now if we
want this to go into the main content we
have to wrap it in section content and
then at the end of it we're just going
to do n section okay and then we're
going to do the same thing to the other
ones so we'll so actually just copy this
and we'll go to about paste that in then
we want to end the extension I mean end
a section okay save that same thing with
services
okay very simple so we'll save that make
sure index is saved as well and then
let's go back to our application where
you load services and you'll see that
everything is fine if we go to our index
page look at the source code it has all
of the HTML all right so it makes it
makes it so that we don't have to keep
repeating ourselves and jam all that
extra HTML in there so now let's talk
about passing values into a blade
template so if we go to our controller
and let's say in our index function here
we want to create a variable called
title and we're just going to set that
to welcome to laravel and then we want
to bring this value into our template or
our view so what we would do is add an
extra parameter here and we can say
there's two ways to do this or two main
ways so that one is to say compact and
then pass in title so now if we go ahead
and save that and we go back to let's go
to our index template and in this h1
we're going to put double curly braces
and just say money sign title alright
and we'll save that and reload and you
see welcome to laravel so if we were to
change this let's say let's just add an
exclamation to it here just to make sure
that it's actually coming from here and
you see we get an exclamation so that's
one way to pass in a single value
another way I'm just going to going to
copy this and then I'm going to comment
it out because I want you guys to have
this code another way that we can do it
is not by adding a second parameter like
that but by adding on to it like this so
we'll say arrow and then width and then
here we can pass in what we want to call
the variable inside of the view and then
also the rect are real the variable okay
which comes from here so if we save that
and we go back reload we get the same
thing okay so this is the method that I
usually use if you want to add if you
want to pass in multiple values
as an array you probably want to use
this as well
okay so let's also add a title to the
above we'll do the same thing so we'll
just say say above us and it'll pass
that in obviously you don't have to make
the title dynamic like this but it just
gives you an idea of how to do it and
you could also go like this you could
say PHP echo title which a lot of
template engines don't don't allow but
let's try that so if we go to a boat you
see that that works as well and I'll
just leave it like that just for an
example now if you want to pass in
multiple values what we can do let's
actually go to services and we're going
to create a variable called data and set
that to an array all right and this is
going to be an associative array meaning
that it's going to be key value pairs so
let's say we want to add a title we'll
say equals and then greater than and
then we'll say services all right and
then we can pass this in we can say with
and just pass in data so now if we go to
our services route our services view and
let's replace this with title and then
go to slash services you'll see that
that works now I want it what I want to
do is pass in an array of services so
we're going to add another value to this
array which is going to be another array
just a regular one and we'll say web
design programming + fco okay now since
we put this inside the data array which
we're passing it in and we should be
able to access this so let's save it and
go to our service glade PHP and first
thing we want to do is check for
services I'm going to get rid of this
and to do that we can say if and we can
even put functions in here so if we want
to say if count services is greater than
0 greater than 0 and then down here
we'll say end if so we're checking to
make sure that there's at least one
service in that array if there is then
we're going to loop through it so we can
do at for each and we can say services
whoops that should be inside the
parentheses so services as service ok
and then we just want to and for each
and in here let's put an li tag and
let's say service alright let's put you
ELLs outside of the for each alright so
we'll save that let's go back and reload
and now you see that we're looping
through the services array that was
passed in and we're outputting them
alright so now I want to talk about
assets and CSS so by default if we look
in our public folder there is a CSS
folder and there's an app dot CSS so
this is basically all of everything
compiled and this even includes
bootstrap okay because laravel includes
it by default so what we can do is we
can go to our layout and we'll go up
here and let's say link rel stylesheet
and when we want to load something from
the public asset folder we can use our
double curly brace and we can say asset
and here we'll say in a CSS folder slash
app dot CSS
all right let's save that and see what
we get and now you can see that it's
actually using that CSS file that has
bootstrap it has all that stuff compiled
now if you didn't want to use if you
didn't want to compile your own CSS and
all that you could easily just replace
this with your just custom CSS but I
want to show you guys how to do that so
if we look in resources there's an
assets folder there and if we look in
sass there's two files there's an app
dot CSS and what this is doing it's
bringing in a font the railway font it's
importing a file called variables and
it's importing bootstrap from from the
node modules folder bootstrap sass
alright if we look at the variables
folder or file it has a bunch of
different values with colors and all
that and we can easily change these now
in order to compile this and use this we
have to do an NPM install because if you
look at the right here where it's
including bootstrap it's coming from
node modules and we don't have that by
default we need to run NPM installed
actually create that and install the
dependencies now if we look down at
package Jason in the root you'll see
that it includes bootstrap staffs it
includes laravel mix which takes care of
compiling assets it also includes view
which is a front-end JavaScript
framework so we can use all this stuff
but we need to open up the terminal and
we're going to do an NPM install alright
and this takes quite a while it usually
takes about three or four minutes so I'm
going to pause the video and I'll be
back when it's done all right that
actually didn't take very long it
actually only took about 40 seconds or
so all right so let's clear this out
and now that created a node modules
folder which is the hell is it
I probably refresh yep there it is node
modules so if we want to change
something like let's go to resources if
you're compiling it like we are you you
always want to go in your resources and
change it they're not in your public ok
because that's just the compiled version
so if we go to variables
let's close the terminal for now and we
change let's see
body background so just just to test it
out let's comment that out and then
we'll say body
- BG and we'll just set it to red just
to test it out alright and then we save
that if we go back over and reload we're
not seeing that change ok the reason for
that is we need to recompile it so to do
that we'll go back into we're going to
go back into our terminal oops and we're
going to do NPM run dev and what that's
going to do is it's going to look at all
of our sass files everything all of our
assets and compile it ok now if we go
back and reload actually require to
clear the cache with a control f5 and
now you'll see that it's changed to red
ok now if you don't want to have to run
NPN run dev every time you change
something you can just do clear this so
you can do NPM run watch and that will
constantly watch the files ok notice how
it never completes because it's still
running and now if I want to go and
change this back I'll just get rid of
the body there and then uncomment that
save it you'll see that it recompile
automatically if we go back and reload
it goes back to gray now if you want to
add your own custom
style sheet what I would suggest is
let's just make this smaller for now
what I would suggest is creating inside
resources assets SAS create a new file
called underscore custom dot SAS not SAS
s CSS and then here let's see just to
test things out let's say body yeah
we'll just do body and then I'll say
background blue and looks at important
just so it overrides any other styles
and then we'll save that and then we
need to include this file in app dot s
CSS so we'll go right here and we'll say
custom actually know what we'll put it
after bootstrap custom CSS and we should
be able to just do import custom what
should be in quotes alright we don't
have to include the extension we don't
have to include the underscore because
the underscore tells it that this is an
include so let's save that and it should
automatically compile because we have
npm run watch running and now if I
reload we get blue okay but I'm not
going to keep that there I am going to
keep the file I'm just going to get rid
of that ok recompiles and now it's back
to gray so that's what you need to do if
you want to use SAS and you want to
compile everything now we're not going
to be using much custom styling we're
just going to use standard bootstrap so
I'm not going to keep this running let's
watch I'm going to control C out of it
alright and then if we do want to change
or add some styles we can change it in
the resources and then we can recompile
it okay I hope that makes sense I know
that some some people get confused with
the whole compiling thing but like I
said if you don't want to use any of
that go right into your public into app
CSS and go ahead and and change this put
what you want
obviously you can't use sass if you do
it that way and some other things but
you can do that too
it's simple so the last thing I want to
do in this video is create a nav bar
okay so we can switch between these
pages that we have so let's go to our
app blade and the content I actually
want to wrap that in a container which
is just a bootstrap class tainer all
right and if we look at it now it'll
push over okay goes into the middle
let's also add a list group class to
this this this ul so if we go to
services let's go class equals we'll say
list group and then the allies are going
to have a class of list group item okay
that will make that look a little better
good
now for the navbar we want it to go in
the layout because we want it on every
page but I'm actually going to put it
inside of an include and then just
include it so we can do that by creating
a folder in the views and we're going to
call it Inc IMC alright and then we're
going to create a new file and we're
going to call it navbar blade dot PHP
okay and for now let's just say navbar
and save it and then we'll go to our
layout and we're going to include that
let's see where I want to put that we're
going to put it above the container so
right here let's say at include and this
is blade syntax will just say include
and then it's in the ink folder and it's
called a navbar so if we save and go
back and reload you'll see that that's
being included now to get the navbar I'm
just going to go to get bootstrap calm
you guys probably know the deal will go
to getting started we'll go to examples
starter template and control you alright
I'm just going to grab this nav tag
right here the reason I do this instead
of going to the you know the regular
component section of the documentation
is because it doesn't include all the
junk the search the dropdowns all that
stuff I just want a very basic navbar
and that seems to be perfect so let's go
to navbar blade and paste that in we're
going to get rid of the navbar fix top
let's see for the project name here what
I'll do is from the layout file I'm
going to grab this right here which
gives us the app name that's in the
config so we'll copy that and then we'll
put it for the project name all right
and let's see you would also want to do
here for the brand route we'll just go
to slash and then let's create our links
so this is going to go to slash I'm
going to get rid of the class active for
now and then about is going to go to
slash about and then we have services
which will go to slash services alright
let's check that out
reload and there we go now we can switch
between our pages and then real quick
for the index page I'm just going to
paste in the jumbotron so if we go to
index bleed PHP I'm going to replace the
h1 in the paragraph and paste this in
all right so basically we just have a
div with the class of jumbotron and text
Center we have our h1 we have our
paragraph and then we just have a couple
links with the button class okay so it's
going to go to lot slash login and then
this one here is going to go to slash
register it's not going to work but I
just want to get the the mark up in
there all right so let's save that and
now if we reload it should look like
that
so our pages are pretty much done as far
as the the regular pages and the pages
controller in the next video we're going
to start to build on our blog so to do
that we're going to create a post
controller we're going to create a post
model we're going to work with the
database we're going to get into some
some more advanced stuff alright so
thanks for watching guys please
subscribe please leave a like and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
