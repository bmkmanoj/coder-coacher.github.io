going to do in this video is the blog
okay I'm going to do the blog and the
contact page alright so what I want to
do is add another s CSS file in the
layouts folder called blog and that's
what we'll put our blog stuff
okay so let's open up the blog HTML page
as well
okay we'll close up these for now
all right so if we go down to our posts
we have a div with the class of blog
post and then it div with the class of
post meta alright so let's start with
the blog post
okay so blog post I want to add a border
to the top the right in the left alright
so let's go ahead and include that
border so we're gonna have one pixel of
light gray
on let me just say I think it's left
right
about variables mix-ins
okay add water
position is right left all right
so right left and then I'm also want to
do one for the top
okay and then padding will be 15 pixels
okay this doesn't look like it's reading
blog post
blog post oh we didn't include we need
to include our our blog file in our main
s CSS file so down here
block all right
here we go so
the image the blog image let's see image
class
okay the class has a blog featured so
let's do that
we set the width to a hundred percent is
that not sure if that's what I want
No
I actually wanted to float
let's float to the left and then give it
a margin right of 15 pixels
all right so for the size if we look at
the HTML we gave it a class of image SM
for image small so what I want to do is
create some image size classes and I'm
going to do that in my normalize file
okay so we'll do i am g sm will have a
width of 200 pixels and you can create
some other ones okay I like to do x sm
for 100 pixels and image large will do
400 image extra-large will say oh 700
all right
so there we go
so now I want to do the post meta which
is this down here so I'm going to go
back to my blog scss and do post meta
and we give it a background of a light
gray color
patting do 10 on the top 10 5 and 10 and
then we want to add a border of one
pixel gray
and then a margin bottom of 20 pixels
all right so let's see what that looks
like all right so that looks good
I don't like how this heading is pushed
down
so what its
page header is what's controlling that
so let me just inside a blog post will
say h2 page header was it a padding or
margin margin top say margin top five
pixels and we should put an important
act
all right there we go so that looks
really good
but I do want to add some padding to the
bottom here and also we need to read
more link so in the HTML let's go ahead
and add a link so in the post meta
and I want this link to float to the
right so I'm going to add a class hold
right which is a bootstrap class
let's just add it to all the posts
all right and then just let's add a
little padding to the bottom in the post
meta so top right bottom
all right so that's good
so over here I want the tab to have a
class of tab light to give it that light
blue color alright so back in modules
components to copy this and we just want
to change this to light change all
instances of primary to light
all right
and there we go
we might as well do that for the other
colors as well
all right and then this one will be dark
okay so next we have this featured video
alright so we're going to let me see if
I gave it a class
it obviously has the primary head class
okay both of these do but I want to make
a class called bloc video that's going
to contain the video inside of the block
and let me just check and see if I added
it already
okay so tabs
right here
so we have block primary head with no
padding
and actually all he needs to do is is
grab the iframe and give it a width so
what do I want to do that I'm going to
do that in blocks
so inside of this block class let's do i
frame with 100%
all right that didn't work
actually I'll just change the size of
the video
yeah okay so right here this I frame
let's change it to 200
208
all right and in the height
we'll say 175
maybe a little higher 200 make it
basically make it even
all right so that's good recent comments
we want these images to be contained I
think this has a class of list comments
yeah ul list comments
so do this in the typography under this
lists
so this comments image I'm going to do a
width of 100 pixels for the list items
do padding
and we want to add border bottom
all right we don't want the last one to
have a border though so we'll use the
pseudo class last child okay let's check
it out
and looks like our ul is getting some
padding or margin so we need to just
zero that out
there we go
all right so that looks good
down here we have these icons that we
need to fix like we did with the other
pages so we just want to change it to FA
six and also add FA order
all right so that's it for the blog page
okay so last thing we need to do is the
contact page alright we already have
actually already did it yeah we already
did it but we need to change these icons
so contact
there you go
all right so that looks good
you just want to in blog and contact we
want to change the active link okay so
in contact we want to take class active
off of the homepage and put it on the
contact all right and then in a blog
page
put it on to the blog link okay blog
contact good
all right so looks pretty good so what I
want to do next is just it is responsive
bootstrap is responsive at its core but
there's just some minor changes that
we'll need to do to make it look good on
a mobile device so we'll do that in the
last video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
