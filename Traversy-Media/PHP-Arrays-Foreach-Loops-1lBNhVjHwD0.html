solutions and this video is going to be
on PHP arrays this is part of my
beginner PHP tutorial series you can get
it at my website at
www.osr.wa.gov.au/payrollenquiry
now we want to add a value to it so what
we would do is my array and we want to
have the brackets and then equals we'll
just say value 1 what we quotes
value1 and you can actually store this
doesn't have to be static text and this
could be a variable as well so now we
have one we have one value inside of our
array so we want to look at this in a
browser so what we want to do is use the
print our function
and semicolon so y'all gonna save and
reload and you'll see we have an array
and we have a key of zero and a value of
value one
so what's that another value so we just
want to say my array brackets equals
value to save that
now we'll reload and we have a new value
with a key of one and it's very
important to remember that arrays always
start with zero they do not start with
one and we don't need to have the keys
as numbers if we don't define a key then
it's automatically goes by the number
but we can define a key by going like
this my array key 1 equals value 3 oh
let's make this key 3
equals value three so we'll save that
and reload and you'll see we now have a
key of key three so this is just this
comes in handy quite a bit and so that's
that's it that's how you create a simple
array what we're gonna do now is I want
to show you how to loop through the
array and display each value and not
display it like this this is just for
debugging purposes so what we're going
to do is I'm going to take all this out
of here and I have an array right here
just like we just created the erase the
variable is person 1 and it just stores
first name last name and so on so what
we want to do is we want to print this
out to the browser neatly so we're gonna
make a for each loop and for each loop
is only you can only use it with arrays
you can't use it with single variables
so we want to say for each and then our
array name person 1 and we want to say
it as key equals sign greater than sign
value and then we want to have the curly
braces so each time it iterates you know
we can use key the key variable is the
key and the value variable is the value
so let's say that go key and I want to
concatenate text on this I want a colon
after the key so what we're gonna do is
concatenate with a period and then
single quotes double quotes wall so lark
and we want to put a colon and a space
now we want to go back to PHP so another
period and we want value and we want a
line break so we're going to concatenate
again and we're just going to put in
some VI tags and semicolon
so now and safe so now this should print
us out a list with the key and a colon
and then the value so let's reload and
you'll see we have first name last name
email in that they all have their
corresponding values that we defined and
this is extremely useful and one of the
things you're gonna need to know most
about PHP development I'm gonna have
some more tutorials more advanced array
functions so check that out too
