has been released along with the angular
CLI 1.7 I believe version 6 is in
release candidate 5 at this time and I
wouldn't recommend using it in anything
that's not just experimental or for
testing it out I wouldn't use it in
production until it's completely stable
and the CLI uses it by default but with
that said I just want to go over some of
what you can expect from version 6
along with version 1.7 of the CLI and
just a quick note
everything here is compiled from what I
view as reputable sources including the
official documentation and logs as well
as credible articles things like that if
anyone has anything to add or even
dispute feel free to leave a comment
below and also note that there may be
changes in the future this video is
simply about what you should expect from
the next release there's a lot of info
floating around but not really any good
put together summary of everything so
that's what I'm trying to do here with
this video now the way that angular does
its versioning it kind of pisses a lot
of people off there's basically a new
version every six months but most of the
changes are under the hood meaning that
the syntax the way that you write code
the way you put your components together
your services that there's no change on
that for the most part it's it's it's
just the updates are to make it work
better and faster and I think the whole
angular 1 to angular 2 it kind of scared
a lot of people especially people that
put a lot of time into angular Bonner or
angularjs whatever you want to call it
because you know one and two are
completely different frameworks but two
through now six are basically they're
all the same framework they just have
you know incremental updates and bug
fixes and new features and things like
that so don't let the way that they do
their versioning discourage you and make
you think that the whole framework is
changing each version in fact you'll see
that almost all of the changes here are
there just under the hood improvements
library updates additions and
and optional stuff nothing that's going
to cripple your angular 5 application at
least from anything that I've read ok
and I've done a lot of research on this
alright so if you want to try out
angular 6 now you can install it with
the CLI as long as you install the CLI
with the at next ok if you do that and
then you run ng new whatever your app
name it's going to create a new angular
6 application ok if you want to test it
out and experiment with it if you want
to upgrade a current app an angular 5
app you can now use the ng update
command which is really cool and you can
add dash next and it'll just it'll just
upgrade it to the next version so since
the update from angular 2 to 4 there's
been an overall theme that the angular
team strives for for every new release
and that's to make the framework smaller
faster and easier to use the main focus
of most of the changes is to achieve one
or all of these things with angular 5
there were a lot of changes under the
hood like a build optimizer that
eliminated unnecessary code things like
that and they're continuing to make
these types of changes and upgrades to
improve the frameworks performance
people do have to understand that
angular is not react ok react is a
library it's much much smaller it
includes much less angular is a complete
framework that includes just a ton of
different stuff in its core so of course
it's always gonna be bigger than react
it's always gonna be bigger than view
unless they really I don't know unless
they really find some amazing way to
optimize it but for the most part it's
good it's just gonna be bigger because
it includes more but they are doing
their best to minimize it in RC 2 they
started only publishing what the CLI
needs and includes only what your
project needs in terms of build and
schematics inside your project's package
Jason this leads to a much smaller
global package for the CLI which I
believe is around 23 megabytes or so and
it keeps improving so they're they're
keeping with this you know stripping out
what you don't need the bundles will
also be smaller in size which of course
we'll make your your app overall run
faster and just a better overall
experience
now as for the library's angular 6 will
be using webpack 4 for module bundling
web pad floor has its own batch of new
features we'll be generating smaller
modules through something called scope
hosting this also goes into making
things faster it will also include or
introduce a new way to connect excuse me
to connect the modules within an app and
a service okay so for instance they're
adding the ability for services to refer
to modules so that if a service isn't
being used it disappears in order to
make that bundle size smaller okay so
it's very dynamic in what what gets
loaded and what doesn't and you know 6
will also include rxjs 6 or reactive
extension 6 and this is gonna also
reduce bundle size for common use cases
this should also make it easier to
compose a synchronous or callback based
code
there'll be support for typescript
version 2.7 which I believe was released
back in January so it'll be much easier
to code with conditional type
declarations default declarations and
strict class initialization and if you
want to look more into the individual
features of these libraries you can
check out the docs for each one all
right and then what's really cool is
we're also gonna get library support
through the CLI ok so we'll be able to
use ng generate library and then the
library name which has been something
that's been requested for quite a while
now so the CLI commands as I just said
will have the new generate library
command we'll also be able to easily
upgrade angular as I showed you in the
second slide I believe by using ng
update and this includes all the core
packages in your dependencies in your
dev dependencies and things like rxjs
zone j/s typescript etc you'll also get
the ng add command to easily add
application features so if you wanted to
for instance start out with material
design rather than a blank application
you could use
and jihad for that it also supports
turning apps into progressive web apps
to support offline web pages it also
includes native script if you wanted to
add that to an existing project the
ability to create progressive web apps
is something that is really high on the
list of features with the angular team
as well alright so we also have the
addition of basil and the closure
compiler okay basically basil is a build
system that Google uses for a ton of
their own software including their
hundreds of angular apps it automates
the building and testing of software and
it's similar to maven if you've ever
heard of that
I believe basil is licensed under the
Apache License but Google uses it to
build the majority of their software if
you want to learn more about basil you
can go to basil dot build I've never
personally used it but it looks very
interesting before if developers wanted
to build and package their own libraries
by hand they had all they had to do it
by hand and if they wanted to share
components and services with other teams
they would have to do that by hand but
basil allows us to be integrated within
the angular ecosystem and it's pretty
advanced stuff I would imagine it would
be for more large-scale Enterprise front
ends but it shows you how much is
invested into this framework and what's
possible version 6 will also utilize the
closure compiler which is a bundling
optimizer used to create JavaScript
artifacts for nearly all Google Web Apps
okay so this is stuff that Google
actually uses in their company so
they're they're integrating a lot of
that stuff a lot of their internal
workflow and their tool chain into this
framework and that shows you how much
they have invested into it closure
supposedly does a better job in doing
things like eliminating dead code than
webpack webpack actually does all right
and here's a link here if I remember
I'll include it in the description and
this goes this is a medium article that
talks about what Google planned to do
with basil and closure and it's about a
year old but it basically talks about
the plans they had for implementing
these with angular and now we're seeing
the result of that
so it's a pretty interesting article all
right so the Ivy renderer this this is a
code name for a new renderer that will
be used and it will reduce the size of
the application and it'll make it
compile faster it will also increase
flexibility and the angular team has
also promised that the switch will be a
smooth one with no braking changes so
we'll have to see about that
but again this this edition ties into
their whole smaller faster easier theme
and you're gonna see that throughout the
next batch of versions of angular
alright so this is pretty cool we all we
have the component dev kit or the cdk
which includes over 30 UI based
components these are implemented in
angular material which is a separate
library but now you don't have to use
that extra library as it will be
included in the core package okay so it
includes things like responsive layouts
so if you don't know flexbox or the grid
system or anything like that you don't
want to use bootstrap this will still
give you a responsive layout which is
really cool the cdk itself was released
initially back in I think December of
last year but it's it's being approved
on and now you can use it with angular
core alright so next is one of what I
think is that one of the coolest
features added and that's angular
elements what you can do is you can
actually create an angular component and
you can package it up as a custom
element and then you can publish it as a
reusable web component so you can take
that web component and you can use it in
a non angular project whether it's a you
know just an HTML CSS JavaScript website
or application or something built with
another framework like react and I think
that's really cool that you can now use
angular to create something for a non
angular project so angular 6 will also
have schematic support and basically
allow you to create a schematic or
essentially a template and kind of
integrated with the CLI so you can
quickly create environments that are
convenient and familiar and you can
apply transforms like creating a new
component updating code to avoid
breaking
adding config options and so on
so essentially you can build your own
scaffolding which promotes reusability
and just saving you time rather than
starting from scratch with every new
application all right so let's take a
look at some of the actual code workflow
changes and there aren't much as I've
said most of these things are there just
under the hood there's some changes but
mostly additions to the code workflow
there's been some additions to the
router for instance so before if you
wanted to if you went to a URL that
didn't match any requests it would just
take you to the the index page or home
page whatever you want to call it but
now we can specify optional navigation
URLs inside a list in the the ng SW
config file okay and we can set URL
patterns like an asterisk or an
exclamation to go to any of these URLs
so maybe a 404 page or whatever it may
be
also currently in navigation start
there's no way to know if the navigation
was triggered imperative ly or through
the location change and with the new
navigation source the source can be
specified and with the restored state we
can get the navigation ID which leads to
its current navigation so in turn we can
handle multiple use cases and routing so
we can make our routing more efficient
basically was when it comes down to we
also have the ng model change event
which is emitted after a value and its
validity validity are updated on its
control now previously it was emitted
before it was updated as the updated
value of the control is available this
makes the the handler a bit more
powerful there's also been some
improvements with form pattern valve
validators so before version 6 pattern
validators shouldn't contain line
boundaries like and/or these would make
the validators fail but now validators
are checked before adding line
boundaries so validators will work as
expected with or without line boundaries
so we have a bit more of a cleaner
syntax when it comes
- validation we also have added
validators for a ramoth the array method
of the form builder before version 6
there was no way to pass multiple
validators to the form builder dot array
method and we can do that now with
version 6 ok we also have an option for
our new option for genera a generic type
of element ref which will allow us to
get a hold of the native element and
permit direct access to the Dom alright
so not much here at least in my opinion
but just a couple couple changes or a
couple new things that you can do in
your code workflow alright guys so
that's it keep in mind I haven't
personally used any of this yet like I
said this is compiled from different
reputable sources I just wanted to kind
of create a video that's you know wraps
everything up into an easy to digest
summary video and I will be doing some
more tutorials on angular using version
6 in the future and possibly a mean
stack course or series but that's it
guys
I also just want to mention that this
will be my last video from this office
I'm moving and I have to get everything
moved over and set up in the new place
so it might be a couple more days in
between videos just for a net just for
now until everything's set up but once
they've all set up will be hitting the
tutorials hard again so that's it thanks
guys and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
