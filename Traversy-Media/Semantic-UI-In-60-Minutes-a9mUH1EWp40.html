we're going to be taking a look at
semantic UI which is a front-end
framework that's similar to bootstrap
but a little more advanced it's powered
by the less CSS pre compiler and jQuery
it has a sleek flat design and it allows
us to create great-looking lightweight
and responsive websites and applications
so in this video we're going to cover
the basics and even look at some of the
build tools themes and some of the more
advanced stuff
alright so let's go ahead and get
started this video is sponsored by dev
Mountain if you're interested in
learning web development iOS or UX
design dev Mountain is a 12-week design
and development boot camp intended to
get you a full-time job in the industry
to learn more visit dev mountain comm or
click the link in the description below
alright guys so this is the semantic UI
website and in my opinion that has it
has a really good in-depth documentation
so we're going to be using this as we
move along in this course much like
bootstrap or get bootstrap comm it has
all the different elements over here on
the side and you can click on one for
instance the form and it'll give you
some examples you can click the little
angle brackets here and it will give you
that code for that exact example all
right now a lot of people compare
semantic UI to bootstrap and rightfully
so because they are quite similar but I
do think that semantics gives you more
to work with but at the same time I
think it's much more difficult ok it
doesn't have to be difficult you can
just you know include the CDN and your
HTML and go ahead and add the classes
and all that but they do give you much
more when it comes to build tools when
it comes to compiling there's 20-plus
themes that you can choose from and you
can you can choose different elements
from different themes so you can have a
button from one theme and then say a
list in another and then you can compile
all that and basically build kind of
your your custom your own custom version
of semantic so what we're going to do in
this video is first just include the CDN
and we're going to look at most of the
elements such as buttons lists icons and
so on
and we're going to create a cheat sheet
or sandbox with the mock-up okay this is
similar to what I did in my bootstrap
and foundation crash course on my
channel so if you guys watch that then
you need to know what I'm talking about
after we do that I'm going to show you
how we can install Symantec using NPM
and then use the build tools with a gulp
okay which is a JavaScript JavaScript
based task runner so I'll show you how
we can work with different themes how we
can override styles create variables and
so on so basically we'll just build out
our own custom version of the framework
and then compile it so that we can just
include it right in our HTML so let's go
ahead and create a folder to work and
I'm just going to create it on my
desktop here and I'm just going to call
this say Symantec underscore sandbox and
in here we're going to create our HTML
file okay so this will be index dot HTML
and then what I'll do is open that in my
code editor I'm using Adam but you guys
can use whatever you'd like so today we
want to do add project folder and go to
desktop and semantic sandbox all right
so here's our index.html file now I'm
going to be using just write hello and
save that I'm going to be using the the
dev server with Adam well actually you
need to install it if you guys are using
Adam and you want to install it just go
to settings go to install and search for
 what is it it's like live reload I
think let's try that
is it dev library no I'm using this
right here Adam live server by jazz Chen
so if you want to install that you can
do that and then you'll be able to go up
to packages and then go to see that's
not it or is it Oh at the top Adam live
server ok we can say start server and
then I'm just going to grab it it opened
up on a different window or monitor and
here it is so now our next HTML is being
run on our local host on port 3000 so
I'm going to be using that you don't
have to you can just simply click on the
index.html file and run it you know off
your filesystem or you can use some
other type of server so let's go ahead
and get started here in the index.html
I'm just going to put in some standard
HTML tags and for the title will say
semantic UI sandbox and save and this
should auto reload I believe or maybe
not like it's not oh well that's fine so
in here what we're going to do is we're
going to include the CDN ok so it's just
an external link for the CS for the
semantic UI CSS file and like I said
after we create the sandbox and all that
I'm going to show you how we can
actually install it locally and use some
of the dev tools so let's search for
semantic UI CDN and it should be this
one right here the first one and you can
include the separate components CSS and
JavaScript files you see if we just
wanted the accordion or the breadcrumbs
and so on we want the entire thing so it
should be C
semantics let me just do a search here
so semantic dot right here Samantha got
mints ESS so I'm going to copy that and
then we're just going to put in a link
here and change that and we'll just
paste that in okay so that's the CDN
link for the CSS and then for the
JavaScript
let's go down here and let's see I just
want us we don't need this we need the
source and then we're going to grab the
this semantic min GIS file and put that
right in there all right so let's save
that and in the body let's just um let's
just say hello oh it did auto update
good and you can see that semantic is
being used because it took away that the
margin and the padding on the body and
the fonts changed as well so we're all
set to be to be to use those semantic
classes so let me just go back to that
site alright and we're going to start
off with the container okay so if you've
used bootstrap you know what the
container is it basically it picks a
width and puts everything in the middle
and uses that width which is responsive
by default so what I'll do is wrap this
hello and it's a div class now when we
create our classes or you know when we
create our classes we're going to have
to use this UI okay that specifies that
this is part of semantic UI and then we
just want to put in our container okay
and we'll save that and if we go back to
our website you can see now it's been
pushed over so it's in the middle it's
in the container
and there are different settings that
you can mess with and you can change the
breakpoints and all that but I'm not
going to get into that just yet okay
actually we probably won't get into that
specifically for the container but you
can see down here it's showing you how
to overwrite things this is what you can
do if you choose to install locally and
then compile it to sort off from source
okay but we don't we're not doing that
we're just simply including the default
CDN so we can't do any of that anyways
so after the in the container let's do
some headings
okay so put an h1 and let's just say
heading 1 and then I just want to put
the out of 5 in this will be heading 2 3
4 5 and 6 and I will be doing some
copying and pasting I should have did it
for this because I will use copy and
paste for like tedious crap like this
all right and if you look that's what
the headings will look like in in
semantic so let's go down here and go to
header and let's see what's available to
us so we can change the sizes if we look
at the mark-up here even though we're
using h1 h2 and so on you can also use a
div you don't have to use these head
tags and you can include UI header so
when he would say class put our UI and
then header and that alone I don't think
does anything let's check it out no it
doesn't but if we wanted this h1 to be
small we could simply put in the small
class and save and I can see that it's
now small there's a few different sizes
we can use so what I'll do is just copy
this class
and let's do small then we'll do tiny
what's the other ones we can do small
tiny medium large and huge so this one
will do large and then for the h5 which
is normally small we'll say huge okay if
we look now you can see that those
classes are overriding the default size
of the headings all right so let's move
on from the headings and actually I'm
going to comment this so you guys can
have this as a reference just like we
did with the bootstrap 1 and foundation
so that's header and then I'm going to
separate each part with an HR and then
now we're going to look at buttons okay
now as far as buttons I in my opinion I
think that there's a lot more available
than there is with bootstrap or
foundation as far as buttons as far as
colors and size and all that icons so
let's create a very basic button so
let's see we don't need the type or the
name let's just see what it gives us by
default it just say read more and it's
just a standard button with no style at
all what we need to do is give it a
class and we want to of course use the
UI and then we want button now one of
the selling points of semantic UI is
that they don't use abbreviations okay
in bootstrap you see BTN they don't do
that they'll use the actual element okay
because I guess it's more semantic so
what's up save that and see what we get
so you can see the button is much nicer
looking as added some padding gave it a
light gray background and so on I'm
going to do is just make this small so
that we can see both now when it comes
to buttons semantic UI has a ton of of
different options or different classes I
think more than bootstrap or foundation
it does use context classes so we do
have primary and
Andheri we also have positive and
negative so let me give you some
examples let's go ahead and just copy
this okay and the second one here we're
going to add a class of primary and then
we're going to do secondary positive and
negative okay so now you can see that we
have the primary which is the blue the
secondary which is black positive is
green negative is red now we could of
course change these if we overrode the
classes but that's kind of a quick and
dirty way to do it if we were to
actually use the build tools and build
out our source code we could actually
change the variables and change the
colors of these okay so I'll show you
how to do that later on now in addition
to the context classes here we have just
the color classes so what I'm going to
do is put a couple line breaks right
here and then let's say button tab and
get rid of this stuff say class UI
button and we can add a color so let's
say red save that and we get red now
this is pretty similar it's not
identical to the negative class but we
can still use the color the red over a
negative if we want we can use both now
I'm going to just paste these in because
there's a ton of them and I don't want
to just waste time typing them all out
so you can see we have red blue green
purple yellow brown orange olive teal
violet and gray so lots of colors to
choose from and we'll save that and you
can see what it looks like over here
okay so a lot to pick from now in
addition to colors we have other classes
we can add such as disabled okay so the
red button will stay disabled and you
can see now it's grayed out and I can't
click on it okay we also have loading
which will put the little loading
spinner inside the button just like that
and then we have size classes so let's
start down here and we'll make this one
mini which is the smallest then we have
tiny small medium large big huge and
massive so a lot of sizes to choose from
as well so it goes from this side here
up to this side alright and if we were
compiling our own source code we could
change the sizes of these we could
change the variables and so on alright
so those are the colors now in addition
to these buttons we have the basic class
which kind of reverses it it'll make the
color the border and then white inside
so let's put a line break here our two
line breaks and let's say button say
class button or UI button and let's say
basic all right so if we save that you
can see that it's much lighter I like
this this version of it looks nice and
clean and you can also add the color
classes as well so if we were to copy
that and I'm just going to do a couple
couple colors so say red green blue teal
and brown alright so all the colors will
work for this as well now in bootstrap
we have a class called BTN block which
will make the button a block level
element so that it goes across the whole
screen or its whole container so in
semantic UI we have a class called what
is it fluid so let's take this first
basic button and just add the class of
fluid and what might show up that wrong
we'll save that and now you can see it
goes across the entire screen or the
entire element
it's contained in so that's the basics
of buttons there's a lot of other stuff
we can do but I'm not going to put it
all in here because some of it is really
long as far as the markup goes but we
can take a look at let's see button ok
so here's just a standard button UI
emphasis so here is showing us the
primary and then we have we have
animated buttons so if we hover over
these those I like these I'm not going
to put them in here because it's good
code is kind of long and I just want
this to be the basic stuff for more
advanced stuff you guys can just look at
the documentation we also have labeled
so a button can appear alongside a label
icons let's go ahead and put an icon
button and so I want to stay within the
container so we'll go right above this
div and say icons and let's see if we
look at the code here might as well save
some time and we'll just grab that okay
so that gives us a little icon button
let's put actually let's put an HR here
separating it now I'm not going to put
all of these in but we can take a look
so we also have labeled where we can
kind of have the you know like or
dislike and then we can put some text in
here but if you guys want you can copy
this and put it in the sandbox HTML file
but I just want just a simple stuff
labelled icon that's pretty neat let's
not a lot of clothes grab that
okay and here's the in the basic buttons
that I showed you you can also invert if
you're on a black or a dark background
you can just put a class of inverted
there's also button groups let's grab
that okay so a group of buttons is just
going to put them all together and it's
going to take the corners off the middle
one so if we take a look at this and see
we have one two three and only the left
and right sides have the edges here all
right and then for just icons I guess
it's not on this page let's check out
the icons okay and there's a lot to
choose from and it gives you the class
if we look at the code here you can see
all the different classes let's just
let's just grab a bunch of these let's
put that right here
just put them on their own lines
all right so a couple icons look at
those all right cool so now let's take a
look at labels okay so go here and we'll
say or is it label okay so these are
very similar to bootstrap labels you can
put an icon as well as some text or even
an image like they did here but it's
pretty simple just as a class of UI
label and then you put the icon right in
there so we'll just paste that in okay
so there's our label let's actually put
an HR here I want to kind of separate
the different components and see what
else we can do with labels so I'm not
going to do the image all right here we
can use them for
for instance form fields we can just
point to an element so to do that I
guess we can just type it out over here
to do that we'll have a div and let's
give it a class of inline and then
filled and let's put in an input and
then under the input we'll put
div and that's going to have a class of
UI left pointing label that should be
separate and then we'll just say that
user name is taken okay let's see what
that gives us and there we go so it's
just pointing to that the input all
right so semantic also gives us a
breadcrumb
so to do that I'm actually just going to
grab it and paste it in so we have a div
with the class obviously you have UI and
then the class breadcrumb and then
inside here we have an a tag with the
class of section and then the divider
now the divider can be any character you
want in this case at the forward slash
but you could use for instance a an
angle bracket or whatever you like and
then we have another a tag with a class
section another divider and then the
active section so let's save that and it
looks like this okay so it's a bread
crumb pretty easy now let's take a look
at lists all right so let's put in here
a very simple list so we have a div with
the class of UI and then list ok now
this doesn't have to be a UL and Li tags
you can use the div and then you want to
give each item the class of items so
let's look at that you see it's just a
very simple clean looking list now if
you want to have a menu list I'm just
going to grab it and paste it in I want
to be able to get to most of the stuff
that I plan so I don't want to waste
time typing so this has the class of UI
and then list and then it has the linked
class and then we have an active item
and then the rest just have the class of
item ok so that would be like a side
menu or something like that we can also
format them to be horizontal so let's
grab that so we have the UI in the list
we also have selled and horizontal ok
and the the items still just have the
eye of the class of item and then you
see it's horizontal okay so this could
be some kind of menu maybe in the footer
or something like that and then if we
look at the documentation for a list
there's actually a lot more okay so
there's the default you can also use
icons okay so you can just add the icon
tag and then you want to wrap the text
in the class of content
you can do with this format which is
pretty nice you can do out like a file
tree structure and that's a lot of code
though
bullet points ordered lists links we
just did that content icons you can use
images in your list quite a bit of code
there or markup I should say description
various you can see there's a lot of
stuff here you can have an inverted list
selection so there's a lot of stuff here
I think much more than bootstrap
so that's list now let's take a look at
forms so let's go and let's add the HR
and what I'm going to do is just paste
this form in and then we'll go over it
okay so we have the form tag with the
class of UI and then form and each field
here is going to be wrapped and a div
with the class of field okay notice that
they use very descriptive classes here
hence semantic UI and then we have a
label with an input okay very simple
another field here first name last name
and then a check box okay so that has
its in a div with the class of UI check
box and then we have a simple button
down here so let's save that and let's
take a look and that's what the form
looks like now we can also have inline
fields if we want them on the same line
so let me just grab that real quick and
we'll paste this in so we have a div
with the class of UI in form and then we
have a div with the class of inline
fields and that's where we put all of
the labels and the fields alright or
which is just one label here for phone
number and then we have the three fields
for each section of the phone number so
let's see what that looks like you see
right here we have the label and then we
have the three fields so nice and clean
looking now we can also have alerts or
what's what semantics calls messages
okay in bootstrap they're alerts so
let's go ahead and put in an HR here
or let's say messages okay so let's add
a div here and this is going to have a
class of UI and then message and then
here we'll have a div with the class of
header because your messages can have a
header and then in here let's just say
we'll just say some message okay and
then under the header we're going to
have just a paragraph and we'll say this
is a message okay save that and then
here we go some message this is a
message and it has a gray background by
default now just like with bootstrap we
can add context classes to these
messages so what I'll do is just copy
this whole thing and for this one let's
add in success and then for this one
let's add error
save that and you see we have a green
one and a red one I believe you can add
any color class as well let me just try
that so let's say instead of error let's
say purple and yeah that works too so
you can basically have any color message
you want just by adding the color class
all right so next thing we're going to
look at is tables and pagination so
let's put a comment here
tables and pagination and this is going
to be quite a bit of markup so I'm going
to just copy this and then let's just
paste that in okay let's look at it
first so we have a nice-looking table
here with nice headers and we also
included some pagination down here so if
we look at the mark-up we just have a
table with the class of UI celled and
table if we take out selled and save
that what did that do okay so this
border right here if we don't if we
don't use selled
that goes away
okay and then we just have our tea head
so it's a table header with the headings
and then in the body we have our table
rows with just how they just have some
text in them and then down here in the
footer of the table we put another row
with this th tag it's going to call span
three so it's going to span across all
three columns and then we put our
pagination okay so we used UI pagination
we also use the class of menu floated
and right you can see how it's floated
on to the right and then for the
previous and next buttons we use the
Chevron icon okay this one is aligned to
the left this one's to the right and
then we have our items in here okay now
if we want one of these fields to stick
out for instance the one that says first
we can add a ribbon class to it a ribbon
label so let's go right here to where it
says first and we're just going to wrap
this in a div okay and we're going to
give this class UI let's just do UI
label I want to see what that looks like
and then we'll end the divs save that
okay so that just wraps a bore it gives
us give it a background and some padding
we can also add the ribbon class which
is kind of cool
and you see it comes back from the start
the side of the table and comes over
which looks pretty cool now we can also
add classes to the rows so for instance
this TR let's add a class of positive
and that'll give it this this what is
that it's like a greenish or yellowish
and then let's say for this one we want
to do class and we should be able to use
any color class so we'll say purple save
that I guess that doesn't work let's try
primary
well that didn't work either I guess we
can't do that what about ever ok so
error worked we can only do no it's kind
of strange but anyways we can use error
or positive or I'm assuming negative as
well and let's say I think that's it for
tables let's look at the documentation
and see if there's any other things we
can do for tables or is it the hell is
it huh okay so there's the ribbon and
then this one also they're just using a
line classes here you can align to the
center single line and then what's this
okay that's pretty cool
get repository so you can kind of do
that looks like a repository of folders
definition list so you can see there's a
lot of stuff that you can do here
variations yeah so you guys might want
to check this out because I'm not going
to go and type all this in or you can
copy and paste it in I just want you to
have this this cheat sheet with the very
basics all right so we're going to move
on from tables and go to segments so
let's look up segment and a segment is
used to create a grouping of related
content so the simplest version would be
this UI and in segments and it just kind
of gives it a border and add some
padding to it so let's go down here and
let's add in our HR tag and I'll say
segments ok and let's do something
really simple we'll just say div and
let's give it a class of UI and segment
and then for the content let's put a
paragraph and then I'm going to type in
alarm and then tab just did nothing well
there we go so what that does in Adam is
it'll just create some sample content
and I think sublime text you can do the
same thing make this a little shorter
though alright so let's see what that
looks like okay so you can see our text
has light border around it now we can
also add a class called raised so what
I'll do is copy this and then go in here
and we'll say raised and now if we go
down you can see it's raised up off the
page a little bit has a little bit of a
shadow we can also do stacked
okay and take a look at that and you can
see right underneath I don't know if you
guys can see that but there's a couple
lines so it looks like they're stacked
on top of each other we also have piled
okay so that basically looks like
they're they're on top of each other but
they're not aligned so gives it a nice
little look and let's see what else we
can do here we can add we can basically
put different segments together so if we
were to put a div here and let's give us
a class of UI segments okay notice it's
segments with an S and then we could
take this and put that inside here put a
couple of them in and save that and now
you can see it kind of looks like a list
group in bootstrap and we can also add
other classes for instance red
let's do red to green and we'll save
that and it is the things aren't colored
themselves but it's the bottom or is it
the top it's the it's the top now if we
want to color in the whole thing I'm not
exactly sure how or if we can do that so
see we get that there must be a way to
do it
you know that's the bottom oh here we go
look at the code for that so it looks
like they have to be inverted so let's
go ahead and say diverted there we go so
now you can color them in if you have
the inverted class all right so let's
look at some of the other stuff in the
documentation I want to look at steps
which is right here step so this is
really cool this is like if you have a
shopping cart and you know the your
website viewer is going through the the
shipping and all that the billing
process you can add these little groups
of steps which i think is really cool
and there's a lot of different
variations as well so I do want to
include one of these in the cheat sheets
so let's just grab this here it's not
too much markup basically we just have a
class of UI steps and then each step has
a class of step we can put the icon and
then put whatever content we want inside
a div with the class of content so not
too difficult so let's put an HR tab
that over alright save that and there it
is steps and whatever one whatever page
you're on you just want to have the
active class okay and that'll make sure
that it sticks out so now I want to look
at content blocks or cards so let's put
an HR alright so this is going to be a
div it's going to have a class of UI and
then card and inside here let's put the
content div and for the content let's
actually put another div that's going to
be the header and here we'll just say
content
block and then under the header we're
going to have a meta class and for that
let's just say I don't know I'll just
say meta info okay and then under meta
we're going to have another content div
and we'll just put a paragraph in here
mostly this is my content and so what
that looks like we'll save it okay so
you can see it gives us this little
content block now we can also add on to
the bottom another section if you want
to put for instance a button so we can
go under the content class here and
create another one so this will be
content but we're also going to give it
a class of extra and then in here we'll
just put a button and that'll just say
read more all right so now oh that's not
right all I got to put UI button no it
doesn't look right content extra
actually you know what it is this the
first content class isn't supposed to go
around everything so it ends right here
so what I'll do is just cut that and
it's supposed to end I would see where
it's supposed to end right after the
meta so right here okay let's save that
and there we go so now we have the
little line here with the button down
here and if we go to the documentation
and go to see card so you can also use
it with images so that looks pretty cool
and you have the little footer down here
the extra so you can do all these
different variations this is what we
just did so there's a lot of stuff here
a lot to choose from as far as design
and layout another thing I want to look
at is item which is let's see right here
under views so this is for like I don't
know blog something like that where you
have the different articles so I just
want to include this in our mark in our
cheat sheet so this is an item
all right and for the image part here
obviously that's not going to work
because we don't have any local images
so what I'll do is just copy copy the
image address and paste that in here all
right then we'll save it and there it is
as far as the markup it's pretty simple
just a lot of it but we have a class of
items each item will have a class of
item now we put the image in the content
which has the header the meta tag and
then a description and then at the
bottom if you want you can use the extra
class and just repeat all right so
that's good for like a blog post or
something like that another thing we
have is a statistic
so deceiver is a statistic and we can
have this kind of look here for a number
of downloads or views or something like
that
so what I'll do is just grab this first
one and let's just put a comment okay so
basically what so we have a class of UI
and then statistic and then we have the
value which is going to obviously the
font is going to be much bigger and then
the label where the font is smaller so
that's a statistic all right so I think
that that's good for the individual
elements now what I want to do is look
at the grid system so if you've used
bootstrap foundation or any of the other
front-end frameworks most of them have a
grid system so what we'll do here is
let's put an HR here and then say grid
system okay and let's start this out
we're going to put in a div and this is
going to have a class of UI of course
and then grid all right so that's that's
going to start
with the grid system and then we're
going to have columns K each div with a
class of column now by default in
semantic UI it's a 16 column grid unlike
with bootstrap and foundation and most
of the others which is a 1212 columns
but you can use 16 in the other
frameworks but by default it's 12 so
what we're going to do here is let's see
in the in the column div I'm just going
to put in a button and we're going to
give it a class of UI button and let's
add the huge class and I'm not going to
put any text for the button because all
I want is the background so if we save
that and we take a look you'll see it's
right here okay so this is one column of
16 columns that go all the way across so
what we'll do is copy this 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
okay what we'll save that and now you
can see it goes 16 across now they're
right up against each other because of
the size of the browser window if we go
a little bigger you'll see they'll
separate a little bit and will be some
padding between them now we do have the
classes that allow us to break these up
and make them bigger say we want 4 4
column divs or whatever but we can also
just surround a certain certain amount
of these columns with a div with the
class of row so let's say the first 4 we
want to put those in the same row so we
could go right here and create a div and
give it a class of row and then we'll
take the first 4 so 1 2 3 4 and tab
those over and then put the ending div
tag for that row right here so now if we
go back you can see that now the four
that are in that row are in the same row
and the rest go on the next
all right and we can put other rows in
here as well now like we we do with
bootstrap we can also give these columns
a width so what I want to do is start a
new grid so let me see where this one
ends okay so that ends there
so under this div we're going to say div
give it a class of UI and grid and then
I'll do is take four of these one two
three four and paste those in and then
we're going to add an extra class on
this column called for remember semantic
UI uses the actual labels the actual
word instead of some strange
abbreviation okay so what that did is it
gave us four divs right here but they
don't span across the page by default
like you may have thought to do that we
need to add the wide class sorry about
that banging - my son upstairs so if we
save that now it goes across the whole
thing okay and actually you know what
why is the button not going oh I didn't
give the button the fluid class that's
why so the buttons aren't going across
the whole thing so let's do that so
fluid
all right so we'll save that now you can
see the buttons go across the entire div
so what else let's see let's make let's
do something that's not even so we'll do
like four and then an eighth column and
then another four column so I'll just
copy this right here its grid and let's
do four and then eight and then four and
I'll get rid of this last one here so
that should be sixteen and we reload and
you'll see we have the four column the
eight column and the four column now we
can also float columns so let's say UI
grid and then here we'll put column four
and let's make this a row and then
inside here we'll have two columns that
will float okay so let's say div and
give us a class of let's do left okay we
want to align this one to the left it's
going to be floated and it's a column
and then in here we'll just put a button
okay then I'll just copy this and then
the same thing except we're going to
float it to the right all right so let's
see what that gives us and you can see
we have these both columns ones to the
left ones to the right all right so I
think that as far as the cheat sheet
here that's what we're going to stop we
did quite a bit there is more especially
if you want to start to look at the
modules which have to do with JavaScript
I was going to include some of these but
it's just going to take up too much time
so we have an accordion see pretty
simple if we look at the code basically
we just want to wrap it in accordion and
we have each div we can make one of the
divs active and you need to add a little
bit of JavaScript with this so if we go
to you usage you just want to include
this little bit of jQuery here call the
accordion function on whatever element
you want to
use it with and let's see what else we
have a dimmer so we can basically put
like an overlay over a piece of content
we have drop-down modal's pop-up
progress bars this is pretty cool you
can actually interact with the progress
bars and then we have ratings here we
have stat little star ratings you can
use so there's a lot to semantics
there's too much for me to go over in an
hour that's for sure I think that we
have the basics down now I want to move
to something that's a little more
advanced and we're going to show you how
to install it using NPM how to run the
build tool with gulp and how to change
up some of the themes and stuff so let's
go to get started and we're going to go
down to see if you're using Mac you
obviously you need to have no js'
installed no matter what you're using
let's see so actually that doesn't
matter to us so basically what we want
to do is make sure no was installed
which it is for me if you don't have no
js' just go to node.js org and download
and install it and then you need to
install gulp okay and you can do that
with NPM now gulp is a task runner it's
used for anything from minifying code to
compiling sass or less and this just
does a lot of uses for gulp so we need
to install that and the little dash G
here that means that we're installing it
globally so that we can run gulp from
anywhere so you want to open your
terminal or command line I'm using
commander for Windows you can use the
standard Windows command prompt or get
bash or your Linux or Mac terminal
doesn't matter so we're going to CD in
to where the project is which is in
desktop and then Symantec - sandbox so
from here we're going to do an NPM
install - G gulp so that will install
the gulp task runner globally so that
you can run the gulp
command from anywhere now we want to go
back over here and you can watch a
little video on how to do this but I'm
just going to click code and we need to
install semantic UI using NPM so let's
go ahead and do that and say NPM install
Symantec - UI and we'll do - - save so
what that should do is create a node
modules folder with the package inside
and then it'll it should also create a
folder called semantics alright and I
believe it's going to ask us some
questions - okay so setup semantic UI we
want the automatic so let's choose that
enter and then let's see is this your
project folder yes the project folder
where should we put semantic UI in the
project I'm going to just choose the
default which is a folder called
semantic so now let's go back into atom
and now we have our semantic folder okay
so in here you'll see the gulp file and
you don't really need to understand
what's going on here but there's going
to be a task called build which will
build out our source code and then watch
is going to do just that it's going to
run it and it's going to watch for
changes while we while we develop
alright so what we'll do is what we have
to do is CD into semantic and then run
gulp build so let's go back to the
command line and we'll CD into semantic
and let's do gulp build and if we look
over here you'll see that it created a
folder called dist okay that's going to
be the compiled code and we have our
semantic j/s file right here and it
should also create yeah the CSS file
right there ok so that's what comes out
of the gulf build
now if we want to work with our local
installation what we need to do is go
back to the index.html and we're going
to replace the CDN link actually know
what I'll do is just comment it out all
right and then we want to point to our
local version which is going to be lets
say link and then this is going to go to
the semantic folder and then to where
the disk slash and then semantic min dot
j s or you could use the unknown
Ephesian whoops that's that's the j s we
need semantic min dot CSS and then the j
s we're going to put down at the bottom
so let's comment this one out okay and
then we'll just say script source same
thing it's going to be in semantic slash
dist slash semantic dot min dot j s okay
so let's save it and now our template
are whatever you want to call this cheat
sheet should look the same it does good
so now we're using the local version
that we build now I'm going to run gulp
watch because I want to make some
changes and I want them to to get
compiled so back in here we're going to
do Gulf watch and you can see it says
waiting for waiting source files for
changes or watching source files for
changes so if we make any kind of change
it's going to watch it it's going to
update it and it's going to recompile
into the dist folder which we're
including in our file here so if we go
into semantics and then the source the
SRC you'll see there's a theme config
the
and this basically allows you to set the
different themes for the entire site if
you want or just certain elements now if
you look over here in the themes folder
there's about 20 teams to choose from
now I was having some issues with
getting the default for the site for the
entire site to work I'm not sure if it
was just my machine or if it's a bug or
what but what I'm going to do here is
just add a theme for the button so let's
say we want the chubby theme and we'll
save that okay that's getting watched
and the buttons should update once
that's done there we go okay so you can
see how the buttons changed so you can
play around with that if you want what I
want to do now is I want to change some
of the variables so for the forum when
we check this box it's just a white
background with a black check if we go
to the documentation here and go down to
or up to theming there's an example for
the checkbox right here so we can change
component default so if we go to site
modules checkbox variables so site
modules and then check box variables so
there's an overrides and a variables for
every element overrides is if you want
to override the actual class variables
is if you want to change the variables
so what we're going to do is grab this
and paste it right in here and we'll
save it and we have gulp watch running
so that's going to recompile it and what
this will do is change the background to
a blue and change the check to white so
if we go back here and check the box you
can see we have blue with a white okay
so we can change any element we want
here we can change the classes and the
variables so if we want to go say these
are modules but let's go to elements and
then go to button dot variables and
let's set background color
let's set that to pink and then we'll
set text color to white see if we save
that you know actually we need the @
symbol here as well so let's save okay
so that should recompile and I see the
default buttons are now pink so that's
going to be it guys so this video went a
little longer than I wanted it to and I
know there's a lot of stuff here that I
didn't cover because I'm still new to
this but I just wanted to give you kind
of an example of what you could do if
you are compiling from source rather
than just including this the CDN alright
so it's up to you what you want to do if
you want to keep it simple or if you
want to you know really dive in I
suggest looking at all the documentation
if you're going to do that alright so
thanks for watching guys if you like
this please leave a like subscribe if
you're not subscribed and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
