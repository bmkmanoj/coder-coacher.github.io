creating the update function or adding
to it so that we can actually change
values and save them and then have have
the changes reflect on the front-end so
we need to go to actually you know what
I want to do first is this form function
I don't like it having all of this so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a custom function and then just
take all this and put that in it
so basically I want all of this cut so
that you have nothing in your form
function and then we're just going to
say this get form and we just want to
pass in instance
okay and then down here we'll create a
new function get form and this should
take an instance and then just paste
that in
okay
you just copy this I like to try to keep
it clean with comments so this will get
in display back-end form and the
parameter is going to be an instance
all right so update where is it right
here
basically we just need to copy this
and then do that for all of our fields
so we have page URL
you have height
and with
you just closed this out
okay with
color
and let's see we got show faces
so header
show votes
oops I missed one right here
so posts okay we need one more and
that's for show border
okay so that's it for the update
function so let's save this and now
let's reload the backend and let's go
ahead and change let's see we'll change
the color too dark let's see if that
sticks
did it save
all right so it did color doc so let's
go ahead and go to the front-end and
reload and there it is
okay so you can see it has the dark
header so now we just need to check test
out the parameters let's see we'll go
let's change it back to light and let's
not show the faces false show Petter
show post no set to true Save
all right so you can see now it's light
the faces are gone and it's showing the
posts all right so this works out real
good
thought we'd have more debugging show
header false
all right so that gets rid of that
header up here
all right
we'll change the width say 400
cool
all right so that's how you make a
wordpress widget or plugin and this is
the first video I've made on this but
I'm going to make some more and I'm
going to create a video to make a much
bigger plugin that basically we can use
for maybe an image gallery or something
like that so please subscribe and stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
