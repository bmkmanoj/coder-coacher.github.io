about state and react and we're gonna
move on from the jumbotron component
that we've been working on so you can
see that I have I've changed up the HTML
let me just go through a real quick we
just have a div with the ID of app
alright and then we also have a
component called app which is right now
just gonna render the text of my app
alright and then down here we're calling
render we're putting our tag in here our
component tag and then saying that we
want this rendered wherever there's an
element with the ID of app alright so
what we want to do is we want to add
some data to our state so to do that
we'll go above the render and we're
gonna use another lifecycle method
called get initial State okay so that's
a function okay so well what we want to
do here is just return an object alright
and for right now I'm gonna have a state
called text alright and I'm just gonna
set it to hello world all right now in
my render if I want to grab that I can
get it by saying this dot state dot text
all right and actually let's put an h1
around that okay and if we save that now
you can see that we're outputting the
state inside of the h1 tags now let's
say I want to change this maybe with a
button click alright so what I'll do is
create a button and let's give it a
click Handler on click equals this dot
actually will call it
change text okay and I'm just gonna give
it a class name remember we can't use
class because we're in JSX right now all
right so let's say BTN BTN primary oops
all right so when this is clicked it's
gonna call change text so we need to
create that okay and then what we'll do
is we need to call this dot set state
and then we'll pass in our object with
text and we'll set that to let's just
set it to welcome we'll say welcome to
my app all right so if we go ahead and
save that and reload we have our button
if I click it it's going to change the
state of text - welcome to my app all
right and you can set the state with any
number of events just a button click is
just one of them all right so what I
want to show you now is I want to create
a form and I'm gonna bind the state - to
an input in that form all right so let's
go ahead and create a form all right and
we're gonna have an input which will be
a text input and let's see we're going
to set the on change event to this dot
actually we'll keep change text all
right and we want to set the value
to this dot state dot text all right and
let's move this button actually we'll
take the on click off I'm going to copy
it and I'm going to put it inside the
form alright now when the text changes
it's going to call this dot change text
and I don't want it to just change to
welcome to my app I wanted to change to
whatever we're putting inside of the
input so to do that we're gonna pass in
an event parameter here and then we're
gonna say e dot target dot value all
right so now if we save this where you
load you can see that we have whatever
the state is we have it in our input all
right and if I start to type you can see
that it actually changes the text as I
type which is really nice and can be
used for many different things all right
so the next thing I want to show you is
how we can nest components and also how
we can pass States as properties to
those components so what I'll do is I'm
gonna go outside of the app component
and I'm going to create a new one and
we're just going to call this we'll call
it will just call it components to
alright and we'll set that to react dot
create class ok and then what we'll do
here is pass in curly braces and then we
need a render method okay we're gonna
say render function and then we need to
return
and we'll put in a div okay we'll say
component - alright so we have our
component here now if we want to nest
that inside the app component let's put
it right below the form okay so we'll
say BR and then we'll put in component -
all right if we save that now you can
see that that component is now nested
inside of app now if I go ahead and
replace this with this dot state dot
text and go and reload you may expect it
to say hello world or whatever is in
text but it's not we get an error it's
saying that this dot state is null all
right and that's because the state up
here is for the app component down here
we're looking at the component to
component which doesn't have any state
so what we need to do if we want to pass
that along to the Nestea component we
have to add it as a property so we're
gonna say text equals this dot state dot
text all right now if we save that and
we try to reload we're still gonna get
the same thing all right because once we
pass it like this we're passing it as a
property and if you remember a couple
videos ago we talked about properties
and to get those we need to do this dot
props all right so now if we go and
reload we get hello world all right so
if you're going to nest components which
you probably will you want to keep all
of your state at the top at the app
component and then any sub components
you want to pass down as properties all
right and if for some reason you want
your sub component to change a state you
need to send that up the ladder by
passing it as a property right here all
right you can actually pass functions
here as well but we'll go over that
later on so that's going to be it for
this video in the next video
I
to show you how we can add an array as
in our state pass it down and then loop
through it and output date all right so
we'll get into that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
