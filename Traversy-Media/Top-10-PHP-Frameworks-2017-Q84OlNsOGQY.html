in this video we're going to be looking
at the top 10 PHP frameworks to learn in
2017 we're going to go over the features
the advantages and some of the
disadvantages of each framework and
they're ranked by popularity ease of use
features as well as my own experience
and opinions so let's go ahead and get
started this video is sponsored by dot
tech having a dot tech domain really
emphasizes the technology aspect of your
business and website click on the link
in the description and get a dot tech
domain today for just $4.99 using the
code traversée alright so jumping right
in at number 10 we have the net
framework this is a pure object-oriented
framework well as close as PHP can get
to pure object-oriented programming and
it embraces the DRI concept which which
is don't repeat yourself this makes for
a very clean codebase net also includes
some really nice debugging tools such as
Tracy which helps you quickly detect and
correct errors dumb variables among
other debug tasks it also uses the lacz
or latte I'm not exactly sure how you
say that but it's a templating engine
which eases your work and ensures output
is protected against things like
cross-site scripting attacks all right
so at number 9 we have ye2 which is a
rewrite of the popular Yi framework he
is very mature it was released I believe
back in 2008 and it's still fully
supported Yi 2 is a high performance
framework that works really well for
large-scale enterprise applications but
it's also not a bad choice for smaller
projects it has a really nice
authentication and security package it's
relatively easy to set up
even though ye can be used on enterprise
level it still employs some good rapid
development techniques and we can
attribute a lot of that to gay which is
a code generator that we can run in the
command line alright so one common
downfall with Yi that I've heard a few
times is that the code is a little bit
messy it's not as organized and as clean
as many other frameworks alright so at
number eight we have fuel PHP I've done
a few videos on fuel a couple years ago
I found it to be really simple and
flexible ok simple relative to other
frameworks
fuel also has a command-line interface
called oil it does things like
cogeneration database migrations
debugging and more fuel uses an
integrated ORM or object relational
mapper that works with makes working
with databases very elegant and easy
compared to just writing out SQL queries
alright you can virtually use any
template engine you want with fuel PHP
you can use mustache jade twig and many
others there's also some really good
security features such as input and URL
filtering cross-site scripting
protection output encoding and much more
fuel is very new well it's not very new
but it's new compared to a lot of the
the more old-school framework so there's
not as big as a community and as much
support alright so at number 7 we have
Zend now
Zend is of above decade old I believe
and it's arguably the most popular
framework for enterprise level
applications so big companies like BBC
and Cisco use end on the downsides end
it's pretty tough to learn I have a
series on it on YouTube and I did
struggle with it a little bit with some
of the syntax and some of the structure
of the application then uses the agile
methodology which is incredibly powerful
but can get a little tricky Zen has tons
of components available to extend your
application and most of these are
reusable so that's very efficient but
again it is kind of difficult to learn I
definitely would not suggest then as a
first framework alright so at number 6
we have slim which is actually one of my
favorite newer frameworks it's
classified as a micro framework and I
believe it's the lightest popular PHP
framework that's out right now hence the
name slim so if we were doing a top list
of frameworks for building rest api's
I'm almost positive that slim would be
number one it almost feels like no js'
and express the way that it handles
routes and HTTP and middleware I do have
a video on creating a restful api with
slim so you might want to check that out
it also supports encrypted cookies flash
messaging templates and much more so
even though it is slim it's packed
features and has very little overhead
all right so at number 5 we have cakephp
so I think this is what I think cake was
released back in like 2005-2006 so it's
very mature it's very stable there's a
great community behind it all of these
frameworks that were talking about have
specific areas where some shine and some
don't and when it comes to rapid
development and prototyping cakephp is
definitely at the top it uses
scaffolding that feels very much like
Ruby on Rails we can create crud
applications extremely quickly it's also
very secure it has CSRF support it
protects against things like cross-site
scripting it also has a really
impressive showcase companies like BMW
and Hyundai have used cakephp in their
platforms cake also is it has a pretty
decent learning curve there's no
complicated configuration settings or
anything like that and like I said you
can get things up up and running really
quickly so at number 4 we have Falcon
our Falcon PHP which has been labeled
the fastest PHP framework and one of the
reasons that Salkin is so fast is
because it's based as a C extension it's
written in C and C++ and no you don't
need to know a single C function to use
Falcon that's all behind the scenes and
it's great for managing system resources
it uses very little overhead and what I
mean is it has really low low memory and
CPU consumption Falcon has a very
helpful auto loading mechanism which
follows psr-4 which is a specification
for loading classes from file paths so
it makes things pretty efficient Falcon
applications are also very secure with a
lot of built-in features all right so I
would definitely definitely recommend
checking out Falcon PHP all right so
number 3 we have code igniter which is
also a pretty mature framework this was
actually the first PHP framework that I
learned and this is how I learned about
MVC about the model-view-controller
design pattern now strict MVC isn't
required with code igniter you do need
to use controllers but models and views
are actually optional now it's not as
elegant and clean looking at some of the
other
framework's it forced but it does force
you to learn certain things that you
wouldn't learn from some other platforms
all right because a lot of the stuff you
have to actually type out you have to
code yourself instead of using some kind
of command-line utility to generate
things all right what else another huge
plus to code igniter is how easy it is
to deploy you can buy a $5 per month
hosting account shared hosting account
and just FTP your files connect to a
database and your site is going to be
deployed all right
it also outperforms many of the other
frameworks it's very light around two
megabytes or so but of course as you add
plugins and other functionality that
size is going to grow okay it also has a
really great documentation and just
about everything you can do every aspect
of code ignitor has pretty good
documentation and support so at number 2
we have the symphony framework which is
another one that's ideal for enterprise
level applications it's used a lot in
the corporate world along with then
Danny 2 it's also used by some pretty
impressive projects such as Drupal which
is a PHP content management system as
well as PHP BB which is a popular forum
platform Symphony is known for utilizing
reusable components which makes
development much faster than using
something like Zen components can be
installed using composer which is a PHP
dependency manager Symphony is one of
the fastest frameworks of its size it's
been it's been around for quite a bit so
it actually has a really strong
community and strong support it's also
very easy to use different databases
with your applications such as MySQL or
Postgres or even no SQL alright and that
brings us to the top position which is
laravel the laravel framework is
extremely popular and respected in the
PHP community and even in the web dev
community in general as bad as a wrap as
PHP gets sometimes
so the creators of Larry Bell have said
that they aim to make web development
more enjoyable and elegant without
sacrificing quality some frameworks are
geared toward you know small projects
some are enterprise level laravel is
actually a great choice for either one
ok so applications of any size
the built-in authentication is
incredible it uses blade templating
which is actually one of my personal
favorite template engines it's very easy
and it's also very powerful laravel also
uses eloquent which is an ORM to
interact with the database it's much
cleaner than writing raw SQL queries
although you can do that with this
standard DB library it also uses artisan
which is a command-line tool for doing
all kinds of things such as generating
controllers and models providers it can
run database migrations display routes
and much much more alright guys so
that's my top 10 overall PHP frameworks
but here's a summary of which frameworks
I think are better for certain
situations so as I said earlier the slim
framework is incredible for building
rest api's Symphony's end and e2 are
great for enterprise level platforms
they're a bit more difficult but also
very powerful for speed and performance
we have falcon PHP which is based on c
and c++ and manages resources really
well and all that and when it comes to
rapid development CakePHP is at the top
with their scaffolding tools when it
comes to ease of use and learning I
personally suggest codeigniter
net I haven't really worked with too
much but seems pretty easy to to learn
the basics of and then the overall best
we have laravel which is is pretty good
in almost all situations all right so
hopefully this video gave you guys a
little insight of course every developer
is different and learns in different
ways so there's no clear-cut list that's
going to work for everybody but the best
you can do is look at the pros and cons
and factor in our experience so thanks

please come come and follow me on
Facebook and Twitter I'm trying to get
more interactive with the community and
it will keep you guys up to date with
everything I'm doing so thanks and I
will see you next time hey guys this
