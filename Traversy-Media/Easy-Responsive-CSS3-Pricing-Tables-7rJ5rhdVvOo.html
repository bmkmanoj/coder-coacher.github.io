we're going to be creating some css3
pricing tables or pricing boxes whatever
you want to call them now this shouldn't
take long at all and you may have
noticed that I've been doing a lot of
small and quick project videos and the
reason for that is in addition to the
you know the big project series and the
more difficult back-end stuff nodejs and
all that I want to I want to kind of
have daily or by daily small project
videos as well as more front-end stuff
so my goal for this channel is to be
very diverse and I want to help as many
different types of developers as I can
and that includes people that are just
starting out I'm actually working on a
big web development for beginners series
where I'm going to start from absolute
scratch and teach teaches if the person
that I'm talking to is never written a
line of HTML in their life because
there's a lot of people that are just
starting out and they come to my channel
and they're completely lost that where
to start because there's so many
different technologies I have almost 400
videos and I think that series will be a
really good starting point for for
newcomers so hopefully you experienced
guys you know all my subscribers you
guys will watch it as kind of a
refresher as well but let me know what
you think about that as an ongoing
series all right so this is what we'll
be building you've probably seen this
many times on different websites
especially like you know
software-as-a-service sites and web
hosting sites we basically have a couple
different packages here in this case
these would be web hosting packages so
simple standards super and they each
have different price points and
different features okay so you'll see
the simple package has 20 gigs of this
space 100 gigabytes transfer and so on
the next tier has 75 disk space next
here has 120 gig disk space so this is
very common alright and this is this is
pretty simple as far as design I wanted
to keep it simple and this should just
should be very very quick video all
right and notice that the middle one
here has this kind of shadow around it
and that's because this would be like
you know the best
Deal or whenever you can even put a
label here that says best deal and as we
hover over the other ones it also gets
that shadow effect okay so the code the
markup is going to be very very simple
the CSS is going to be simple I just
wanted something that you know people
could easily understand and this is also
completely responsive you'll see if I
make it bigger it goes along with the
size of the screen if I make it smaller
we get to a certain point they get 700
pixels it'll break into single columns
or single tables which is nice so this
would look good on a mobile device as
well alright so let's go ahead and get
started I do have a folder here called
pricing tables with an empty index.html
file and an empty style.css file I'm
going to go ahead and open a new tab and
I'm going to start the server okay I'm
using atom for my text editor and I have
a package called atom live server so I'm
going to go ahead and start that and
that should open up on my localhost and
we just have a blank page here we
actually didn't need that tab so we're
going to get started with the HTML so go
into index.html and I'm using Emmet so
I'm able to just do exclamation tab and
that will give us a basic structure for
our our website so for the title let's
go ahead and change that to say
responsive css3 sorry about that
dinging guys pricing tables and we're
going to we're going to include the
style sheet that I have which is called
style dot CSS and in the body here the
dhtml is going to be pretty simple first
of all we're going to have an h2 and I'm
just going to give this let's not give
us a class at all actually so it'll just
be an h2 and we'll just say responsive
responsive css3 tracing tables and then
each of these these columns are going to
be in a class called call so let's
create a div with the class of call and
inside here we're going to have a ul and
the US are going to have a class of
price box our price desc
-
and then we'll have a bunch of allies
now this first one here is going to have
a class of header this is where the
price is going to go I'm sorry not the
price but the title of the package so
this one will be simple and then the
next one here is going to be where the
price is all right now I'm going to
create a class called M for emphasis or
emphasize and this is going to be any
row that we want to have like a light
gray background now I could put a class
like gray but what if you wanted to
change it to a different color than then
that will really wouldn't make sense so
I think that this is a little more
semantic so in here let's put in some
strong tags and we'll put the price
which will be $5.99 and then after the
strong tag I'm going to do slash month
okay because it's per month
and then we're going to have our
features inside of the rest of our list
items here so we'll say strong and this
is going to be the disk space so we'll
say 20 gigabytes and then after the
strong will say this space okay and then
I'm just going to copy this and a couple
more Jesus Christ hold on guys let me
silence that silence all right so dis
space then we have the bandwidth or the
data transfer so that's going to be 10
gigabytes counts change that to data
transfer and then next we have the
domain the number of domains that are
allowed with the account so that's going
to be two domains and let's say 50 email
accounts and I actually used to be a
reseller for Hostgator so when I had my
web development company I also basically
had a hosting company and I could set up
packages for different prices and set up
hosting if you guys are interested in me
doing a video on kind of showing you how
to start up your own little hosting
company let me know I'll show you how we
can purchase a reseller account how you
can integrate a platform like wh CMS
which allows you to
you know gives you credit card
processing for your packages and all
that if that's something you guys would
be interested in I'd be happy to do it
as long as you know as long as it was
there was enough demand for it so let me
know about that as well I like to get as
much feedback as I can from you guys
about what to do next you know whoops
that should be just too and then FTP
accounts all right and then this last
one here is going to be the signup
button so we're actually going to just
get rid of that and this is also going
this is going to have a class of M
because we wanted to have a gray
background and then let's do an a tag
and we'll give it a class of button okay
it's not actually going to go anywhere
and then for the text will just say
signup all right so there's our first
column now we can just copy this column
and paste in two more okay and then the
second one here this is the one that's
going to be the best deal so it's going
to have that extra shadow so for the UL
I'm going to add a class of best okay
and then let's see this is going to be
standard now the headers are going to
have a black background but for the
middle one I'm going to make that one
let's see I'm just going to add a style
here you could add a separate class
actually no that's not really a clean
way of doing it let's just give it an
extra class and we'll call it I don't
know header two I guess or header black
or no it's not going to be black it's
going to be green so head our green and
for the price let's change this to what
six we'll just add a 1 so it'll be
$15.99 per month we'll change the disk
space to 75 will change the data
transfer to 50 domains let's say 10
domains 100 email accounts and let's do
unlimited FTP accounts
all right and then for the last one look
that was the last one wasn't it all
right you know what let me just grab
this and put that in the middle all
right so for the last one here let's
change this to 25 per month and for the
disk space we'll say 120 the data
transfer is going to be a hundred
gigabytes the domains we're going to do
unlimited domains unlimited email
accounts and unlimited FTP accounts and
that's it that's it for our markup so if
we take a look at that it looks
horrendous but we haven't added any CSS
yet so now let's go into our style CSS
and we're going to start with the body I
just want to change the font so we're
going to say font family and let's set
that to Tahoma
all right and then we'll have the backup
of sans-serif I also want to change the
background to a dark background
so we'll do triple three and then we're
going to change the color to white which
is triple F all right and then we're
going to move on to the call class which
is wrapped around each one each box or
column and we want these to float to the
left and there's three of them so we're
going to set the width to 33.3 percent
all right and then we're going to set
the padding to a pixels now if we look
at that you'll see that they're not all
in the same line the reason for that is
due to the extra padding okay so what we
can do here is we can assign this a box
sizing and we can set this to border box
what that's going to do is it's going to
include the Pat all the padding for
everything inside of the width so you'll
see if we save that now it goes all the
way across the padding isn't ruining it
okay I'm pushing the next one down and
that's all we need to do for the call
class now we're going to move on to
where we do most of the work and that's
going to be in the price
all right so for the price box we're
going to give it them a background of
white and let's give a color of kind of
a dark gray so we'll do triple five and
then we'll set the lift style to none
because we don't want any bullets or
let's do a style type and let's see
we'll set the border to one pixel solid
and let's do triple five for that as
well and then we're going to we're going
to zero out the margin and the padding
and let's also give this a transition of
0.3 seconds so if we save that you'll
see we get the background and all that
most of what's going to make it come
together is the list items which are
going to style in a minute
now I also want to set the shadow for
for when we hover over also for the best
class so let's go right under here and
say price box and we'll do : hover and
also price box and the class of best all
right actually we want that to be we
don't want a space right there so for
that we're just going to add a box
shadow and we're going to do 0 10 pixels
top right 15 pixels 0 and in the color
which is going to be black so let's save
that and I see the middle one has that
black shadow and if I hover over these
they get they get it as well so now
we're going to start on the LI the first
one here is actually the header so let's
do that first you'll say price box
header
and we're going to say background-color
and we're going to set that to just a
little lighter than then I'm black and
then set the color to white all right
and then let's set the font size to 25
pixels save that okay now we're going to
do the list items in general so price
box Li and let's see these are going to
have a padding of 20 pixels we're going
to add a border bottom of 1 pixel will
make it solid and for the color we're
going to do triple E and then we just
want to align everything to the center
so text-align:center alright save that
and there we go so now it's starting to
come together now for the enth class
that's going to give it kind of a darker
background so let's go ahead and do
price we're going to do price and then
the class of M and we just want to
change the background color to 2f for 3
times which is light gray I'm also going
to change the font size to 20 pixels and
up this should be price box there we go
so now the prices have the M and so do
the the button background so now let's
do the buttons themselves so we'll say
class button and we're going to set the
background color to a green color which
is going to be the hexadecimal value of
4 CA f50 it's f50 okay we're going to
set the border to none we're going to
set the color of the button text to
white we're going to set the padding to
10 on the top and bottom
Dean on the left and right set the text
align to Center and its of the text
decoration to none because we don't want
an underline and then the font size to
18 save that and there's our buttons now
the last thing we want to do is make
these responsive you'll see if we go
really small that obviously doesn't look
very good so we're just going to add a
simple media query down here so we'll
say at media and we're going to set a
max width of 700 pixels so anything
that's under 700 this will be in effect
and we just want to take the call and we
want to set the width to a hundred
percent instead of a 33 so now if we go
to 700 pixels or lower it goes to one
column all right and that's it guys we
now have some pricing tables let me just
I just want to Center that age to
actually so let's go up here and just
say h2 and text-align:center there we go
oh and for the green the header green I
also want to do that so let's see would
we do the header right here so the price
box dot header dots header like do
header green is that what I called it
for the second one yeah this will
actually go like that and let's set the
background it's going to be that same
green as the button so let's grab this
right here I'll say background color
save that and now the middle one as a
green header so that's it guys hopefully
you enjoyed this and I will see you in
