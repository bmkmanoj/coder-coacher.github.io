you how to create a full-featured online
store in e-commerce website with open
cart which is an open source platform
now I know I don't have to say this to
my sister my subscribers but there's a
lot of paid hosted ecommerce programs
out there and I would definitely advise
you not to fall for that crap most of
the time you don't have access to the
source code which makes it almost
impossible to customize it and make it
original an example of this would be
something like wicks or Squarespace or
something like that there's plenty of
good open source platforms out there
there's open card Magento PrestaShop and
they're all free not only that they come
with their own community where you can
get support you can get answers and so
on all right you don't have to just deal
with one company like you would with Wix
so in this video what we're going to do
is we're going to download opencart
we're going to actually upload it to a
live web host with a domain name and
we're going to set everything up alright
now as far as web hosting goes I would
suggest in motion hosting to for any
shared hosting I've used them for years
and they've been just awesome and if
you're looking to get shared hosting and
see how cheap it is $7.99 per month you
know which is nothing and you get a full
cPanel you get full access an unlimited
databases and so on I do have a link and
affiliate link in the description so if
you guys are going to purchase a package
I'd appreciate it if you could go
through that link alright so before we
get started I'm going to show you what
we're going to be building which is a
website called DJ outlet which is a
online shop that sells DJ equipment now
this is actually the default Open Cart
theme I just edited the CSS a little bit
to change up the colors and they also
created this custom logo which isn't
that great but you know it makes it more
custom and I'll also show you how to do
that in Photoshop okay I'm going to
include all the files or a link to all
the files in the description so you'll
be able to get the logo if you don't
want to create it yourself alright so we
have this slideshow here which i think
is really cool you don't have to use it
but
you can and it's a way to showcase
certain products and then down here we
have the four products that I created I
basically just took the info from Amazon
alright and I'm not going to go through
the entire front end right now because I
don't want it to take too long but just
just to give you the gist of it we can
add products to a wish list for if we
want to save them for later now if I try
to do that now it's going to tell us to
log in or create an account there's a
full authentication system for customers
and they can log in they can track their
orders they can you know contact support
and all that stuff so let's say we want
to look at this here this DJ controller
it has a product details page and you
can upload multiple images alright and
you can scroll through those images and
there's a description you can add
related products reviews que customers
can write reviews and let's see they can
share listings there's just a ton of
stuff here now if we wanted to purchase
this we could add it to our cart and up
here you'll see one item if we click on
that it will show us kind of a drop-down
of the cart and if we go to view cart we
can see the full the full cart alright
with all our products we can change the
quantities we can remove them
there's even coupon codes we can use I
think I created one called Brad so see
how it's $99 if I apply the coupon now
down here it's 89 it's a 10% coupon all
right we can estimate shipping we can
even add gift certificates alright so
there's there's not too much that you
can't do with this platform now I'm not
going to go through the whole checkout
but I'll show you some of it so you can
either make customers register for an
account or you can enable guest checkout
where they don't have to actually create
an account but I would probably suggest
that you disable guest checkout just so
you get all that info and so your
customers have a way to track everything
and so on it might you know it might
eliminate some confusion for the future
and then once you do that they can enter
their ship it their address details and
all that
I'm not going to go through this entire
thing but you see they'll check they'll
pick delivery details delivery method
payment method I think I have PayPal
enabled and also CEO Dr Cobb cash on
delivery and then they can just check
out all right and they'll get an email
and all that stuff everything's taken
care of all right so I think that that's
all I'm going to do for net for showing
you the front end for now
you see there's also the categories in
the menu here so this is exactly what
we'll be building now I'm not going to
go through the back end right now but
it's it's very intuitive and very
customizable so to get started here you
need obviously hosting if you don't want
to upload this on to a live post I would
suggest xampp which I'm sure many of you
have used before basically it gives you
an Apache server on your local machine
it gives you PHP and by the way OpenCart
is a PHP platform and it also gives you
MySQL so you can use that what I wanted
to kind of do you know I wanted to build
a live application I don't do that too
often all right so this is my C panel
for in motion hosting if you use
something like Hostgator or GoDaddy they
also have cPanel that you can use and it
should look very similar to this so we
need a database to store everything user
info product info it all has to go
somewhere so we're going to use a MySQL
database and cPanel makes it really easy
to create ok so if we go to databases
and we go to let's do MySQL database
wizard so we're going to create a
database here let's say just call it
call it DJ outlet and click next step
we're going to create a user I'm going
to do the same thing DJ outlet actually
we can't do that many characters let's
just do this to prod alright it's going
to be prefixed with your domain if
you're using cPanel and by the way I
don't know if I mentioned it but we're
using the domain code demos com
alright so password let's see I'll just
do I'm going to delete all this after
anyways so let's go ahead and create
password strength must be at least 20
all right so let's do ABC 1 2 3
exclamation
ABC 1 2 3 exclamation and create user
all right now right here we need to pick
the permissions for the user I'm just
going to click all privileges and click
next step and we should be all set so we
have this as the user and this as the
database now if you're using xampp or
lamp or something like that you'll
create a database probably through PHP
myadmin which is also available for
cPanel so if we go back and we go to
databases phpMyAdmin it should redirect
us ok you can see we have the database
right here code demo DJ outlet and it's
empty right now all right when we go
through the installation of Open Cart
it's going to fill everything up it's
going to create all the tables and so on
so now that we have the database we can
go to Open Cart calm and go ahead and
download everything so a free download
and click on download now and it's going
to give you a zip package ok the current
version is two point three point zero
point two yours may be different but
everything should still be the same
alright now I already downloaded it I
should have it in my downloads right
here alright so I'm not going to do that
and then you want to upload those to
your web host ok and the easiest way to
do that is through FTP so if you're
using cPanel you should have already
have an FTP account with the same the
same details as your you know your
username for your cPanel and so on your
password but you can create more FTP
accounts if we go to right here FTP
accounts
and yeah you can see I already have an
FTP account with the actual details of
cPanel but you can create another one
here for instance you could say Brad at
code demos comm or whatever your domain
is password and so on okay once you
create that you need a way to log in
through FTP and I would suggest
FileZilla so if you go to FileZilla
project org you want the client okay you
can download that so I already have that
open I'm going to bring that down I'm
already logged into code demos and I've
already uploaded what I need to alright
so what you need to upload let's go
ahead and open up that zip package that
we downloaded ok we'll just go ahead and
extract that so take everything out
alright now this includes everything all
the source code you don't want to upload
everything what you want to upload to
your hosts is everything that's in this
upload folder so if we open that up this
includes all the actual files that we
need now this is very important you see
this config disk file file there's one
here there's also one in the admin
folder you need to rename these ok you
need to just take off the - dist
so it's just config dot PHP alright same
thing in the admin folder I'm just going
to remove the disk alright and I
actually didn't do that to the files
that I uploaded so I'm going to just
overwrite those alright so once you're
logged in to your host via FTP you want
to just grab everything here in the
upload folder and just drag it over and
drop it in and it'll all upload alright
you can see I didn't rename my config
files so what I'm going to do is just
grab this one and bring it over oops
okay let's reload okay now I'm just
going to delete the dist okay and then
in the admin folder same thing let's go
over here and bring over config.php and
I'm going to delete the dist all right
so now that everything is uploaded and
the config files are renamed we can go
ahead and install it so let's close this
up and we're going to go back to the web
browser see which one we add here all
right and we're going to go to well I'm
going to go you want to go to your
domain name but I'm going to go to code
demos comm all right and it's going to
start the install it should be
redirected to install slash index.php
all right so this is just the the
license and so on so we'll click
continue and then it's going to run a
check on everything it's going to check
your PHP versions going to check some of
the PHP config and you can see
everything is ok if you have these green
checks now if you didn't rename the
config file right here you're going to
get it's not going to say writable it'll
say error or something like that or
permissions denied all right but we did
rename it so everything is okay all the
directories is ok so we should be all
set to click continue and then here we
need to put in the parameters of our
database so if you're using xampp or
something like that you're probably
using the root user so you want to keep
that and then put in your password we're
using live hosting here so I'm going to
grab the user name for the password copy
that and put that right in there alright
and this is going to be localhost in you
know 99 percent of fall cases all right
and then let's grab the database name
and put that in there right right here
and then we're going to put the password
for the database which is abc123
exclamation and then down here we want
to create a
admin account for our system so I'm just
going to leave admin as the username and
I'll just put that for the password
alright and then for the email I'm going
to put my one of my actual emails
alright and we'll click continue
and that should set everything up and
you can see it says don't forget to
delete your installation directory
that's very important for security
reasons go over to FileZilla and go
ahead and delete that install folder
alright so that will delete and then we
have the option to go to our shop and
also the option to go to the back end
all right so let's first go to the shop
and we have our front end okay and it by
default it's going to give you all of
the sample data I'm going to show you
how to delete that in a few minutes but
you can see we're actually at code demos
comm we have a live ecommerce site on
the Internet okay with and we didn't
even write any code all right so let's
go ahead and go to the backend which you
haven't even seen yet and we see it's
we're at code demos comm slash admin so
we're going to put in our credentials
and see it says install folder still
exists because it's actually still
deleting or it should be I think it's
still going but that will disappear
there we go and this is the dashboard
okay so this will show you all your
analytics your sales analytics your
customers some customers that are online
your sales all that stuff all your
tracking data and over here we have all
the different options I really really
like this interface so we have our
categories and you can see there's all
sample stuff here that's what you're
seeing on the front end if we go to
products
products all right so you can see these
are all the different products that are
on the front end there's a lot of sample
data but I'm going to show you exactly
how to get rid of all that and start
from scratch if we look at some of these
other menu items we have different
attributes and options you can give
products let's take a look at that
so attributes now these are certain
attributes for certain products for
instance clockspeed that's probably for
you know one of the computers number of
cores
obviously these are you can see they're
in the group processor and we see our
attribute attribute groups right here so
motherboard processor technical we're
going to delete all these but just to
show you you can do it and you can set
up different options for with a checkbox
checkboxes radios selects all that stuff
for instance if we go to let's go to
Apple cinema 30-inch and over here they
have some available options okay and
these they just named it's small medium
large which doesn't really make sense
for this product but you can do that for
instance if you wanted to choose a
screen size or something like that all
right and they have a bunch of stuff
here I think they have every type of
option available just to show you how it
works all right but we're not going to
use options for our products so let's
see what else we have
manufacturers okay so you can create
certain manufacturers they have all the
tech companies and if we look at the
front end if we look at the homepage
they have a slider with all the
different manufacturer logos okay so you
can do that as well now when it comes to
those sliders on the front end those are
actually extensions if we go to
extensions and there's a bunch of these
already set up and you can also install
other ones you can also purchase them
there's premium extensions but if we go
to modules and down here you'll see
slideshow on the home page and if we
want to edit that we can do that from
here
all right actually the module itself we
can edit from here okay so the width and
the height and all that if you want to
add images to the sliders then you will
go to see where is it
well is it layouts no banners and here
it is a homepage slideshow if we click
Edit you can see we have the two images
that are in that and this should also be
the manufacturers slideshow right here
with those images alright so what else
customers this is where all your
customers will be listed all your orders
everything affiliates you even have a
built in affiliate system where you can
get you can have users sign up and they
can get paid for for sales on your on
your site and what else settings users
which includes the admin users and so on
analytics I'm not going to go through
everything but it's just a ton so what I
want to do now is start to delete the
sample data okay so there's a few areas
we need to do that and let's start with
categories okay so we're just going to
check all of these and then go up here
and click delete click OK
let's get these ones as well delete all
right then we're going to go to products
and we want to delete all the products
ok and let's see we want to go to let's
see products out at rebukes I'm going to
get rid of attributes
okay and also attribute groups all right
and now for the banners let's go to
banners and I'm actually not going to
delete them I'm going to just disable
them alright so let's go to edit and
we'll click disabled save same thing
with this one or the manufacturers
disabled alright and let's see what else
manufacturers themselves let's go ahead
and delete those and I think we should
be all set so if we go back to the
front-end and reload we basically have
just an empty and empty site here okay
all the functionalities there but the
products and all that stuff is gone
we're going to create new ones so now
we're going to do is start to customize
our store so let's go back to the back
end and we're going to go to let's see
where is it settings right here
all right now you can actually create
multiple stores with the same platform
all right but we're just going to use
this default and click edit so let's
change some stuff up we'll change the
name to DJ outlet meta tag description
we could say cheap and professional DJ
equipment ok keywords so you could do
like DJ equipment turntables mixers and
so on
ok and then the theme there's only one
by default which is default and you can
either create a separate theme or you
can buy a separate theme you can get a
free one well there's all different
options for that and then default layout
we're just going to keep default all
right now if we go to store we're going
to once again change this to DJ outlets
we're going to store owner put mining
address I will just say 55 Main Street
Boston Mass we don't need the geo code
email we're going to keep that telephone
fax now image right here you probably
want to chain but we're going to get to
the images in a minute all right and
then let's go to local and you can
change up this stuff I'm just going to
leave it actually let's change the
country-region state I'll say
Massachusetts and we'll leave the rest
you can change your currency and so on
all right
option so these are just different
options for instance if you want to
disable reviews you can do that taxes
account information we're just going to
leave yeah we're going to leave all that
stuff and then image so your store logo
will take care of that in a second
you can even link your FTP account but
we're going to leave all that stuff you
can put it into maintenance mode so that
people can't you know do anything on the
front end
and then let's just go ahead and click
save up here alright so let's go ahead
and create a logo so I'm going to go to
Google Images let's just search for
record ok let's see
I want X let's do record icon because
this is specific one I want which is
this one right here alright I'm just
going to show you the process that I go
through to create simple logos and like
I said the it will be available in the
downloads if you don't want to do this
yourself
so let's go ahead and click save image
as and you can see I already have
everything that I need in this folder so
let's see I'll just create another one I
guess so let's say new folder and we'll
say DJ outlet underscore images alright
and then I'm going to create a folder in
there called original ok we're going to
delete that into that file and I'm going
to save it as record icon dot thing ok
so we have that so I'm going to open
that in Photoshop ok and then let's see
we're also going to go back to our store
and let's go to the front end and you
see they have a logo here I'm going to
just go open image in new tab and let's
go ahead and save this alright we'll
save it in original as logo.png ok so
we're also going to open that in
Photoshop and then what I'll do is drag
the record image into our logo here and
I'll do ctrl T and resize it okay I'll
just yeah we'll just look that looks
good and let's minimize that and then
this opencart logo here I'm just going
to get rid of that so just to delete and
then let's put some text in here
and it's a DJ outlets okay and the type
of thought this is is century gothic
alright but you can do whatever you'd
like and then I'm just going to change
let's see I did the just a DJ and I'm
going to click up here into the color
and just make that black and click OK
alright and then I'm going to select
both of these layers and just kind of
move it to the middle alright and that's
our logo so let's go ahead and do save
as and I'm not going to do it in
original we're going to go here and save
it as well go dot PNG alright and then
let's go back close that up and see if
we can close all these things up ok and
then in the backend let's go back to
settings and click Edit and see we'll go
to image and store logo we're going to
click Edit and then this upload button
right here and we're going to grab our
logo okay so it's been uploaded oh you
know what it's it's not showing because
it's the same name as this and that file
didn't get deleted so what I'll do is
just go back and change the name so
let's see go down here and I'm just
going to change it from logo - let's
just say DJ logo all right and then
we'll upload that
all right so it's a success and what the
hell is it that is sorry so we'll click
that and now save and then if we go to
our front-end and reload there we go so
now we have a custom logo now if we go
back to our settings and go to store you
may want to change this as well so what
I'll do is open in a new tab and then
we'll save that save it in original open
that up in Photoshop and then what we'll
do is bring over the record so I'm just
going to bring that in here
and get rid of that layer underneath
we'll just delete that and then let's
save that right here and we'll just save
it as DJ logo 100 times 100 and it'll
save it go back over here and we'll
change this upload we want this one here
oh I guess the logo.png did actually
change so for this we're going to choose
that record icon alright and we'll save
now we can also change this up here to
even customize the back end so if we say
open image in new tab and it's really
small but we're going to save that into
original let's save it as a small logo
okay and then we'll open that up and
let's bring over this okay do a ctrl T
so we can resize
all right and then we'll get rid of the
original layer let's save it and we'll
save it here a small logo PNG and then
what we'll do is just replace it in our
files okay so actually I want that open
again we know that the location is an
admin view image logo.png now I'm doing
it this way because I couldn't find an
option to change it in the backend so
we're just going to replace the image so
if we go to our files and go to admin
and view image it's this logo.png right
here so let's go ahead and why does that
keep closing well there we go so we're
going to go and upload small logo PNG
and then delete this logo PNG and then
just rename this to logo dot PNG all
right and then we'll go back to our
store and reload okay we might have to
clear the cache with ctrl f5 and I see
we have our own logo alright just makes
it a little more custom now I'm going to
use manufacturers for our products as
well so let's first create those and
then we'll create our products ok so
let's go to manufacturers and for the
images I actually prepared those already
I'm not going to do that because it's
just going to take too much time so you
will have this DJ outlet images folder
for download and then the paste in a
folder called manufacturers and we're
going to use these for bearing our new
mark Pioneer and Sony okay so let's go
ahead and add a new manufacturer and
this will be let's say new mark on SEO
URL you want to fill that out as well so
they can just go to you know slash new
mark and see all those images and let's
see we're going to upload it so say
upload and manufacturers and I'm just
going to
grab all of these and click open all
right so let's choose the Newmark one
and save alright and then we'll do the
same for the other three so this will be
Sony ok and let's choose that and save
ok let's choose to add another one this
will be berenguer whom i'm sure if
that's felt right but that's fine
all right so let's see right here save
and then we just want to add pioneer
all right so now we have our
manufacturers now we're also going to
want to create some categories so let's
go to categories and let's click add new
so this is going to be DJ controllers
and for for a description I'm just going
to go to lorem ipsum our lips um calm
and just grab a little bit of text so
we'll just grab like a sentence or two
copy that and put that here now as far
as meta tag title we're going to use the
same as the category name and then you
can put a description and stuff if you
want and then let's go to data and this
is where we can put the image so I also
have a folder called products in the
images let me just paste that in okay so
products and these are all the products
again you'll have the link to download
these in the description so we're going
to use just each product for the
category image as well so it's an image
and let's go ahead and just upload all
of those product images oops
all right so we get success let's grab
one of these DJ controller images now
top this is if you want to add this
category to the top menu and I do so I'm
going to just check that off alright and
you can change the sort order as well
and we don't need anything InDesign so
that should be good let's go ahead and
save and now if we go to our front-end
and reload we have our category DJ
controllers click that and we have that
info we just added so let's add a couple
more categories so this is going to be
turntables and again I'll just grab some
text let's go to images okay and we'll
grab this top and save all right and
then we're going to have one more
category which is going to be headphones
okay and we'll add the image let's do
that
top save okay so now we have our three
categories so now it's time to add some
products so let's go over to products
and let's click new now for the text I'm
going to be just pasting it in you guys
can copy it if you want and then let's
see description we'll just grab
paragraph okay meta tag title is going
to be the same as the title alright and
let's see for the model
I guess this doesn't really have a model
number so I'll just make one up we'll
just say x100 and then for the SKU let's
do 0 0 1 and let's see the quantity that
we have let's say we have 200 of these
and there's all types of options I'm not
going to go through every single one you
can also put all the weight info and
stuff so it calculates the shipping and
then let's see links manufacturer this
is going to be new mark categories this
is going to be DJ controllers stores
always going to be default related
products you can add if but we don't
have any yet and you can even add
downloads for instance the manual or
something like that
alright we're not going to use
attributes or anything like that let's
see oh I don't think I put the price so
if we go to data you want to put the
price in alright and then let's see you
can apply discounts is just a lot guys
image we're going to just add that this
right here and then we can add
additional images so if we click right
here what score let's throw these two in
there as well
and that should be good let's go ahead
and save all right so let's go to the
front end now if we go to the home page
it's not going to show by default
because the home page is actually a
module if we go to DJ controllers you'll
see it but let's add it to the home page
so we need to go to where is its
extensions and then we're going to
choose modules and go down to featured
and this home page right here so we'll
click Edit and for products we're going
to choose that product ok will do let's
do limit 8 all right so let's save and
now if we go to the front-end and reload
there it is alright so I'm going to go
ahead and just add the rest of the
products just to save a little time I'm
going to do this off camera basically
just repeat what we did here for the
three other products alright guys so I
added the rest of the project products
now I did mess up with the manufacturer
and I put barriner when it should
actually be technics but that's fine I
just took I just chose behringer's of
the manufacturer for the turntable now
we need to add these to the home page so
let's go to extensions and go to modules
and let's see featured home page edit
and we're just going to add the rest of
these alright we'll save and now if we
go to our home page and reload we have
all of our products and we have our
description pages our images I also
chose some related products and so on
alright so let's let's change the colors
because we want this and all the buttons
to be red so this is the only file that
we actually have to edit so we want to
go to the CSS which is going to be let's
see it should be in system
no oh it's going to be in catalog and
then view theme default and stylesheet
all right so we have a style sheet dot
CSS what I'm going to do is bring it to
the desktop and let's go ahead and
minimize this and here it is right here
so I'm going to edit with let's say
sublime text you can use any code editor
and we basically have some colors to
search for and replace so I'm going to
go to C replace and we want this
hexadecimal value and we're going to
change it to this one all right so I'm
going to say replace all alright the
next one we are going to search for this
value and we're going to replace them
all with this one ok so that replaced
that let's do it again replace and now
we're going to search for this one and
replace with this one replace all and
then one more and again these files will
be available so you don't have to
manually do this and replace it with
that or place all and then we're going
to save this and then just re-upload it
alright and then we'll go back to our
site and reload and nothing let's do a
control f5 that clears the cache so now
we have our red navbar okay so we're
almost there guys now let's do the
slideshow so we're going to go to let's
see where was it late banners and let's
create a new banner and we'll just call
this DJ banner make sure it's enabled
and then for the images
I'm going to make those available for
you guys so you'll have a folder called
slide and slide one two and three so we
want to go ahead and add those title
let's just say slide one and we'll
change the image let's go ahead and
upload those images alright and we're
going to choose slide one you can put a
link if you want as well so let's create
the next one let's do where is it slide
two and then slide three and let's go
ahead and save that and then to let's
say enabled we have to go to our
extensions I believe and then modules
and go down to slideshow homepage and
then edit and let's change it to DJ
banner and save and there we go is our
slider
okay very easy now for payment we're
going to we're going to go to where is
it says extensions if you can't find
something in here chances are it's an
extension so payments and you can see
there's a ton of options
authorize.net is a really good one but
obviously you need an account with these
companies cash-on-delivery you'll see is
enabled by default and everything else
is disabled but we're going to go to
PayPal payment standard and let's see
install okay once we install it we can
edit it and then you could put your
there are paypal email address there you
can choose sandbox mode if you want
which is kind of like just testing and
you have some other stuff here but let's
make sure that this is enabled and we'll
click Save
alright so now they should be able to
use PayPal so I'm pretty sure that's it
guys I mean let's go ahead and just test
out the login system and so on so let's
say we want to add this to the cart
alright and then we'll go to view cart
oh the coupons if you want to add a
coupon you can go to where is it coupons
and you can see there's a 10% one
already created the code is two two two
two
let's go ahead and let's actually change
that - I will say 10% and you can see
it's already 10% and let's make sure you
can choose specific products or leave
leave it for all of them you can choose
specific categories alright let's go
ahead and enable it for everything and
then if we go to our front-end and we
say 10% apply coupon and now it's 8910
alright
and then shipping you choose that stuff
let's go to checkout and let's go ahead
and create an account alright so say
register account continue and then I'm
going to just put everything in here
alright so I just added everything to
save some time I'm going to pick a
password okay we can also use a
newsletter if we want but I'm just going
to click this check box and click
continue
ok delivery details will click continue
shipping flat rate continue and you can
see we have the PayPal option so we'll
continue
and it gives us a summary we can say
confirm order and it should redirect us
to PayPal all right I can't actually
make a purchase because I can't use my
account to purchase from my account but
it'll go through this and it'll add the
customer and their orders in your
back-end so you can see what they've
purchased all right so really cool but
we're just going to go back and that's
pretty much it we have a full
functioning ecommerce site that we did
in what less than an hour now one thing
I want to mention is the pages down here

want to change those you can go to see

delivery information your privacy policy
