about state and we talked about nesting
components all right so we're gonna
continue to work on that in this video
all right I've reset the code back to
just having one app component but what I
want to do is I want to create start to
create a to-do list all right so we're
gonna have a to-do form which will be
able to enter text in and then we'll
have a to-do list which will display and
loop through all of the the to Do's
so what we're gonna do here is we're
going to embed our nest in two
components one is going to be to do form
and then we'll have one under it called
to-do list all right so let's go ahead
and create those real quick I'm just
gonna copy what we have here for our app
component okay and it'll paste that in
and that okay so this one will be to do
form and for now we're just gonna I'll
put some text will say to do form and
then this one's going to be to do list
whoops okay to do list
okay so that should work let's go ahead
and save it and you can see now we're
all putting the two components so we
want to keep our two dews inside of our
state for now okay so let's go above the
render in the app component and set get
initial State all right so what we're
gonna do is we're going to have actually
we need to return an object and we're
gonna have text which will be set to
just an empty string and then we're
gonna have to do which is gonna be in a
right now for now I'm going to just add
them here all right so it's gonna be an
array of objects so each to do is gonna
have an ID
so we'll say one then we'll have text
actually that might get confusing so
let's put name alright so this will be
meeting at work okay we'll put another
one in here actually we'll put two more
so this one I'll say
bring kids to school and then this one I
will say food shopping all right so we
have some to dues now we want to pass it
to the to-do list right so we can go to
dues equals this dot state dot to do
this all right
since we're passing it in as a property
we can then access it in to-do lists as
this dot props dot - dues
okay but what we want to do is we want
to map through those and then display
them in our application so what we need
to do here is we're going to open up
some curly braces and we're gonna say
this dot props dot - dues dot map all
right and then in here we're gonna say
to do and I'm gonna set that to an
object and then in here we want to
return let's put these in an Li so we
want to say Li to do equals to do and
then we also need a unique key so we're
gonna say key equals to do dot ID
all right so that's the list item and
then in here we want the to-do name to
display so we'll say to do dot name all
right
and actually let's change the the route
div here to a ul all right so let's save
that and see what that gives us all
right so you can see now we're looping
through our mapping the to do is out
into the application and just to make
this look a little better let's add
class name is working with bootstrap so
we'll say list group all right and then
the allies will also give a class name
of list group item oops
all right so that should make it look a
little better there we go all right so
that's how you can map through your
state data
all right so in the next video we're
gonna start to create our form so that
we can actually add to our - dues
alright so we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
