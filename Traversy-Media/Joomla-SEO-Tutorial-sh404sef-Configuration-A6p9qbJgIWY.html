Joomla tutorial and this video is going
to be on Joomla SEO and optimizing your
URLs we're going to be we're going to be
using this site DJ social network which
is basically just a it's a joomla 2.5
site that uses jomsocial so it's a small
social network site but the site really
doesn't matter it's this is global no
matter what site you're using um and
what we're going to do is first of all
enable clean URLs with Joomla and then
we're going to install sh404sef which is
a great SEO component for Joomla it'll
allow us to edit our URLs and it'll
allow us to add metadata and page titles
to any page we want really so the first
thing I want to do is you want to go
into your back-end like I said this is
joomla 2.5 point 8 so we want to go to
global configuration and by default we
have search engine friendly urls enabled
so if we go to let's say DJ videos now
the URL is clean there's no queries or
anything but we still have this
index.php and we don't want that we want
it to just be /dj videos so what we want
to do is enable URL rewriting but in
order to enable this we need to have mod
rewrite enabled on our server
and if you have GoDaddy or Hostgator or
one of the big hosting companies chances
are you can do this you must likely have
an Apache server so what you need to do
is actually log in to your site through
FTP
and this is FileZilla if you don't know
too much about this kind of stuff you
should have got a welcome email from
your hosting company which has your
cPanel login and possibly an FTP login
but usually you can use your cPanel
login as to log into FTP so you just put
your site here in the host and then your
host at your cPanel or FTP username and
password ports 21 but you can leave that
blank so now I'm in that in the root of
DJ social network and we want this H
this htaccess txt file we want to rename
this we want to take the dot txt off the
end and we have to put a dot at the
beginning if we don't do this the you
are out the URL rewriting won't work and
your site will probably break so now we
want to check yes and we'll save it and
go back to the front-end now if we go to
DJ videos you can see the index dot PHP
is gone and it's like that for all pages
DJ directory group discuss okay so
that's what you can do to have cleaner
URLs with the core system but now what I
want to do is I want to UM install
sh404sef and I believe it's a premium
extension I don't remember exactly how
much it is but I'll put that information
in the description so I mean you
wouldn't all it like any other extension
I mean if most of the SEO extensions
cost something they have they're not
free most of them the ones that I've
worked with anyway in sh404sef is
probably is definitely actually the best
one I've ever worked with I use it on
pretty much every Joomla site I build
unless the client wants something
different so the version I have right
now at this time is 3.5 so I'm going to
install that
and it was installed successfully so now
we want to go to components SH 404 and I
it's not enabled you have to well I
guess it is enabled usually it isn't
maybe because I had this already
installed and then I reinstalled it but
if this is set to no you want to set it
to yes and here we can see the rewriting
mode
yeah deafness is definitely pre-selected
you always will most likely say without
HT access so what you want to do is
change it to with HT access and then
click start so now we should be using
the component instead of cordula
and if we go to our front-end again and
let's go to DJ videos you can see the
URL is changed and not in a good way it
it capitalized some letters and it also
put this videos at the end what we want
to do is just take this middle pod out
and just have it DJ social network comm
slash videos so how we would do that is
we need to go back and we want to go
into configuration sh404sef IgG Eurasian
and let's just go through some of these
settings I'm not exactly sure what we're
going to do here because I haven't
planned this out but I'm just going to
look at them real quick and see what we
want obviously we want to enable URL
optimisation we already did that and you
can look at some of these this right
here all lowercase I always select yes
because it's just a URL shouldn't have
capital letters in my opinion so I'm
going to select YES for that and you can
also change your say a space character
so if you can have a hyphen or you can
use an underscore I suggest leaving it
at -
just because domain names have hyphens
they can't have underscore so just keep
that and SH URL I don't think we need
anything here no languages okay URL
cache that's fine we can see we have the
width HT access mode
okay
so that all looks fine and you can
actually change settings for different
components you can see that we have the
jump social is the community the login
extension all all the modules and
components that you have installed
alright so that should be it all you
need to really do here is enable all
lowercase so we can go test that out
and that didn't work I'm going to do a
control f5 clear the cache
ah
oh that's why I forgot to purge the URLs
we have to go to the URL manager and in
order for it to change the URLs you can
see these capital letters we have to
actually clear them out and generate new
ones so you want to click purge up in
the top right hand corner it's going to
give you this confirmation box and just
click delete
all right so now if we go back let's go
to DJ videos and now you can see it's
all lowercase because it's not going to
just change not change the URLs on the
fly you have to actually purge it so now
what we want to do is go back to the
control panel and I want to see if we
can get rid of this double this DJ
videos and then videos again and we can
actually see management
extensions configuration that's all we
want to go
and we want to change this show category
let's change that to none we don't want
to show the category in the URL show
category and categories links let's do
you can keep that on categorized items
insert content table name No
activate multi-page article smart tales
and so why Dino
okay
so what this is is you'll see this
Joomla this is this pertains to the
standard content component that Joomla
has which is the articles basically the
article manager so now that's Joomla
that should be good for your site but we
can also this site has jumped social so
we can also look at certain options for
the actual jomsocial component so insert
name main page of a pre tono
okay I'm going to click no for that I
don't want to insert that short URL to
use a profile yes
insert use a short name yes
insert group category no because I'm
pretty sure that's where that DJ videos
came from insert discussion ID I'll
leave that a yes video category name no
insert video category no video ID that's
fine all right so that should do it for
this site so let's save that and go back
to the URL manager and purge
all right so see what's changed
all right so now we got rid of that DJ
videos and we just have videos now if I
want this to actually be DJ videos we
can go to the URL manager and let's
search research for links with the word
video
and you can see right here is the videos
link so we can actually click on that
and change it to DJ videos
save that and encourage again
all right so let's go back
and now it's DJ videos so you can change
any URL on your site that you want very
easily just by using the URL manager
something that's not you can't do
anything like that with Joomla core so
you need an extension to do to do stuff
like this and the last thing I want to
show you guys is how to change metadata
and page titles I will see you see this
DJ videos page the title just says
videos so I want to change that and if
we look at the source you can see we
have no keywords and no description for
this page and technically if you're just
using Joomla and jomsocial without the
the SEO extension there's really no way
that you can add as far as I know
there's no way you can add metadata to a
page like this I'm pretty sure I'm not
going to say that that's a fact but when
I want to use when I want to use
metadata on pages like this I install an
extension so what we want to do is we
can actually do it from here from the
URL manager if we click on
let's now search for our DJ's DJ videos
so we want to click on that and you can
easily just click on this title and meta
tags and we can change let's just say
we'll just change it to DJ videos and
the description keywords will just say
DJ video DJ videos alright so we'll save
that
and if we go back and reload title has
changed and if we look at the source
right here a description and keywords
alright so very easy since this URL
manager is great you can do so much from
here so if you're going to use an SEO
extension I definitely suggest this
sh404sef and I'll put the the URL to it
in the video description so that's it
for this tutorial and I will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
