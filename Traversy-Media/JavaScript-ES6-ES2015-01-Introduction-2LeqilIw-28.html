to be looking at es6 or equi script 6
also known as es2015 and we're going to
look at all the new features and see
what's changed and improved in the
latest version of javascript so what is
echo script echo script is a scripting
language standard and specification and
languages like javascript jscript
ActionScript these are all based on the
ACMA script standard alright but in this
series we'll be focusing on solely on
JavaScript es6 is the most recent
version of equi script or javascript
it's a very significant update there's a
lot of new changes to the syntax and
just how things work it's been the first
major update since es 5 which was
released way back in 2009 and es6 and
es2015 are the same thing at different
names for the same thing some of the
goals of es6 were to make javascript
taken more seriously not so much now but
in the past a lot of a lot of developers
didn't look at JavaScript as a real as a
high-level programming language but now
with es6 we've added classes and things
that make it look more like you know
something like Java or something or a
respected programming language they've
obviously fix some issues from es 5 as
with any software update you want to
look at you know bugs and things that
just throw people off and fix those
issues backward compatibility so it's
very important that es5 code works in an
es6 environment modern syntax of course
we want to you know stay up-to-date with
with certain syntaxes such as classes
that are scaling and better for big
applications
ok so javascript is now being used for
these big applications as opposed to
just you know doing some some slideshow
or something like that you know of
course with nodejs you can run
JavaScript on the server and it can be
pretty powerful also just having new
feature
is in the standard JavaScript library so
you can use things like classes without
having to use typescript or or any kind
of you know third-party extension so
compatibility we still have quite a ways
to go for all the browsers to be caught
up you know like ie 11 obviously there's
always been issues with Internet
Explorer the latest version of Chrome
and Firefox are just about there
in fact we'll take a look at the chart
at the kangas website which shows us
exactly what browsers include what es6
features also of course you can use
transpilers to compile es6 code into es
5 i'll show you how to do that with
Babel there's also tracer closure and
some other ones as well so if you were
to build a production application right
now and you wanted to use es6 you should
use some kind of transpiler because you
don't know what your users are using as
far as browsers so what's new in es6
okay there's a bunch of new concepts and
syntaxes the let and the consecration
let is basically a replacement for var
but what's good about let is that it
gives you it gives you block scope local
variables so for instance when you use
var it sets the the variable globally
all right so if you set a variable in a
global scope and then you put it inside
of a loop or a function it's going to
still be that local variable with let we
can we can limit the scope to whatever a
function or a loop or whatever it may be
which is really helpful and also Const
which is for constants that don't change
all right well obviously take a look at
these in action the destructor D
structuring assignment this helps us
extract data from arrays and objects
into distinct variables all right
classes and inheritance is a huge is a
huge deal we can now we don't have to
use prototype to based objects we can
actually create
classes we can extend and inherit them
just like languages like Java and PHP
template strings which is one of my
favorite features of es6 we don't have
to use concatenation anymore we can just
use backticks instead of quotes and we
can include variables we can bind data
and it's just really helpful so we have
some new string features we have new
math and number features which will go
over new data structures we can use map
and set and week map and week set which
we'll go over later iterators generators
which are functions that can basically
be paused and yield a value and then
beak and then continue all right as many
times as needed promises and
asynchronous data okay we can use
promises to work with asynchronous data
and then arrow functions which are also
really helpful which use a lexical this
which I'll talk about in a little bit
all right so enough of the slides in the
next video we're going to set up Babel
so that I can show you how to compile
es6 code into es5 so that it's
compatible with just about every browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
