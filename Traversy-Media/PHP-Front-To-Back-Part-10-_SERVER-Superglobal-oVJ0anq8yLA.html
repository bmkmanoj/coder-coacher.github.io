start to look at superglobals so
superglobals as you can see in the PHP
documentation are built in variables
that are always available in all scopes
okay so we can access them from a global
scope from inside functions inside
classes wherever they're basically
system variables and there's all
different kinds we're definitely not
going to get to all of them in one video
for instance post will use when we work
with processing forms get will use when
we work with query strings inside of
URLs in this video I want to start with
server ok and server is just that it
holds information about not only the
server but file paths client info like
the clients browser that that's viewing
the web page the client IP address in a
lot of cases so what I want to do is
kind of do a little project where we
create a web page that tells us
information about the server and then
and also a little bit of information
about the client ok so instead of just
you know writing mindless code I want to
actually create something so let's go
ahead and open up our PHP sandbox I'm
going to create a new folder called
website two and inside here we're going
to create a file and save it as index
dot PHP this is where we'll have our
markup and then I just want another file
that we'll save as server will say
server - info dot PHP ok and what I want
to do is create an associative array for
the server intro and also one for the
client info and then we'll display it in
a nice web page and we'll even use
Twitter bootstrap ok so let's go ahead
and go into server info and create our
PHP tags I'm actually going to create at
the top well know we're going to need
the bottom as well ok and then this is
going to be on the server
server superglobal okay now notice with
the superglobals they all begin with
folks up for Global's they begin with
money sign underscore and then whatever
that variable is alright so what we're
going to do is create an array they
create server array and then we're also
going to create any client array okay so
it's just going to be an array with the
different values and the superglobal so
let's call this server and when I set it
to just a set of brackets for an array
and it's going to be an associative
array meaning that we're going to define
the key and the value okay now if we
click over here on server should tell us
the different values we can use all
right so let's take for instance server
name this gives us the name of the
server host under which the current
script is executing if the script is on
a virtual host this will be the value
defined for that virtual host so
basically it's the host server names so
let's go ahead and add a key here which
will be a string and we'll say host
server name alright and we're going to
set that to the server superglobal which
is an array and then we want server
underscore name okay so that should give
us the server name and then just to test
it out let's go ahead and just echo
server which is the name of our array
and then we want the host server name
okay so let's save that and then we'll
go to localhost / PHP sandbox /c website
- slash server info dot PHP and it gives
us a localhost
okay that's what we have for our host
server name alright so next one I want
to do is see
let's do HTTP host which is the contents
of host header from current request if
there is one so I believe in this case
it's also going to be localhost but
let's say host header and set that to
server host on the school header ok and
then we can change this to host header
let's see what that gives us
undefined index host header I'm sorry
not host header HTTP underscore host
okay so that's also localhost alright so
let's look at see I'm not going to do
all these some of these won't even work
in my case let's look at server software
where is that right here server
identification string given in the
header is when responding to requests so
this will basically tell us what the
server is running so let's go ahead and
add server software and set that to
oops I don't like that server underscore
software and let go that out okay save
that and tells us reusing Apache 2.4
point 25 windows 32 and we're using open
SSL and PHP 7.1.1 ok so that's what that
does just tells you what kind of server
you're running OS things like that next
thing we want to know and this is
something that you'll probably use a lot
is your document root ok so the root of
your web server so let's set that to
server document underscore root ok and
what we can do here is instead of you
know putting out each individual one we
can actually do a print our and let's
just look at the whole server array that
we're creating created ok so now you can
see that document root is see slash
xampp slash htdocs and if you are using
xampp most likely it'll be the same
thing all right so let's the next one I
want to do is the current page and we
can get that you can get that with PHP
self so PHP underscore self and a lot of
times when you're submitting forms if
you want to submit to the same page
you're on you can put this as as the
action alright so let's go ahead and
reload and now you'll see current page
is in PHP sandbox web site - and then
server info dot PHP alright another one
we have is the script name and some of
these may be the same in in some cases
we'll say server strip name we'll see
that that is actually the same thing as
well
okay gives us the location of the
current script now if you want the
absolute path because right here we just
were going from htdocs but if you want
the absolute path you can do that as
well okay absolute path and set that to
server and this is going to be script
underscore file name
okay let's reload that and you can see
we get from C Drive all the way to our
current script all right so that gives
us all the server information not all of
it I mean there are some other things
here you can add you can go ahead and
experiment but I don't want to put every
single one in now for the client array
go ahead and comment that out we're
going to set client equal to some
brackets and first of all I'm going to
do is we want to get the system info but
the client using so it's the client
system info and let's set that to our
server and we can get this with HTTP
underscore user underscore agent all
right and then let's do a print our for
our client Garre okay so client system
info now this different manufacturer
manufacturers have different strings for
this I'm not exactly sure why it says
Mozilla and Crowe in here but if you
look at Crowe it says 50 version 56 dot
0 dot dot - 92 4.87 and if I go to what
say
help and about you'll see that that is
in fact what I'm using okay it also says
windows 64-bit which is what I'm on i'm
not sure why safari in mozilla are in
here i don't use this very much but you
can use it as a fairly unreliable way to
tell what browser your clients are using
all right so in addition to that we can
do the client IP address it will take a
client IP and let's get to server
underscore I'm sorry server and then
remote underscore addr all right so
let's save that and that's going to just
give me this colon colon one I'm
actually on the same machine as my
server so that's not going to work
but generally this will return the users
IP address okay you can also get the
remote port so let's say remote support
and set that to server and then remote
port okay and you can see that remote
port from for this for me is six to
seven three four alright so what I want
to do now is comment this out and we're
going to go to our index.php page and
build out a web page and include some of
this info so let's put in our basic HTML
tags for the titles and system info and
then I'm going to include bootstrap so
I'm going to go to bootstrap dot
bootstraps cbn.com and just grab this
link here which is the CSS file
all right so say a truss and paste that
in okay and so we shouldn't need
anything else in the head so now in the
body well actually we do need to bring
our server info file and so appeal to a
PHP include which we've already gone
older and we're going to include server
- info dot PHP okay and then down here
let's add a div and give it a class of
container which is a bootstrap class
just pushes everything in the middle
okay and then let's put an h1 anal space
server the server and file info and
under that what we're going to do is is
test for the server to make sure it's
there this variable now I haven't gone
over this yet but there's actually a
shorthand peach shorthand PHP if syntax
or not just yes but for loops or each
all that stuff so what we can do is we
can say PHP if server instead of you
know opening it here closing the tag and
then doing it down for the closing
bracket what we can do is just use a
colon here and go like that and then
down here say PHP and if okay so it's a
this is a better way to do it if you're
actually inside of an HTML if you're
inside HTML markup okay so if there's a
server then let's put a UL here and
we'll give it a class of list group all
right and then what we want to do is
loop through each value in the server
array and one output not only the value
but also the key okay so let's do for
each
so for each and we're going to we're
going to use the key in the value so
we'll say for each server value as and
then the key and then also the value and
we can also use that shorthand syntax
here as well so down here we can say PHP
and for each okay and then for each
value we have we want an Li I'm going to
give this a class of whist group item
and inside here let's see let's do the
key and the value I'm going to put the
key inside of strong tags off okay so
let's go and say PHP echo T let's echo
key and then we put a colon in a space
and then after the strong tag let's do
PHP echo value and that should do it so
let's save that and then we're going to
go to local host PHP sandbox slash
website to can get rid of that server
info file and there we go server and
file info we have the server name the
host header the software the document
root the current page that we're on the
script name that we're on and then the
absolute path of the page that we're on
okay so pretty handy now we want to do
the same thing with the client stuff so
let's just copy from this h1 to the end
if and we'll just paste that in and
let's say client info and then we'll
test for the client variable and then we
just want to loop through the array
that's in the client variable and
everything else should stay the same so
we'll save that reload and there's our
client info alright so that's it that's
the server superglobal and we were able
to create a nice little script
there that tells us the information on
the server as well as what we can on the
client okay so hopefully you guys like
this our next few videos are going to be
on different superglobals for instance
form processing I'll show you how does
how to pass along queries and URL things
like that all right so thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
