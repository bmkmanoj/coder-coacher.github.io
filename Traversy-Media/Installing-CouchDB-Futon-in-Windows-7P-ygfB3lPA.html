you how to set up couchdb on a Windows
machine
alright so CouchDB is a no SQL database
and it is document orientated alright so
it uses JSON documents so if you
understand if you know and understand
the JSON syntax then you should have no
problem using something like couch
alright and if you've used something
like MongoDB it's pretty similar to that
ok so what you want to do is go to couch
DB dot Apache dot org slash download and
you have a couple different options here
for Mac Linux we're gonna choose the
windows option
alright so that's gonna give us a
Windows install that we can download so
we're gonna go ahead and do that alright
so let's go ahead and open that ok just
a simple Windows installer just accept
everything click Next you know the drill
so it's telling me that the folder
already exists alright you guys
shouldn't have this problem I'm just
gonna go ahead and fix this real quick
alright so that should be all set that
was just from a previous installation on
this machine alright so we have the
option to install couchdb as a Windows
service all right so you'll most likely
want to do this so that you don't have
to go and manually run and stop it it'll
just run in the background alright so
I'm gonna keep those checked click
install
all right so that should be it I'm not
gonna view the readme let's just click
finish all right so now if we go to our
Windows search here and search for
CouchDB you should have this Start
CouchDB file if we click that it's gonna
go ahead and start the service if it
wasn't already running all right now we
can verify that CouchDB is installed and
running if we go to localhost and you
want to go to port 5 9 8 4 and then we
want to say slash underscore utils
alright and that's gonna open this
interface all right so this is futon so
from here we can manage our database and
we can manage individual CouchDB
documents so for instance we can create
a new database and let's call it
customers create alright so now we have
a brand new database if we want to add a
document we can click new document and
it's gonna assign us in ID which will
have the field underscore ID all right
so if we click this little check mark we
can save that and if we want to add
another field let's say we want
first-name and we can add that here
last name alright and let's create one
more and we'll just do our email alright
so that's how we can add fields and now
if we click save document now you can
see we have a customer document now if
you're not familiar with no SQL
databases this is much like a column in
a relational database if we want to see
the actual document itself we can click
source and you can see it's formatted as
Jason alright so we'll go back to
customers and you can see we now have
one document now you may want to make
this this Futon interface more secure
because right now anyone can go to it so
if you look down here in the corner we
have it says welcome to admin party
everyone is admin and fix this we click
to fix this
it's gonna ask us to create a username
and password alright so click create and
now down here you can see it says
welcome and then your username and you
can choose to change your password log
out or set up more admins alright so
let's go ahead and log out now we can
still access it because we're on the
local machine alright so if we were to
go to this but on another machine it
would prompt us for our username and
password alright in addition to what
we've already seen over here on the side
we have tools in overview is going to
just show us the different databases we
can go to our configuration we can see
the different configuration values and
we can easily edit them if we need to
replicator now I'm not gonna go into
this but basically if you want to
replicate a database from either this
machine or another one
you can do so with the replicator status
is going to tell us if we have any tasks
running or not documentation we have the
manual Diagnostics Diagnostics
if you want to verify your installation
we can go ahead and do that says our
installation looks fine and just recent
databases that we've created all right
so I'm not going to go too far into it I
just wanted to show you guys how to set
it up and how to access futon I will be
doing another video showing you how we
can connect to it through a web
application and I'll try to get to that
soon alright so if you liked the video
please give it a like subscribe whatever
you can do is fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
