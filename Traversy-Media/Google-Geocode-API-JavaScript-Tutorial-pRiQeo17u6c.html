video on the Google Maps API and a lot
of you guys really like that and it gave
me some good feedback so what I'm going
to do now is go over the geocoding API
which allows us to basically take an
address like a street address and then
send a request to to the API and then
get back the latitude and longitude the
the country the county basically all of
any address info or any location info
associated with that address all right
so that's we'll be doing in this video
let's get started this video is
sponsored by dev Mountain if you're
interested in learning web development
iOS or UX design dev Mountain is a
12-week design and development boot camp
intended to get you a full-time job in
the industry to learn more visit dev
mountain comm or click the link in the
description below alright so the setup
for this video is going to be similar to
the Google Maps API video we need to
register an API key so that we can make
requests ok so this is the documentation
for geocoding and if we look right here
this is the URL that we need to make the
request to so it's Maps API Geo codes
last JSON and then you'll see this is an
address parameter and in this case
you're looking up 1,600 amphitheatre
Parkway Mountain View California and
then you need to attach your API key so
let's go ahead and create that first so
you need to go to the console
developers.google.com/maps project and I
have that selected and then I'm going to
say enable API and we're going to want
to go to Google Maps API s and then
click more and you'll see that there's a
geocoding API so we want to click on
that and then we just want to enable it
and then once we do that we should be
able to get our credentials so let's say
create credentials and we want to see to
click that and then it should give us an
API key right here so we're going to
click done and then we have that in our
console we can come back to that in
so as far as our project set up all
you're going to need is one HTML file so
I have a folder called my geo code with
one file called index.html so I'm going
to open that up and I'm using atom for
my text editor you can use whatever you
want I'm also using Emmet and let me
just go to settings to show you if you
want to install that and it kind of
makes things easier as far as HTML tags
if you want you can just search for
Emmet and click packages and that should
come up this first one you just want to
install that I'm also going to be using
atom live server so search for atom live
server and click packages and it's this
one here by jazz Chen okay and that's
just going to allow us to open that HTML
file on our localhost on a cert on a
specific port alright so let's go ahead
and while I have this open I'm going to
go to packages Adam live server it's
actually running I'm going to stop it
and then I'm going to restart it alright
and like I said you don't need to have
this you can just open index.html
alright you'll see it's running on my
loopback address on my localhost
alright so now what we're going to do is
I'm going to use Emmet to put in some
basic HTML structure so just exclamation
tab and it's going to give us our
doctype our head body tags all that
stuff and then in a title let's just say
I will say my geocode app alright and
then let's see we're going to want to
I'm actually going to open up the
documentation again see I have a ton of
stuff open here there we go alright so
before we get into our actual project
let's take a look at our response so if
we send a request to this right here
it's going to give us something that
looks like this okay which is a results
array that has an address components
array and if we look in here we have
excuse me we have a bunch of different
objects and each one has a long
name a short name and then types all
right now types is just data see it's
the type of component for instance this
is the street number type which is also
in an array because some have more than
one type alright then we have a short
name and a long name in some cases
they're the same there's no short way to
say 1,600 so that's the street number if
you look here we have the route type
which is actually the street name and
then we have this locality political
this is the city okay they have some
really strange names and if we look here
we have administrative area level 2
which is the county name I really don't
like the way that they respond with the
response that comes back and the types
and stuff but I guess there's a reason
for it because you know some places have
regions some have States so they can't
just say state all right because it's
not exclusive to the US or somewhere
else that has States and then we also
have the formatted address which is the
complete address written out so even if
we said you know if we search for just
1,600 ampitheatre parkway Mountain View
this will come back with the state with
the zip code and the country and all
that stuff all right then we have
geometry which has the latitude and
longitude values okay so we can get all
of this info and then we're going to
insert it into our web page all right
you can also do reverse geocoding which
I'll probably do in another video where
you can actually put the latitude and
longitude and then get the city and all
that stuff back okay now before we get
into writing our JavaScript to make the
request I just want to show you an
example through something called postman
so I'm going to just search for postman
chrome because it is a Chrome extension
I believe it's also for Firefox as well
I already have installed now you don't
have to do this you can just watch but
if you want you can download it and just
launch it and what we can do is just
grab from the documentation we'll grab
that entire URL here
and then copy that and bring it over to
postman and make sure that this is get
because we want to make a get request
and then we'll paste that in we're going
to need our API key so we'll grab that
and let's just go ahead and replace that
and let's say send and you'll see that
we get a response that looks very
similar to the documentation response
formatted address geometry address
components so we want to mimic this same
thing in our JavaScript now this is in
this API is not dedicated to JavaScript
you can you could use any language or
any framework as long as you can make
HTTP requests you could use Django or
PHP frameworks laravel anything that you
can make a request with now as far as
making the request through our
application we're going to use something
called Axios okay now you don't have to
use this you could use you know standard
JavaScript which is kind of long and
drawn-out to make an AJAX request you
could use es6 promises you could use
jQuery but I think that this is one of
the easier ways to do it okay so if we
go down here you can install it with NPM
but I don't want to do that I want to
keep this very basic we're just going to
include the script tag and then we'll be
able to say Axios get to make a get
request put in that URL along with the
address and we'll get a response and
then we can take that response and we
can format it so that we can insert it
right into our web page all right so
that's what we'll be doing so let's grab
the script tag right here and go back to
our application and we're just going to
paste that in right here now I'm also
going to use bootstrap 4 so I'm going to
just search for bootstrap for CDN and if
you've never used bootstrap 4 don't
worry about it we're just using a couple
things we're going to use the let the
list group which is the same syntax as
bootstrap 3 we're also going to use
cards all right and then just a simple
form so I'm going to grab the CDN right
here and copy that and then we'll bring
that into our application as well let's
put that right here
okay and then we should be all set as
far as as far as the head info so before
we get into creating our form and all
that we're going to just start with the
JavaScript just to make a request we'll
hard-code the location and make sure
that everything comes back okay so let's
go ahead and put in our script tag at
the bottom alright and we're going to
create a function here called geo code
okay and I'm just calling that you can
call it whatever you'd like and then
from here we're going to make our quest
alright so we're going to use Axios so
since we included that script tag we can
just use Axios and we can say dot get
and then inside here is where we want to
put the URL so let's go and grab that
copy it and we'll go back and let's
paste in actually you know what we only
want we only want up to the question
mark because address and all that depth
those are parameters we just want this
URL right here okay and we're going to
put that in right here and then what
we're going to do is have a second
parameter which will be an object of
parameters okay and it has to be in
params like that okay so this is going
to take the actual address or location
and what I'm going to do is put in let's
see I don't want to do this yeah let's
let's go inside the geo code function
above the get request and I'm just going
to create a variable called location and
for now we're going to hard-code that so
let's just set it to I will say 22 Main
Street
Boston Mass alright and then inside
address we're just going to say location
and then we just want to also put our
API key so I'm going to grab that let's
copy that and we're going to put in key
and then just paste that in okay now
what we want to do here is get rid of
the semicolon and then just do dot then
okay and then this is going to take in a
function that will give us that or the
response from that request so we just
want to pass in response and then if
there's an error we can do dot catch
that will take in a function as well
that'll take in an error if there is one
okay and you can handle that how you
want I'm just going to console.log it
okay and then for now we're just going
to console.log our response to see what
it gives us okay now we just created the
function we haven't called it yet so
let's just go right above it and we'll
say call geocode and let's go ahead and
save it and then I'm going to just open
up the application you just bring that
over okay and open up the console here
with f12 and you can already see that we
got an object back so if we look at that
what we're going to be concerned with
here is data
so inside data we have the results now
results is an array and we're always
going to get the first one which is
going to be at 0 and then inside there
is where we have our address components
which is also an array so you can see we
have the if we look in types this is the
street number we get 22 back because
it's 22 Main Street this one here is the
street name you'll see four types we
have route it's not actually called
street name and we have Charlestown
which is the neighborhood okay so
neighborhood or political I'm not sure
yeah I guess Main Street is in
Charlestown which is kind of like a like
a subset of
and then in here and you're not always
going to get the neighborhood back
because you know most places small towns
they don't have the they don't have
specific neighborhoods like that and
then if we look down here we get the
formatted address we get the geometry
which has the latitude and longitude so
we're getting what we need back so let's
go back to our application and what I
want to do is start to take that
information and create some output so
that we can put it into our web page
all right so in here inside the dot then
is where we're going to be working so
let's just put a comment here and we'll
just say log will say log full response
and then underneath that we're going to
start to format things so let's say
format or formatted address so we're
going to grab that now I'm just going to
console.log to make sure we can get it
correctly so what we'll do is take that
response and then remember we're going
to look in data we kind of want to look
at the structure here so data results
the first the first one in that array
and then format it address okay so you
need to kind of match that structure so
response data results that's an array we
want the first one in there and then we
want the formatted address okay so if we
save that it reloads and we get the
exact formatted address all right now we
want to output that on to the screen so
let's go ahead and do you type so much
so much stuff old in here close that up
and then let's put that into a variable
so we'll say formatted address set it to
that
okay and then we're going to want to
create the output to put in the web page
so I'm going to create another variable
called formatted address output and for
that now instead of using single quotes
we're going to use backticks because
this allows us to create a template
string and we can use multiple lines now
for each area the formatted address the
address component in the geometry we're
going to create a ul a list group
alright so in here let's say ul ok and
this is a bootstrap class of Lists group
alright and then inside here we'll have
our Li tag and that will have a class of
list group item okay now the way that we
can use variables inside the template
string is with a money sign and then
some curly braces and all we want to put
in here is that formatted address
alright just like that so we have the
output now down here we're going to
actually output to app ok so we want to
create a div inside the body here too to
kind of be a placeholder for that so
let's say div and I'm going to give it
an ID of formatted - address and then
tab okay that's Emmet that's how I could
do that with the tab and then down here
let's grab that with document dot get
element by ID and the ID is formatted
address okay and what I'll do here is
just say at the end dot inner HTML and
then we'll set that to the formatted
address output okay
simple as that let's save it and reload
and there it is
alright now remember we're going to have
a form later on that we can actually you
know put in what we want but for now
we're just taking this
than address so let's go back and I just
want to wrap a container around
everything that kind of that pushes
everything into the middle this class
container is the bootstrap class even
have to use bootstrap but I figured I'd
make it look decent all right so if we
reload now it's pushed to the middle so
now we want to go to our address
components and do the same thing which
is a little different because address
components is an actual array this was
just a single object that we could
output with the array we're going to
have to loop through the components and
then output each one so it's going to be
a little different so we'll go right
here and let's say address components so
we'll create a variable here called
address components and we're going to
set that to response data results zero
dot a dress components all right and
again if we look at the the complete
response we're getting data results zero
address components which is an array so
what we want to do here is we're going
to loop through it and then we're going
to add each component to a list item so
let's start out by creating a variable
called address components output and
we're going to set that off by being
just a ul with the class of Lists group
okay and then we want to loop through
each one so we're going to use a for
loop which takes in a variable so
variable I we're going to set that
initially to zero then I'm going to say
as long as I is less than is less than
address component dot length and then
we're just going to increment by one
okay and then for each one we're going
to want to add two
this output variable so we'll say
address components output and we want to
append to this okay we don't want to
replace this ul we want to add to it so
we can do that with + equals now I'm
going to use a template string here
because I want to do multiple lines so I
use backticks
alright I didn't use backticks here I
use single quotes because it's only on
one line and we're not inserting any
variables into it so for this will have
an Li with a class of list group item
and then here what do we want we want
first of all the type I'm going to use
that as kind of the title of it of each
one so for that let's do our variable
and we can say address components and we
want whatever the current iteration is
so we want to use I right here which is
going to represent whatever one of these
were on so 0 1 2 3 and so on okay and
then we want to get the types so dot
types
now remember types is an array if we
look at it right here types is an array
and we want the first one so we're going
to say we need that 0 so right here
let's put in brackets and then 0 so that
will give us the types and I want that
to be inside of a strong tag to make
that bold all right and then we'll put a
colon here and then we want the actual
value now you can use long name or short
name I'm going to use long name so we
should be able to do address components
whatever the current iteration is and
then we want full name ok that should
work long name sorry not full name so
long name then we also want the closing
ul so we're going to go outside of this
loop and then
address components output and we want to
plus equal on to that just a closing ul
alright and that's the full output so
now we just need to create a div up here
just like we did for the formatted
address so it'll be a div with the ID of
address - components tab and down here
we're going to do the same thing just
grab that document.getelementbyid d it's
going to be address components in our
HTML will be address components output
ok let's save that and go back cannot
read property length of undefined so see
it's talking about right here address
components length when they do wrong oh
I used a camel case right here the
response is actually address underscore
components so it didn't know what that
was so let's go ahead and save that and
there we go
so now we have this ul with all that
stuff we have the type as the kind of a
key I guess and then the value as the
value all right
and no matter no matter what it's going
to even if there's no for instance that
there's no neighborhood if we just put
Boston Mass if there's no neighborhood
it's just not going to show up here ok
because it's looping through when it's
only going to output what it finds so
let's go back and let's see you know
what I want to do is just wrap each one
of these each section the formatted
address the components I want to put
those inside of a card which is just a
bootstrap element alright so up here
where we have our divs let's just add on
to that class
called card block okay which is kind of
like a well in bootstrap 3 save that and
then it just kind of separates them so
now the last thing we want down here is
the geometry the latitude and longitude
so let's go back and we might as well
just add that div here now so this will
be ID geometry and then we'll go down
just like we did right here I'll
actually just copy this and then this
will be geometry and let's see whether
they set that variable as so we're going
to grab the latitude and the longitude
so we'll save our lat and remember
that's going to be in dot geometry and
just to show you data results zero
geometry location and then we have lat
and launched okay so that's what we're
grabbing so geometry dot location dot
lat
okay and then we'll grab the longitude
change that to LMG and change that to
LNG and then this is going to be
geometry output and then it's going to
be a ul but I do want to Allies one for
the latitude one for the longitude and
I'm just going to add in a label for
them both so strong
latitude okay and then this right here
we'll just put in the lat variable and
then we'll copy that and then this one
will be longitude and that'll be the LNG
okay and then we just we need to output
it like we did the rest of these
so that'll be geometry and then we're
going to output the geometry output
variable so let's save that and now we
have latitude and longitude so we're
grabbing all of the address info and
we're outputting it now if I were to
change the location that we're looking
at let's just change it to let's just
adjust the word Boston and it'll still
get us some stuff so if we save it and
you'll see it gets to look the city name
it gets the county the state the country
and the latitude and longitude all right
now just imagine what we did in the last
video with the Google Maps remember we
had to put in the latitude and longitude
to put a marker on the map
so we could make it so that we could
just add a simple city name and then get
the latitude and longitude and put that
into our Google map application and mark
it on the screen okay which which is
kind of cool maybe might be something
that I'll look into doing all right now
let's make it so that we can actually
change this inside of a form so we're
going to go and go up here we're going
to create we just look at the HTML here
so we're going to put in first of all on
h2 and I'm going to give that an ID of
text - center because I want it centered
on the screen and we're going to say
enter location all right and then under
that we're going to have a form and
we're going to give that an ID of
location form no action no okay and then
in here we're going to have an input so
I'm going to do input we're going to
give that an ID of when I put location
input
okay so type text' ID location input
let's also put a class in here and we're
going to give it a bootstrap class of
form control and then also form control
- LG and then we just need our button so
I'm going to put a line break and then
we'll put in our button and let's give
that button an ID let's see an ID
actually it doesn't need an ID so let's
just say submit okay we're going to give
it a type of submit and we're also going
to give it a class of BTN BTN primary
which is a bootstrap class and BTN block
which will make it a block level element
so that it stretches all the way across
alright so let's take a look at that so
that's good to see so now what we want
to do is basically create an event for
when we submit this form okay and we're
just using plain JavaScript I'm not
going to use jQuery or anything I don't
want to bloat this up so let's go to see
down to our JavaScript and we don't want
to run geocode right away because we
want to be able to submit the form and
then run it so I'm going to comment that
out for now so for good actually and
then let's say get location form so for
that we can do create a variable called
location form and set it to document dot
get element by ID and as an idea of
location form now we want to do is we
want to listen for a submission so let's
say listen for submit we're going to
take that location form and we're going
to add an event listener to it
all right and the event we want to
listen for is a submit event okay now
when that's submitted we want to run the
geocode function okay now if I save that
and we go and submit you'll see it kind
of just blinks and the reason for that
is because when you submit a form and
actually tried to submit it to a web
page and we don't want that we want to
kind of catch the submission first so to
do that we can pass in an event
parameter to geocode and then we can
let's say prevent actual submit and we
can just do a dot prevent default
okay so let's save that and now when we
click Submit it works now it's always
getting Boston so we want to change that
so what we'll do is we're going to catch
what's submitted in that input box okay
so instead of setting this just you know
to a string called Boston we're going to
set it to document dot get element by D
and remember that input has an idea of
location - input now if you want to get
an actual value from an input field then
you want to do dot value or else it's
just going to get you this the input tag
so let's go ahead and save that now go
back and let's enter I will say McLuhan
MA
so I'm going mass of MIT and there we go
so it gives us all kinds of information
the city name the county the state
latitude and longitude let's say we want
ten school streets
Amesbury mass submit and it gives us all
of that info so the school the street
name street number gives us the postcode
even though we didn't enter that in here
it's still going to give us that address
info so it's an excellent way to format
an address if you have someone at your
website or your application
and you want them to enter their address
there's no telling what they're going to
do they could leave off the zip code
they could leave off the state anything
like that and this makes it so that it
actually formats it correctly and puts
it into your database for example so
that's another reason to use geo code
it's not just to get the latitude and
longitude from an address although that
is uh you know that's the main use for
it alright so I hope you guys liked this
project and we might do something later
on where we combine this with the app
the map application that we built or
maybe you could you know take a look at
it as kind of like homework and do it
yourself and try to figure it out
alright so thanks for watching guys
please subscribe if you're not please
follow me in social media and I will see
