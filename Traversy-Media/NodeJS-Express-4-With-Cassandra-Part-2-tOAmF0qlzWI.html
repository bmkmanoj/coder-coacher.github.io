Express Cassandra application video in
this well in the last video we got
everything installed we installed node
we installed Apache Cassandra and also
we'd saw get along with the command line
interface so what I want to do in this
video is I wanted to set up our initial
database along with the tables we're
actually only going to have one table
but before we do that I just want to
kind of go into what the Cassandra's
data structure because I realize that
some of you may not even know what
Cassandra is and it's basically a no SQL
database but it it differs from things
like MongoDB or CouchDB it's not a
document database it's actually a column
family database which uses properties
from a key value store as well so it's
kind of unique basically it does have
tables or columns you can call them and
very similar to a relational database in
terms of how it looks but it's actually
very different when you look at the
backend and what goes on but basically
we're going to obviously start with a
database alright and that database needs
to have at least one key space and
that's basically equivalent to a schema
if you are talking about relational
databases so we're going to name our key
space people all right and then inside
the key space we're going to have a
table or tables and these are also
called
columns okay so we are actually only
going to have one column or table and
just for simplicity I'm going to just
call it a table from now on okay so
we're gonna have a subscribers table and
inside the table we're going to specify
the fields that we want alright and well
right now what I want to do is just have
a first name last name and email but I
actually we need an ID as well and fresh
name last name email will all be text
fields the ID however is going to be a
UUID field okay so it's gonna be a uu ID
which is basically a it's a long string
and it's just a unique it's unique
identification it's a unique ID so that
we can pull the the correct rows that we
want and we're not going to manually
type these in we can actually use a
generator that will generate these for
us all right so let's go ahead and get
started we're going to use the cql shell
that came with the with the data stacks
package if you don't have this please go
back to the first video and just
download and install all this software
all right so we are now in the cql shelf
and one keyword that i want to show you
is described okay so you can describe
tables key spaces pretty much any object
and I'm just gonna say describe key
spaces okay and by default you'll see
should see these three key spaces we
have system system traces and then the
OP Center program which is the GUI the
browser GUI program also has its own key
space okay now what we want to do is
create a key space and like I said we're
going to call this people now we also
need to specify replication values
because Cassandra is used often for just
huge amounts of data sometimes spanning
across multiple data centers so you just
need to specify how many nodes you want
for replication and you also need to
specify the class all right and how we
do that is say with replication equals
and then in here we need a class and
basically there's two classes we can
choose from one the one that we're going
to use is simple strategy all right and
this is used for typically if you have a
single node or you have a single data
center you would use this the other one
is called network topology strategy and
that's what you would use for if you're
using multiple data centers and you just
have a huge amount of data all right so
that's the class and then the next thing
we need to specify is the replication
factor and that that basically means how
many nodes you want to designate for
replication and I'm just going to put
three although it really doesn't matter
for us okay so let's see what happened
here
unable to find strategy class what do
they do here
hmm
oh you know what this the simple
strategy has to needs a capital S here
alright so there we go so now if we go
back and say describe key spaces you can
now see that we have the people key
space now if we want to use it we need
to say use people and now you can see
that this prompt here has changed to
people all right now cql is extremely
similar to and in most cases identical
to SQL alright so you can see we can say
select all from and then a table we can
do that okay so let's go ahead and
create a table and again just like SQL
we're going to say create table and I'm
going to call this subscribers and we
need to specify the fields that we want
alright so the first one is gonna be an
ID and it's going to have the it's going
to be the UUID type alright and then the
next one will be
let's do email and that'll be text and
then we'll do first name which will be
text
last name also text and we'll just leave
it at that
alright so now we need to specify our
primary keys so it's a primary key and
ID okay I'm gonna put an ID now the way
that this works is quite different than
a relational database if you want to be
able to sort by a certain field or let's
say use it in an update or anything like
that then it needs to be defined as a
primary key so you can have more than
one primary key in this case I want I'm
going to use email as well so I'm gonna
put that in there
okay so we'll run that and now we should
have that table you say describe tables
okay so now you can see we have our
subscribers table so let's go ahead and
insert some data so we'll say insert
into subscribers and then we need our
fields so we'll have
the ID and then we'll have email and
then first name and last name okay and
then we're gonna say values so you can
see pretty much the same thing as SQL
values for the ID now this is going to
be a UUID so it's gonna be this long
ugly looking string of characters and we
don't want to do this manually so we
does a few functions that we can use one
of them is the now function so I'm going
to say now and then some parentheses and
that's gonna generate a type one UUID
for us all right next we have the email
so we're just gonna have to think of an
email just say user one at gmail.com and
next is the first name and say John okay
last name will say Doe okay so that
should work
alright so if we get no errors back
that's usually a good thing but now we
can say select all from subscribers and
there we go and you can see the ID is
this is a UUID and it was generated by
that now function and then you can see
we have our email first name and last
name alright
now I want to go ahead and insert some
more subscribers here see and I want to
show you how you can do a batch okay so
we can do more than one query at one
time so we could say begin batch and we
don't want to semicolon just click enter
because that'll bring us to a new line
and we'll say inserts into subscribers
and we need ID
first name last name and then we want
our values a values will be again we're
going to use the now function and then
we'll stay for email user two at say
yahoo.com make sure that you use quotes
if you're using strings let's see what
else do we get first name I will say Bob
and then last name
we'll say Johnson okay so that's one now
without a semicolon I'm going to click
enter again and we can do our next one
so insert into subscribers
I apologize I'm not the fastest typer in
the world let's say ID email first name
last name and if we got a quote here
actually what am i doing we don't need
quotes here and he quotes for the values
not these alright so we're gonna have ID
email first name last name let's see
what else
values so for values we're going to use
them now for the ID we're gonna use
let's say user 3 at yahoo.com say
william smith alright and that's good so
without the semicolon then click enter
again and then what we want to do is
apply a batch semicolon alright so that
should have ran so now if we go and we
select all from subscribers now we have
three users alright now we can we can
add a where clause so let's try to do
select let's say select first name last
name from
subscribers we're female is equal to
user - that's what do we have yahoo
yahoo.com
I let's involve data filtering but okay
so what we need to do here is just tack
on allow filtering at the end here
okay and now it gives us the first name
and last name of the person with the
email that we chose now one thing that I
should mention is that I don't I believe
that if you want to add a where clause I
think that this field has to be a key a
primary key I'm not positive so let me
just try something actually I think it's
only inserts that that's true for but
let's try to we'll say where first-name
is equal to
Bob
okay so no index column present and by
columns clause with equal operator all
right so basically you really have to
plan out your database and your schema
according to the queries that you want
you you're gonna want to run and I think
it's a it's kind of a fallback for
Cassandra because it does add in some
extra work and some frustration if you
for instance didn't make a feel the
primary key that you should have but it
makes up for that in other ways
extremely scalable really fast can
handle huge amounts of data things like
that so we have a couple subscribers in
our database it's our key space has been
created so I think I'm going to stop
here because the video is getting kind
of long and in the next video what we'll
do is we'll get nodes set up will
install Express which is going to be the
the framework that we'll be using
it'll generate our initial files and
folders for us so yeah we'll be doing
that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
