video we're gonna take a look at a
JavaScript animation engine called
anomie and this can be used for pretty
much any kind of animation it uses CSS
properties it uses Dom element and Dom
attributes it uses SVG anything you can
think of you can add animations to
alright so this is the site here anomie
j/s this is the home page and if we
click on the github button this is this
is the documentation you can see you can
do cool things like this we're not going
to get into anything extravagant I just
want to introduce you to the library and
I'm gonna show you how we can how we can
do a few things but yeah this is the the
API documentation you can see you can
use just CSS properties which is mostly
what we're gonna do we're gonna use some
transforms just to move things around
you can use object properties Dom
attributes SVG attributes and you can
animate shapes and images and even text
you can create progress bars so there's
a lot you can do you might want to look
at this documentation but what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna build this
right here which is not anything special
but the way that we're gonna create it
it's going to show you how to put
together projects and maybe you can
create something on your own so we
basically just have some squares here
these are just divs with different color
backgrounds and we have a play button if
I go ahead and click play it's gonna
start the animation which is basically
just going to take each square bring it
down rotate it and each one is on a
delay so that it goes one after another
all right and then what's really cool
about this is we can pause it anywhere
okay we can pause it midway through and
you'll see that it'll just stop okay if
I click play it'll just continue where
it left off so we can pause and we can
play alright and it's set on it's set to
loop but you can set it so that the
animation just runs once if you want but
I said it I have it on a loop so that's
what we're going to be creating we're
gonna get into a little bit of CSS a
little bit of styling we're
gonna do that most of that until the end
though because I really want to just
focus on the library all right so that's
what we'll be doing this video guys
hopefully like it and let's get started
so if you guys really enjoy my content
you feel like you really get something
out of it consider becoming a patron to
push me to keep bringing you
high-quality educational videos showing
your support with even $1.00 means the
world we have different perks and tiers
including a $2 tier that'll give you
every udemy course that I release
absolutely free to learn more check out
patreon.com/scishow and in this icon and
search for it and install it that'll
allow you to open up your files on your
localhost so what I'm gonna do is create
a project folder so I'm going to just
create a new folder in my projects
folder called enemy yeah enemy app
actually will call it and we'll open
that up in Visual Studio code and we're
gonna go ahead and create a couple files
so first of all we want an index dot
HTML okay we also want a style dot CSS
and we want a main dot j/s alright so in
the index.html let's go ahead and put
some markup I'm using Emmet so I'm going
to just do exclamation tab and it's
going to give us a basic layout here
alright let me make this a little
smaller here so this is the
documentation I have open over here on
the right now let's go ahead and change
the title we'll just say and me app and
what we're gonna do is we're going to
just use the CDN to link it you can
install it with NPM and you can do all
that and you know you use webpack and
but I want to keep this really simple so
let's just search for an me CDN
and we'll grab it from CDN J s comm so
right here the current version is
version 2.0 0.2 so I'm going to copy the
script tag and we're just gonna put that
down right above the ending body tag
alright and then let's just link our
script file all right so we're gonna
link our main J s let's also be sure to
link our stylesheet up here oops
so we'll say link and it's gonna be
style dot CSS all right now if I want to
open this up in live server I can just
right click and say open with live
server all right and again if you guys
aren't using live server or a visual
studio code you can just open up the the
HTML file alright so what do we want to
do we want to add some markup first of
all so we're going to create a couple
dibs so let's go right in the body here
and let's create let's see we're gonna
do three divs or four divs with the ID
I'm sorry the class of box okay so I'm
using Emmet so I can just say dot box
and then I can actually do asterisk and
then four and then tab and it'll give me
four divs with the class of box all
right now each one I also want to give a
different class for different colors so
we'll have red we'll have blue green and
let's do yellow all right so we'll save
that obviously we're not going to see
anything over here because there's
there's nothing there's no text or
anything but we're gonna add some CSS
real quick so remember we have a class
of box so we're going to style that so
for our box class we're going to
position this to relative alright
because we want to be able to add we
want to be able to Anne to animate the
position we're going to set the the
initial width of 100 pixels let's also
set the height to 100
pixels alright and then we're gonna set
a margin of four pixels and we're gonna
set this to display as an inline block
so in line - block alright so that's the
actual box now if I save it we're still
not going to see anything because we
haven't added a color each color is
gonna be attached to its color class so
let's go ahead and do that so we'll say
dot red so red class will have a
background color obviously of red all
right so have red we'll have blue which
you'll have a color of blue
we'll have green and we'll have yellow
all right so let's go ahead and save and
now we have our boxes all right so we're
not going to do the controls the the
play/pause and all that we're gonna
we're not going to do that until the end
okay so what we need to do now is go
into our JavaScript and this is where we
want to create our anomie functions so
if we look at the documentation and we
go down we need to create an anim
function that takes in a configuration
object and you want to specify what the
target is what you want to animate and
like I said this can be a CSS selector
or a Dom element a node list and object
and array there's a lot of things that
you can do but we're going to be dealing
with CSS selectors okay so we want to
basically create an enemy function for
each box and then we want to add our
properties okay so things that we want
to animate you can see you can do like
background color you can basically
animate any CSS property opacity sizes
things like that you can also set
durations you can set rotations so let's
go ahead and do that let's add in our
first enemy function and the way that
we're gonna do this is I'm gonna create
a separate anomie function for each box
okay for each one of these at first and
then at the end I'm going to show you
how we can optimize it into just one
alright so at first it's gonna look like
you know it's going to violate the the
DRI principle don't repeat yourself but
at the end I'm going to show you how we
can optimize it so this is gonna take in
a targets okay so for the target it's
gonna be a div with the class of box and
we're gonna deal with the red box first
okay so it has a class of red alright
and then we're going to add in since we
want it to move down we want to use
translate but we want to use translate
why because we're dealing with the
y-axis okay the y-axis is up and down
the X is left and right in this example
right here they're doing X but what I'm
gonna do is copy this and paste that in
and let's change this to Y
okay now the reason that this is set to
an object with two of 202
I'm sorry an array with two objects is
because we want this to run twice we
want it to first go down okay and then
we want it to go back up so this value
here is the p' is the basically how far
we want it to go I want it to go 200 all
right and then I'm gonna set the
duration to 500 which is 500
milliseconds okay so half a second and
then we want it to go back to zero
actually first of all let's just run it
like that let's see what that does so if
we go over here and we save since I'm
using live server every time I save it's
gonna reload on its own so you can see
it just moved down okay so what we want
to do is go I'm just going to undo and
put that back because we wanted to go
back to 0 and we want the same duration
of 500 so let's save and you'll see that
when it reloads it goes down wait a
minute did I do that right
actually we want a duration of 800 to go
back up let's down up that seems fast
it's because we didn't have the return
rotation and yet but you can always
change this if you wanted to change this
to let's say 3 3000 which would be 3
seconds it'll go down take 3 seconds and
go we're back up in 8 800 milliseconds
all right but we're just going to keep
it like that all right so next thing we
want to do is I want to do a little
rotation so we're gonna add another
property here of rotate alright so for
the rotate we could just say one turn
actually this needs to be in quotes so
we could say one turn and save and
you'll see that it'll rotate alright
every time I reloaded it runs and it
rotates but I want to actually I want to
set an easing value on this easing is
just kind of the way that it starts and
stops you can have it start slow and
fast or start fast and slow things like
that so what we can do is we can
actually set this to an object with a
value so the value will be the same it's
gonna be one turn okay but we're also
going to set the it's the easing and
we're gonna set that to ease in out sign
so ease in out sign si and E and save
and you'll see that it just has it has a
little bit of a different effect all
right but that's what we want and all
this stuff is in the documentation let's
see so for instance yet right here are
easing so we have duration we have delay
okay we're going to be using some delays
as well elasticity so there's different
options that you can use yeah you can
get very advanced with this stuff but
I'm just trying to keep it simple but
that's our first animation for our first
box so what we're gonna do now is we're
going to Adam for add this this stuff
for the next box which is the blue one
so I'm gonna copy everything here and
we're gonna change this to div box blue
and let's save and see what happens
so what happens is the exact same thing
and it happens at the exact same time
which is not what I want I want the red
box to go first and then the blue box so
in order to do that we need to set a
delay so let's go to translate Y which
is where it brings it down and let's go
and in addition to the value in duration
let's set a delay all right now we want
if we say delay 500 let's see what that
does
okay so that's not gonna work because
it's 500 down but it's 800 up so it's
it's it's starting when this one gets
down and we don't want that we want this
to start when this one gets up so we're
gonna set the delay to a thousand
all right we're gonna go like that all
right so first one will go down that one
will go down actually you know what okay
so it still doesn't look right because
the turn the rotate turn is actually
happening at the same time as well so we
want to put a delay on that as well so
right here let's say delay we're gonna
do delay and we're gonna set that to
1,000 as well so let's save there we go
so that's the effect that I want okay so
let's do the same thing for the green
one so we'll go ahead and copy this and
we'll paste this in we'll say we want
the div with the the class of green all
right and this time we're gonna change
the delay to 2,000 because we need to
wait for the FERC for the green I mean
for the red and then for the blue so
we'll set that delay to 2,000 we're also
gonna set the turn delay - mm - a f---
the red green I mean red blue green good
so now we'll do the same with yellow so
we'll go ahead and paste that in and
we'll say yellow and we're gonna set the
delay to 3,000 on both the translate and
on the rotate and we'll save and there
we go so that's the effect that I want
so having all four of these is really
violating the don't repeat yourself
coding principle so what we can do if we
look at the documentation we can
actually set right here function based
property parameters so we can set a
function as a parameter and that's what
we want to do we want to do a delay just
like they're doing right here and that
will delay each one okay so instead of
having to do four different enemies we
can do one and it'll apply that delay to
each each each iteration I guess so what
we'll do is I'm going to just first of
all just copy one of these
and then I'm gonna comment all of these
out and I'm gonna leave them because I
want you guys to have them in the
resource files okay but then we're gonna
go down here we're gonna paste this in
and instead of saying div dot box dot
read instead of just targeting the red
box let's target all of them okay they
all have a class of box so if I go ahead
and I do that and I save it's gonna just
you know it's going to run it all at the
same time so what we want to do is we
want to add in down here we'll put a
comma and we're gonna say delay and
we're gonna set that to a function okay
and that function is going to take in
the element the iteration and then
another parameter which is what is this
parameter total targets all right so
what we have to do here is very simple
we're just going to return we're gonna
take each iteration and we're going to
multiply it by whatever the delay we
want so I'm going to say 1,000 the
reason I'm saying 1,000 is because
that's the amount of time for it to go
down and up okay so let's go ahead and
save that and then let's watch it and
there we go so it's doing the same thing
with this one anomie function or this
yeah this one anomie function rather
than having these all these different
ones okay so that that really cleans it
up so let's see that's the animation and
by the way you guys can can add any
property you want for instance if you
wanted to add like background color any
CSS property just make sure you use the
camel case you can't do background -
color like you wouldn't CSS but if you
wanted to set this to let's say black
and save you'll see that each time it
goes down it'll get set to black and
it's going to stay there unless of
course you make it go back to its
original color but you can set things
like
opacity so if you wanted to set that to
let's say 0.3 and save you'll see that
each time it goes down it'll it'll get
lighter will get transparent so just
mess around with this stuff you know I
mean what I'm building here is just an
example there's a lot more you can do
and I always encourage you guys to build
stuff on your own don't just don't just
watch my videos copy the code and that's
it think about it look at the
documentation figure out something to
build on your own and then share it with
share it in the comments you know any
links that I see in the comments that
are you know projects that you create
from you know from my video from my
tutorials I'll always approve those ok I
get a ton of spam links like to you know
look at my website and like service or
company and all that and I don't approve
those but any any kind of project you
guys build that's that's based on the
video I will approve all right so now
what we're gonna do is apply we want to
apply the buttons so we're gonna
actually edit the mark-up for this one
second what we're gonna do is go to the
HTML and we're actually going to wrap
all of these these box classes in a div
with the ID of boxes alright so we'll
say div ID boxes and we're gonna wrap
that around all of these okay and then
inside here we're gonna have another div
and we're going to give this an ID of B
of buttons BTN s alright and in here
we're gonna have our two buttons so
we'll say button this is gonna have a
class of play and we'll just say
actually I'm not going to put we're
gonna be using icons we're gonna use
font awesome for now I'll just say play
but I'm gonna get rid of it alright and
then we'll go ahead and copy that and
we'll have a button with the class of
paws
all right in fact let's let's grab font
awesome now so we're just gonna search
for font awesome CDN and we're just
gonna grab the link tag right here let's
copy that and put that right above our
link to our style sheet and we'll save
that and then for the icons instead of
putting play here we're gonna put an eye
tag with the class of FA okay font
awesome and then we also want the actual
icon class which is going to be FA -
play - circle all right so that's the
play button and then let's copy that and
for the pause sorry about that we're
gonna say FA - pause circle let me just
put this on vibrate alright and let's
see is that good for the yeah I think
that's that's good for the mock-up so
let's save that and it's gonna look like
this for now okay so what we want to do
next is let's do our styling okay before
we get to the actual JavaScript for the
buttons let's let's style some stuff
here so let's see four boxes and put the
ID of Bach actually we'll put this above
the class here so we'll say boxes and
we're gonna set the width here to 80%
I'm gonna set the margin Auto so this is
basically like a container set that to
auto and let's align to the center all
right I'll save that good now for the
buttons
remember the buttons ID goes around the
button both buttons so ID BTN s let's
set a padding of 20 pixels let's set a
background of light gray f4 three times
and let's set a margin bottom
margin bottom of 20 pixels and save
there we go and now for the buttons
themselves let's see
so we'll say ID BTN s and we want button
okay so this is this applies to both
buttons we're going to set the
background to white we're gonna set the
padding to 5 pixels on the top and
bottom 10 pixels on the left and right
and we're gonna set the border of the
button to zero all right we'll save that
good now we just want to make the icons
bigger and change their color so we're
gonna say I D BT NS remember those font
awesome icons they have a class of FA so
we're just gonna change the font size to
30 pixels save that and then I want to
style the color but each I want this one
to be green this one to be red so we
need to target the actual icon class so
again BTN s then we want FA - clay -
circle okay that's the play button and
we're just gonna set the color of that
to green and then let's copy that and
we'll set the FA paws circle we're gonna
set that one to read and save and there
we go
so that's pretty much our interface it's
not gonna work yet right now it's still
just gonna run when we reload the page
so what we're gonna do now is go back to
our JavaScript and let's see let me just
pull this up so what we need to do is is
we want to put this enemy function into
a variable okay so let's say var and
we're gonna call this play pause and
we're gonna set that equal to that enemy
function alright and then what we want
to do is we want to select each each of
these buttons and apply
an event okay now let's let's actually
set autoplay for this to false because
right now if I reload the page it just
it's gonna go automatically so there's
actually a property called autoplay okay
and we'll set that to false so that way
if I save and the page reloads it's not
gonna just automatically run alright now
we can actually fire off before we get
into any of the button clicks or
anything we can fire this off by taking
that play pause variable and saying dot
play okay that's part of the API so if
we save that it's gonna play okay and
then we also have play pause dot pause
which obviously isn't going to do
anything because it's not playing all
right
but what we're gonna do is set up some
events so let's say document dot and
we're going to use a query selector okay
so query selector and we want to grab in
the boxes ID we want to grab the play
button okay which has a class of play I
believe let me just check so button has
a class of play so that's what we want
to grab and then what we're going to do
is we're going to say dot on click and
we're gonna set that equal to what I
just showed you that play pause dot play
okay and play pause is coming from this
variable name okay if actually you know
it now we'll just leave we'll just leave
it at play pause but you can call it
whatever you want you call it boxes if
you want but we'll just leave that so
let's go ahead and save let's see why is
that playing automatically it shouldn't
be
on click equals Oh actually I'm running
it because I have the parentheses there
it should just be on click equals clay
pause dot play like that so then when we
click it then it runs all right and then
for the pause it's the same thing we'll
just copy this and we'll paste this in
and we're gonna choose the pause button
which class has a class of pause and
we're gonna call play pause dot pause
alright let's see on click of no why is
this no boxes dot pause let's take a
look over here and it's because I have a
class I have an uppercase P for the
class don't want that alright so now
let's try it let's press play pause and
there we go play again pause play good
now if you want it and you can see how
it just stops when it gets to the end if
you want it to keep looping all you have
to do is add a property of loop and set
that to true and then save and then if
we play it it should go all the way
through and then it should start again
there we go
and of course you can always pause it
and play it alright guys so that is it
that's our little animation script or
project hopefully you enjoyed it I know
it's not the most practical thing in the
world but hopefully it turned you on to
the enemy JavaScript animation engine
it's much better than using something
like jQuery you know it's it's a
specific library for that
so hopefully you liked it and that's it
leave a like subscribe follow me on
social media whatever you guys can do
join the discord server I appreciate all
that so thanks for watching and I will
see you next time hey guys I've just
created a new discord server that's open
to the public the goal is to have a
place where people can go
to help each other out for programming
issues as well as just a place to
discuss new ideas and get feedback I
also check in daily there's a channel to
request videos on YouTube and much more
