crash course and I realized that I
didn't have an introduction to Jason on
my channel and Jason is extremely
important in web development especially
if you're working with restful api s and
sending data back and forth it's pretty
much replaced XML in that area now I
know a lot of you already understand
Jason but I do have a bunch of
subscribers that are just getting into
JavaScript and programming in general so
this is geared more towards more towards
them but feel free to watch this as kind
of a refresher all right so we're going
to take a look at some slides and then
we'll jump in and we'll start to work
with JavaScript objects and Jason so
what is Jason it stands for JavaScript
object notation and it's essentially a
lightweight data interchange format and
it's used to send data back and forth to
a server as text it's actually based on
JavaScript object literals so if you use
JavaScript in the past you may have
worked with something that resembles
Jason already if you've never written or
even heard of Jason before I think after
you watch this you'll be quite surprised
at how easy it is to understand and read
and write so as I said Jason has
arguably replaced XML and it's often
used with Ajax which is that which
actually stands for asynchronous
JavaScript and XML so it's a little
ironic that Ajax now uses Jason more
than it does XML which is actually in
its name and if you don't know what Ajax
is used for it's used to send data back
and forth from client and server without
having to refresh the page in a browser
and later on I'm going to show you how
we can make an AJAX request to a JSON
file and output the content in the
browser all right Jason can also be
parsed with almost any modern
programming language either natively or
through libraries so even if you're not
a JavaScript developer learning Jason is
extremely relevant and I would also
suggest that any programmer should learn
JavaScript anyways all right so let's
take a look at the different data types
that can be used with Jason
so we can use numbers just like regular
JavaScript if we use a numeric with no
quotes around it that'll be looked at as
a number and there's no difference
between decimals or floats or integers
they're all looked at as numbers of
course we have strings which is a string
of unicode characters these must be
wrapped in double quotes we can also use
boolean values which are true and false
we can use arrays which are ordered
lists of zero or more values arrays are
also wrapped in square brackets just
like in regular JavaScript and just
about any other programming language we
can also embed child objects which are
an unordered collection of key value
pairs and we can have multi-tiered
objects embedded in in the adjacent
object and lastly we have null which is
an empty value now when working with
object literals we can use any standard
JavaScript data type including functions
and dates but if it's specified as jason
values need to fit into one of these
okay we do have super sets of jason such
as Beeson which is used by MongoDB that
can allowed they do allow additional
data types but that's beyond this course
alright so before we jump in and we
start to write some JavaScript in Jason
I want to just look at some of the rules
that the syntax follows okay so Jason
works by using key value pairs and in
this example we have an object with one
key value pair name is the key and Brad
is the value all right now notice that
both the key and the value are using
double quotes if this was a JavaScript
object literal we wouldn't need the
quotes around the key just the string
value but if we wanted this to be parsed
as jason is valid jason then we need the
double quotes around both the key and
the value
all right if it's if it's valid jason it
also much must follow the specific data
types that we just described now if you
want you can create a file that is
strictly for Jason it must be valid and
it has to have a
Jasin file extension and then the mime
type associated with Jason is
application slash Jason so if you are
working with let's say a restful api
that and you want to send Jason you can
use this type in the header all right so
let's take a look at a really simple
example this is a single JSON object for
a person it's wrapped in curly braces
and uses the key value pairs the first
pair which is the name uses a string as
the value a string of Brad Travis E okay
it must use double quotes and the second
one is a number and notice that the
number doesn't have quotes around it the
next is an address which is actually an
embedded object with a street and a city
and then the last is an array of strings
okay so this is a very simple example
that uses multiple data types all right
so that's a brief introduction to what
Jason is now we're going to jump in and
we're going to actually look at and
write some code alright guys so I have
an index.html file here that I just have
in a folder called JSON sandbox
and it just adds your basic HTML head
and body tags and then we have this
script to these script tags in the body
this is where we're going to write our
JavaScript so it's really important to
understand that a JavaScript object and
a JSON object are a little different and
we went over some of this in the slides
and you saw that Jason Newton with Jason
you have to have double quotes around
both the key and the value when you're
working with standard JavaScript objects
you usually don't but you can so what
I'm going to do here is just create a
variable called person and set that to
an object which is represented with
curly braces and in here we're going to
say name and we're going to set that to
a string called Brad okay so this is
actually a JavaScript object this is not
valid Jason so what we can do here is we
can access I'm just going to use
console.log you can use alert well
actually you can't use alert because
it's an object but what this will do is
just log to the console down here if
you're using Chrome
hit f12 and that will open up the dev
tools and you just want to go to the
console Firefox also has it and I
believe every browser does ok so what we
want to do here is just log out person
all right so if we reload this you'll
see that it gives us an object and it
has the key value pair name and Brad now
this works in JavaScript in fact this is
what you would do but this is not valid
Jason if we go to Jason lint comm which
is adjacent validator and we take
actually let's just go ahead and put in
here name Brad and we say validate Jason
it's going to give us it's going to tell
us that this is not valid and the reason
for that is because it doesn't have
double quotes around the D key so if we
go ahead and do that and click validate
it says valid Jason now we can in fact
go over here and put double quotes like
that and then if we go back and reload
this is still going to work alright but
I'm going to leave those quotes off now
when we log this out it's it's logging
out the object if we want to access a
certain property such as name which is
the only property it has then we can
just do dot name and if we reload we get
Brad we can add on to this and let's say
age 35 and then down here we can say
person dot age and that will give us 35
now when using JavaScript objects we can
set the data type of the value to
anything that we can do in JavaScript
even a function so if we wanted to say
email and set that to a function and
then just return say Brad at gmail.com
and then go down here and say person dot
email which is a function so we need to
put in our parentheses reload and we get
Brad at Gmail alright and this is
certainly not valid Jason although it is
a valid JavaScript object so if we go
over here and we try to do that let's
say email
email and we'll set that to function and
we'll return Brad at Gmail and we try
and run that of course that is not valid
all right it has to be one of the data
types that we specified in the slides
which is number string boolean null and
array and object okay it has to be one
of those all right so I'm just going to
take this this email off right here this
function and I want to show you that we
can prepare this as jason if we wanted
to send it through Ajax to a server or
do something that requires it to be
valid Jason okay we can actually change
it to adjacent string so to do that we
can use a function called stringify so
what I'll do here is just say person
equals Jason dot stringify and then pass
in that person object and then down here
let's console.log person okay so we'll
go back here and reload and now you can
see it gives us a string that is
formatted correctly it has quotes around
the keys and around the string but not
around the number okay so that's valid
Jason we could send to a server now if
you want to take this JSON string and
turn it back to an object that's easy as
well and you would do that because if we
try to do person dot name and reload
we're going to get undefined okay so
what we want to do is parse it back into
an object so for that we would use Jason
dot parse okay and we'll pass in person
and now if we reload we're able to get
Brad okay it's back to an object all
right so I'm just going to comment these
out here and then I'm going to add some
more stuff to this so let's say we want
address and we'll set that to an object
which will have a streak
se5 main street which isn't my real
address by the way and then city will
say Boston alright in addition to that
let's create an array say children set
that to an array of strings and we have
Breanna and Nicholas okay now if we
wanted to access the street then we
would have to do person dot address dot
Street okay because it's another level
in so we have to specify that we want to
go into the address object and get this
street property so let's reload and we
get five Main Street all right now let's
say we wanted to access Breanna in the
children array for that we could do
person dot children and since it's an
array we're going to open up some
brackets and say we want the first one
which has an index of zero so if we
reload that we get Breanna if we want
Nicholas we can say one and we get
Nicholas okay and if you know JavaScript
then you know that arrays are zero based
all right so what I want to do now is
create an array of objects so I'm going
to go down here and save our people
and we're going to set this to an array
and inside here we'll have some objects
let's give the people a name and an age
okay and then we'll put another one
these should be separated by a comma
this one will say name John age 440 okay
and then we'll do one more we'll say
name oops
Sarah and we'll say age 25 so we have
this array of people objects so if we
wanted to access let's say John what we
could do is we can say console.log oops
people which is the name of the array
and then we want to get the first one
I'm sorry the index one because it's
zero one two so we want John which is
one let's go ahead and save that and
reload and it gives us the whole object
if we want to just the let's say the age
we could say dot age and that will give
us John's age now you may want to loop
through an array and then do something
with the output so for that what we
would do is we could use a for loop I'm
just going to comment that out we could
use a for loop so we're going to say var
I equals zero we're going to set I to
zero by default and then we're going to
say as long as I is less than people dot
length so the length of the array which
in this case is three and then we just
want to say I plus plus because after
each iteration we wanted to increment by
one okay so all I'm going to do here is
console dot log and we're going to say
people and for the index we're going to
use the current iteration which is the I
variable all right so let's save that
reload and you can see it goes through
and outputs each object if we just
wanted let's say the name we could do
dot name reload and we could do age or
whatever other properties there are
alright now you may want to output these
onto your screen and the browser in your
application so if we wanted to do that
we could go up into the HTML and let's
create a ul we'll give it an ID of
people and we're not going to put
anything inside that's going to be
generated through the JavaScript all
right let me just comment that out and
then we should be able to do what we'll
do is set a variable of output and set
that to nothing by default and then
actually though that should be outside
of this that should be here okay so we
set the output to nothing and then each
iteration we're going to take that
output variable and we're
going to append on to it so we're going
to use plus equals and we want to append
some Li tags and then in here we just
want to concatenate and we want to put
in yeah people let's do people I dot
name okay so that's going to go through
it's going to append to this output
through every iteration and then after
that what we want to do is say document
dot get element by ID and we want to
grab the element with the ID of people
which is the UL we created and then we
just want to say dot enter HTML and
we're going to set that equal to the
output okay and we'll reload and now
you'll see that it's outputting on to
the screen all right so now what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
JSON file and we're going to create a
people array in JSON and then fetch that
data through Ajax and then output it
onto the screen so let's create a new
file here and we're going to call this
people dot jason ok now this has to be
valid Jason so we're going to put in our
curly braces and then we're going to set
a key of people make sure you have
double quotes around that and set that
to an array okay and then what I'll do
is go to this array we created and grab
all these okay we'll paste that in and
right away Adam knows that this isn't
valid okay it's not valid because these
keys do not have double quotes around
them so let's go ahead and just change
that
all right so now that should be valid we
can go ahead and check it if we want to
copy that paste it in Jason lint and
validate and you can see down here that
is valid so let's save that and then
back in our index file let's see I'm
going to just comment everything out
here and I'm just I'm keeping it so you
guys have a reference to go back and
check if you want all right but what we
want to do now is send a get request to
that people dot chase and file and once
we get it we want to output the data now
I'm going to open up see where is it I
thought right here so this is the
w3schools site which is an awesome site
for a reference for all kinds of
technologies but this is showing us how
to make an HTTP request through
JavaScript now this is much easier if
you use jQuery or a library like Axios
or something it's it's much fewer lines
of code but I don't want to include any
external library so we're just going to
use JavaScript all right so let's grab
this and we're going to put that here
and I'll try to explain what's going on
here so your browser has this XML HTTP
request object so we're going to access
that and put that into this variable all
right then we're going to take that
variable and we're going to say
onreadystatechange equals a function and
then we want to check for the ready
state and the status ready state should
be four which means that the response
has been has been captured so we can use
it and then status this is an HTTP
status of 200 which means everything
went okay all right and then once we get
that we can then grab the response now
down here we're going to say X HTTP or
whatever you call this variable dot open
and then say we want to make a get
request to a specific file or a specific
URL
in this case we're just getting people
the dot chasin okay and then we finally
just want to call send so let's go back
up here and I'm going to get rid of this
for now and we want to console dot blog
and we want to log the xh TTP dot
response text because that's where the
response is stored so let's go ahead and
save that and go back to our application
and reload and now it's telling us that
the xhr cannot load because basically
we're not using a host Ronna we're
calling this from the file system we're
not calling it from an actual domain and
that's just a security protocol that
chrome uses so what we want to do is we
need some kind of server if you have
would say xampp installed or something
like that where you had you can use your
localhost and you can just upload this
to your web root then you could do that
but another solution is to use nodejs
and install a module called live server
so I'm going to do that so I'm going to
just open up I'll just use my standard
Windows command prompt ok and then I'm
just going to navigate to that folder
which I think is in sandbox C CD Jason
sandbox ok you want to go wherever you
have this this index.html alright and
then you need to have no js' installed
so if you don't have that just go to
node.js org go ahead and download it and
install it just a simple windows install
our same with mac if you're on linux you
can use your package manager but once
you get that installed you'll have a
command called NPM and then what you
want to do is say npm install - g live -
server ok and that will install the live
server module and it's installing it
globally so that you can access it from
n
anywhere so now all we have to do to run
this on our server is go to the correct
folder and say live - server ok and that
should open up your application on port
8080 okay so now we're running our
index.html in a server so if we open up
the console now you'll see that it's
actually getting the data ok ignore this
right here actually that go that should
go away so we're now able to access this
response so let's put this in a variable
instead of just logging it will save our
response equals that and then we can see
that there is a key of called people
which is an array so let's try to
console.log response dot people now
that's going to give us undefined and
the reason for that is because this is
formatted as a JSON string so it doesn't
know what to do with this so what we
need to do is just wrap the response in
JSON dot parse okay once we do that
it'll bring it to a JavaScript object
which we can access like this so now you
can see it gives us the people object
all right now I want to do the same
thing and just I'll put it up here so
what we can do is grab this okay copy
that
comment this so let's paste it in and
again we're creating a variable called
output we're going to loop through
people dot length now we haven't set
people yet so what we want to do is
actually we'll just do it here save our
people
equals the response that came in dot
people okay so now we can just loop
through it let's get rid of that we can
add each person or each name the people
array to the output and then we'll
output it into the people the element
that has the people ID so let's save
that and now you'll see that
we're getting this info from the people
dot Jason file if we were to add another
one let's say named Jeff and age 20 save
that and you can see that that will get
added since we're using live server
which actually uses live reload I didn't
even have to update it I didn't even
have to refresh it alright so we're
going to go ahead and stop here
hopefully this gave you guys some
insight into Jason JavaScript objects
and Ajax alright so that's it and if
you're not subscribed please do so if
you like this also leave it a like
dislike if you don't like it and I will
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
