our registration form and we're able to
now register and the user goes into
MySQL now we want to take care of the
login so let's go to our app PI file and
I'm going to put this right below the
register so we'll go right here and
let's say user login and we're going to
create a route so at app dot route okay
and in here we're going to say slash
login and then we also want to add the
methods here because we want to be able
to accept the post request as well as I
get so in here we'll say get and post
and then we'll define a function called
login and then we want to check to see
if the put if the request method is post
just like we did with the registration
so request a for quest method is equal
to post then we want to do something
this is also going to have actually no
this isn't going to have an else but we
do want to go down one on the same level
as the if and do a return and render the
template okay we're going to render
login dot HTML alright so if it is
submitted if the form is submitted
then we want to first get the username
and password from you know from the form
so let's say get form fields so username
and we can get that from request dot
form and then in these brackets we're
going to say username
okay now I'm not using WT forms for the
login like I did with like the
registration because we really don't
need it
so getting the form value is a little
different we're doing request form
username up here we did form name data
okay just wanted to point that out now
the password that's submitted in the
form I'm actually going to call that
password candidate and we're going to
set that to request top form password
okay I'm putting candidate because I
want the actual correct password that we
get from the database to be put in in
password and then we want to come
compare the two all right so we have
these two values now we want to create a
database a cursor okay so we can say cur
equals mysql dot connection dot cursor
okay then we want to get user by user
name so what we'll do is create a
variable called result and set that to
the cursor dot execute and here we're
going to do select all from users where
username is equal to and I'm going to
use this percent s okay and then the
next parameter is going to be inside
these brackets what we want that s to be
which is going to be username okay which
is this it's the one being passed into
the form all right so now we want to do
is check the results we're going to say
if
if result is greater than zero so this
is basically if there's any rose found
then we're going to get the stored hash
all right you know it's set a variable
called data and then we're going to use
cursor dot fetch one okay that should be
all lowercase now what this does is it
looks at this query it matches the first
one it finds and you know and that's
what it'll take is that so it's only
going to fetch one so even if there were
more users with that username it's just
going to get the first one all right and
then we can get the password from that
okay from that query so we can get it
with data password all right now if this
doesn't work for you then you probably
don't have this right here okay because
we're treating it as a dictionary
because that's what it's giving back to
us by default it's going to give you a
tuple which would be formatted
differently so make sure you do have
that configuration value all right close
I so we're getting the password from the
database now what we want to do is
compare the passwords so let's do if and
then we're going to use our sha-256
underscore crypt dot salt and let's see
we want to pass in not salt am i doing
it script verify yeah sha-256 script
verify and we want to pass in first the
password candidate and then second the
actual password that we got from the
database for that user now for now what
I'm going to do is just law I'm just
going to log either pass or fail okay so
if this matches if it's verified then
let's say app dot log r dot info this is
how we can actually log stuff to the
console and let's just say password
matched ok now this here if this is
false that means that there wasn't even
a user by that name so we want to put an
else for that I probably should've did
that earlier but that's going to go
right here so else then let's just do
app dot logger tot info and we'll just
say no user all right so let's actually
let's try that okay we need to create
the template first so let's say new file
and templates logon dot HTML now for
this template I'm just going to paste
this in because it's really simple we
are extending the layout block body we
have an h1 sorry about that
then we're including the messages
partial in case there's any messages and
then a form which is a post and it has a
user name with the input text name is
username and for the value we're putting
in request form dot username so if
something happens in the forms refreshed
we want the value to stay same with the
password alright so let's go ahead and
save that and then let's go back to app
dot pi and actually now that should be
fine we're just rendering login so let's
try to go to slash login ok to mark
invalid syntax let's see what did I do
here oh I forgot the colon
all right so if we go to login
there's our form so I'm just going to
submit just crap and press submit in
let's see
right here is missing the O on the end
here you guys probably saw that all
right so let's reload okay and I want to
look at the console now and it says no
user okay because there is no user of
this now if I match the user we know
that there's one in there of Brad and
the passwords one two three four five
six so if I say Brad and password that
doesn't match and submit and we look
we're not getting anything there let's
see so what we want to do is just add an
else right here and then we'll just log
passwords so a password not matched okay
and then let's try it look in the
console password not matched so now I'm
going to put the correct login in submit
and we look at it and we get password
matched all right so the logic is all
there for the login now we just need the
the loading of the of the templates and
all that okay and then we want to create
our session okay when we login we want
to establish a session and we want to
store the username in a session variable
as well so we'll go back to let's
actually do the else so this right here
if there's no user found what we want to
do is just rerender the template so
we'll say return render template and
we're going to render login dot HTML now
what I want to do is I want to pass
along pass along the error so right
above that let's say error equals we'll
say username not found but this keyboard
is really with me
all right so login HTML we have this
error we're going to pass that along and
then we're going to do the same thing
for this copy that okay so this will
just say invalid login okay then pops
along the error so let's save that now
we need to to output this error
somewhere within the template so I'm
going to go back to the messages file
they include for messages and go right
here and we're just going to do we're
going to say if error so if there's an
error then we're going to display a div
with the class of alerts and alert
danger oops and we just want to output
the actual error all right now I want
also want to be able to send a regular
success message so let's paste that and
and we'll say if MSG and then this will
be alert success and then MSG okay so
this takes care of messages if we're
redirecting to a link and we need to
basically get flashed and then these
will take care of if we want to render a
template and pass along either an error
or a message so hopefully that makes
sense but let's try this so far whoops
yeah so we'll try it let's actually add
a login link to the navbar
okay so now we'll go login submit' let's
see render template takes exactly one
argument - given the hell they're
talking about you can do too
so return render template Oh we just say
error equals error
all right hold on a second submit it in
two places
oh I included the messages here that's
right so I'm just going to get rid of
that
that's the login HTML page there we go
all right so username not found now if I
do the correct username and the wrong
password we get invalid logging so
there's two different messages for each
situation so now we need to handle if it
actually works okay so let's go to app
pi and this is where it passes we can
get rid of this let's just put a comment
here that says passed oops all right so
what we want to do if everything passes
is we want to create some session
variables so you should have imported
session up above here right here comes
from flask
all right so we'll do session
so session and then we'll have a value
for logged in and we're going to set
that to true all right and then we also
want the username stored okay we'll set
that equal to the username variable
which is right here
okay comes in from the form so once we
set those we'll go ahead and just flash
a message here we'll just say you are
now logged in and that's going to be a
success message and then we want to
redirect
let's redirect to dashboard which we
haven't created yet okay and then I just
want to close the connection here so
let's see that should be right here
we'll say car dot close all right so I
guess we could see if this works even
though we don't have a um you know what
let's create the dashboard first before
we do that because I'm pretty sure it's
going to work
so in app pie let's go down here and
let's do app dot route and this is going
to be for slash dashboard
yes slash def dashboard then we'll say
def dashboard and then we want to return
render template dashboard dot HTML okay
now we need to create that in the
templates
so let's go ahead and extend layout and
we need our block okay so in here for
now I'm just going to put in an h1
whoops and this is going to say
dashboard and then I'm also going to put
in a small tag here and going to say
welcome and then whatever the username
now we can get that from session dot
username so let's go ahead and try this
so login submit' and there we go you're
now logged in we're in a dashboard and
we're seeing the username here now we
also want to obviously logout so let's
go ahead and create that route so in app
dot pi
I'm going to go right below login and
above dashboard I should be commenting
these actually let's go up here make
sure yeah so this will be user register
this will be we'll say read register
form class and then this will be single
article
index all right so let's see where are
we log out okay so let's do a pro okay
this is going to be to log out or slash
log out and all you have to do here is
do session dot clear and that will kill
the session and then flash that's going
to be a success message and then let's
go ahead and just return redirect and
it's going to go back to the login page
okay so let's put a logout link in the
nav bar just copy this okay so that's
going to be log out log out so let's
click logout and now are logged out now
we need a way to make sure any way to
check to see if the users logged in to
be able to access a page a certain page
for instance the articles or add article
or even logged out they shouldn't be
able to log out if they're not logged in
we also want to hide some of these so
when we're logged in we don't want to
see register and login that doesn't make
any sense so let's first do the hiding
of the links ok so right now we're
logged out we shouldn't see the word
with the link Lago so let's go to our
navbar and we can just all we have to do
is
test for the session alright so under
here let's do we'll do an if session
dots logged in then we want to show if
we're logged in we want to show log out
so I'm just going to move this actually
we're going to cut that and put that
here and then we're going to have an
else actually now notes is no Coleman so
else then we want the register and login
okay and then we'll just end it so this
will be end if so it saved that and now
we don't see the logged out so if we go
ahead and log in now we're logged in and
all we see is the logout let's also put
a dashboard link there as well which
they should only see if they're logged
in so that will go right here awesome
so last thing we need to do here is make
it so that if we're logged out we can't
see the dashboard link but if we go to
the URL manually it lets us in and
that's obviously not good so for this
we're going to use a decorator okay so
it's a special kind of function that we
can actually add to any route we want
let me just open this up in the
documentation so we'll say flash
decorators our flask not flash so this
gives you some sample snippets I just
want I want this simple authorization
and this is how we need to format it
okay so we create a function inside the
function we have a wrapper and then
that's going to wrap around this this
wrapped or whatever you whatever you
call ever you want to call it I believe
you don't have to use wrapped and then
you pass in this args and then you have
your logic and basically it's an if
statement will say if what the users
logged in then we're not going to do
anything if they are not then they're
going to get booted out to the login and
they'll get a flash message saying
they're unauthorized all right so we're
going to do something similar to that
and it's a little tough to get wrap my
head around this quads right here I'm
not exactly sure what these are for this
is probably the one part of this
application I don't fully understand all
right so we're going to go to a PI and
we're going to put this decorator right
above the logout right after the login
so we'll say check if user logged in so
let's create a function and we're going
to call this is logged in now this is
going to take in a parameter F and then
what we want to do is say wraps
passing that F value and then we want to
define rap and we put that weird args
thing in here okay and then this is
where we put our logic so what we're
going to do is check to check the
session for that logged in value so if
logged in in session let's need the
colon right here too so if logged in in
session then we're going to return that
F value that F function and pass in the
args and kwargs else then what do we
want to do we want to set a flash
message and that's going to say
unauthorized please login and then
that's going to be an error message so
we want to use danger right here okay
and then we want to return and redirect
URL for and we're going to kick them out
to the login page okay and then on this
level this right here the same level as
the wrap we want to just return the wrap
all right so that should do it I believe
now if we want to use this on any route
for instance dashboard we can just go on
the next line here we can say at is
logged in and hopefully that works let's
check it out
so right now whoops what happened file
line 118 wraps is not defined oh you
know what we actually have to bring
wraps in so up here we just need to say
from and this is going to be from funk
tools imports wraps okay because it just
didn't know what that was
alright so let's save that while we've
written a lot of code so far okay so now
it's running let's reload let's try to
go to dashboard while we're not logged
in and it brings us to login and tells
us we're unauthorized if we do go ahead
and log in we can go to the dashboard
alright so I believe that our
registration and login system is
complete so what we want to do now is
our next in the next video is start on
the articles ok we want on the dashboard
we should have a button that says add
article we should also be able to view
them and edit delete them alright so
thanks for watching guys I appreciate
you sticking sticking with this this
series or this project and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
