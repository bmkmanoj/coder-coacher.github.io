reviewing and not reviewing but unboxing
and giving you a demo of the super
Knight LED strip alright so this is what
it looks like you've probably seen this
all over the web if you like looking at
setup videos like I do a lot of the LED
lighting that you see behind the desks
behind the monitor this is what they're
using alright so go ahead and so what
I'll do is I'm gonna show it to you
unbox it and then probably gonna set it
up and I'm gonna continue the video to
show you what it looks like all set up
alright so we have a power cord just
looks like your standard PC power cord
then we have the AC DC adapter so this
goes right into there just like your
laptop and that plugs in and then this
white box this is the remote nice cool
little remote alright so you can
actually change the colors of the LED
lights with this thing alright so you
see that the RGB white and different
shades of each color they're reds greens
blues and I guess whites and then you
got flash you get different effects
flash strobe fade smooth and it looks
like you can adjust the brightness as
well and of course your on and off
buttons so that's pretty cool
and then this here this what is this oh
this is just you plug that into there
and then you're gonna hook one of these
up to the strip alright so let's take a
look at the strip itself
this is what the strip looks like now
with this it's it's really long how long
is this actually ah
does it not say one second guys let me
just see if I can find out how long this
is sixteen point four feet all right or
I think that's five meters and you can
see that the the little connector here
is what you're gonna plug into this
right here all right now obviously 16
feets pretty long but you can break
these every third LED you can cut it off
there all right so you see these these
brown these copper lines right here you
can actually snap them off at that and
it'll still it's gonna be usable it's
not you're not gonna break it
alright so you can basically you can
make this as long or as short as you
want obviously up to 16 feet for me I'm
probably gonna put it along the back of
my desk so I'm probably gonna use I
don't know six maybe seven feet of this
thing but yeah so I'm gonna set it up I
have so I have some cable management
that I need to do first because it's
it's looking pretty ugly down there and
I'll show you what it looks like I'll
show you my setup although I have a
setup video on my channel that you may
want to check out I will be doing an
update because I did get some new stuff
alright so I'm gonna go ahead and set
this up and I'll be back alright guys so
I have the LED lights hooked up now and
I also threw another two monitors on the
top so I now have six that screensavers
kind of taken away from the LEDs take
that off there alright so I really like
these
now I'm only using about 4 feet of the
16 so it's not gonna be like crazy
bright and that's how I want I don't
want the whole room lit up just behind
everything
all right so I have we look under here
you can see that it's all red I have
just the solid red on right now so what
I'll do is grab the remote here and just
go through say you can change it to
orange yes that would be the best view
okay yellow brighter yellow we can do
light blue down to dark blue right there
that I like that that looks nice green
you can do white I do like the white too
actually it's kind of perfect yeah I
guess that's purple so those are the
colors we can adjust the brightness and
then we have some effects you go like
this let's see it just kind of blinks
real fast goes goes through the colors
this one kind of its kind of like a
heartbeat I guess
and it's which is different colors this
one that kind of looks like the same
thing and then this one which is like
fast blinking and a fast color change
all right so I I like this I feel like
since I'm using only four feet I'm not
really showing you guys its full
potential but like I said I don't want
to light up the entire room just right
behind everything so I'm gonna do
another video on my setup soon with the
six monitors I got a new mic I got some
other stuff as well so I'll check in
with that stuff probably in a few days
all right so hopefully you guys learned
something from this review what if you
you know decide if you're gonna buy
these or not I I like them personally
and I would suggest it but yeah so
that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
