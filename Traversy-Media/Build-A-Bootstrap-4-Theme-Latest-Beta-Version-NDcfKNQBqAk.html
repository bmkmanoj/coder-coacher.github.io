we're gonna be creating a bootstrap for
beta theme okay so bootstrap was just
upgraded to beta I think it was like a
week and a half or two weeks ago and
this is actually from my bootstrap 4
from scratch course which I initially
created in bootstrap alpha unfortunately
a couple days later they upgraded it to
beta so I had to redo the whole course
but long story short I do have a 5
project course that you may want to
check out this is one of the projects ok
so this is the course right here it's
actually on sale for only $10 now which
is a udemy sale but you may want to
check that out it has a 4.9 rating it
has learning sections as well as the
project sections alright now for our
work flow we're gonna be using the
bootstrap 4 starter pack which we
actually created in the course and what
this does is it uses gulp which is a
JavaScript task runner to compile our
bootstrap from source compile all of our
sass load up a dev server and then move
the correct files that we need from from
our node modules to our source folder
including you know jQuery and popper
which are dependencies of bootstrap 4 as
well as font awesome okay so this pack
includes all of those and literally all
we have to do is install them with npm
install and then npm start we'll start
up our dev server now as far as the
project itself it's a theme called loop
lab it's a one-page theme I think it's
really clean looking basically we have a
transparent navbar at the top which is
fixed you'll see it'll stay at the top
no matter what then we have this
showcase area with a background image we
applied an overlay using CSS then we're
using the grid system here these check
box this area right here is actually
using flexbox ok so it's using the new D
flex class in bootstrap 4 over here we
have a card with a form in it okay the
card uses the is using the Prime
background-color and then down here we
have basically three sections explore
create and share and each section has a
header with some text and a button ok
we're using the new outline buttons that
bootstrap for uses and then we have some
more checkboxes we have some stock
images from pixels comm you see the
create section the share section and
then the footer just has a button that's
gonna open up a contact modal and the
navigation will just bring us around to
certain spots in the theme alright so
very very simple it's also completely
responsive if we go ahead and make this
smaller you'll see that for I think
that's large screens extra large and
then when we get to medium it's going to
get rid of the text in the showcase and
it's just gonna have the form here
alright and then you can see that
everything still looks really good still
very responsive if we go down really
small you'll see that the the links here
will go away and we get the hamburger
menu where we can just have this this
drop down
alright so pretty simple but pretty
clean theme and I think you'll learn a
lot about the new bootstrap for classes
and so on alright so hopefully you guys
enjoy this and let's get started
alright so the first thing we're gonna
do is setup our bootstrap for starter
pack all we have to do is you can either
clone it using git or you can just
download it I'm just gonna download the
zip right here and the link is in the
description by the way and we're gonna
go ahead and just open that up and we
want these files here so we have the
source folder the gulp the package.json
and you don't you don't actually need to
read me but we'll grab these files here
and actually let's create a project
folder first so we're gonna call this
loop lab and we'll bring these files
over alright and feel free to use this
starter pack in all your bootstrap 4
projects so now what we want to do is
open up a command line our terminal in
the loop lab folder I'm using git bash
for Windows so I'm gonna go ahead and
just open that up if you want get bash
you can just go to get -
see em calm and you can download it here
it's also available for Mac alright so
in here like the documentation says we
just want to run npm install that's
going to install bootstrap for beta it's
going to install popper and jQuery which
are dependencies and then the dev
dependencies so let's go ahead and say
npm install alright so once that's done
we should be able to run our server by
just saying npm start and there we go so
we have our bootstrap for beta starter
so we're gonna leave this running this
server let's go over to vs code and
we're just gonna open up the loop lab
folder okay we'll close that up and what
you're gonna see here is your gulp file
you don't need to pay any attention to
this stuff this is just all the tasks to
compile sass and move around our files
and all that now if you look in your
source folder just from running npm
start what it did is it took all of the
bootstrap files so bootstrap CSS all the
bootstrap javascript and all the the
dependencies jQuery popper it took it
from the node modules folder and brought
it over to our source folder ok because
the source folder is is gonna be your
final directory where you just want to
upload to your your web host alright it
has the compiled CSS style dot CSS from
the style dot s CSS file so any CSS you
want to add you want to use your sass
file ok that way you can use variables
and stuff like that alright so let's go
ahead and open up the index.html this is
what it looks like very very simple it's
just including font awesome bootstrap
our stylesheet ok all the compiled stuff
and then our JavaScript bootstrap
JavaScript and the dependencies ok and
if we open up our console f12 you
shouldn't see any errors down here so
let's get started on our project
first thing we want to create is the
navbar
alright so we're
get rid of actually first of all it's
changed the title here to will say loop
lab and then we're gonna just get rid of
this h1 we don't need that and we're
gonna create our navbar so let's say nav
now I am using Emmet
okay Emmet comes default with vyas code
if you want to use it on atom or sublime
text you'll have to add it as a
dependency I'm sorry from the dependency
a plug-in or an extension so we're gonna
create a nav tag and we're gonna give it
a couple classes so one we want a class
of nav bar we also want a class of nav
bar - expand and I'm gonna do - SM now
what this does is this is gonna tell it
when we want the the little hamburger
menu the responsive menu to show up and
I wanted to show up on small screens
okay if you want it to show up on like
let's say medium screens you could do MD
or you could do LG if you did you could
also do Excel but that would just it
would always be in that state but we're
gonna do SM now in bootstrap for alpha
this was toggleable okay it was now var
toggleable and then the size so just
keep that in mind it's now expand now
for the background color I want it to be
a dark color so we're gonna use the BG
dark class alright and then in order for
the navbar to be have light text we want
to use navbar dark
okay that's telling it that the navbar
is gonna be dark so we need light text
and then I also want to fix it to the
top so we're gonna give it a class of
fixed top and then we'll go ahead and
tab and now we have a nav with all those
classes all right now inside the nav
we're gonna have a container because the
content inside the navbar I want to
restrict to the middle now we're going
to need our branding or our logo so
that'll be an a tag with the class of
nav bar - brand okay and this is just
gonna go to let's say index dot HTML all
right and then for the branding we're
just gonna say loop web
all right so if we were to save that
you'll see that at Auto loads and we
have our little nav bar so next thing we
want to put under the branding is the
collapse button so it's only going to
show up on small screens but we still
have to put it in so it's going to go
right under the a tag we're gonna put in
button it's gonna have a class of nav
bar - toddler and then it's also going
to need a couple extra attributes so
it's gonna need one called data toggle
we want to set that to collapse and then
it also needs a data target because it
needs to know what to collapse down so
we're gonna give this an idea of hash
nav bar collapse let me just turn on
word rap here alright and I guess I'll
just make this bigger alright so we have
our button it has a clasp it has data
toggle data target now inside the button
we're gonna want a span and we're gonna
give this a class of nav bar
- toddler whoops toddler - icon okay and
then nothing in there that's that's
gonna give us the little icon with the
lines so let's go ahead and actually
save that and if we go back to our
project you'll see that when we make
this go down to a small size the icon
appears now we don't have our menu or
anything so nothing happens but you'll
see that it will appear on small screens
if we were to change this to expand MD
and save you'll see that even if we go
bigger it's still there until we get out
of the MD if we put this - LG and save
that and go back you'll see that it'll
stay there until we hit large until we
hit extra-large all right but I prefer
to have it SM just on small screens so
now what we're going to do is go under
the button and we're gonna have a div
with the class of collapse as well as
nav bar collapse
all right and we're also gonna give it
an ID and the ID should match whatever
you have for the data target here so now
have our collapse accepted you don't
want the hash in there and then in this
div is where we're gonna put our UL okay
so we're going to be ul it's gonna have
a class of nav our nav as well as ml -
Otto okay so that's margin-left:auto
what that's gonna do is it's gonna move
the UL to the right so we'll have the
branding on the left and the UL on the
right and then each li is gonna have a
class of nav - item all right now I've -
item and let's see inside here we'll
have an a tag with a class of nav - link
okay and for the for the link here let's
say hash home alright now I want this to
go up to the top when we click this home
link so what I'm gonna do is just give
the body an ID of home so that it goes
right up there when we click it alright
let's see so we're gonna copy this whole
li we're gonna have a couple other links
so one two three more let's just push
these over oops what happened here
all right so the second one is gonna be
for Explorer so I'm gonna change this
text to explore we're gonna change the
the href to hash explorer head section
because each section is going to have a
head and that's where we want this to
navigate to this one right here is gonna
go to create so this one will be create
- head - section and then this last one
is gonna be share and you guessed it
it's gonna go to share head section all
right so let's go ahead and save that
and let's take a look so we'll make this
bigger and there we go now we have all
of our links now we're gonna move on to
our CSS because we're gonna add some CSS
to our navbar as well as to the main
body so let's go to style dot s CSS
remember we're using our sass file here
and we're actually gonna set a couple
variables so let's set a variable called
BG color should be money sign BG color
and we're gonna set that to a dark gray
all right let's also set the font color
to white all right and then we're gonna
have a primary color whoops so primary -
color and that's gonna be a hexadecimal
value of number sign 0 0 8 DD 6 okay and
let that's it for now so for the body I
actually want to add the background
which will be the BG color and let's do
color which will be the font color
all right so if we go ahead and save
that and we take a look and you'll see
that it'll automatically update so for
the navbar actually wanted to have I
wanted to have some opacity I want it to
be transparent a little bit and then
have a blue border so let's go down here
and say navbar and we'll say border
bottom let's do the primary color
let's do three pixels and let's do solid
all right and then we're gonna set the
opacity
I hope acity I don't want it too much so
I'm gonna set it to 0.8 and save and
there we go all right you know I'm gonna
do I want these I want these to be
displayed both at once so I'm just gonna
put it in the responsive mode I guess
I'll just make that smaller and then
we'll make this smaller all right so
there we go now you can see that this
works as well so we're good with the
navbar now we're going to move on to the
home section which is like the I guess
the showcase area so we'll go back to
our index and let's go under the nav and
we'll go ahead and put a comment in here
and we'll say home section okay so this
is actually gonna be a header tag we're
gonna use an html5 header tag I'm gonna
give it an ID of let's say home -
section okay and then in here what we're
gonna do is we're gonna have an overlay
over the image remember it was actually
you know what let me bring up the the
actual project alright so if we look at
it you'll see that there's a dark
overlay over the image if we just did
the image it'd be too bright we wouldn't
be able to see the text so we need to do
that so we're gonna have a class right
here called dark - overlay alright and
then in here I'm gonna put another class
of home - inner
and in here we're gonna have our
container to constrain all the content
to the middle all right now we're gonna
use the grid system if we look at the
project again so this will be and he
column div right here this will be a
four column okay so let's say call
actually we need to do our row class
first
so we'll say row and then we'll do a
call lg8 okay so that's our eighth
column and let's do a call lg4 that'll
be our four column so in the eighth
column we're gonna have an h1 and
bootstrap four has these heading display
classes which are really nice so we're
gonna set this to display - four as a
class and then we're gonna say build
social profiles and gain revenue and
profits all right and then I'm just
gonna wrap build in or ya know not build
social profiles I'm gonna wrap in strong
tags all right and then let's see under
the h1 we're gonna put our flex flex
containers now let's go back to the
final project and then what we have is
three different Flex containers with two
flex elements inside one's gonna be the
check ones gonna be the text so to do
that we're gonna create a div with the
class of D - flex okay we're also going
to give it a class of flex row which
signifies that we want it to go
horizontal we could also do flex column
to make it go vertical but we're gonna
go ahead and do that and then what we're
gonna do is have a class of P - 4 so
this is actually padding for it's gonna
add padding all around the sides and if
you guys are interested in the spacing
classes you can take a look at this this
documentation page here so basically we
can have MRP
for margin or padding then we can have
what sides we want so for instance PT
would be padding top PB would be padding
bottom and you can also do MT and B X
would be for both left and right
why would be for top and bottom and
blank would be for all sides and that's
what we're doing we're doing just P - 4
so the four is part of the size which
can be 0 through 5 and they're basically
just multipliers of whatever the spacer
is so p4 is gonna be spacer times 1.5 ok
so just know that you can have different
levels of padding and margin using these
classes so we're gonna do p4 and then
inside that we're gonna do our font
awesome icons so this will actually be
an eye tag with the class of FA and then
the icon I want to use is gonna be a
check so I'm gonna do FA - check and
we'll tab that and that's gonna give us
our icon alright so if I were to save
that it's gonna look like this it's not
gonna look too good yet but we'll fix
that in a little bit so let's see we're
also gonna have another flex item inside
the D flex div so let's go right here
and let's say another p4 I want padding
on this as well and I want to put some
text so I'm gonna say lorem let's do
lorem 15 tab which is part of Emmet it's
just gonna generate 15 words alright if
I save that you'll see that it
automatically gets aligned because this
is actually a Flex container and these
are flex items just by putting this D
flex if I were to remove these flex
classes you'll see they're not going to
align anymore alright but let's put
those back and then I just want to make
sure that this is aligned to the start
and then this item is aligned to the end
so we can add those classes right here
we'll say a line - self - start and then
this one here will be a line - self -
end alright and then what we'll do is
copy the entire D Flex role because we
want three of these these
box areas let's see that ends right
there so we'll just grab that and we'll
paste it in two more times and save and
now we have our three areas here all
right now I'm gonna make this bigger and
on this side we want to put our form so
let's go to our four column div which is
right here and we're gonna put we're
going to use a card for this so we're
gonna say class card we're also gonna
give it a class of BG primary which will
give it a blue background we're gonna
make it
text Center and we're also gonna add the
class of card form
okay card form is actually a class that
I'm creating so we can grab onto it
later it's not actually a bootstrap
class so inside a card we need a card
body so we're gonna create a class of
card body now in alpha six this was
actually actually card block like this
so you may remember that if you've used
bootstrap for alpha it's now body all
right and in here we'll just put an h3
we'll say sign up today and let's just
add a paragraph here and we'll say
please fill out this form to register
all right and then under that let's put
in our form oops we don't need an action
it's not going to actually do anything
and in the form we're gonna have a class
of form group inside here we'll have an
input and it's gonna have a type of text
let's also give it a class of form
control okay just like bootstrap three
now we can also add a class of form
control - LG which will make it bigger
okay make it wider which is what I want
and then let's give it a place holder
let's say a user name
all right so save that and that's what
it's gonna look like so far don't worry
about it being so far up will fix that
after
so let's see we have our forum group
with the input inside now I'm just gonna
copy that so the form group and the
input that's inside and we're going to
paste in another one let me change up
this this indentation here I don't like
this let's see let's do two and then fix
this up there we go alright so again we
have the form group username then we
have the next one that I just pasted it
in this is gonna now be the email so
change the type to email and let's
change the place holder to email and
next we're gonna have the password and
the confirm password so let's copy a
form group again paste in two more types
gonna be password
let's see placeholder password this one
here type is gonna be password and then
for the placeholder will say confirm
password and save alright and then the
last thing we need is an a submit button
so that's gonna go right above the
ending form tag we'll say input let's
give this a class of BTN also BTN -
outline - light and then also BTN block
which will display it as a block and
change the type to submit okay since
it's an input submit we also need a
value for the text and we'll just say
submit and save all right so that takes
care of all the markup for the home
section now we have to work on the
styling so we're gonna go to our style s
CSS file and let's go ahead and put in a
hash home section that's what we wrapped
everything in and we're gonna put a
background image here so let's say
background and we'll go ahead and set
that to a URL
now for the image it's actually an image
from pixels com
so let's say we'll go to pixels calm you
can also get this from the files in the
link in the description but this is
where I got it I think I search for
social and let's see it's where the hell
is it this one right here so this image
here and I grabbed the nineteen twenty
by twelve eighty so we're gonna download
that let's bring it into our project
source and I'm gonna create a folder
called IMG and let's save it as home dot
JPEG alright so now that we have that
let's go ahead and throw that in here so
it's gonna be in dot dot slash we want
to go outside of our CSS I'm sorry our
CSS after after it's compiled into image
and then home dot jpg alright and then
I'm just gonna say no-repeat and let's
save so you can see that's what it's
gonna look like so far at least the
image is showing up and we're gonna set
a minimum height here of 700 pixels save
that okay so now it goes down to 700
pixels let's set the background size to
cover okay we want to cover the whole
thing so you can see now we can see the
whole image let's also do background
attachment background attachment and
that's gonna be fixed okay now we want
to have a dock overlay remember we can't
really see the text like this remember
we gave it the class of dock overlay so
we're gonna add that here so dark
overlay and we're gonna set the
background color now for the background
color I wanted to have some opacity so
what I'm gonna do is set it as an RGB a
value and I'm actually going to create
it as a variable up here so I'll create
a variable called dark overlay and we'll
set that to RGB a and we're gonna set it
to black so 0 0 0 and then the opacity
will be 0.7 like that oops
just like that will set the background
color to the dark overlay variable and
that should do it now we want to
position this as absolute we want to
cover the entire area so we're going to
start at top zero and left zero and then
we're gonna set the width to 100% with a
hundred percent and let's also set the
min height to the same as the home
section which is 700 pixels and save and
now we have our dark overlay alright now
we want to move everything down so
remember we also had a class of home
inner oops home inner and let's see
we're gonna set the padding top of this
to 150 I hate this keyboard so much but
I get too many complaints for my
mechanical keyboard it's too loud and
there we go now let's see the card form
right here I want to add a little bit of
opacity so remember we added that class
card form and we're just gonna set
opacity to let's say 0.8 and save now it
has a little bit of transparency and now
the icons here we want those to look
different so we're gonna style those as
well yeah oh you know what I wanted to
do actually is I wanted since we're
using sass I wanted to nest all of these
okay because everything all of these
here are actually
in the home section so we can nest them
so we can just take these and put them
right within here like that save and
you'll see that still works so for the
FA so if the font awesome the icons
we're gonna set the color to primary
color we're gonna set the background to
white we're gonna set the padding to 4
pixels let's set the border radius to 5
pixels and let's set the size of font
size and I'm actually going to create a
variable for the icon size so up here
we'll create a variable called icon size
we'll set it to 30 pixels all right and
we'll stick that in right here save and
take a look and there we go now if I go
ahead and they make this smaller you'll
see that we have an issue now everything
is breaking out of the image out of that
700 pixels what I want to do is I want
to make it so that when it's less than a
large screen I want to get rid of this
this text right here and just have the
form so let's go back to our index.html
and there's actually a couple classes
that we can add here so we want to go to
our lg8 column which is this right here
and we're gonna say d - none okay so
this is display:none and what that did
is it took away that whole eight column
but it did it for everything for every
screen what I want to do is I want to
display it on large screens and up so we
can add another class that will be d -
LG so large screens then we want to
display it as a block not as none save
and now we have it back okay but when we
go below large it's just gonna be the
form which is what I want alright so
that part is now done and that's
basically the the toughest part of this
the rest are pretty and pretty easy
because they're pretty similar the
explore the create and so on so let's go
under the header and let's say this is
gonna be our explore head section so
let's create a section with an ID of
Explorer - head - section and in here
we're going to have a container we're
gonna have a row and this is going to be
just a one column grid so we're just
gonna use the call class but I also want
everything to be Tech Center so we're
gonna add that as a class as well all
right and then in here what we'll do is
we'll have a class of P - five so that
we have padding five on all sides and
then we'll have an h1 I'm gonna give
that a class of display four which will
just make it really big so we have
display four through display one display
one being the biggest and like I said in
my course I go over all of these types
of classes so if you guys are really
interested in bootstrap for especially
the newer version the beta version I
definitely suggest checking it out so
under the h1 we're gonna put a paragraph
with the class of lead which was also
available in bootstrap 3 it just makes
it more prominent and then we'll say
lorem 20 tab which will give us 20 words
all right and then finally under the
paragraph we're gonna have an a tag and
we'll give it a class of BTN BTN -
outline - secondary pants it's just
gonna go nowhere and then for the text
we'll just say find out more and save
and that's what it's gonna look like so
there's nothing really else we have to
add to the head as far as styles or
anything it's using the the background
of the body which is the dark gray and
that's what I wanted all right so now
underneath that we're going to do the
explore section
okay that was the head now we're gonna
do this section so we'll give this a
section tag of we'll give it an ID of
Explorer section I'm also gonna give it
some classes we're gonna give it a class
of BG - light which is a bootstrap for
beta background class also a class of
text - muted which is just gonna make it
a little lighter and then also some
padding on the top and bottom so py -
five okay py is top and bottom padding
now in here we're gonna have again a
container okay we're gonna have a row
and we're gonna have two six column divs
so we're gonna do call MD - six and
we're gonna have two of these okay now
on the first one we're gonna have the
image so the image I also got from
pixels so let's grab that website I
didn't mean to open Adam let's see so
the image is gonna be what is this image
oops that's not the right one where's
the finished one let's see so the image
is gonna be this right here this mobile
phone so let's just search for mobile
phone and it's this one right here so
click on that as far as the size I think
I got the nineteen twenty by twelve
eighty we could do smaller but let's
just grab that because I think that's
what I used and then let's save this
we'll save it as Explorer - section one
dot jpg okay make sure you save it in
your loop lab source image folder
alright and then we're going to go back
and put in our image this is going to
have a class of image fluid so that it
stays within its its container element
we're also going to give it a little bit
of margin bottom so we'll say mv3 and
then we're also going to give it a class
of rounded - circle all right and then
for the source it's going to be in the
image folder and it's gonna be explore
section one dot jpg and let's save it
and there we go so there's our image so
on the other side we're gonna have some
texts kind of like what we have right
here Rd flex so let's see what I'll do
is actually copy what we did up there so
it's C D flex which ends right here just
gonna grab that okay and then we're
gonna go down and let's see actually
we're gonna put some stuff before that
so in this sixth column div let's put an
h3 and we'll say explore and connect and
then under the h3 we'll put a paragraph
and I'm gonna dual arm 30 tab which will
give us 30 words and underneath that I'm
gonna paste in the D flex okay so that's
one and then I want to paste in one more
and let's save and that's what it's
gonna look like now as far as the
styling we need to add some styling to
our icons the reason that it's not
formatted like this is because if we
look at our sass file the effe that we
styled is within the home section it's
nested within there so that's not going
to apply so what we'll do is we'll add a
class for the explore section and then
we'll put in an FA and here and we'll
style it so I'm gonna put a color of
white
let's see what else we'll do a
background whoops what the hell
background is gonna be three three three
let's do padding four pixels I had to do
that padding four pixels and let's do
border-radius
five pixels and let's do font size which
will be the same as the other one so
it'll have the icon size variable save
it and that's what it's gonna look like
so that's our explore section now if we
click on explore it'll bring us down as
far as it can to show Explorer click
home it brings us back up alright so
next we have the what is it the create
section so let's go back and let's copy
the Explorer head because it's gonna be
very similar we'll paste that and this
is gonna be the create head okay so
we're going to change the ID to create
head section and let's see what else
we're going to change here let's see so
I want this to be blue so I'm gonna give
it a class of BG primary and let's do
let's change Explorer to create and I
just want to change the button from
outline secondary to outline light and
that should do it let's save go down and
there's our create so now for the create
section what we can do is copy the
Explorer section
change that to create section I copy and
paste because I don't want you guys to
watch me just you know type out the same
crap over and over because these are
very similar so just try to follow along
you know follow the changes of making so
we're gonna change the ID to create
section we're going to change for these
classes all I want is the padding class
we can get rid of the BG light and text
muted and then I want the columns to be
reversed so in other other words I want
the image on this side and the text on
this side so what we'll do here is let's
copy everything that's in this column
md6 which ends here
I'll grab everything in there cut it out
and we're gonna paste it right in this
call md6
and then just grab the image cut it and
put the image in this one all right and
then let's go ahead and change this
heading to say create your passion we'll
leave the text that's fine we'll leave
all the the flexbox icons that's good
and let's see the image so the image is
gonna be let me just take a look real
quick I forget so the image is gonna be
this tablet thing right here so let me
search for a tablet by the way pixels is
an awesome site for free stock images
really high quality stuff so it's this
one right here and we're gonna grab the
1920 version will download that we'll
save it as create - section one dot jpg
alright and then we'll go back and we'll
just change this to create - section one
jpg and let's say I believe that this
stuff
yeah these classes will stay the same so
let's go ahead and save let's take a
look there we go now we have to stop
our icons again so what we'll do is go
back to our sass file let's put in
create section put in our dot fa class
here and I want the same styling that we
have for the home section so I'm just
gonna grab all this and we'll go ahead
and paste that in and save and there we
go so that looks pretty good and now all
we need now is the share section the
share head and the share section so
again let's copy let's see let's copy
the explore section again so we want the
head and the explore section we're gonna
copy both of those and notice how I
break everything into sections that's
how I like to build themes like this is
just to have a section for everything
and make it it makes it very modular
alright so let's go ahead and paste that
in and then we're gonna change this to
share head and then that's gonna be
share head section and let's see what
else we want to do here let's add the
class of BG primary let's change this to
share and change the button to outline
light and then that should be good for
the head now for the section let's
change this to share section and let's
see four classes yeah we'll keep those
classes BG light and let's see we do
want the image on this side and except
we need to get a new image which is
gonna be let's see what image it is it's
this one here which I believe if we
search for social
is that it no that's not it is where is
it
maybe it's not under social huh search
for share no that's not it either
all right you know what
sorry for the bang and my wife and son
just came home upstairs but yeah we'll
just use this one doesn't really matter
we'll grab the 1920 and let's save it as
share section one dot jpg all right and
let's see we're gonna change this to
share section one jpg keep the classes
that's fine for the h3 let's change that
to share what you create and we'll leave
the Flex checkboxes and all that that
should be good let's save and now we
have our share we have our image now
these I want a style these checkboxes as
well and I want them to have the same
styling as this as the Explorer so what
we can do is go over here and just put a
comma right here I'm sorry right here
next to explore and say share or hash
share section because then this FA is
going to apply to the F phase inside of
the share section so we'll save and
there we go so now we just need the
footer which is very simple so we'll go
down past the last section and let's say
main footer this will be also be a
actually no it's not gonna be a section
it's gonna be a photo tag we'll give it
an ID of main footer and I want this to
be dark so I'm going to give it a class
of BG dark and then let's give it a
container and a row and then it's just
going to be one column so I'm just gonna
give it a class of call and let's also
do text center okay inside here let's do
a py 4 I want padding on the top and
bottom and we'll have an H 1 this is H 1
I'm actually gonna
formatted as an h3 in bootstrap for we
can give it a class of h3 and it'll be
in h1 but it'll be the size of an h3 and
we'll say loop lab let's do a copy right
underneath so we'll say copyright ampere
samp copy semicolon 2017 and then we're
just gonna have a button underneath give
it a class of BTN and BTN primary ok now
this is actually going to be a modal say
contact us so modal's need to have a
data toggle attribute of modal and they
also need a data target for data target
we're gonna say hash contact modal
alright that we just need to create that
so let's go down below the footer will
say contact contact modal so this is
going to be a div with the class of
modal it's also going to have the class
of fade and also text - dark alright
we'll give it the ID of contact modal
okay so the ID should match this ID
right here and then it's gonna have a
modal dialogue class and it's gonna have
a modal content class should be modal -
content inside here we're going to have
a modal header div
and inside here we'll have an H five
with the class of modal - title okay
it's also gonna have an ID so hash it's
gonna have an ID of contact modal title
and in the H five let's just say contact
us alright and then we want the modal
body which is gonna go underneath it's
gonna go underneath the modal header so
right under here
modal body and this is where our form is
going to go get rid of the action so in
the form we'll have a form group as
always and then we'll have a label let's
a label for name okay under the label
we'll have an input let's see so the
input will have a class of form control
and then what we'll do is we'll just
copy the div with the form group and
we're gonna have two more oops let me
just fix this so we have two more the
second one's gonna be for our email
contact okay can change the type to
email and then this one's gonna be for a
message alright and message is actually
going to be a text area so we're gonna
get rid of the input type text and just
put in text area which also needs to
have a closing tag alright and then
we're gonna have a modal footer which is
going to go under the body so the body
ends here so we're gonna say modal -
footer and inside here we'll just have a
button we'll give it a class of BTN and
BTN primary let's also do BTN block make
it a block level element and we'll say
submit
all right so let's go ahead and save
that and now if we click on the contact'
and the footer we get a little contact
modal and that's it
so our navigation should work explore
create share and home and if we make
this smaller it should be completely
responsive everything looks good the
modal still fits in there good and our
little hamburger menu works so we've now
