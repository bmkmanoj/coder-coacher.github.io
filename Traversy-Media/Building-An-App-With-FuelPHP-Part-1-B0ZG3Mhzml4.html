looking at fuel PHP which is it's a PHP
MVC framework and it's a little less
known than some of the others like
cakephp and CodeIgniter and Zend but
I've used it a couple times and it's
actually it's it's actually really nice
it's pretty easy to use and it really
reminds me of code igniter so we're
gonna go ahead and just go with this I
didn't plan out an application to build
or anything but we'll probably build a
just a really simple blog probably just
one table one post table and we'll see
how it goes alright so what I'm gonna do
is click this big download button here
and we'll go ahead and download that now
I'm using zamp or xampp
so i'm gonna go to my local hosts folder
which is in my c drive and let's see and
there's am poor xampp however you want
to pronounce it and then htdocs and this
is going to be our server root alright
so if i go to localhost it just
redirects us to the to the zamp panel
here alright so what i'm gonna do is
create a subfolder
and let's see
hello
you know this is my wold on my first
time using Windows 10 but I just
installed it not too long ago and I'm
there's some issues that I don't know if
it's just this virtual machine or if
it's Windows 10 itself
I don't know so we'll see so I'm gonna
create let's just call this my blog you
know just get rid of that extra folder I
created all right so we're gonna open up
that zip file and just take everything
that's in it and put it right in there
actually we don't need the docs that's
just the documentation
all right so let's see what we got we
have two main folders here fuel and
public fuel is the basically the whole
application that's where our controllers
and models and views and all that stuff
is and then public is what the the
front-end will see all right so if we go
to localhost / my blog it's just going
to show us a listing of files and
folders what we want to do is go to the
public folder and that's going to open
this the start page up so this is kind
of a boilerplate or sample application
whatever you want to call it but it's
it's basically just a static page
there's no functionality to it now what
I'm going to do so we don't have to go
to localhost my blog and then public I'm
going to create virtual host in my
Apache virtual host file so if you want
to do that then you have to go to xampp
or zamp
and for now i'm just going to call it
zamp just for simplicity and then you
want to go to apache conf extra and then
this V host file right here so let's
choose to open this let's open this with
sublime
where is it
sublime text that's what I'm using for
our text editor
all right so that should open
wow this is slow
again I don't know if it's the virtual
machine or if it's Windows 10 alright so
this is the virtual host me see if I can
make this bigger so you guys can see
this Jesus Christ alright so you can see
down here we have some entries now this
right this line here if you've never
touched this file it's probably gonna
look like this with the comment here you
want to just make sure you take that out
all right and then what you want to do
is let's go ahead and just copy this and
paste it there and we're gonna do is
uncomment these two lines and we only
need let's see we only want the document
root and the server name that's all we
really need so I'm gonna get rid of that
can get rid of that and then uncomment
these all right and then the root is
going to be htdocs slash in my case it's
going to be my blog whatever you call
the folder slash public all right and
then right here let's change this to my
blog com
all right so that's gonna be the domain
for our application so let's go ahead
and save this actually you know what one
more thing I'm gonna copy this and what
the reason I'm gonna do this here is
because if we go to just localhost I
don't want it to go to my blog so I'm
going to say that the X htdocs root we
want little post alright just like that
so we'll save that and then we need to
do one more thing need to edit the host
file alright so what we're gonna do is
open up notepad and you want to run
notepad as an administrator alright so
make sure you do that you won't be able
to save it
all right and then we're gonna navigate
oops sorry
we're gonna go file open and we're gonna
go to C Drive windows system 32 and then
drivers and then et Cie and then over
here we're going to choose to view all
files alright we want the host file
Wow
okay so what we want to do now is let's
copy this line and we just want another
entry here and I'm gonna say my blog.com
alright and save it alright now we need
to restart apache so i'm gonna open up
my zamp panel and go to apache stop and
then start
all right so now we should be able to go
to my blog calm alright and that's gonna
take us right to our fuel application so
now that that's all set we're gonna open
up sublime text and make this bigger I'm
going to open the project in the text
editor which is in zamp htdocs in my
blog alright so we can see the files
over here and we're gonna be focusing
mostly in the fuel folder here and then
in the app folder
alright so in app you'll see that we
have a classes folder you open that up
and you have a controller folder this is
where all of our controllers are gonna
go so if we click on welcome that's what
we're seeing here alright so you can see
how we name the controllers controller
underscore and then whatever we want to
name it and then the actions or the
methods are going to be prefixed with
action so this is the index we also have
a hello let's see what happens if we go
to that
so if we say slash hello it just gives
us this hello world which is probably a
view so if we look at
let's see views and then the welcome in
hello and that's what we're looking at
you can see right here alright so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna create a
new controller so in the controller
folder let's say new file and let's save
this as posts dot PHP
alright I'm gonna keep this really
simple I'm not gonna be creating
categories or tags or anything like that
just very just simple posts alright and
I'm gonna copy you can close that up I'm
gonna copy what we have in the Welcome
controller for now paste it in and I'm
gonna get rid of all this junk you
should comment your code really well but
just for this I just want to get it you
know fit as much code as I can so let's
see we'll get rid of this stuff so we
just have the index alright
now if we for instance let's comment
this out and let's just say die and
we'll say post index then we'll save it
alright and then let's change this let's
go to slash post because that's the name
of our controller slash index or
actually I'm sorry post no that's not it
either
wait a minute here do we need to create
a route oh I still have welcome here so
this should be posts alright and then we
should be able to posts there we go
alright so post index and even if we
take away the index that's gonna be the
default alright and if we keep our
naming conventions this way then we
don't have to create a route for this
alright you can see it's just working as
is alright if we create another one and
we'll call this action
and then let's say post ad now if I go
back and I go post slash add we get post
at all right so obviously this isn't
what we want but we're gonna want to
load up a view alright so actually stay
in the ad and let's get rid of this and
uncomment this so this is how you can
load a basic view but we're gonna want
to change this to post and change this
to a view called ad all right now if we
try to load that it's going to give us
an error because we don't have that
template I'm sorry we don't have that
view so let's go to the views folder
down here create a new folder called
posts and let's create a new file save
it as ad dot PHP alright and then
what's going on here all right so then
we'll say add you all right now if I go
and reload we get add view now we could
do that or we could use the template
controller which is what I want to do
because right now every view if we want
to have multiple pages every view is
gonna have to have for instance a navbar
or head tags body tags and we don't want
that we want to have one layout or one
template that wraps around all the views
all right for that they believe that we
have something called the template
controller yeah
okay so this is pretty clear to shows us
what we need to do we need to extend
template I'm sorry controller template
and then we want to use this alright so
let's go ahead and change this to
controller underscore template and we'll
grab this and this this chunk of code I
actually like better than this so what
we'll do is just replace this and now
the data array this is going to allow us
to pass whatever we want to our view
alright
so the template title let's just change
that to template actually you know what
that's not right that's not where we
define that for the title this could
just be a page title once you say add
post all right and then the view we want
this again to go to post slash add just
like we had before alright and we're
going to save that and now in our views
folder we're going to create a file
right in the views folder and let's save
it as template dot PHP
alright now let's go to that file just
wait a second for this to load okay so
now if I open up template PHP let's just
put in here main and she'll make it up
each one and we'll say main template
save it and let's make sure our
controller saved as well and then we're
gonna go back to our add page and now
you can see that we're loading our main
template well that's all we're loading
we we can't see the view anymore
so what we need to do for that is we
just need to output a variable called
content dos a PHP echo content alright
it's really important that you use this
naming convention now if we reload now
you can see that we have our add view
and it's also wrapped in the template
alright so anything we want to show on
every single page can go right in the
template alright and then we don't have
to repeat that in every single view so
what I'm gonna do now is I don't really
care about design and creating a custom
template or anything so we're just gonna
get a bootstrap template so we'll go to
bootstrap com
and let's go to getting started and then
examples and we just have this right
here this starter template alright so
we'll grab actually
ah
I'm trying to think maybe we should just
use the blog template
yeah let's grab the blog template
alright yeah we'll grab this so what
we'll do is do a control you can get the
source code so we'll just copy
everything there and go to our template
dot PHP and I'm just gonna overwrite
this for now and we're gonna go to the
top and just work our way down and just
just change some things and remove some
things you can keep all this the title
for the title we're actually going to
echo out a variable called title alright
and then let's see for the CSS oh one
thing I didn't mention is that the
bootstrap CSS is actually already
included if we look in the public folder
right here and go to assets and then CSS
you can see we already have bootstrap
CSS same thing with the JavaScript so
all we need from this bootstrap site is
this HTML all right now those actions
it's actually a little snippet we can
use to to load the asset files alright
so I'm gonna get rid of this whole thing
here and we're just gonna say PHP echo
and then we want to say an asset double
colon CSS and then the file which in
this case is going to be bootstrap dot
CSS alright and that'll go ahead and
load that for us now the rest of this
stuff in the head that we can get rid of
and then there's one more CSS file we're
going to need if we go back to the
source code you'll see there's one
called blog CSS you don't want to click
on that and then we're gonna copy all of
this and then we're gonna go to our
public assets CSS folder and let's
create a new file there and we'll save
it as you could call it blog I'm just
going to call it style dot CSS all right
wait a second for that
okay so we're gonna paste all that in
save it close it up go back to the
template copy that and we're just going
to change this to style all right so
that should load both files for us now
just to check it I know this is all hard
code at HTML but just to check it out
make sure everything is loading let's go
back here and reload and now you can see
we have all that bootstrap code alright
so let's go back here and the only other
link that we're gonna want it besides
the home page which I'll just make a
slash is gonna be the add post page
alright like I said this isn't gonna be
a full featured blog I just want to show
you how we can build an app with just
basic crud functionality alright so
we'll say add post and that's gonna go
to slash posts slash add okay and the
home page what we're gonna link to the
post index in a minute okay now down
here let's see what else do we want I
guess the name of the blog it's just
changes to say my fuel blog
and change this text here just say a
simple blog built on few old PHP all
right and then down here I do now since
this is the add page actually that
doesn't matter because we're going to
take all this out but this this
formatting I want to keep on the index
page so what I'm gonna do here is let's
see where that ends blog post I just
want that I just want one of these posts
and I'm gonna cut that and then what I'm
going to do is go in my views folder and
the posts create a new file and we're
gonna save that as index dot PHP
and we're just going to paste that blog
post markup and save it
alright and then we'll go back to
template PHP we'll get rid of the rest
of these blog posts
all right and we know I don't need this
pager either and let's see that what is
that and
that's the row sidebar I want to keep
that
this one ends we're all right there okay
okay so so everything we want all the
content from the other views we want to
go right here so what's a PHP echo
content
all right and then we have the sidebar
here you can pretty much put whatever
you want I guess I'm just gonna keep the
about text right here I'm gonna get rid
of the archives because we don't have
that functionality and then this here
these are just like social links I guess
we can keep those down here in the
footer let's say blog
just a blog built with fuel PHP and then
down here we can keep the jQuery
we don't need actually we don't need any
of this we're not gonna be using
javascript so I'm just gonna go ahead
and get rid of that alright so we'll
save that and yeah that looks good so if
we go back to the add page and reload
you can see now we just have our add
view which is coming from this page
right here all right if we go to our
index we still see this alright and
that's not what we want so to change the
home page to change the controller and
the view and stuff like that we're going
to go to the routes so the route file is
gonna be in config and then routes and
then all we're gonna do is you see this
route right here we're going to change
this to posts index alright if we save
that and reload we get the post index
now let's go back to our index view and
we're not seeing this here because if we
go to the controller hopefully I'm not
confusing out you guys if we go
back to the controller we're still just
doing this we're not including the
template or anything like that
so what we'll do is just copy this
and we're gonna just change this to blog
posts and then change the the view here
to posts index all right now we'll go
back and reload and now we have the
index view showing which is right now
just a static blog post all right it's
just it's just in the markup it's not
coming from a database or anything like
that so now what I want to do is work on
the database okay so I'm using zamp and
that includes PHP myadmin
just get out of this stuff here this is
this is the demo all right so I'm going
to go to localhost / PHP myadmin
and if you're more comfortable using
some other database tool that's fine I'm
just gonna create a database called my
blog and we're just gonna create a table
called posts and I don't know let's just
say seven
all right so we know we're gonna want an
ID and that's gonna be auto increment
and it's also going to be a primary key
all right in addition to ID we're gonna
need a title that's gonna be a varchar'
will say 255 let's do a category even
though I'm not gonna have a category
table what we will have is just a
drop-down of text and we can put that in
here so this will be a varchar' 255 then
of course we need a body that's gonna
have text and then we're gonna have a
create date actually you know what let's
also will have a tags field but we're
not going to do anything with it really
besides just put it in the post if you
want to add on to this after that's fine
let's do that and then we'll do create
date and that's going to be a date time
and then for the default we're gonna
choose current timestamp alright so that
looks good
let's go ahead and click Save and what
we can do is just insert a couple posts
just to work with okay so this will be
let's say my first post category web
design body let's see I guess I'll just
grab some text real quick
all right so I'm just going to grab
couple paragraphs
and I'm going to put the paragraph tags
in here
all right tags let's say I don't know
a fuel blog test current timestamp
that's good and then the next one will
say my second post category this time
let's say programming body I'm just
gonna copy what I did here and tags
another set of tags
and we'll click go so that's going to
give us two posts in our table all right
so now what we want to do is we want to
fetch these and we want to output them
we want to output them right here on our
home page or not post index I should say
so let's go back to our controller and
actually before we go to our controller
we need to create our model so you can
see in the classes folder there's also a
model folder so we want to create a new
file and we're gonna save it as post dot
PHP and all we have to do here is just
create our model class and then include
the fields all right so this is really
easy I'm just gonna say class model
model underscore post and then we want
to say extends ORM slash model
and then we're going to create a
property with protected static
properties and that's going to be an
array and then all we need to do is add
in our fields as array properties all
right so we have an ID we have a title
category
tags and createdate all right that's it
that's all you have to do when I model
for what we are doing so if we go back
to our controller we can go like this
little slips gonna say posts equals
model underscore post find all right and
that's going to go ahead and grab all
the posts from the database now we need
to include this in our view so we can
loop through it and display it so in
this data right here in this data array
we're gonna say posts and that's going
to equal posts all right now we should
have access to this variable in our view
so let's save that and then what we want
to do is go back to our index view
remember we have this static static HTML
here so all we need to do here is a PHP
for each
and we're just gonna put in three toasts
as toast and then go down to the bottom
here and end it and then let's see we're
gonna make this post a little bit
simpler let's change that to PHP echo
post and we want the title
alright now this meta here I guess we
could put the date here you know what I
probably should have put an author but
that's fine if you guys want to do that
you can so we're gonna say PHP echo post
create these
and then under that we're going to put
our post body so let's see
so right here PHP echo host body
a little neater and save it
okay so we have an era or a model not
found oh that okay this there's two
things that we forgot to do one I'm
surprised I forgot which is actually
configuring the database so to do that
we need to go to our config and then
development and then DB PHP and then
we're going to change this to our
database oh shoot you know what actually
no yeah so route whatever your database
username is and then the password
alright and then we'll save that so
we'll save that and then there's one
other thing we have to enable the ORM
package which need to look up real quick
the ORM is the object relational mapper
and that's what's going to allow us to
interact with the database okay so this
is it right here we need this always
load array and then packages and we're
gonna load the ORM array I think I'm
sorry the R in package I'm going to copy
that and then we need to go to our
config and then config.php and then down
at the very bottom I think yeah right
here this always load I'm gonna get rid
of all this all these comments and we're
just going to paste that in alright so
let's save that and hopefully that fixes
this problem
okay so we have another property body
not found for model post did I forget
that I did okay so we just need to put
body in here in the model alright there
we go so now we're getting my first post
and my second post it's now getting them
from the database now one thing you
probably notice is that you can see
these paragraph tags all right so it's
not parsing the HTML if we want it to
parse the HTML then we're going to go
back to the controller and we're gonna
add a third parameter here and let's say
false all right and then we'll reload
and now it's gonna process the HTML now
another thing is we probably don't want
the entire post to show on this page
because this is just the blog role it's
just showing us you know we only want
like maybe the first couple sentences or
something so what we can do is we can
use the string class to truncate this
text so let's go to our view which is
our index and we want to go to where we
have the post body and we're going to
put in here and use the string class and
we want to use the truncate function
we'll grab this
all right and then all we need to do is
put in another parameter with the number
of characters that we want let's let's
see what a hundred looks like okay so
that's that I want to do a little more
than that
let's do 200 okay so that's alright and
then what we'll do is we need a link to
the view page which we haven't created
yet so let's just go ahead and we'll go
right under the body here and I'm gonna
put a link and let's actually give it a
class to just give it a class of BTN and
then BTN default okay that'll make it
look like a button and then we want it
to go to slash posts slash view slash
and then the ID which we can get from
post id
all right and we'll say
few more all right let's take a look at
that and we're going to want to put that
on a new line
yeah let's do another one
all right so now we have our view more
now that's not going to show anything
because we haven't created the view
action or the view view so we're gonna
do that so we'll go back to the
controller and I apologize if I'm moving
kind of fast I just want to I want to
cover everything in one video if
possible so now we need our view action
so we'll say public function action view
all right and we're gonna grab our
template code here our template
initializer and what we're gonna do now
is we're going to do something similar
to this except we don't want all the
posts we want a single post so let's do
post equals model post and we're going
to use find except this time we want to
pass in the ID which I figure out we
have to pass in here as well all right
so passing it in here it's gonna grab
whatever ID we put inside of the in the
URL all right now for this actually you
know what this isn't what I want to do
what I want to do is put in we want to
find first and then we want to put in a
second parameter which is going to be an
array and then here we can say where and
then that's gonna be an array and that's
where we can specify what we want all
right so we want the ID to match the ID
all right and then what we need to do is
add that to our data array oops so this
will be post and that will equal post
okay and then for this for the title we
can make this dynamic so we can say post
title and then we just want to change
this to the view to the view view and
then we need to create that let's go
down to views posts I'm going to create
a new file and we're going to save it as
view dot PHP alright and then in there
once that's created
open that up and let's just test it out
okay so if we reload this index and
click view more we get test perfect all
right and we should be able to access
whatever posts this equals all right now
I'm going to go back to the index view
just to copy some stuff here I just want
what we have in the for each and then
we'll put that in our view okay so we're
going to want the title that's correct
that's correct we don't want to truncate
at this time
and we don't want to view the view more
all right so let's save that
and now we get our post now you we're
not parsing HTML so we need to pass in
that same false parameter so we want to
go right here and pass in false and
there we go
so now we have our view page now I
initially wanted this to be all one
video but we are ok it's it's running
kind of long so there will be a part two
in the next part we're going to handle
writing to the database adding posts and
then ultimately we'll want to we'll want
