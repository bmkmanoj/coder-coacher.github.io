Adam is an incredible code editor for
web development and programming and if
you guys have watched my videos for a
while then you've probably seen me use
it quite a bit so in this video what I'm
going to do is take a default
installation of Adam and set it up with
my favorite packages and plugins now you
may not see me use all of these plugins
all the time and the reason for that is
because when I create videos and
tutorials I have to think about the
people watching especially for you know
the people that don't have much
experience in programming and I have to
think about if they're going to get
confused and it's going to make them
think they're doing something wrong if
they're not seeing on their screen what
what they're seeing on my screen so I
usually use very basic settings and a
minimal amount of plugins when I'm doing
my videos but building a production
application is a different story so
we're going to go through and we're
going to install some of the plugins
that I like to use with the atom text
editor alright so what I have here is a
brand new installation of atom there's
nothing but the core packages and
plugins installed and I've created just
a folder over here called my app and we
just have some empty files an index.html
file main.js file and a style.css file
there's nothing in these files at all
alright we just need them forward so I
can give you some examples of what some
of these plugins do now if you're new to
add them and you don't know how to
install packages it's really easy you
just go to file and then settings and
then click on install and you can see
you can search from here you can also
search for themes if you want and then
we have some featured packages listed
down here and then if you wanted to
search atom dot IO for packages you can
just click on the link right here and
you can see you can search from over
6,000 packages and they list some
featured one some trending recently
updated things like that and then if we
click on one of these you'll see it's
kind of like a mini documentation page
it'll give you any configuration info
you need gives you a list of bugs and
issues and things like that alright so
let's go ahead and get started with
installing some of these packages and
plugins
so the first one I'm going to install is
Emmet and Emmet is a toolkit for faster
HTML and CSS it allows you to easily
create tags attributes classes IDs and
even full document structures with very
short abbreviations now I'm not going to
focus too much on Emmet itself and the
syntax in fact I'm planning on creating
a separate tutorial for that I'm just
going to show you how to get it set up
and maybe just a little bit of the
basics so let's go ahead and search for
Emmett's which is EEE Mme T and then
we're just going to click on packages
alright and you'll see it's the first
one that pops up here it's by M at i/o
and it has over a million downloads just
so each package will show you how many
downloads it has and we're just going to
click install alright and once you
install a package you'll see it will
change to give you these options here
some of them have settings some of them
don't but you'll always see an uninstall
button and a disable button all right if
we look at the settings of Emmett this
will give you any configurations it also
shows us all the different key bindings
like I said I'm not going to go over at
Emmet itself I just want to show you how
to get it set up all right it also show
you how to install it manually you can
actually install you can install
packages from the command line as well
some more key keyboard bindings there's
actually not a lot of settings here so
now that that's installed let's go ahead
and just go into index.html and now
instead of you know typing out div class
give it a class of test and then having
to go and add the closing div like that
we can just simply do div dot test and
then click tab and that's going to give
us a div with the class of tests now
when you're using a div element you
don't even have to type Davout you could
just say dot test tab and it's going to
create the div for us if we wanted this
to be an h1 we could say h1 dot test tab
alright if we wanted to do an ID we
could say h1 number sign test tab that
gives us an ID of test if we wanted to
add a test and a class we could do that
so we could say h1 dot test 1 and then
let's say we wanted an ID of test
- and then tab and you'll see it gives
us a class in an ID and if we wanted to
do like multiple classes we could do H 1
dot test1 dot txt - tab and it gives us
that the two classes all right so it
makes things overall it makes things
much quicker and of course if you didn't
want an ID or a class or anything you
could do like ul tab and it'll just give
you the tags you can do Li all right
then you can do an a tag which by
default gives you an href attribute and
then another cool thing to do is just
put in an exclamation mark and click tab
and it'll give you an entire HTML
structure it will give you the doctype
the head and body tags HTML tags it'll
set up a viewport meta tag for
responsiveness so this saves you some
time as well so you have to type this
crap out all right now like I said I'm
going to do a video later on on Emmet
because there's actually a lot more
helpful things you can do but I'm not
going to you know I'm not going to put
all that stuff in this video all right
so the next one we're going to install
is called file icons which is really
simple it basically just looks at our
files and it gives us a little icon next
to it to better identify what type of
file it is because when you get into
working with you know frameworks like
angular you have typescript you have all
these different kinds of files readme
files and it's just it just makes it a
little easier to tell what each file is
so let's go ahead and search for file
icons and it's this one right here it's
by file icons has over 3 million
downloads we're going to go ahead and
install that all right now some of these
plugins you have to actually restart
atom and this is one of them so we're
just going to exit out here and then I'm
just going to go back in see where is it
ok and now if you look over here you see
the HTML has a AML 5 icon j/s icon css3
icon alright and then any other type of
file we created is going to have an icon
for instance if we say test dot PHP it
has a little elephant which is the PHP
logo alright I'm just going to delete
that and if we go into C let's go to
packages
then this is where all the packages we
install are going to show up so let's go
to settings and we have some stuff we
can do here if you want them to be
colorless we can uncheck that you'll see
now that black and white and it's the
only color when change which is pretty
cool you can have them black and white
and then if they're if you change a file
and don't save it it'll be it'll stay in
color which is kind of cool so your show
file show icons in tabs so if I open
this up you'll see there is an icon up
there as well but if I uncheck that it's
not going to show it in the tab so it's
all preference it's up to you guys what
you know what you want to do with that
and then there's some other options down
here as well and here's all the
different file icons what else you can
resize the icons as all types of
settings you can you can mess with if
you guys want to get into that
integration with other packages I'm not
going to get into any of the complicated
stuff but just another helpful plugin if
you guys are interested in that so this
next plugin you may have seen me use
quite a bit it's called atom live server
and it's by Jaz Chen and this lets you
open up your current project on a local
web development server on your local
machine it'll choose a specific port and
it'll open it up on your localhost and
this mimics a real hosting environment
not only that but it also gives you live
reload so every time you save a file
your browser will automatically refresh
so let's go ahead and search for atom -
live - server and it's going to be this
first one right here by Jaz Chen we're
going to install that all right so that
should be installed now if I go over to
my packages menu here and we go to right
here atom live server and we say start
server it's going to open up a browser
on your localhost by default it's going
to be port 3000 and this is that the
actual index.html file if I go ahead and
I minimize this and actually snap that
over there and let's open up index.html
and go ahead and put some structure in
here and we'll just put let's put an h1
and we'll just say
hello world and I'm going to just do a
ctrl s to save and it should reload on
its own save you know what I think we
have to restart Adam for the live reload
but if I reload manually you'll see it
loads so what I'm going to do here is
just stop it and let's exit out and then
open Adam back up okay and then we'll go
to Adam live server start server it's
going to open on a new tab and then
let's just add an exclamation here and
save and you'll see that it live reloads
I didn't have to actually click the
reload button but you do have to restart
it initially when you first install it
all right so that is Adam live server so
the next one we're going to look at is
actually just called to do and it does
just that let's just put two dews inside
of our code which is probably something
you've seen before but it also let us
open up a sidebar that shows us all the
different to do is in that particular
project so it will search all the files
list them all and we can actually search
for them and do some other stuff so
let's go ahead and just search for to do
and it is this first one here it's by
this RiRi RG Mir J I'm sure I butchered
that name but you want this one here
we're going to click install this one
isn't it's popular you see it only has
votes six-and-a-half thousand downloads
alright so let's go ahead and I'm going
to open up my JavaScript file and we'll
just put we can put anything in here I'm
just going to put a function called my
function and we'll just do a console log
and we'll say hello all right now let's
say we wanted to put it to do here to
tell us you know at some point later on
we want to run this my function so what
we would do is put a double slash and
then to do colon and then we could do we
could put whatever we want here so let's
say not create lips what I do
let's do run
my function okay we want that we want to
basically just save it for later
letting us know that we need to do this
in the future so let's go ahead and save
that and then what we can do is go to
packages and we can go to to do and
toggle and now over here in the side bar
you'll see we have this to do run my
function alright if we put another one
here we could say I don't know do
something else and save and then if we
just reload this you'll see that's going
to show up as well and it's under it
shows you the file it's in now this
isn't just for JavaScript we can go to
our CSS and what I would do is probably
just put a comment here and then do to
do and say I don't know add body style
all right we'll save that and then if we
go over here and reload you'll see we
have this style CSS and we have our
to-do right here to add the body style
so you can imagine if this was a big
application a big project and you had to
do this all over the place you could
easily see them here and not only that
but you can search for them so if we
search for my function you'll see that
that's it's going to filter out that
it's going to tell us the number of
files that were searched which is three
because we only have three files here
all right and if we go and we look at
the settings let's go to settings
packages and click on the settings for
the to-do package and let's see what did
I want to show you right here we can
ignore certain paths as well so for
instance if we have if you're working
with nodejs usually you have a folder
called node modules which is just all
your node packages and you're not going
to want to search all those files
because there there can be a lot of them
so if we sad let's say test j/s in here
and let's say there was it to do in here
and I'll just say anything and we save
that if I reload you'll see that it is
showing here right here node modules
test j/s but if we wanted to skip this
node modules folder altogether we could
just put it in
the ignored paths like that and then if
we go on we reload it's now not showing
that it's not searching that file at all
or that folder you can see search three
files okay so you can ignore files you
can ignore entire folders which is very
helpful and really you know help stop
from bogging it down all right so that
is the to-do plugin mini-map by Adam
mini-map is a package that gives us a
condensed version of the file on the
right side of the screen if you've ever
used sublime text and you probably know
exactly what I'm talking about
it's a feature that is is by default on
sublime so let's search for mini-map and
it's this one right here a mini-map this
has over three and a half million
downloads let's go ahead and install it
all right so if we go ahead and close
this up let's open up main j/s and it
doesn't have to be JavaScript it can be
any file and you'll see there's a little
mini version of it over here and if I go
ahead and paste in some code from
another script that I had open you'll
see that it's going to show over here as
well so this looks pretty much identical
to the one in sublime text so as far as
options if we go to our packages here
and let's go to mini-map settings we
have absolute mode which is going to
it's going to enable the the text to go
underneath the mini-map ok so right now
you'll see that it's just kind of a
sidebar and it splits it from you know
this side on this side but if I were to
check that absolute mode now well I
think we have to restart the editor but
what it'll do is it'll allow the text to
go underneath here okay instead of just
kind of cutting it off for for the whole
length of the page and see we have just
absolute mode height so apparently you
can adjust the height as well for the
absolute mode that's the adjustment map
with only if smaller character high
character width so there's a lot of
settings here I haven't really played
too much with it
it also has
compatibility with pigments which is
actually the next one I'm going to show
you opacity you can change that so you
can kind of see through it so this
there's some options to this but it's a
really simple plugin as far as
functionality so pigments is a really
cool plugin that will basically search
your your your project and your CSS for
specific colors and then it'll add that
color as a highlight behind the text so
this can be a color name it can be a
hexadecimal value an RGB value anything
like that so let's search for pigments
and right here now there's actually one
called mini-map pigments which enables
it on the mini-map plug-in that we just
installed so I'm actually going to
install both of these so let's click
both of those alright so I'm going to
close this up and now I'm going to open
up that style.css file and let's go
below that to do and actually let's say
we were replacing this to do with our
body and let's put in a background so
put a background of let's say black
alright and then it should just pop up
there it is so it just gives you the
color of that text now this isn't too
helpful because obviously everybody
knows what black is but not everybody
knows hexadecimal values so if we were
to say color and let's do a light gray
so f4 three times alright and it's going
to get that color and it's going to add
it to the background and we can also do
RGB so if we do an h1 here and let's say
we wanted background and we'll do RGB
and let's say we wanted to do 181 one
three seven zero so red green blue and
you'll see that it gives us this
yellowish color okay so any color format
it'll read and it'll give you those
colors now another cool thing if we go
ahead and save this and we go and we
click on what is a ctrl shift P to open
up our command palette and we search for
pigments
and let's see I want this right here
fine colors and then what this is going
to do is it's going to look in our
entire project for every color that
exists and it's going to list them here
and inside the file that they exist so
you can see the entire color scheme
visually which i think is pretty cool so
very handy for writing HTML and CSS all
right so this next set of packages has
to do with linting now I'm not going to
go into lending in detail it's basically
analyzing your code for potential errors
as well as checking style of your code
so make sure your code is written the
best in the best way possible now
there's a bunch of different linters for
different languages most of them have a
default set of rules to check for and
they also allow you to configure your
own rules and remove some rules as well
so it can get really complicated so what
we're going to do is we're going to
install tool in ters which is j/s hints
and JSC s by default J's hint will catch
serious breakable errors and things like
missy
missing semicolons and then J SCS is
more of a style checker it's much more
strict and second so I don't usually use
linters in tutorials because I don't
like issues popping up all over the
place it just confuses people
but linters are a good idea when you're
actually working on production code so
if we search for winter there's
basically a coral into our package and
then you can add on like you know JSC s
and J is hint there's there's all types
of them I'm not going to get into all of
them but let's go ahead let's install
this and then we're going to look for
two more and you see that some of these
packages actually need dependencies I'm
just going to click yes to install these
dependencies
all right this one too alright and then
I'm going to search for linter - Jas
hint and this is this one we want right
here to Flint OJ's hint will click
install all right then we're going to
search for winter JSC s and we're going
to install that all right so now that
those are installed we're going to have
to just get out of atom and then go back
in and then let's open up main jas and
notice we have some issues here and
these should all be JSC s you can see
down here it tells you the provider and
this is all just style based so things
like you know not putting a space there
just little issues like that with with
J's hint it's more serious stuff for
instance if I were to I'm just going to
get rid of this if I were to create a
variable and call it one which do I'm
sure you guys know is not valid in
JavaScript that's not going to work and
I'll just set it to a string of tests
and now if you look down here there's
actually one from J as hint that says
expected an identifier instead saw one
okay basically telling us that this is
not we can't use that as a variable and
then if we were to let's say create a
variable or do anything and then just
leave off the semicolon you'll see that
this also gives us an error but it's
yellow meaning that it's it's more of a
warning than an error all right and say
we should be able to I thought that that
would pop up but I guess not and down
here you'll see so severity warning
missing semicolon all right so it just
does things like that to better help you
debug your code not just debug but also
you know format your code in the best
way possible and you can see why I
wouldn't want to have the
enabled when I'm doing videos because
I'm trying to show examples I'm not
trying to you know write the right
perfect code so I don't want this stuff
popping up all the time alright and
there's a lot more to it I'm not going
to go into detail I'm just giving you
guys an example of of what this these
packages do this next plug-in is called
atom beautify and this works for just
about any language it'll automatically
clean up your code and make it more
readable with the correct indentation
and just you know beautify it so let's
search for Adam - beautify and right
here has over 3 million downloads you
can see it works with JavaScript PHP
Python Java C C++ pretty much anything
alright so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go and I'm going to search for
the jQuery X let's just take jQuery CDN
and see I'm going to click on the
minified version here and then just grab
this link I just want to get some
minified code that's that's the only
reason I'm doing this I'm not going to
get the whole thing I'm just going to
grab like up to here and then copy it
and then let's go to our main j/s and
just paste this in and you can see that
that's just an absolute mess and if I go
to packages and go to atom beautify
beautify it's going to go ahead and just
take everything and indent it correctly
and it's going to make it look nice and
obviously it's no longer minified but I
just use that to give you an example of
how good it is at you know making it
look a lot better and readable ok so
very very simple it's just it's
basically just some code cleanup alright
but in a very elegant and easy way
so chances are if you've been
programming for a while you've probably
used a stack overflow website quite a
bit when you've been stumped so the next
plug-in is called ask a stack and that
allows us to search for answers on Stack
Overflow without having to even leave
atom so let's search for ask and you
stack and see right here oh it's ask
stack by Chris 9/11 so let's click
install here alright and let's say we're
in the JavaScript file here I'm just
going to get rid of that and let's say
we wanted to look up how to sort an
array so we could actually do I think
it's ctrl alt a and we get this little
pop-up where we can ask questions so
let's say how do I sort I'll just say
how do I sort an array and then we can
search by language so we'll say
JavaScript and click ask and everything
comes shows up over here if I click the
link title here it'll open up in a
browser but if I want to show it right
in here we can just click on that it
will give us the question and the
answers okay which is really helpful and
save you some time you don't have to
keep going back and forth it's something
that's that's very very simple but again
can be very helpful
so highlight selected the last package
we're going to look at and this one is
very very simple it just allows us to
highlight some text or an expression and
it will search that file for any other
instances of that text so let's search
for what is it highlighted selected
chance right here we'll click and stop
all right and then if we go into main
j/s and let's say I don't know I'll just
say function function
okay and then if I were to highlight the
word function you'll see every other
instance of that word is going to be
highlighted okay so very very simple but
it is something that that can be very
helpful as well all right so that comes
to the end of this video now there's one
set of plugins and packages that I
didn't include here and that is that's
that's packages for specific frameworks
so if you're using something like
angular or react or laravel or anything
like that most of those have their own
packages for instance let's say we were
using view j s so we search for view
because you want to have the correct
syntax highlighting this is actually the
one I use is this language view so I'm
not going to go over every single
framework plug-in but those are also
ones that you probably want to install
if you're working with view a lot or
react or something like that okay so
that does it for this video guys
