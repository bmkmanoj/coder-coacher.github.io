we could add to dues to our list here we
want to do the edit and delete but one
thing I forgot is the view page okay
we're going to want a view because right
here we can't see all the fields we
can't see the description we can't see
the priority so we're going to go ahead
and do that
alright so let's go to our controller to
do controller and then go to deep yeah
details action and all we need to do
here is fetch we want to fetch the
single to do so it's going to be similar
to what we did up here in the list so
I'm going to just grab this whole thing
actually
and let's see we'll just paste that in
here
and let's change this to details and
then this is going to be a single to do
all right and then this is going to be a
single to do and we want all this except
we want to change find all to just find
and then we want to pass in the ID all
right so let's save that and now we're
going to open up the details view and
this page isn't going to be too
complicated let's put a link that's
going to go back to the index page so
it's going to go to just slash and we'll
say back to - dues and then let's put
the HR let's actually make that a button
all right let's make sure we don't have
any errors or anything
okay good so next thing let's put it in
each - okay this is going to be the
actual to-do name so we should just be
able to say to do dot name pick up kids
good
if we go back meeting with team view
there we go okay next thing let's do a
ul and let's give it a class of list
group
Oh aye it's going to have a class list
group item and let's make this category
okay then we'll do another one for
priority
all right and then under that let's do
our description oh we need to do date as
well
and let's put that in strong tags
okay
so it's this date time cannot be
converted to string no problem you're
just going to say date and let's copy
the formatting from the index not that
index
which is this right here I'm just going
to grab that
there we go all right so that's our to
do so back to to do is now what we want
to be able to do is edit all right
so for edit the Edit view is going to be
the same really as the add view so I
mean the create view so let's grab that
and put that right in there and I'm just
going to change this to edit to do so
that'll be the same so we'll save that
and then back in the controller in the
Edit action I'm going to actually copy
what we have here actually let's copy
this whole thing
paste it here and we're going to change
this to edit that's going to get the to
do that's passed in through here through
the ID and then we're going to go up to
the create action and we're going to
want what are we going to want all of
this
yeah we're going to want all that
and we're going to put that
right in between these two okay and then
we have some changes to make we actually
don't want this because it's not a new
to do it's going to come from heat from
this one here so we can get rid of that
and then let's check when it's submitted
we're going to get all the data from the
form that's going to stay the same
now this we're going to want this up
here as well because when the forms
displayed we want whatever's there in
the database to show so we're going to
put that up here as well
put it right here
all right
now we're not going to need persist and
then this line here I'm going to move
that and move that up above here alright
and then we're going to say to do
I'm going to say to do equals a.m. get
repository that bundle to do and then
find ID all right so I think that that
should work and then let's say to do
updated okay so let's save that and go
to an edit
undefined variable name
that's where
let's see let's go see the Edit
well that's fine
name equals form
oh okay right here we didn't set these
they should actually be coming from the
to do so we're going to go like that to
all of these
to date oh and then this we don't want
now
I'll say set createdate - well actually
you know what let's keep that now we'll
keep it as updated and then yeah let's
try that
context is private property name
what
- dusit name
oh these have to be functions we have to
add the parentheses
okay another error
undefined oh I'm an idiot brain fire
this should be yet what these should be
all of these should be getters so we
need to get category get description
and then this one that's not going to
work we're going to need get due date
alright hopefully that's the last error
nope undefined variable now okay so we
just need to take that and actually
we'll keep that and also put it up here
variable form does not exist edit
did I not pass it through I didn't so
down here we're going to pass in form
okay next ever
an exception has been thrown during the
rendering of a template must be an
instance
Oh same thing I did before we need to
create view instead of just form I don't
think we need to pass anything in but
we'll find out
there we go finally so you can see that
the the infos all there all right so
that's good so let's update this lets
say call client and then put into
clients name say John Doe alright so say
I have to call John
call client John Doe let's view it and I
have to call John awesome one thing I do
want to do though is in the Edit form it
says create to do I'm going to change
that so let's go to actually let's go
right where we are and just change this
right here to update to do
alright so sorry about that we had quite
a few issues there but they got worked
out so that's good yeah last thing we
need to do is just be able to delete
these these things alright so we have
our delete action down here or do we now
we don't
alright so let's create that I'm going
to copy this whole details action and we
want to change our little thing here too
to do slash delete
all right and then we'll change this to
delete
and let's grab
I want this right here this a.m. and
then find query
and we're going to just get actually you
know what we don't need any of this
let's paste that in there because delete
doesn't have its own view alright and
then we should just be able to say II M
remove and we want to pass in here to do
and then we'll do our flush all right
and then we'll just do our ad flash and
then redirect just like this
we'll change this to to do removed and
returned to the to do list perfect so
let's say that hopefully this works out
okay so let's see delete perfect oh you
know what one thing though we're not
seeing the messages so what we'll do is
let's go to our base HTML and we're
going to go right above the body block
all right and let's add some code here
we want upper sense and then we're going
to say this is going to be a for loop so
for last message in app dot session dot
flash I think it's flash bag dot get and
then the type which is going to be
notice
and
then we want to do our end
all right and then in here let's put in
flash message
all right so I just want to test it out
so what I'm going to do is go to my
delete action here and I don't want to
keep deleting things because I just want
to test it so I'm going to just get rid
of this for now whoops I don't want to
get rid of that I just don't want to
actually delete so let's reload whoa
so if I click delete
to do removed okay and if we want to
make that look a little better we can
add a div around it let's say alert
alert do we know we won't don't want
danger we want success
okay
let's try that
awesome alright and if you do want an
error message if you want to open an
error message you could do the same
thing and just change notice to error so
right here you could just change that to
error and then you can change this to
danger all right awesome so now let's
just click that delete back and we
should be good to go
or not the block body has already been
defined oh we don't want that twice
okay so we've created a complete crud
application using symphony3
so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
little course and always if you can
leave a like subscribe do whatever you
can that'd be really appreciated and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
