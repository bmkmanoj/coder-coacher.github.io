when we're logged in and it'll tell the
database it'll update the database with
the user ID so what I want to do now is
add a relationship between the blog
posts and the users and we want to be
able to display just the current users
posts in the dashboard all right then
we'll move on to access control and
things like that so what we'll do is
open up visual studio code and let's go
into the models ok so we want to go into
the post model and creating a
relationship is super easy all we have
to do is create a function here so we're
going to say public function and we're
going to call it user and then all we
have to do is say return this this
belongs to and then the Malta the model
of the user which would be AB slash user
so what this is saying is that a post
has a relationship with the user and it
belongs to a user alright so a single
post belongs to a user so let's save
that and then on the other side of it
we're going to go to the user model and
we're going to create a function called
posts and we're going to add the has
many relationships or return this has
many and then app / post
okay so we're saying that a post or I'm
sorry a user has many posts ok because
the user can have more than one post so
it's a one-to-many relationship so we'll
save that and just adding these these
two lines of code in these two files it
makes us so that we can use certain
certain queries and certain elements
that normally wouldn't be available to
us now in the dashboard
we want to fetch the post for that
specific user so let's go to our
dashboard controller and in the index
we're going to add some stuff here we're
going to say user underscore ID equals
and then we can get the the logged in
users ID by doing this all right and
then once we have that let's go ahead
and say user equals and then the user
model and we want to find by the user ID
okay and then we're going to pass along
to the dashboard we'll say with and here
let's say posts and since we added that
relationship now we can say user posts
just like that which is very convenient
so let's go ahead and save that and then
we'll go to our dashboard view dashboard
blade and what we're going to do here is
create a table so it's a table class
table and tables Striped okay and we
want to have a table row with some
headings so let's do TR and then here
we'll do th okay all we're going to have
is the title and then we're going to
have two other headings which will be
blank because that's going to be the
edit and the delete buttons okay so now
under here we're going to loop through
all the posts for that specific user
okay so for each clothes as host
don't need that and then let's put I'll
just copy that so this is going to be
the post title which we can just get
with post title and then we want the
edit button so that's going to be an a
tag so it's going to go to slash post
slash in the knee ID / edit alright
we'll give that a class of BTN and - BTN
default so let's check that so far class
HTTP control is you okay we got to bring
in the user model into the dashboard
controller so a POS a use app slash user
property post does not exist on this
collection instance what do you mean oh
this is wrong this should be user and
then ID with that and there we go so
that's going to show all of this users
post now what I'm going to do is log out
and then register as a new user we'll
just say test at test comm register
let's see not found all right so I think
that this is happening because there are
no posts on so in the dashboard where we
did our for each actually let's wrap it
around the whole table so we're going to
put if
count and you'll say if count yeah
posts is greater than zero then we want
to show all this stuff let's try that no
it's not it
oh that's spelt wrong wait a minute okay
so we're getting redirected to dashboard
that's spelt wrong so login controller
register right here spelt that wrong you
guys probably didn't do that so it
should be alright now now when we
register it'll redirect us to the right
place which will be the dashboard and
notice that John Doe has no posts so in
that that if statement in the template
here let's go and let's say else you
have no posts okay and we'll create a
post let's call it post five this is
post five by John actually we don't need
to put by John okay and now if we go to
our dashboard will only see post five
because that's the only one that we
created with this account and the edit
button should work okay and now let's
add a delete button so we're going to do
we're going to take the same stuff that
we have in the show view for the delete
which is this form right here and then
we'll bring it in to our dashboard view
into this th right here actually these
should be TVs not th's
all right so let's paste this in here
and that stuff should all be the same
we'll save it and let's create another
post just to delete okay so we'll go to
our dashboard and let's delete and there
we go so that works good now another
thing I want to do is make it so that it
says written on and then the date and
then the name of the user and since we
added a relationship we should be able
to do that so let's go to our post index
and go to right here we have written on
and now we should be able to do will say
by post and then we should be able to do
user remember we added that user
function with the relationship and then
we can get any user field and we want to
get the name alright so that should just
automatically work so let's go back to
posts and there it is so you can see it
has the right user will also do it on
the show page so let's just copy this
and go to show Glade and we're going to
put that right here so now both the
index and the show should have the
author's name alright so in the next
video we're going to start getting into
access control because we don't want
guests to be able to post and edit posts
we also don't want users to be able to
edit each other's posts so we'll get
into that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
