I'm gonna introduce you to the new
Parcel bundler and try not to have these
thoughts of we need another bundler like
we need another JavaScript framework or
a hole in the head
because I thought the same thing but the
simplicity and the speed of this thing
really caught my attention now webpack
is an incredible build tool it's very
popular and powerful and I don't think
it's going anywhere but with that said a
lot of people have problems setting up
web pack and learning it and configuring
it it's a bit confusing when it comes to
configuration so parcel has zero
configuration if you just want the basic
module loading and basic asset bundling
so you install it you run it and you can
use common j/s modules as well as es2015
modules right off the bat with not a
single line of configuration now if you
want to use parcel with something like
react then you'll need babel and there
will be a little bit of configuration
but not nearly as daunting as something
like web pack or some of the other
bundlers now web pack has been around
for a long time and you can do a lot
more which makes your workflow and your
devided development process more
scalable but if you're not looking for
those extra bells and whistles parcel
may be a better choice it's definitely
an easier and a faster choice and of
course it's very very new so there's
much more features to come so in this
video we're just gonna take a look we're
gonna set it up we're gonna create some
modules I'm going to show you how we can
use NPM modules how we can use sass and
do some other things with very very
minimal if no configuration at all all
right so let's go ahead and get started
coding dojo is a programming school that
turns beginners into developers and only
14 weeks over 90% of their grads land
jobs within three months of graduating
often making over 70 K per year to learn
more visit coding dojo com or click the
link in the description below all right
so this is parcel J s org and you can
get to the github page from here and
some of the documentation gives you
examples basically as far as features
right off the bat we can bundle all of
our assets and use modules we can use
code splitting we can make it so that we
can split output bundles so that we only
only load what we what's needed at the
time
hut-hut module replacement error logging
and of course speed and if we go down
here to the benchmarks you'll see that
parcel is about twice as fast as web
pack and browserify and if we use cash
it's about ten times as fast so there's
a significant speed difference here
which is definitely worth checking out
all right so let's get started here so
I'm gonna open up vs code now I'm using
Linux Ubuntu 17.10.2011 as well and
before we create any kind of file what I
want to do is just install parcel
bundler globally so I'm on Linux I have
to do sudo and then NPM install I'm
gonna do - g4 global and then parcel -
bundler alright we'll let that install
and I actually just did a video on
creating a babel web pack starter kit
where i basically built it so that we
could use es2015 modules we installed
babel and all that stuff and i want you
if you watch that video I want you to
see how much simpler this is we don't
have to create some kind of web pack
config dot J's file like we do with web
pack everything just works automatically
when it comes to loading common j/s
modules or es2015 modules ok so now let
me just clear this out and we're just
gonna do an NPM in it so we generate a
package dot JSON file we can just enter
through all this stuff here so now we
have a package dot jason and we don't
need to worry about that for now I just
want it there
and we're gonna create a new file called
index dot HTML and we'll put some markup
in it with Emmet so we'll use
exclamation tab and that'll just give us
some head and body tags and then this is
basically gonna be just a joke generator
I'm gonna use the Chuck Norris joke API
which just fat just allows us to fetch
random jokes I figured I wanted it to do
something I mean this isn't gonna be
like a full application a lot of it is
just showing you examples of what parcel
can do but I do want something on the
front end and it's just gonna be just
random jokes so in the body here for now
I guess we could put the mark up it's
very simple we're just gonna have an
idea of rap we're gonna do an h1 and I'm
just gonna put in the word joke and then
we're gonna have an h3 with the ID of
joke that'll be the placeholder for the
actual joke that's fetched and then
under the rap div I'm gonna put a
paragraph with the ID of copy because I
want to show you how we can also fetch
data from a text file using the FS
module or the filesystem module which is
actually a no js' default module so
that's our markup and then we of course
want to include our main script so we're
gonna say script give it a source of
dodd slash index dot JSON tree point so
let's create that file index dot JSP I'm
just gonna do a console log real quick
and we'll just say hello and save so
with parcel all we have to do to compile
in to run a dev server is say parcel and
then index dot HTML so if I go ahead and
run that you'll see it built in two
hundred and twenty two milliseconds you
can see that there's a dist folder it
has an index.html excuse me and a parcel
app.js file so this is the compiled code
now we also have a dev server
running on port one two three four so if
I were to go to localhost port one two
three four you're gonna see our
application and I'm just gonna snap it
over here and let's open up the console
and you'll see we get hello okay so it's
as easy as that to compile and run your
dev server so let's uh let's do some
module syntax here so I'm going to
create a new file not in the dist folder
you don't want to create anything in the
dist folder we're gonna create a new
file in the root called jokes dot J s
and for now we're gonna use common J s
syntax so we'll say module dot exports
and just for an example I'm just gonna
have an object with a name of John Doe
and then we'll go to our index J s and
we can simply say Const let's say Const
name equals require and then dot slash
jokes actually this should Beaton's make
this jokes so jokes is the variable that
we use to grab on to this module and we
know that it has a property called name
so let's say console log jokes dot name
and save and we don't want quotes and we
get John Doe so it's as easy as that to
use our module to use common J s modules
so let's do something better something
that makes sense and let's create let's
say module dot exports and let's make
this a function we're gonna get rid of
the name property which is just a string
let's create a function called get one
alright so we'll say get one is a
function and what I want to do is use
the Chuck Norris jokes API if I can just
pull that up real quick I don't know the
exact URL so I'm gonna just search for
Chuck Norris
jokes API and it's this I see what is it
I see n DB calm and this just gives us
lets you want to go to the choke no not
the jokes API and if we go down I just
want to get a single random joke so this
is the URL that we want to fetch so I'm
gonna first do this just using the fetch
API and we're gonna return it as a
promise so you're gonna learn a little
vanilla JavaScript in the process and
this is all stuff that's in my new
JavaScript course if you're interested
I'll put the link in the description
below so to return a promise we say
return actually let's do it without a
promise first just so I can kind of show
you how this works let's say fetch and
inside here we actually want to put that
URL so let's get that right here so
we'll copy that and we'll put that right
in there
and the way that fetch works we have to
do it returns a promise we have to do
dot then and we want to take the results
and we want to map it to res dot Jason
and then we can do another dot then and
we can get the data from it so we're
gonna say data let's say data and let's
just say console dot log data so we'll
save that and then let's go back to
index j s or we already brought in jokes
but let's go ahead and let's console log
jokes dot get one okay which is a
function so if we save that and we look
down here what happens is it's when
we're calling return actually we didn't
call return but we will we'll try it
will say return data and save now we get
undefined when we return what we're
seeing right here the result is is from
this console log that's gonna work the
return is not because this is done
asynchronously so what's happening is
it's actually getting its it's returning
before it's getting the data so there's
a few ways that we could handle this one
is with callbacks which I don't really
want to use so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna use a promise so if I were to get
rid of this console log and just return
the data and reload you'll see we just
get undefined so if we want to use a
promise what we'll do is wrap inside
here we're gonna wrap this in return new
promise and then inside here it's going
to take in we're going to use an arrow
function so we need some parameters we
want resolve and reject okay and then
we're going to set an arrow function
here
and then we're going to take this whole
fetch right here cut it and put it
inside of that return new promise now
whenever we want to return the data we
want to use resolve so this data right
here actually if we had if we if we look
at it let's look at it first what it
gives us and it gives us a value so data
and then we want value and then we want
joke see that specific joke is actually
in joke so it's gonna be data dot value
joke that's what we want to return from
this get one function so remember we're
using a promise so we want to say
resolve and then data dot value dot joke
like that
so now we'll save it we'll go back to
our index J s instead of console logging
jokes get one we want to just call it
and it's going to return a promise so
remember I promise we deal with with dot
then so we want to inside this dot then
it's going to give us the joke we're
gonna set that to an arrow and then what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say
document dot get element by ID remember
we have that idea of joke I'm gonna say
dot in our HTML and I'm gonna set it
equal to the joke that's being returned
right here which is being sent right
here through this resolved so let's go
ahead and save that and there we go we
have a joke that outputs to the browser
if I reload it's going to give us
another one so every time we reload it's
gonna be a new joke now we could do the
same thing using es2015 modules instead
of the common j/s syntax so let me just
show you how to do that we'll go ahead
and comment this out and then es2015
modules looks like this so we'll say
import
jokes from dot slash jokes okay now it's
not gonna work now because this side
isn't right the jokes j/s we're still
using modular sports which is common je
s so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy
the entire get one function so this
whole thing here and then I'm going to
just comment this out all right and then
to use the es2015 syntax we're simply
gonna say explore Const jokes set it to
an object and then we're gonna paste in
that get one function alright and then
we'll save this and now if we reload it
works alright so you can use this syntax
which is the es2015 module syntax or
calm and J s which is basically the the
nodejs syntax now we're not we're not
restricted to our own modules we can
install anything we want from NPM so
let's say we wanted to use Axios instead
of fetch which I wouldn't I wouldn't
recommend I'd recommend using a native
API over something like Axios but just
to do let's say you wanted to you could
go ahead and install Axio so we'll say
npm install
Axios and we can bring that in up here
we can we can even use es2015 syntax
actually we don't want those so Axios
from Axios and again I'm gonna just
comment this out just so you guys have
it for reference and then let's say
export Const jokes just like we did
above and again we'll do get one
and what we'll do is we'll also return
this as a promise so we want
excuse me resolve reject and then in
here we can use
Axios so we'll say Axios get paste in
our URL which is this hopefully you guys
are learning a little more than just
parcel in this video so
Axios returns a promise so we're gonna
say dot then and inside here we're gonna
get a result or a response and we're
gonna set that to a code block and we're
going to resolve because we want to
return a promise as well so resolved and
then we're gonna get it from res data
dot value dot joke because Axios
actually adds on this dot data to the
res so that's why we did res dot data
value joke as opposed to up here we just
did data dot value joke so that should
do it let's save and let's reload looks
like the server stole yeah we need to
start the server up again with parcel
index see how fast that compiled and
there we go
so we're now using Axios in our
client-side application without a CDN or
without downloading and putting a script
tag or anything we simply installed it
with NPM just like you would do with web
pack except it's much easier so let me
give you another example of using a
module from NPM so I'm actually going to
install jQuery now I wouldn't suggest
this but I just want to do it as an
example so I'm going to ctrl C stop the
server and we're gonna say NPM install
jQuery
all right and we'll go ahead and we'll
go up here in our index J s and we'll
say import money sign from jQuery and
then instead of using document dot get
element by ID which I would not suggest
if you guys have watched my JavaScript
course you know that I am I don't like
using jQuery for any Dom manipulation I
think it's uncalled for it's not needed
it's just extra baggage but I just want
to give you an example of using another
module that we can install and use so
let's say ID joke and say dot HTML and
it'll pass in actually we use text so
jQuery our joke dot text and pass in the
joke variable save let's start the
server and it should do the same thing
so if we reload there we go so now we're
using jQuery now what if we wanted to
output just some text from a text file
so we could do that as well so I'm gonna
create a new file called let's call it
copyright dot txt and here I'm just
gonna say copyright I'm gonna say 2018
it's close enough so just put the text
copyright 2018 and what we can do is we
can go back to our index J s and we
could go ahead and import the FS module
which is a default nodejs module that
deals with the file system and we'll say
import it from FS and then down here
what I'm gonna do is create a variable
called copy and we're going to set it to
FS and we're gonna call the read file
sync right here read file sync method
then we're gonna pass in double
underscore darn aim so the current
directory and then we're going to add on
to that slash
copyright dot txt and then we want the
encoding which is going to be utf-8 like
that okay so now we have a variable and
whatever we have in that txt file should
now be in this variable so if we were to
use jQuery which I don't really like to
do you guys know that but we'll say dot
txt and it'll pass in copy and save
let's see what did I do wrong here no
such file no such file parcel app caught
all I spelled it wrong I forgot the why
all right there we go and there it is so
now we have this text
let's see it'll start the server again
so now we have this text right here that
is actually coming from a text file
okay so we're using the filesystem
module to do that all right now for
those of you that are kind of new to
this and kind of new to web pack what's
going on is everything we're including
here is being bundled into this parcel
app.js file if you look at our actual
compiled folder here dist it's simply an
index.html file that points to Parcel
app J s if we look at parcel app J s it
is just a huge file that has everything
that we've done so far all compiled into
this one file or bundled into this one
file ok so instead of including all
these separate script tags and all these
separate files you're using modules
internal modules to to create this this
partial app file all right so what about
CSS okay so let's do some stuff with CSS
so we'll create a new file not in the
dist
keep doing that in the root we're gonna
create a file called style dot CSS and
let's go ahead and let's put an h1 here
and we'll say color
red and let's say for the wrap we have
an idea of rap and for that I'm gonna
say display flex or flex and let's say
justify contents let's do Center let's
say a line content Center let's say a
line items Center and let's do padding
five pixels let's do border one pixel
solid and let's make it a grade arc gray
and then a border radius and there's a
reason I'm doing this and I'll show you
in a second
so border radius four pixels and then I
also want a box shadow and box shadow
will be 0 10 pixels 10 pixels and then
rgba and we want black so 0 0 0 and then
0.12 for the opacity alright so let's go
ahead and save this and then let's go to
our index.html and include this style
sheet just like we would normally and
save okay so that's what it looks like
let's say I just want to add a little
padding on the h1 so padding right we'll
say one REM
okay so now we have our random joke
generator with some CSS now what I want
to do is I want to use post CSS so post
CSS if we go to github is a tool for
transforming styles with JavaScript
plugins and there's a bunch of things
you can do and you can you you can do
all this functionality with parcel so
what I want to do is add the
autoprefixer which will add vendor
prefixes automatically so for like
Safari and other browsers it'll add
prefixes where it needs to so to do this
we're gonna install autoprefixer which
is an NPM module so let's stop the
server down here and you don't have to
do this stuff I'm just trying to give
you guys some examples of what you can
do so let's say npm install autoprefixer
let my spelt that wrong
okay so now that we have that installed
all we need to do is add a file over
here if we want to use post CSS we need
to add a dot say new file it's going to
be dot post CSS RC and in this file we
just want to put in some brackets and we
want to specify the plugins or post CSS
that we want to use and we want to use
autoprefixer so autoprefixer and we're
gonna set that to true and that should
do it
let's yeah that's good let's save that
all right so now when we save our
stylesheet I'm just gonna resave this
and then let's go ahead and run I'm
gonna clear this out and let's run
parcel index.html that should compile
everything and run our server and let's
go into the dist folder and look at our
CSS file so now if we stretch this out
you can see CSS and look at that so
display Flex we have all of these
prefixes the WebKit box pack ms flex
pack all this stuff for other browsers
web pack box shadow all stuff that we
didn't have to add by default and we
don't have to worry about so
autoprefixer can be really helpful for
maximum browser compatibility and
basically the only configuration we had
to do was this simple RC file right here
with the autoprefixer plugin alright
another thing we can do is we can
actually use sass so first is first I'm
going to just create an extra CSS file
so I'm gonna call this backgrounds dot
CSS and in this file I'm just gonna say
body and we're going to set the
background to a light gray so
that there and then we can go to our
style dot CSS and we can go and we can
simply say at import backgrounds dot CSS
actually want to do dot slash it's in
the same directory and let's save and
reload oh I forgot a semicolon alright
so we'll save that and now you can see
the background has a light gray just to
make sure because that is really light
let's do a black okay so you can see
that that is being included now we can
also use s CSS or sass files so of
course we do need to install node sass
so I'm just going to clear this out and
say NPM install No - yeah no deaths
- sass
okay and now excuse me what I'm gonna do
is change this background CSS which is
right here I'm going to change the name
to s CSS like that and then I'm gonna
create another file called colors dot s
CSS actually let's call it it's called
variables dot s CSS and we'll set a
variable in here so we'll say variable
light gray and this is just sass syntax
and we'll set it to that and then we'll
go to our backgrounds s CSS now the
reason I change it to s CSS is we can't
use variables in a CSS file so it does
have to be s CSS to be able to use the
variable so we'll say light grey save
and then go to style dot CSS and just
change that to it we're importing now
backgrounds s CSS and save and reload
whoops we need to start our server first
okay so we'll reload I looks like let's
see what's going on here oh you know
what I didn't include the variables
inside the backgrounds file so we need
to say import dot slash variables dot s
CSS and save and there we go so now if I
were to go on variables and change this
to let's say red and save and reload
there we go
so we're now using sass so as you can
see this is very very easy to implement
all these different development
technology SAS modules autoprefixer x'
and everything that comes with post CSS
you also have post HTML you can use you
can install babel plugin so you can do a
lot with parcel and and i'm just getting
into it it's
new this is just kind of what I've what
I've gotten so far I hope I didn't
confuse you guys with like the jokes
with using promises and fetch and all
that stuff I hope that wasn't confusing
but my point is just to show you that we
can create our own modules you could
have just exported a single string if
you wanted but I wanted to do something
that was kind of fun and maybe taught
you something else along the way all
right now if we stop our server and
close everything up whoops okay so this
in our route here is just all of our
development stuff right this dist folder
this is our actual application that we
can upload to whatever github pages a
shared host anything so what I'm gonna
do is in the distal der I'm gonna go to
index.html and I'm just gonna open it
with live server which has no no
compiling or anything like that it's
simply going to load the HTML file I'm
gonna close this first and then say open
with live server and we get our
application so I can reload we're gonna
get a random joke each time and we can
do what we want with this application
that uses all of this bundling all right
so I hope this wasn't too long guys and
I hope it was clear and hopefully you'll
take a look at this and use it in the
future I really there's not too many new
technologies that I get excited about
but I really think that this is gonna
take off because it's so easy to use and
it gives you a lot of the stuff that's
something like web pack gives you but
much faster and much easier okay so
