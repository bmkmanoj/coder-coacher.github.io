discuss some of the CSS units of
measurement that confuse new developers
and designers and that's REM m vh and VW
okay but we're mostly going to focus on
REM and M now for a long time we use
fixed pixels or P X units which is very
simple to understand 12 pixels is always
12 pixels no matter what well R M and M
are relative and the difference between
the two is what their relative to okay
now they're both relative to font sizes
but M is always relevant re REM is
always relative to the root element
which is the HTML element and then M
units are relative to their parent
element okay or the element that the
child is used by so let me show you
exactly what I mean cuz obviously that
that can be kind of confusing what I
just said so I what I have here is an
index.html file and in the body all I
have is a div with the class of box and
then a paragraph inside of it with some
dummy text alright and then I have it
linked to a style sheet which I don't
have anything in yet alright yeah over
here you're seeing the the HTML file and
you're also seeing my google chrome
tools now what I want to do here is I
want to grab this paragraph so we're
just gonna put in a piece selector for
our paragraph and we're gonna set the
font size to one rep alright and we're
gonna save that now we're not gonna see
any difference because the default font
size is 16 pixels for the HTML element
or for the page now if we go over here
on our chrome tools and so you know I
can make this small or make this bigger
okay so if we go over to our chrome
tools here and we go on the paragraph
that we just created which is right here
and down here where our Styles are we
can click on computed and you can see
that the font size is actually 16 pixels
okay so the browser takes that one REM
and it converts it into pixels now this
is relative to the HTML font size okay
so right here this HTML tag if we click
on that it's relative to that font size
which by default is 16 pixels now what's
cool about REM is that the user can
actually control the size of the font
from their browser settings so if we go
to sewers its settings and we go down to
appearance and we go to font size you'll
see that we have medium recommended is
the selected but if I go and change it
to large you'll see that the font
actually got bigger okay if we change it
to very large it gets bigger if this was
just regular pixels like let's say 16
pixels and save that has no effect so
that's that's one reason alone to use
REM is that the user can actually
control we can't control the font size
like that so it's great for
accessibility people that have you know
vision vision disabilities and so on
alright so let's just put that back to
medium so that that's one reason to use
REM now like I said this is this is 16
pixels by default now you can of course
change the HTML font size so if we say
font size for HTML 10 pixels and save
this is going to go down to 10 pixels
okay one REM is going to equal whatever
the font size is here now if I were to
change this to 2 REMS this is now this
is a multiplier so it's going to take
the font size and it's going to multiply
it by 2 so if I save that you can see
down here if I hover over the paragraph
and we go to computed the font size is
now 20 pixels because it's double what
the the core HTML font size is now of
course you can use decimals here as well
so if we say like 1.5 REM and save now
you can see that it's 15 pixels all
right if we were to say let's say 6 REM
you can probably guess what that's going
to be it's gonna be 60 okay it's going
to multiply this by six
okay so hopefully that makes sense now
I'm gonna set this back to one REM and
I'm going to just get rid of that so
it's back to its original 16 pixels now
you don't you can use REM on more than
just the font size so and you should so
let's go ahead and let's put a border in
here and we'll say let's just put one
REM to begin with and see what that
gives us and we'll say black solid so by
default one REM of course is gonna be 16
pixels because that's that's the root
elements pixel size for the font but
what we would want to do here is take a
percentage of that so let's say zero
point one REM and then if we look over
here you'll see that the border size is
now 1.5 something pixels
okay so let's add some padding here so
padding so padding I'm actually gonna
set to the same as the font which is
gonna be one REM which is going to be 16
pixels alright but of course you could
change that if you want if you wanted to
do like 0.5 REM you can see that the
border is now I mean I'm sorry not the
Board of padding is now 8 pixels okay
it's gonna be half of 16 pixels but I'm
gonna keep it at 1 rim now if I were to
go back into my settings so let's see
settings and we'll go to font size very
large and you can see that now not only
has the font size increased but also the
the border and the the padding has as
well you can see font size is now 24
pixels and the padding is 24 and then
the border is 2.3 something pixels okay
so it gives it gives the user that
control if we say very small it's going
to decrease all of that stuff the font
the border
in the padding alright let's put that
back if this stuff was set to pixels and
it was all fixed that wouldn't make any
difference at all all right so it's
really not that hard to understand it's
just relative to the HTML font size okay
and one REM is equal to by default 16
pixels unless you change it here or you
change it in your browser settings or
whatever so now let's move on to M now M
works the same way except it's not just
relative it's not relative to the HTML
it's relative to its parent element now
this paragraph has a club a div with the
class of box wrapped around it so what
I'm gonna do here is let's say dot box
and let's set the font size let's see so
we'll say it will set the font size to
let's say 30 pixels all right now if I
save this we're not going to see any
difference because again REM is relative
to the root HTML but if I were to copy
this and then we'll just comment that
out and then we'll change this to M
units okay instead of REM and save now
you can see that it's relative to box
it's relative to its parent element if
we look down here at the the the
computed Styles you can see for border
we have 3 pixels for font size 30 for
padding 30 because that's they're both
set to 1m now if we didn't have a parent
okay so if we get rid of this right here
this body
I'm sorry box font size 30 if I comment
that out and save then it's gonna work
like Ram it's gonna be relative to the
HTML if I were to set font size 10
pixels you'll see that it'll change
because this the HTML is in fact the the
parent of the paragraph okay now if I go
when I change my settings over here
let's first of all get rid of that and
save so it's back to normal and if I go
to my settings and change to very large
you'll see that it'll also change here
very small all right so you can still do
that even with MS now that won't work if
I want to just go back to okay so it
won't work if you're not you using the
core HTML element so now if I go very
small you'll see that didn't change okay
it's not gonna work if your parent
element actually has a defined font size
okay hopefully that makes sense alright
so there's not much more to be said
without overcomplicating it that that's
that's the basis of how MRAM works REM
is relative to the root element M is
relative to its parent element okay and
it's always relative to the font size
all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna comment all of this out and
now we're going to talk about V H and V
W which is viewport Heights and viewport
widths so I've talked about this in a
few videos before I have the full screen
video background that I just did also I
have a landing page with a full-screen
image the in those videos I talked about
VH of V W so if you saw those and you
probably already know this stuff but
basically if I set the box okay remember
we have a div with a class of box and
we'll set the background to blue all
right we'll save and by default it's
just gonna be you know just that div now
let's set a height for this and let's
set it to 20 VH all right and we'll save
now what this is gonna do is it's going
to take up 20 viewport Heights so if we
look at the height of the browser right
no matter how small no matter how
maximized it is or whatever you can
think of it as a hundred slices across
okay and what we've set it to is 20 of
those hundred slices so you can see it
takes up 20% of the height if I were to
set it to 50 you'll see that it takes up
half of it and and this is no matter how
how this is resized if we go and we can
actually close this so if we resize it
down to this you'll see it's always
gonna be the same it's always gonna take
up half all right now for the full
screen image landing page that I did in
the video landing page we set this to a
hundred so that it was it would always
cover you know a hundred percent of the
of the height no matter how how we
resize this now the space you're seeing
on the sides here and at the top this is
from the padding and margin from the
body also from the power graph here
paragraphs by default they have a margin
of I think it's ten pick or five pixels
on the top and bottom so to fix that
what I would do is add a reset so we can
say asterisk which means every element
on the page but it's just my zero out
the margin padding like that and save
and now you'll see there's no spaces now
if we go and we add something below the
box remember that box is what has the VH
100 if we were to add let's say an h1
under here and we'll just say whatever
hello and save you'll see that no matter
how we resize it we still we don't see
anything below the box okay until we
scroll by scroll down now we'll start to
see the rest of the content so this is
how fullscreen landing pages are made at
least this is one way this is the way
that I suggest all right so that's VH
and then we also have VW which is
viewport width now you don't need to use
this as often because as you can see it
goes all the way across it's a block
level element but we could set width to
let's say 50 V W if we do that and say
if you'll see that it'll take up half of
the page
okay and if we set it to 100 it's gonna
go all the way across just like it was
anyways alright guys so hopefully this
helped you understand a little bit about
RAM em and the viewport height in
viewport with units now it's up to you
what you want to do if you still if you
want to use fix pixels or whatever
that's absolutely fine it's all
preference I'm not gonna say there's a
right or wrong way to do everything but
if you want your site to be the most
responsive it can be if you want it to
if you want users to be able to control
the overall scale of the site for
readability then I would suggest using
RAM units alright you know frameworks
like bootstrap for they've moved from
using fixed pixels to REM units just to
make things more responsive and more
more readable alright so that's it guys
