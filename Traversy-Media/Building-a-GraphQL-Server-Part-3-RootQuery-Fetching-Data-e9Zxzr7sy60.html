our server our Express server we
implemented Express graph QL we created
a schema file and we brought in
everything we need from graph QL and we
exported the schema now we're getting an
error down here saying that the schema
query must be an object type but got
undefined now the object type we need to
create is a root query ok so a root
query is kind of like the baseline for
all other queries and all other object
types so what we'll do is we'll go right
above it we'll go right here and looks a
root query and we're going to create a
variable called root query ok we're
going to set that to new and then we're
going to use this right here graph QL
object type now we're going to create a
couple object types actually in this
project we're only going to create a
customer object type but you can create
as many as you want okay if you're going
to have all different types of data for
instance maybe customers had products or
something like that but the one that you
do need is the root query ok so that's
going to be a graph QL object type
that's going to take in and objects
we're going to put our curly braces and
all object types need to have a name
this one is going to be root query type
ok and then we basically want to we want
to be able to query individual customers
as well as the entire list of customers
so all customers so let's go right here
and we'll say for the individual
customer we're going to set up this
object and we're going to say it's going
to have a type of customer type ok now
it doesn't know what this is yet so
we're going to go ahead and create a
customer type so let's go right above
the root query we'll say customer type
and we're going to create a variable
called customer type
okay and we're going to again set it to
new graph QL object type just like we
did with the root query okay and again
this is going to take in an object with
a name okay in this case it's going to
be customer now we want to define the
fields that we want for a customer so
let's say fields and we're actually
going to set this to an arrow function
okay look so we're going to set this to
a set of parentheses and inside here we
want some curly braces so we're going to
set our fields we want to have an ID I'm
going to set this to be a graph QL
string so we're going to say type graph
QL string okay now remember we brought
this in up here you want to bring in any
type that you want for your data fields
you want to bring in the type up here so
ID let's also do a name okay so the name
is actually going to be a string as well
so let's say type graph QL string now
we're also going to have an email which
will also be a string so I'm just going
to copy that and we'll say email and
then we'll have an age okay so the age
is actually going to be an integer so
this will be graph QL int okay I
remember we brought that in up here so
that's it that's our customer type
basically we're just giving it a name
and we're giving it fields so let's go
back down to our root query and now it
should know what a customer type is now
remember we can use any kind of data we
want any kind of database if we wanted
to use MongoDB we couldn't we could
install Mongoose and we could make our
queries and I'll show you where we would
do that but for now we're going to just
put some hard-coded data in here okay
we're going to work with JSON server
later but for now let's just put some
hard-coded data okay just so we can see
how this works so what I'll do is just
create a variable called customers and
we're going to set that to an array of
objects which will have an ID to be a
string of one
we'll give it a name of John Doe email
say J doe at gmail and then an age
you'll say 35 oops
page 35 okay age is an integer that's
why we don't have a quotes around it so
let's go ahead and just copy this and
then we'll put in two more people here
two more customers so two and three and
we'll just change this up we'll say
Steve Smith change the email here we'll
say Steve is 25 and then let's make this
one we'll say Sarah Williams change the
email and we'll say that Sarah is 32 so
now we have our data okay like I said it
doesn't matter where the data comes from
at this point so now let's go down here
to our root query and we want to go
inside of customer okay which has the
type of customer type and then we're
going to also give it some arms okay so
we want to fetch the customer by its ID
right so we have to specify that here so
ID and we're going to also give this a
type so it's going to be a graph QL
string and then the next the next value
we're going to put here is going to be a
resolved function so we're going to say
resolved and this is going to take in
two things it's going to take in current
value and args all right and then here
is where we actually want to resolve our
response now since we just were just
using hard coded data what I'm going to
do is I'm going to loop through the
users or the customers and we're going
to find the customer that has the ID
that they're asking for and we're going
to return it so let's go ahead and do
that so we'll just put a for loop and
we're going to say let I equals 0 and
we'll say as long as I is less than
customers which is the name of our array
dot length
and we want to just increment by one and
then what we'll do is we're going to
search for the customer that matches the
ID that they ask now when they query it
by ID we can access it through this args
so we can say if customer customers I so
the current iteration that we're going
through in the four loop dot ID is equal
to args ID okay which is the ID they are
looking for then we want to just simply
return that customer so returned
customers I so that current iteration
and that's it now later on when we use
JSON server we're going to have we're
going to make an actual request in a a
get request to get the customer but for
now it's just hard coded so we're going
to return it like this all right so now
what we'll do is we'll go down here to
our schema and we're going to put in
query and set that to the root query
okay and that's it so let's save that
and let's try and let's restart this
manually okay and we're getting an error
here so fields must be an object with
field names as keys or a function which
returns such an object all right so
let's see fields must be an object oh I
didn't this should actually be this
customer here this needs to be wrapped
in a fields object so fields just like
we did here fields so we just need to
grab this customer which ends right here
we'll cut that out and put it inside
fields because it's looking for that
fields and it's not finding it
let's see it's just fix this up alright
so let's try that
alright so see we're still getting an
error ID argument must be input type but
got undefined
let's see but god undefined so I D
always got the type going to say type
there we go alright so now our server is
running so now hopefully we should be
able to access graphical and we should
be able to query a customer so let's go
ahead and go to our browser and what
we're going to do to get the graphical
is localhost 4000 slash graph QL and
there we go so here's our interface and
let me just clear this out you guys
probably won't have that ok so you'll
probably see something like this which
is like a welcome but we're going to get
rid of all these comments and we're
going to make a query now remember the
query is very simple it's actually very
close to how the data is formatted we're
going to put some curly braces let me
just make this bigger and we're just
going to say customer we want to fetch
the customer by its ID
let's get customer 1 and then we have
some curly braces and we want to define
what we want back from that customer so
let's say we want name email and H now
to run it you can either press the play
button here you can do ctrl enter and
there we go so we get back our data we
get back customer name John Doe email
and age all right so if we want to get
customer to let's go ahead and press
play and get Steve Smith 3 we get Sara
Williams if I try to get 4 we're going
to get null because we don't have a
customer with ID for now we're just
dealing with hard-coded data right we're
dealing with this right here but like I
said you can use anything you want if
you wanted to use Mongoose if you want I
just did a video on using nodejs with
MySQL if you wanted to use the MySQL
client through nodejs you could do that
you could grab your data
that way so it's it's really powerful
where you can use any you know any stack
you want really and of course you know
limited to JavaScript you can use graph
QL with Python or PHP or c-sharp or
anything else all right and we're
getting specific data because if we want
just the name we can just take those out
and run it
let's get ID one and now it's just
giving us back the name rather than you
know with a standard rest api giving us
a whole shitload of data that we don't
need now another cool thing about
graphical is if we look over here we
have something called the documentation
Explorer and it shows us basically a map
of our data so we have the query right
we have a root query type if we click on
that it's going to show us that we have
a customer field that takes in an ID and
has the type of customer okay and by
type I mean this right here okay so our
customer type now imagine if you had a
bunch of different a bunch of different
types
it would they'd all be listed here and
if we click on customer it'll give us a
list of arguments so it's a nice little
map of your data it doesn't really show
us much because we have such a little
amount of data but if we had you know
customers products maybe like product
reviews and all types of stuff it would
all show here and we have a nice little
map of the data okay and we can use any
kind of any kind of client to access our
server we could build a react app
location using you know Apollo or
something like that and we will get into
that in another series but this is
really powerful it may not seem like it
at first but it really is a powerful
technology alright so before we get into
mutations and actually changing data on
the server and get into you know Jason
server I want to make it so that we can
get all customers not just an individual
so in the root query type fields let's
go right after the customer put a comma
here and we'll say customers okay we're
going to set that to some curly braces
and then give it a type now in this case
since we're getting all the customers we
want to set it to graph QL
list okay so I want to set the graph
you'll list and then we want to put in
the type that we're getting which is
customer type okay and then we just want
our resolve now notice we don't have any
args because we don't need any because
we're not fetching it by the ID like we
are here so resolve is going to take in
parent value args and then all we have
to do here since we're working with
hard-coded data we can just return this
okay so we'll go here and we'll say
return customers and let's save that and
then we should be able to go back to
graphical let's clear the cell and all
we have to do now is say customers
customers and then let's say we want the
name
okay so we'll press play to expect the
name phone you know what let me restart
the server all right let's try that
again
expected named fond customers it
actually should pop up when I spoke
there we go customers oh I'm an idiot we
didn't need the parentheses where we
weren't passing in anything any idea or
anything so we actually don't need those
parentheses but let's go ahead and also
request the name email and you'll see we
get these pop-ups these hints telling us
the different fields that are actually
available so let's get the name and
email and there we go so now we can
fetch all of the customers all right
guys so that's how we can fetch data now
we've been working with hard-coded data
so in the next video we're going to set
up JSON server so that we can have a
more realistic environment because right
now I mean you're not going to be
working with hard-coded data in a real
project okay so that's what we'll be
doing in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
