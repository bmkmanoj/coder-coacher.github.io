created our store and also finished up
the initial code for the app component
now in order to be able to run our
application we need to do a couple
things and we're going to use gulp to
handle some tasks that we need done so
this is the gulp file j/s and we're
going to create a variable called gulp
and we want to require it alright we
also want to include browserify okay
we're gonna need reactive eye that's
going to take care of our JSX code
reactive eye in just in case you don't
know what JSX is it's whatever we return
in our render method alright and there's
a few rules that we have to fall for
instance we can't create a class like
this you have to use class name alright
and there's a few other things that that
you'll need to know as well we'll get to
that later so let's see reactive fie
yeah you're also gonna need our vinyl
source stream module so this is gonna be
source equals require and we want vinyl
source stream all right so let's do our
first task which is going to be
browserify so gulp task and we want the
name of the task so what this is gonna
do is it's gonna take all of our
JavaScript so our actions are components
constants all of these JavaScript files
it's gonna combine them into one file
called main KS and that's going to be
put in a folder called dist alright
which will hold our compiled application
so let's say browserify alright and then
in there we want to pass in source /j s
slash main dot j s alright and then we
want to add on to this we're gonna say
dot transform and this is gonna take in
react to Phi that's gonna take care of
the JSX alright next we're gonna call
bundled okay that's gonna do what I just
said bundle everything together and then
we want to say dot pipe and we want it
to be in a file called main J s and then
another pipe this is where we set our
destination so we're gonna say gulp dot
nest and then we're gonna pass in dist
/j s so main dot j s will go into disc
/j s and you don't have to worry about
creating dist it's gonna do that for you
so that's the whole browserify task
alright so we're gonna create another
one so gulp dot task and this one's
gonna be called copy and this is gonna
be responsible for bringing
over things like the index file the CSS
in the vendors alright so we'll say
function and then gulp dot source and
we're gonna pass in source slash index
dot HTML because we want to bring that
over and we want to call dot type adult
dot dest okay just like we did above and
that's gonna go right into the dist
folder all right so that takes care of
one now we need to make sure that we
move the CSS files alright so we'll say
gulp dog source and we want source slash
CSS now we want every file that's in
there so we're going to do an asterisk
dot asterisk alright so any file with
any extension you could do dot CSS but
I'm just gonna leave it like that ok
same thing I'm gonna say gulp dot dest
and then we're gonna pass in dist slash
CSS all right so we have one more I'm
just going to copy this okay so this is
gonna be source /j s slash vendors so
anything in the vendors folder which
would be jQuery bootstrap whatever you
want to include all right and then
that's gonna go to dist
/j s ok so that's the copy task now we
need to set up the default so I'm gonna
say gulp dot task
and this is gonna be default and then we
will just want to include an array with
the other tasks we want to run so
browserify and copy alright and then
we're gonna pass in a function call back
and we're gonna return gulp don't watch
now what this will do is it's going to
continuously run the process so that we
can continue to code and every time we
save it'll be updated and we can see
that can't see the changes in the
browser alright so we want to pass in
SRC slash and then any folder slash it
then any file ok and then we just need
to add that array again so browserify
and coffee oops
alright so that should be it for the
boilerplate we may have some errors that
we need to fix but that looks about
right
so what we'll want to do now is go to
our command line let's see is this
correct yeah all right
so before we actually run gulp we need
to install all our dependencies all
right everything's in the package.json
file that we need so we should be able
to now say npm install and it could take
a minute or two
all right so everything should now be
installed you have this node modules
folder and now what we want to do is run
gulp and hope everything works out all
right so it looks like we're getting an
error and let's see aridif after fifteen
browserify dest dot on is not a function
okay let's see oh I see the issue right
here this pipe main J s we actually have
to add source okay this is where the
vinyl source stream module comes in so
I'll just add that alright and it'll
save it and let's run gulp again okay so
this means that it's it's running okay
and if we look up here we now have a
dist folder and oh it didn't bring over
index.html it brought over jQuery main
j/s and if we look at mange s it's just
everything all mushed together all right
CSS that's over now the index.html
didn't so let's check that out
oh there's a comment that's why all
right so let's go ahead and stop that
with control C and what I'm gonna do is
delete the dist folder and we're gonna
run gulp again okay so now we have the
index folder so let's try and open that
up and see what we get
so we'll go to dist and then index so
we're gonna open that with Chrome let me
bring it over all right so we get my app
let's open up the console make sure okay
we're getting no errors that's good now
everything is coming out of right here
all right so if we change this we'll say
hello world save it and it updates so
this is the the entire boilerplate okay
this is what you have if you get it from
github
all right I just wanted to go through it
step by step and then in the next video
we're going to start on working on an
application using this boilerplate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
