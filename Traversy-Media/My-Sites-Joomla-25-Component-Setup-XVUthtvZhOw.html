solutions and i wanted to make a quick
video showing you how to install and
configure the my sites component which
is a component that's mainly for
displaying web design or web development
projects but could also be used for
other types of projects as well so if we
go to tech I web solutions com and click
on downloads and click on jeweler
extensions component and I have the 2.5
in 3-point old version we're going to
install the 2.5 version so I'm going to
click download download and then it's
going to ask to it's going to download
the package for us I actually already
downloaded it but I'll do it again
alright so now we have the calm my
sights zip file and I'm going to go over
to a I have a brand-new jeweler
installation Han 22.5 so yeah I'm going
to install the extension just like any
other browse for the zip file
and click on upload and install
alright so it's been installed
successfully now the next thing to do
would be to go to components my sites
and create a category all right so let's
create a new category and I'll just call
this web design and put in some sample
stop filler content
this is just from the lorem ipsum
website category image I have an image
that I just grabbed off google going to
use that for the category image so I'll
click Save and new so i can create
another one another category and i'll
call this web programming throw some
content
and then I'll select an image for for
this category
okay so i'll see them close so now i
have two categories now we can go over
to projects and create a new project
i'll just name this test project
and we want to choose a category I'll
choose the web design category you want
to choose a date and a description in
the URL I'll just say something calm
something and for each project you can
have a main image and you can have up to
four thumbnails so I'm going to get a
main image here again these are just
images I grabbed off google i'm going to
select to thumbnails here
and these would would most likely be
screenshots or maybe banners that you
design or something like that so I'll
click Save and close so now i have i
have two categories in one project now
we need to create a menu link so i'm
going to go to menus main menu add new
menu item and we're going to click
select and we want first I'll create a
categories item which will give us a
layout of all the project categories so
I'll just name this my project
categories and you have an option here
to display either the full layout or
titles only the full layout is it'll
display the category image the
description in the title the titles only
will just be just text just the title so
I'm going to keep it at full and I have
the default width at 180 for the images
and height of 120 but these can be
changed as well so I'm just going to
leave it like that and click Save and
new and now we'll create a link for all
just all the projects so if we click on
projects and I'll just call this a call
it my projects
and again you can choose the full of the
title layout and you can choose the
width and height of the image I'm just
going to leave it at the default so now
if we visit the front end and reload we
have these two links here I'm going to
click on the categories link which gives
us the title of the category the image
and the description now when you hover
over these the grey background that's
just part of this template for some
reason it has gray when you hover over
any link so that that's not going to be
there on other templates so you click on
the category and it will show you a list
of projects in that category alright so
if we click on the test project it'll
take us to a page like this where it
tells us the title the category the date
in the project description which you
could put anything in you could create
your own custom fields in the
description if you wanted and then we
have the main image and we have the
thumbnails underneath and if you click
on the thumbnail it will open up to a
nice big view of your project and you
also have this launch the website button
which will just open another tab and
bring you to the the website we can also
view the project's view if we click on
my projects this will show all projects
in all categories and if you want you
can filter by category down here go to
web design web programming we have
nothing in and we can click all projects
from here as well
now we can also change the image size
say we want to change the category image
sizes maybe maybe you have maybe your
site doesn't have a sidebar and you want
three big images you could easily do
that right from here so let's say we
want to change to 300 will say 302 80 hi
so we save that and we go back to the
categories layout and now we have two
big category images and we can do the
same thing for the projects page if we
go back to my projects
we can change the width and the height
here as well
if I reload now we got the big thumbnail
the image at the itself actually isn't
as long as I I made it but depending on
the height of your image I just got to
match that up alright so i think that's
it you could also create a menu item for
a for category i guess i'll show you
that real quick if we want to choose
single category then we can choose the
category over here we'll just say web
design we can name this web design
and then we can also create a link to
one specific project which if we select
single project we should get a drop-down
over here and it will show us all our
projects and you can set the height the
width of the main image in the
thumbnails so we'll just say test
project i'll save that if we go to our
front-end and reload we should have some
more links over here if we click on web
design it will take us to the category
page of the web design category page and
it will show us all the projects we
click on test project it will take us to
that one project page alright so that's
basically it you can also download the
modules I have a couple modules for this
component where the yeah so we have the
projects module which will just display
the latest projects in a list and then
we have categories little display the
categories in a module position so
that's it I hope you enjoy the extension

questions go ahead and contact us
