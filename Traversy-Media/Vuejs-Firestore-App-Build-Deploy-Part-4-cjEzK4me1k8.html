ahead and we fetched all of our
employees in the dashboard component
from fire store and we put them here in
the collection so what we want to do now
is work on the view page if I click on
one of these icons it takes us to the
view component so we want to open up
view employee view and what we want to
do first is go down to the script here
and in the return so we have our name
then we have our data return and we
basically want to have an object with
all the properties so for instance
employee underscore ID but we want these
set to null at first okay so we're going
to say that I'm going to say name no
Department no and position no okay now
we want to use a life cycle method here
so under the data method we want to have
something called before Route enter okay
so before Route enter and that's exactly
when this runs is before we enter the
route so in here in here is where we
want to fetch the individual employee ok
we only want one employee that's the one
that matches this right here this
employee ID so again we're gonna have to
bring in our database from our firebase
in it so we're gonna go right here and
say knock on so we're gonna say import
DB from dot slash firebase and knit and
then down here in before route enter and
this actually takes in a few parameters
it takes in two from and next and then
we're gonna say DB dot collection of
course we want our employees collection
and we want to specify a condition we
want to specify a where okay so we're
gonna say dot where
employee underscore ID and the way that
we do this is we don't just say employee
ID equals or anything we need to put a
second parameter with the condition so a
comma and then inside what's inside of
single quotes the condition which is
equals and then a third parameter which
is what we want it to equal which is the
ID in the URL and we can get that using
this two parameter right here
so we can say to dot and then it has an
object called params and then that has a
value called employee underscore ID okay
and the reason it has this paramus in
the router we defined that as a
parameter employee ID which is this okay
hopefully that makes sense
so employee ID and then we do our dot
get okay and then the dot get returns a
promise so we do a dot then okay and in
the dot then I'm just going to put this
on a new line here so we'll say dot then
inside here again we're gonna get a
query snapshot and set that to an arrow
function and we want to loop through so
query snapshot we're gonna use a for
each and inside here we'll get a doc and
then we want to actually call use this
next method right here so we're gonna
say next and inside here will have an
arrow function we're going to use VM and
set that to an object and this is where
we actually assign all of the fields
that we want to put up in the template
so we want to use this VM so we'll say
VM dot employee ID is going to equal and
remember we have that doc object which
has a data method and then we can get
any field we want so it's a employee
underscore ID okay and then we're gonna
do VM dot name equals dot dot data dot
name excuse me
I'll just go ahead and copy this down so
we want name we also want Department and
we also want position all right now this
is this is basically a navigation guard
it's going to run before we the page
loads now after the page loads we want
to do the same thing we want to fetch
the data so we're gonna set up a watcher
for the route to call a method called
fetch data which will basically do the
same thing we did in the in the
dashboard except it'll fetch a single
employee instead of all of them so we
want to go below right below the before
route enter navigation guard and put a
comma and we're just gonna say watch and
in here we want to say for our route now
we can access our router with money sign
route and we want to just set this to a
method called fetch data now this method
we have to create so we want to go right
under the watch put a comma and say
methods
okay so methods and then we can define
custom methods here and fetch data will
be one of them so we'll say fetch data
and then this is going to be very
similar to what we did in the dashboard
except we're just fetching one employee
so we're gonna say DB dot collection
employees and we're gonna do a where
clause this time so we want to say we're
employee underscore ID comma equals now
we can't do what we did up here in the
navigation guard where we said 2 dot
params because we don't have access to
this to object so we can use the router
by saying this dot money sign route dot
params and then we can access employee
ID okay so we're saying where the
employee ID equals whatever is in the
route in this case 0 0 3 and then we
want to continue on and say dot get
which returns a promise so then we do
dot then I'm gonna put dot then down
here and inside this dot then we want to
put a query snapshot and we're gonna use
an arrow and then inside here again
we're gonna just for each through the
query snapshot just like we did in the
dashboard okay and that's gonna take in
the doc the result which is the document
snapshot and then instead of setting
like we did in the dashboard we set a
data object we're gonna set the specific
properties themselves so for instance
this dot employee ID is going to be
equal to doc dot data dot employee ID
all right so we're gonna do it that way
so this dot name equals that
dot Department it's killing me not to
use semicolons position equals dot dot
data dot position all right so let's
save that and make sure we get no errors
and then we should have access to all of
these properties up in our template and
we can do what we want with them so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have again a
ul with the collection header so I'm
gonna get rid of this h3 will say ul
collection and also the class of with
header and let's do Li dot collection
header which will be an h4 and in here
I'm gonna put double curly braces and
name we don't need to do employee dot
name because it's not an employee object
like with the dashboard it's simply the
name property which we set right here
ok so let's save that and we get Sam
Smith if we go back let's go to John Doe
we get John Doe so let's go ahead and
put some more allies in here so we'll
say collection - item and let's do we
use Emmet will say times three and in
this one here I'm going to put the
employee ID I'm gonna put a label so
employee ID number and we'll set that to
our double curly braces and say employee
ID
I have to reload all right so this one
here will be the department so just de
PT this one will be position like that
and then below the UL I want to have a
back button or a back router link so say
back and let's see it's gonna go to it's
just gonna go to the home page so slash
I'm also gonna give it a class of BTN
and a class of gray there we go so I'm
also going to put a delete button
because we're gonna handle that as well
in this video so I'm gonna copy this
paste that in and then this will say
delete and let's see actually I'm sorry
this should this should be a button not
a router link and we're gonna give this
a class of red and then the way that we
get this to work is we do an @ click
which we'll call an event and we want to
call a function called delete employee
so let's save that and now we have a
delete button and we're gonna get an
error because there is no delete
employee so let's go create that so down
in our methods under fetch data we'll
say delete employee
and first of all we'll do a confirm when
we do it you'll say if confirm are you
sure
then the way that we do a delete is by
saying DB dot collection and we first
need to get the one we've the employee
we want to delete so do the same thing
we did above dot we're actually we'll
just copy this let's just copy this
whole thing
all right so collection employees where
employee equals that and then we're
gonna do the dot get the dot then query
snapshot for each and then instead of
assigning all this stuff we're simply
going to say doc dot ref okay we can use
this ref object and then that has a
delete method and then after we delete
we want to redirect and we can use the
router for that we can say this dot
money sign route dot push and we want to
just go to slash and I used a semicolon
here I'm going to get rid of that I'm
sure I've used them other places as well
but yeah so that will that should delete
it and then it should redirect us so
let's save all right so let's see if we
can go back let's say we want to delete
Sam Smith we'll click delete are you
sure okay and that didn't work it looks
like the router didn't work let's see if
it actually deleted which it did so Sam
Smith did get deleted but something went
wrong here let's see what went wrong
here
I put wrote it should actually be router
route is a pro is a if you want to get
the parameters and so on you can use
route but to actually do a redirect you
want to use router so I guess we'll go
ahead and delete Sarah and then we get
redirected good so we can now view all
of our employees the list we can view
individual employees and we can delete
them so in the next video we're gonna
work on the new employee page we'll
create our form and we'll be able to add
them through the application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
