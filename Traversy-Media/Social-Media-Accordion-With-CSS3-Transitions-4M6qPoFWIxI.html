we have a cool little project to do it's
a social media accordion slider and it's
built with pure CSS ok well of course
HTML as well but there's no JavaScript
and we have some really cool animations
here if we hover over each of the social
media icons you'll see that it kind of
just opens up and gives us the title
gives us a little blurb changes the
color makes the icon bigger so I thought
this was a really cool project now I got
the idea for this from another code pen
that I saw by I'm probably gonna butcher
this name but it's by Ayesha angry and
grainy and you can see it's basically
the same thing but she used SAS and
compass and it's just a lot more
complicated than I thought it needed to
be even if we look at the compiled CSS
it's just way more than I wanted to
basically just redo it and simplify it
and create it as a tutorial and then
also you'll see that it's just it's not
responsive at all it's not responsive at
all so I decided to add some
responsiveness to it so once we get to a
certain point you'll see it'll change
this is basically for like tablets and
then if we go down to a smaller size for
smartphones you'll see that it looks
good as well now if you want to tweak it
a little bit and make it maybe slide
down and out you can do that I just
didn't really have the time for that but
I couldn't figure out a way to have it
still have this type of effect and you
know on small screens it's just not you
would have to make it open vertically or
something like that but I did want to
give credit to Ayesha I think that's
that's how you pronounce her name and I
will put the link to to her her what is
this code pen in the description because
I did I didn't want to just kind of copy
it and not give her any credit for it
alright and I'll kind of explain things
as we go along I'm going to use CSS
transitions so hopefully you guys enjoy
this project
let's get started alright so if you want
to follow along with me there's a couple
things that you need to do to get set up
in very easy you just need to create two
files one index.html one style dot CSS
these are completely empty and they have
them in a folder called social accordion
and then you're also going to need two
font files which are the icons the
social icons that we're using this is
where they come from so this is called
generic ons or general cons and these
two files we're gonna implement within
the CSS so that we can add those those
social media icons and these these
generic icons these fonts these were
used in one of the the default WordPress
themes I believe alright so there will
be a link in the description to download
those two font files alright so let's
get started here so in the HTML we're
gonna put in our boilerplate with Emmet
I'm gonna close up the sidebar here and
let's change the title to we'll say well
let's just say follow me on social media
now this isn't something you would just
deploy as is it's basically a widget
that you would you would integrate into
a your your existing website or
something like that let's go ahead and
link the see the CSS file so style dot
CSS and then in the body we're gonna
have a container and in the container
we'll have a header with an h1 and again
let's just say follow me on social media
and under the header we're gonna go
ahead and put a ul with a class of
accordion so basically if we look at the
the final project here each one of these
are their list items okay and they're
gonna have a class of tab and then this
whole box right here that you see the
outline is the accordion
okay the UL with the accordion class so
let's create an Li with the class of tab
and inside here we basically want two
divs so the first is gonna be it's gonna
be a div with the class of social and
it's gonna have a class of whatever that
current whatever
that network is so this will be YouTube
I want YouTube to be the first one okay
and inside here we're just gonna have a
link to to whatever yours your youtube
link is so I'm just gonna put mine okay
and let's let's add a target here as
well so that it opens up on a separate
tab and then here we'll just say YouTube
this text actually isn't going to show
the way that we're gonna insert the
icons is this a tag right here we're
gonna choose we're gonna use the before
and after pseudo elements and css3 and
if you've never used those before
they're basically used to add content
through CSS and that's how we're going
to insert the icons okay so we're gonna
we're going to use social a-after and
social a before to put basically both
versions of these icons here and then
we're gonna add some transitions all
right now I tried to make it I'm a tried
to make the code as simple as possible
if you look at the version that I use to
create this with as a reference it's
it's much harder to understand that's
what I like to do is kind of dumb things
down for people that are just getting
into like css3 and transitions and stuff
like that alright so next thing we're
going to do is under this div we're
gonna have a div with the class of
content and that's where the the header
and the paragraph are going to go with a
heading so it'll be an h1 that says
YouTube and for the paragraph I'm just
gonna say follow me on YouTube for
we'll say for tutorials on latest
development technologies so what I'll do
is just to create this first list item
this first tab and then just paste the
rest in and go over it but if I save
this and we take a look by the way I'm
using live server 4 vs code that's why
you can see why my local host up here
but you can just open up the index.html
file and that's fine so like I said I'm
gonna grab the rest and paste them in
and then I'll go over them they're
basically the same thing just different
social networks so I paste this and
right under the Li and I'll go I'll just
scroll through what you guys can either
copy it or you can get it from the
source code in the description but
basically under the YouTube we have
another Li with the class of tab a div
with the class of social again and then
Twitter and the Twitter link and then
the content with the h1 and the
paragraph ok the next one is Facebook
same thing Li with the class of tab next
one is LinkedIn next one's Instagram and
next one is github
ok so I'll go ahead and save that and it
looks absolutely horrendous but we will
fix that with CSS ok so that's it for
the HTML very very simple so let's move
on to style dot CSS and we're gonna
start off here by just creating a reset
so we're gonna basically say everything
should have a margin of 0 I want to zero
out the margin and the padding padding
zero and let's also say border zero all
right so if we save that everything gets
squished together because there's no
longer any margin or padding and then
for the body we're gonna add a
background color
almost black to-to-to and hexadecimal
and let's say font family will do arial
helvetica sans-serif save that now to
use these generic icons or whatever it's
called Gen generai cons we need to
create a font face so we're gonna say at
font face and give it a font family
which will be generations and it whoops
that should be a semicolon now it needs
a source which will be to the two files
that you downloaded so we need to wrap
it in a URL so we'll say URL and then
point to fonts the fonts folder and then
the name of the icons so the first one
is gonna be if we look at this here it's
gonna be the WOFF file so in here close
that up let's put that file name which
is Jenner I con - what is it regular -
web font and then right after this
closing parenthesis we're gonna say
format and the format is gonna be WOFF
okay then we're going to put a comma and
we want the other file which is the
TrueType font so we're gonna do fonts
slash generai cons - regular - web font
and the extension for that is IOT and
then we want to do again format and the
format for that is going to be true type
okay and that's it so now we should be
able to use generai cons as a font
family when we want to insert those
social media icons okay so let's move on
next thing we're going to do is the
container class which is just gonna have
a margin
top and bottom will say 50 pixels left
and right will be Auto push it to the
middle and then let's give it a width of
90 percent and we'll save I spelt that
wrong okay so now you can see it's
pushed to the middle we have a little
margin on the top so the next thing
we're going to do is this header right
here so it's in html5 header tag and
then an h1 and I just want to change the
color of that to white I want to set a
margin bottom to 10 pixels and a text
align to Center okay next thing we're
gonna do is the accordion and as I said
before the accordion is this box the
whole box you see here so we're gonna
add those styles
okay so we'll say a background
background is gonna be slightly lighter
than the body background which is gonna
be 333 okay the width is gonna be a
hundred percent of its container but
it's gonna have a min width of 800
pixels okay because it needs to fit
everything in here that is expanded okay
and if you were to add more here you
would probably have to expand this in
order for these to fit okay and if you
were to take some out like if you only
wanted the first three here you could
make this smaller if you wanted to but
we're gonna say min with 800 pixels and
we want this displayed as a block level
element of course we don't want any
bullet points so we want to say
list-style-type:none square and then
let's set the overflow to hidden so
nothing breaks out of it let's set the
height to 200 pixels now if I were to
save this and take a look you'll see
that we have the outline of the
accordion I want to get rid of all the
text though right now so what I'm gonna
do is set the fonts
to zero and then we're gonna add the
fonts the font size of the content later
on okay so next thing we want to do here
is work on the tab class okay and each
one of these as I said is a tab so let's
add in tab and we want these displayed
as an inline block okay they should be
side by side background color so
background color will be slightly
lighter than the accordion so four four
four and let's do a border right of
three three three solid one pixel
okay the width of each one will be
eighty pixels and the height should be
the same as the accordion did I put I
didn't put oh yeah I did yeah
two hundred pixels so it should also be
two hundred pixels let's see what else
we want the overflow to be hidden and
let's say we want this to be
position:relative and let's add a margin
zero and let's save that and now as you
can see we have these eighty pixel wide
boxes okay what we want to happen when
we hover over one of these we want it to
basically go into 450 pixels wide so if
I go down here and I say dot tab hover
we want to change the width to 450
pixels now if I hover over one you'll
see it extends each one will extend to
450 now I don't want it to just pop into
450 pixels I want it to smoothly animate
to that size like this and the way that
we do that is by using a CSS trend
ition ok transitions are pretty easy to
understand it's basically just taking
the the changing of the property such as
the width and setting a time to it so we
could say we want it to take a half a
second or one second to get to that
width from this width and that will give
it that animation effect that's
stretching all right so what all we need
to do to achieve that is to add a
transition into the tab class right here
and this takes in a couple things we
actually want to transition everything
so we'll say all and we'll say we wanted
to take 0.5 seconds so half a second the
type of transition or the effect is
gonna be ease in out and then the delay
we're gonna just do 0.1 seconds okay
so now if I save that and I hover over
one of these now you'll see it nicely
just changes it doesn't just snap to 450
pixels it slides open which is what we
want all right so now let's work on the
content which is this part here this
white part with the text because right
now it's just blank
so let's target and by the way if if I
were to remove this font size 0 you can
see though that all the text is still
there but we want to keep that there
because we want to just target each item
in the content so we'll say tab content
h1 and we're gonna set a font size here
of let's say 2 PO I'm going to use REM
units so we'll say 2.5 REM and then
let's just add a margin bottom of 10
pixels and get rid of that so if I save
that
let's see oh I didn't add the content
itself so right above this we want just
the content class we want to do a few
things here one we want the background
to be white okay
we also want the width to be 360 pixels
so right now let's say you know I'm
gonna comment this out for now
alright so the reason that it's not
showing white is because it also needs a
height so the height is gonna be the
same as the accordion which is 250 200
pixels so now you'll see it's white but
it's it's not giving us what the effect
we want we want them to be gray and then
have this side be white so we can
achieve that by just giving it a margin
left so the content will be pushed to
the left 80 pixels now it's gray and and
now you can see when we open it
it's then white okay let's see we also
want to do some we want to position it
relative we want to add some padding to
the content around the content so we'll
say 50 on the top let's say we'll do 0 0
15 on the left and I think that's it so
now we can uncomment this and save and
there we go
okay so now we want the the paragraph
that's under it we're gonna target that
I'll just copy this here and we'll
change this to instead of h1 will target
the paragraph the font size I'm gonna do
0.85 R M and let's see we don't need
this let's do a line height of 1.4 R m
and then we also want to do some padding
on the right of 30 pixels and we'll save
and there we go so that looks good now
we're gonna start on this part which is
going to be the icons now we're gonna
insert the icons before and after the a
tag okay which is this right here inside
the social class the 8 so we're gonna
target social a colon before and colon
after okay that's how we define pseudo
pseudo elements is just the colon and
then whatever it is so in this case
before and after so to add a specific
icon say add icons so let's say for the
YouTube icon we want to target the
YouTube class and then the a tag within
it and then before okay we also want to
put it after because there's basically
two icons we have the one that displays
and then when we hover it we have that
one as well okay so we want to do both
before and after so YouTube a-after now
to insert the icon or to insert anything
you use content okay so we could put
whatever we want here what we want
though is the code for the specific icon
the generic generic generic ons or
whatever the hell and whatever the hell
it's called has codes for certain icons
just like font awesome
other icon libraries so the one for
YouTube is f2 1 3 so we want to insert
the the YouTube icon before and after
that a tag which is this right here
okay so down here we want the after one
which is the one that will tree hover
over we want the background to be red ok
so let's go ahead and do that so we'll
say dot YouTube a-after and we're gonna
set the background color to red which is
going to be ff0000 and save that and
we're not gonna see anything just yet
because we have some styling to do to
the a tag in general not just YouTube a
we need to style social a before and
after as well alright but this is how we
add the icons so for it to show up again
like I said we're gonna have to target
social so social a before and social a
after so we want to set a width of 80
pixels and we want to set a height of
the accordion which is 200 pixels
we want it to position:absolute because
it's basically like an overlay and we're
gonna just do text indent 0 we're gonna
do padding from the top we want the icon
to be kind of like in the middle so
padding top 90 pixels and then we're
also going to do some padding on the
left which will be 25 pixels we want
this displayed as a block
and for the font this is where we
implement the general cons font so it's
gonna be a normal font weight it's gonna
be 30 pixels and the font type will be
that generic on general generic ons and
then the color we want to be white all
right so if I save that alright that's
not showing up for some reason I
probably misspelled it somewhere let's
look at the font face here regular - web
font hmm oh I didn't put the extension
here should be dot WOFF there we go
sorry about that so now you can see it's
red by default which we don't want we
want it to be gray and then the
transition that we're gonna add that
will bring in the red so to make this
gray let's go back down here and let's
go after what we just did and we just
want to target now social a after okay
we want to target that and we want to
set the font size so the after is the
red right because we want that we want
the red to be the bigger icons so we're
going to change the font size to 48
pixels and then we also want to add
padding - left of 20 pixels padding top
of 80 pixels so we're just positioning
it because we made the icon bigger so we
want to change these values to these for
the red version and then finally we want
to do margin - left
85 that's what's gonna push it over and
basically make it go away by default so
now if I save if we go back now it's
gray
okay if I were to comment this out and
save now you'll see it's red okay
so that kind of pushes it pushes it over
now we want the effect of the this
moving over and the red one moving in
okay the after moving in and the before
moving over so we need to add a
transition into here so we're gonna say
transition all will say 0.4 seconds hija
let's do ease in out and let's say a
delay of 0.1 seconds now that alone
isn't going to do anything we need to
target the hover again so let's go up to
the tab hover and instead of just tab
hover we want we won't also want to add
social and then a after okay
actually it's do the before first all
right
so tab hover social a before now we want
to basically push this over so we're
gonna use margin left and we're gonna
say negative 100 pixels so this will
move it over to the left so if I save
that now you'll see that that icon is
moving over to the left a hundred pixels
so it's going outside of the accordion
which is overflow:hidden so we just
can't see it now notice that it's not
red and we're not seeing the other icons
so all we have to do for that to work is
we'll go ahead and copy that and we'll
change this to after and set the margin
left to just negative five pixels and
save and now you can see that it comes
in okay because we're setting the margin
left of after to just negative five
pixels so it's bringing it back in and
without this transition that we added if
I were to get rid of that
you'll see it just kind of pops in so
that transition is very important just
like the other one for for this for the
content alright I hope that I'm
explaining this fairly well because it
is it is kind of hard to explain
especially if you're new to css3 and
transitions and all that stuff
alright so I think we're good here
next thing we're gonna do is add the
rest of the icons so there's what six of
them so we can just copy this we
basically have to do this for every icon
so that'll be two three four five six
and we'll go up here we're gonna leave
YouTube as the first one the next one
will be Twitter so this is the first one
that's YouTube and I'm just going to
highlight this and do control D two
times two to grab the next two and then
say Twitter now the code for the Twitter
icon is gonna be F 202 and then we also
want to change the color to be the
branding of Twitter which is going to be
6 DC 5 DD alright and let's see the next
one is gonna be Facebook so I'm going to
just grab these change these to Facebook
and the code for Facebook is f 204 and
we want to change the branding as well
the color to 3 B 5 9 9 8 that'll give us
that Facebook blue alright and then we
want this one to be LinkedIn and we're
going to change the code here to f 208
and then the color so for the color
we're gonna do 0-0 a 9 CD
that'll give us that linked in blue and
then for Instagram we're gonna do the
code f2 1 5 and we're going to change
the color here to the Instagram green
color which will be 6 DC 9 9 3 and then
finally we want the github and the color
for that I'm sorry the code for that is
going to be 200 okay and there's
references for the the Jenner I con
codes as well let me just see if I can
find that actually unicode's I guess
yeah Unicode values yeah I see
let's see right here yeah Facebook so we
used what 204 I think we use that one so
this is a list if you guys want to use
other icons this is a good reference for
those Unicode values alright so back to
the color here this is going to be six e
five four nine four so let's save and
let's go back to ours and there we go so
it looks like it's working pretty good
and the next thing we need to do is make
this responsive because right now if I
were to make this smaller it just it
doesn't work out it's it's not
responsive whatsoever so let's go ahead
and do that we're gonna add a couple
media queries so let's do at media so
this one is going to have a max width of
950 950 pixels and what that means if
you guys aren't familiar with media
queries is any styles that we put inside
here they're only going to be in effect
if the screen or the browser is 950
pixels or less all right so first thing
I'm gonna do is change the container
with from ninety percent to 70 percent
okay because I don't want it to spread I
mean it's gonna be pretty wide 950 is
pretty big but we need that in order to
fit this so we don't want the container
to come all the way out here we want it
kind of you know pushed in a little more
so that's the container next thing we
want to do is for the tabs we want them
to display as a block now if I go ahead
and save that actually we're not gonna
see a difference unless I make this a
little smaller there we go so since
they're displayed block they're
basically on top of each other and the
only one we can see is
YouTube because the accordion is 250 I'm
sorry 200 pixels high and it's set to
overflow:hidden so we can't see anything
under it all right so I'm gonna fix that
in a second let's do a tab width of 100%
so now we can actually see the content
and then let's also do a border bottom I
want to kind of separate each one
because they're going to be going
vertically so we'll say border bottom
three pixels 333 solid alright so now
let's target the accordion and the
accordion we want to display as a block
we want to set a minimum width of 450
pixels so if I save that you can see now
it's a little shorter now if we want to
be able to see the rest of them we want
to change the height from 200 to auto
and save and now we can see all of them
okay now we have some weird effect going
on here so we need to do two things we
need to add for the tab I'm gonna set
the width to 85% okay and then we need
to target the hover and set the width of
the tab to 100% so it's a tab hover with
100%
let's see still missing something here
what do they do
men with 450 tab oh I'm sorry it's not
it's not the tab that should be 85% it's
the content which is the white part so
we want to just put in content there we
go all right so that looks pretty good
for it further this screen size now when
we start to get smaller around right
here you'll see that it's no longer even
on the sides and it just that doesn't
look good so now we need to create
another media query for smaller screens
so this one we're gonna do a max width
of 680 pixels and we're just going to do
a couple things here we want to set the
container to be much wider so it's it's
4 950 or less it's set to 95% we want to
set it now I'm sorry it's up to 70% now
we want to set it to 95% and almost take
up the whole screen because it's such a
small screen size and then we just want
to take the accordion and we want to set
the width of that to 100% and set the
minimum width to 350 pixels okay so it
should it shouldn't go any smaller than
that and if I save now you can see that
it fits all right so even on very small
screens it looks good all right
and then when we hit 950 or higher of
course it goes back to the original
alright so hopefully you guys enjoyed
this little project I know it's not
building like a full website or
application or something like that we're
not using frameworks or anything special
but I think this stuff is important and
I think it lacks on YouTube and just
just on the internet tutorials in
general because this is all real life
stuff that you're gonna be building as
part of websites part of applications
and stuff so it's it's good to get a
grasp on things like CSS transitions so
hopefully this helped you a little bit
and you enjoyed it and that's it I will
