front-to-back video in this video we're
going to be looking at the include and
required statements in PHP and what
these do is they allow us to insert PHP
code markup text into another PHP file
and it saves you a ton of time and saves
you from writing a ton of code
especially if you're using it with HTML
so what I'm going to do here is in PHP
sandbox I'm going to create a new folder
we're just going to call this website 1
ok because there's going to be times
where we're using multiple files and I
want to keep those bunched into one
folder for that for that particular
video ok so we might have website to
website 3 and so on so I'm going to
create in here a file let's save it as
index dot PHP
alright so let's pretend that this is
just a very simple website we'll also
create a file called about dot PHP and
let's create one more called contact dot
PHP alright so we have these three files
I'm going to start in index.php I'm just
going to put in some basic HTML and just
say my website and then we'll have a
heading and let's just say home because
this is the home page so let's just put
in a footer
look I've used to blind a while I've
been using Adam which doesn't finish you
are your HTML tags so I might do that a
couple times so when the footer will
just put let's say a paragraph and I'll
just say my website copyright 2017 okay
it doesn't really matter what we put
here so let's save that let's open it up
over here with localhost / PHP sandbox /
website 1 all right so that's our
beautiful website now what I'm going to
do is just copy this and put it in about
actually you know what before we do that
let's create a simple navigation menu so
right above the h1 we'll put a ul this
isn't going to be pretty at all put a
new tag and this will go to this file
which is index.php and in here we'll
just say home ok able to copy that and
then we'll put our boat
and contact alright so now let's grab
all of this save it and then let's paste
it in here and we'll just change the h1
to about everything else is going to
stay the same and same with contact all
right so now if we reload we have this
little website now just try to picture
this as a real website a much larger
website where there's a lot of code
there's a lot of meta tags and all that
now when you create different pages
you're not going to want to repeat that
you're not going to want to have all the
same code the only difference between
all three of these is this h1 okay
you're going to have one piece of
content that's different and you can you
can really save some time by using
includes or requires so what I'm going
to do here is in website one let's
create a new folder and we'll call it
Inc ok often you'll see this way or it
will just say includes and inside here
we're going to create a new file and
let's save that as header ok and then
we'll create another one and save that
as footer thought PHP I'm sure you guys
know what I'm getting at so in the index
file let's grab everything above the h1
and we'll cut that and then we're going
to put that in the header file save it
and close it ok and then back in index
let's take everything below the h1 cut
it put it in the footer file save it and
close it ok so now for our index page if
we save it like this reload obviously we
just see the h1 but we can actually
include those two files that we just
created so to do that we'll do PHP
include ok and then we just need the
location which is in the ink folder
slash header dot PHP
okay and then we can just copy that put
it there and then just change this to
footer okay so if we save that and
reload we get our navigation back or
footer our head tags everything and just
to show you that it's really working
let's go to header and let's change will
just say hold one save it reload and
you'll see that that's actually coming
from this header file alright and then
what you want to do is just basically
we'll just copy this whole thing go to
about paste that and we'll just change
that to about okay same thing with
contact alright so if we go ahead and
reload and you can see now we can
navigate between pages and the actual
PHP pages while why is that not all it's
looking at it as HTML we just change
that
all right so you can see how helpful
this is now all we have to worry about
on each page is the main content we
don't have to deal with the header and
all that stuff
all right now if we were to include a
file that's really not there
they don't say header one and reload
opportunity go to home and I see we get
a warning saying that that files not
there but it does continue to run the
script and you can see it outputs home
still now the difference between include
and require is that if we use require
and we reload it's not going to continue
the script it gives you a fatal error
okay so when you're when you're trying
to figure out which one you want to use
include or require use require if you
don't want the script to continue if you
if if that file doesn't load and you
want everything that just halt then use
require if you want it to keep going
regardless then use include okay you can
also use require once I'll just put that
back to Heather okay so you can use
require once and this is identical to
require except that PHP will check the
file to check and see if it's already
been included and if it has it won't
include it or require it again all right
so let me just I'm just going to use
each statement on each page just so you
guys have it so that's required once on
a boat will do require
and then contact what we'll use include
all right and you can also do it like
this like a function format if you want
to do that you'll see that still works
okay so that is included and require
alright so we're going to start getting
into some more some more useful stuff
than just you know looking at variables
and stuff like that so I plan for this
series to be pretty long we're going to
go all the way up to you know creating
classes that that work with databases
and things like that
all right so try and stay tuned and
that's it I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
