below alright guys so I haven't done one
of these videos in quite a long time
meaning the opinionated comparison type
of videos but this is a question that
I'm asked almost daily should I start
with react or angular and sometimes view
J s and I do want to say that I do love
you I think it's great but I wanted to
stick to these two these two
technologies for this video now I've
used both and I really like both it's
not a video where I'm gonna bash one or
the other or say that you should always
use one over the other every developer
and every project is completely
different and they have a different set
of needs so saying that you should
always use react or always use angular
is pretty damn stupid but this video is
to help each individual developer decide
for themselves what they want to
specialize in what route they want to
take especially the new guys I think you
should learn both but of course you have
to start somewhere
and the let the last thing that I want
to mention here is that angular is a
framework and react is technically a
library by itself okay there's no
surprise there please don't you know
blow up the comments saying you know
this is the framework reiax library we
all know that but there's things you can
add packages you can add to react that
will basically turn it into a framework
that directly competes with angular and
it does directly compete with angular
alright so what we're doing is we're
basically comparing the two ecosystems
not the exact framework versus the exact
library alright so let's go ahead and
move on now we're gonna have a couple
different categories the first thing I
want to talk about is the learning curve
of both technologies when you choose a
technology to learn this is one of the
first things that you think about how
long is it going to
make me to learn this will I even be
able to learn it will be too hard well
let's start with angular and by the way
when I say angular I'm talking about
angular 4 not angularjs I just want to
make that clear so angular is a big
framework which means that it's it's
powerful and it includes a lot but of
course there's a lot to learn so when
starting to learn angular you're gonna
hear a lot of new intimidating
vocabulary like dependency injection
directives decorators pipes etc I will
tell you that it sounds a lot scarier
than it really is once you grasp these
concepts they're actually not hard at
all and you'll see how helpful and
powerful they actually are alright
another thing you have to deal with with
angular is typescript typescript is a
superset of JavaScript so it's basically
JavaScript plus a bunch of other
features including static typing so when
we create our components in angular we
can add types to them so if it's a
string or a number or a boolean now this
is important to mention that this is
optional you do not have to do this in
angular or in typescript you don't have
to define any types but I would
definitely recommend it because it does
make your code much more robust less
prone to errors and in my opinion makes
it much cleaner so you can also create
things like interfaces and you can kind
of map out your data and I know that
this stuff sounds difficult but once you
get the hang of it it really just adds
you know it adds a robustness to your
application all right angular is more
opinionated than react which is one of
the advantages in my opinion because
with react you can do you know you can
do the same thing a million different
ways with angular there's only you know
one or two ways to do certain things
which makes it easier to follow gives
you much more clear instructions on what
you're supposed to do alright so I look
at that as a big advantage to angular
right but again it's all preference you
might like the flexibility to do things
different ways all right so let's move
to reiax so as I said before react is a
library
if we were talking about just the core
library it's much smaller and much
easier to learn than the angular
framework now that's great and you'll be
able to say you'll learn react you
learned react in a shorter amount of
time than you did angular but react by
itself is not as powerful for or it's
not even near as powerful for large
applications it's a great view library
but if you want routing you know
validation HTTP requests things like
that you're gonna have to install other
packages and of course that adds to the
learning curve as well now as I said
with react there's there's a lot of
different ways to do the same thing if
you look at react code from two
different developers they'll probably
look completely different you know
whether where they're making HTTP
requests how they handle State and
properties all that stuff can be handled
very differently and a lot of the times
it can be in the wrong way yet it will
still work or some parts will work until
you know you get to a certain point you
realize you did it all wrong and you
have to go back and redo it so that to
me is the worst part of react but that's
just from my own experience you guys
might think differently about it okay
once you find the best practices that
stuff kind of all goes away and you know
it's fine but that does add to the
learning curve and that's what we're
talking about here all right so react
doesn't use templates or traditional
templates it uses something called JSX
or JavaScript extension or JavaScript
syntax extension which basically allows
us to embed HTML in the JavaScript and
at first this can seem a little quirky
especially when you were you know you're
probably taught to separate your your
markup and your your your JavaScript or
your logic but this is something that is
really powerful once you get the hang of
it and it's really easy to get the hang
of it's it's basically just putting HTML
inside JavaScript with a couple
different changes like you can't use the
class attribute you have to use class
name things like that but it's really
it's actually really easy to learn all
right so the last thing we have here is
Redux ok so react is often
used with Redux or flux which are
application levels state managers and in
my opinion Redux is frigging hard just
setting it up and just learning the
concepts of it is hard not just Redux
any kind of state manager so I'm
creating a react course now and trying
to explain Redux is is definitely the
toughest part alright I think it's
overused I think that a lot of
developers use redux where it's not
needed you know you don't really need it
for smaller applications but many
developers do insist on using it in
react with almost all situations and
personally I don't think that that
that's needed but you know it's all
preference people are gonna do what
they're gonna do but Redux is very
powerful I don't want to take that away
from it but talk when talking about the
learning curve it is pretty damn
difficult to to grasp at first alright
so the next category is performance and
this is kind of tough because it's not
really fair to directly compare the
performance of angular to react and the
reason for that is because angular is a
complete front-to-back framework it
includes routing form tools HTTP library
reactive extensions all these features
they bloat the framework and they make
it slower react however by itself is
just a view library which of course is
much smaller and of course much faster
now once you start adding packages like
the router you know adding an HTTP
client and any testing whatever you're
gonna add to your react application then
it starts to come up a little more to
where an Euler is and then you can start
comparing them fairly but even after
that react still wins the performance
the department it is a very fast
technology in general one thing to
mention though is that the change from
angular 2 to angular 4 there's not much
on the surface but under the hood they
did quite a bit to increase the
performance so angular 4 is definitely
you know performs better than angular 2
did so I just wanted to mention that but
I think that react definitely wins in
the performance Department
all right so now let's take a look at
features now I do want to mention that
both frameworks have a lot of the same
general features and advantages they
organize your code they're
component-based they offer dynamic
markup they're used to do a lot of the
same things and they share a lot of the
same features but let's look at some of
the individual features all right now
again at its core angular obviously has
a lot more features than react at its
core but we're kind of taking a look at
the ecosystem and you know common
packages that are used with react and
stuff like that so angular is basically
a batteries included framework it comes
with a component router you know
reactive extensions for things like
observables
an HTTP client a forms module for
validation and the list goes on all
right it also offers to a data binding
in a way that no other framework really
does binding data from the view to the
model is extremely easy using the ng
model directive angular also supports
MVC Model View controller or at least
different aspects from that design
pattern it also comes with features that
are easily implement allow you to easily
implement testing both the unit testing
and end-to-end testing which is also you
know a great feature of angular so it's
basically packed with features to build
enterprise level front-end applications
now react on the other hand does not
include much at its core but that's not
to say that things can't be added to
give it the you know the features that
angular includes out-of-the-box ok plus
some additional ones
react uses a virtual Dom which is very
powerful it creates its own lightweight
version of the actual Dom and only
includes and updates what's needed
rather than you know refreshing the
entire thing and this is part of the
reason that react is really really fast
it also uses JSX which is more powerful
than standard templates because you can
put absolutely any type of JavaScript
that you want in it JSX is not required
to use react but it makes things a hell
of a lot easier and I could I can't
think of any reason
and why you would not use JSX with
angular alright react also does a really
good job of managing component and state
I'm sorry component state and properties
it makes data really easy to work with
and pass around between components in my
opinion passing data between components
and angular is much more difficult than
doing it in react all right now react
alone it's kind of hard to maintain app
level state component State is easy but
if you want if you want true app level
state management then you're gonna need
something like Redux or flux or mob X
which I said before is pretty damn
confusing to learn but that doesn't mean
that it's not extremely powerful so
Redux although it's hard it is a great
feature of the you know the entire react
ecosystem alright then you have external
packages that are often used like the
react router the new react router
version 4 is a bit difficult to grasp
but it's also very powerful once you
want to you know get it running and set
it up correctly there's a lot of
different ways to use it as well react
doesn't have a core HTTP component like
angular does but of course you can use
fetch or you can use something like
Axios which is an external HTTP client
and then enzyme is popular for attesting
react so you have these different
packages that are commonly used with
react even though they're not part of
the actual library alright so I would
say both technologies share a good
amount of features and you know they
have some some nice individual ones as
well so if you're just comparing the
core technologies then angular of course
is the clear winner it includes a lot
more but you know you can add stuff to
react to to make it really powerful
alright so what about tooling so both
angular and react have some pretty nice
command-line interfaces the angular CLI
and create react app are both pretty
great and they really allow us to
streamline development the angular CLI
in my opinion is a bit more powerful
because we can quickly generate things
like components and services as far as I
know create react
can't do that you can you basically have
to create everything yourself as far as
the files and you know the basic
structure both system use web use
webpack they both have their own
autoloading dev servers they have
compiling and build tools obviously
angular has the additional task of
transpiling typescript
and the CLI has a script for that when
we run ng serve all that happens behind
the scenes okay it uses something called
TS c or typescript compiler for that and
both have testing tools as well I
believe create react app uses jest for
testing and then one of if not the most
important part of these tools is the
ability to build out your application
into production into static assets that
you can simply upload to a server or you
can place into your you know the
back-end client folder if it's a full
stack application so these are really
important you know you don't need to use
them of course you can build a react app
location just from the ground up with
with webpack but these these make it a
lot easier to not just build the
application but also compile and build
it out for production alright so I think
that they're both pretty even in in that
department alright so as I said both of
these technologies have their own
ecosystems which now spread well beyond
the browser so we'll start with angular
so ionic is a popular hybrid framework
which is basically an angular
application that runs inside of a native
wrapper for mobile apps so you can
create mobile apps using angular now
hybrid apps can be a bit clunky compared
to native applications the user
experience can be not so great at times
I'm not as fast and not as responsive
but I think out of the the different
hybrid frameworks ionic 3 is definitely
the best one all right now we also have
native script which allows us to build
true native apps iOS and Android apps
with angular as well as JavaScript now
I'm in the process of learning about
native script now so I can't say too
much about it
same thing with a lot of these
technologies but native script does not
seem to be you know as good as react
native at least at this point but again
it's all it's also newer it's a newer
technology now angular also has a
material design component library if
you're a fan of material design I hope
to do a tutorial on that soon angular
Universal is a seed project that can be
used to render angular on the server
side
there's also ng rx store which is a
state management library which was
inspired by Reax redux it's basically
you know it's based on state mutated by
peer reducers it also has integration
with reactive extensions all right and
you can see that these two kind of these
the once one of them does something the
other basically copies it in a you know
in a kind of a different way they've
basically become like the windows and
Apple of JavaScript frameworks
alright so react has quite the ecosystem
of course it has react native which is
extremely popular I would say it's the
best way to build mobile apps with you
know web type technologies it's very
fast and a lot of the applications if
built right they're right up there with
you know native apps that are built on
Swift or Java of course if they're
created correctly you know you can write
horrible applications with fantastic
technologies it's all up to the
developer react also has a material
design library called material UI which
you know much like angular's material
design component but this one seems to
be a little bit more mature next Jas is
a framework for rendering server-side
applications react applications it aims
to do this in the simplest way possible
so this can kind of be compared to
angular Universal we also have mob X
which is another way to manage state it
works a bit different than redux does it
provides a set of decorators to define
observables and observers and it
introduces reactive logic into your
state all right then we have story books
or story book which is
development environment for react it
allows you to browse a component library
view different states of each component
and interactively develop and test
components we even have reactive VR it's
the react is getting into virtual
reality and I haven't used this yet but
I have watched a few videos on it and
then react desktop is a JavaScript
library built on top of reacts library
which supposedly brings a native desktop
experience to the web okay featuring
many Mac OS X and Windows 10 components
so as you can see the the react
ecosystem is extremely large and
powerful react is making its way into
basically every aspect of technology so
I'd say in this category reacts
definitely wins so the last category
we're gonna look at is jobs now I have
to stress that this really depends on
where you are different companies in
certain areas are using different
technologies so I would suggest checking
out companies near you to see what
they're using but one common trend that
I've noticed is that angular for angular
2 they're used quite a bit in the
enterprise world and I think that's
because you know angular is geared more
toward really large scalable enterprise
applications the mean stack is
incredibly popular which is something
that we didn't even talk about and then
react seems to be like the cool
framework it's used in the startup world
so basically the suits you know the
people in suits and ties are using
angular and the hipsters with the
scruffy beards are using react at least
that's what I've noticed and then you
also have UJ s in there which is
up-and-coming but definitely not as many
jobs looking for view developers as
react and angular at least you know the
from what I'm what I've researched now
there's also quite a few companies that
are still using angularjs I thought I'd
mention that as well but I don't have a
solid answer on what's better to learn
to get a job faster especially you know
with the location issue you guys in the
comments feel free to post your
experiences and your opinions you know
maybe what they're looking for in your
area I've
always been an entrepreneur and I've
always had my own businesses so I'm not
the best person to give advice about
getting a job you know for a company
because I've always done my own thing so
I can only really tell you what I've
researched all right and I'm not gonna
sit here and lie and tell you I know
everything all right so bottom line with
with all of this is that there's there's
really not a clean clear-cut answer for
everyone if you're deciding between
these frameworks look at the different
categories and see what interests you
and try them both out see which one you
pick up quicker do some more research of
course more than just this video you're
never gonna get all the info you need
from one person or one video so read up
on some blog posts some some business
you know business journal type websites
technology websites and you know make a
decision and like I said I I think that
you should learn both but you need to
start somewhere all right hopefully you
guys enjoyed this and thanks for
watching feel free to share your own
opinions in the comments just please be
respectful of everyone you know no
fanboy and thanks a lot guys thanks
for watching so I just want to give
another shout out to male tag who
sponsored this video male tag is a free
Chrome browser extension that allows you
to track your emails in real time I've
been using it myself for about a week
now and I can't recommend it enough
on top of email tracking mail tag has a
bunch of other features like desktop
push notifications that alert you when
your emails have been opened link click
tracking that shows that people have
actually clicked on the links in your
email and a ton of other cool features
again all these features are completely
free be sure to check out male tag and
