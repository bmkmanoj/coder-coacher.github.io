angular 2 crash course now if you've
been following my channel for a while
you may have seen that I do have an
angular 2 playlist where I go over all
the basics and fundamentals but you may
have also noticed that there's some
things that no longer work in that
series that's because I made those
videos back when angular 2 was still in
the release candidate stage so there's
been some changes to the framework and
the syntax leaving some of those videos
useless so angular 2 is now stable and
I'm making a all in one guide or crash
course whatever you want to call it with
the updated syntax alright so we'll be
using angular 2.2 stable for this course
now we're going to go through a few
slides for people that are just starting
out so we can go over exactly what
angular 2 is and some of the
fundamentals then we'll jump into some
code from there now after you finish
this guide I would suggest that you
check out my 12 project angular 2 cores
from edge' wanax that way you can get
some actual projects and some actual
applications under your belt all right
now leave a link in the description
alright so what you should know before
going through this course or guide you
should know HTML and CSS now CSS is
important in this particular video but I
would suggest getting really good with
HTML and CSS before starting hardcore
JavaScript you should know some basic
JavaScript before getting into angular
but you don't have to be a pro by any
means you should basically just know the
fundamentals of programming things like
functions conditionals loops things like
that so what is angular 2 there's a lot
of different JavaScript technologies out
there some are libraries some are
plugins extensions frameworks any of the
two is a framework okay and it works on
the client-side it's not a server-side
framework but I'll go into what it's not
in a second and it's used to create very
powerful web applications it was created
and is maintained by Google it is the
most popular JavaScript framework to
date and it's often described
is what HTML would have been if it were
created for dynamic web applications and
not static websites so as I said a go-to
is not a server-side technology it runs
on the client it can be used on the
server but it's it's based to to run on
the client side it's not a JavaScript
library such as jQuery or react or
mootools or anything like that it's not
a design pattern like model view
controller or mvvm or anything like that
it's not a platform like dotnet it's not
a language it's also not a plugin or an
extension okay it's a client-side
framework so what angular 2 offers these
are just some of the things that it
offers but we have dynamic HTML okay so
as I said it's basically what HTML would
have been for applications because in
applications you have a lot of dynamic
functionality it's not just mock-up to
display a static website uses powerful
templates fast rendering uses HTTP
services you can make get requests and
post requests it uses components so it
has a component encapsulation which is
extremely helpful and makes your
applications that much cleaner form an
input handling event handling it has
routing uses the latest JavaScript
standards uses es2015 typescript and
much much more
so what's new from angular 1
well angular 2 is completely different
than angular 1 and a lot of people ask
me if if they should learn angular 1
first and I would definitely say no
because I think that it will do nothing
but confuse you ok because it's very
different angular 1 uses controllers and
scope which are not included in angular
2 angular 2 basically replace that with
components okay everything is based
inside of a component now which makes
our code cleaner makes it more reusable
it also has a reduced learning curve
since everything's in
slated in the component and no longer in
scope and different controllers it's a
little easier to learn it also uses
typescript which is a superset of
JavaScript and I'll get into that in a
second and it also uses es2015 which is
also known as es6 okay which is a later
standard of JavaScript it offers better
mobile support for mobile apps it also
uses reactive extensions or rxjs which
is a set of libraries to work with
asynchronous data okay and it also gives
us something called observables so what
is typescript as I said it's a strict
superset of JavaScript so basically it's
everything javascript is with some added
features it's maintained by Microsoft it
gives us some features such as static
typing makes it look a little bit more
like let's say Java or C++ languages
like that it also gives us class-based
object-oriented programming which is
extremely helpful and that's based
basically what angular 2 is based off of
his classes ok every component is a
class so components are the main way to
build and specify elements and logic on
the page there are basic building blocks
of the user interface an angular
application is basically just a tree of
angular components decorators allow us
to mark class as an angular component
and provide metadata that determines how
the component should be processed
instantiated and used at runtime so this
is an example of a component we're
importing the main component package
from angular and then this is a
decorator okay when you see this at
syntax this is a decorator and we can
provide metadata all right so the
selector is basically what we'll use for
the tag the HTML tag to insert the
component the template is the content of
the component in this case it's a div
with some text you can see we have this
double curly brace syntax
this is interpolation basically we're
bringing in a dynamic variable
alright called name now if we go down
here into the class
see in the constructor we're saying this
dot name equals max so we're setting
this name property to max and that's
what's going to display up here we can
also have events okay so this button
here has a click event events always
have parentheses around them and then
we're calling a function that's called
say my name all right and then you can
see that down here under the constructor
and it's basically just going to
console.log my name is and then
whatever's in that property in this case
it's max all right now if that's
confusing to you that's absolutely fine
we're going to get more into that later
so in addition to components we have
services which are used for reusable
data services to share between
components throughout an application so
services basically you want to use those
to access data okay if you're working
with an API where you're fetching data
from a database or back-end you want to
put that in a service so that you can
access it from all components okay you
don't want to just stick it in one
component because then you can't use it
from other ones so you want to use a
service for that it keeps the components
lean and focused on supporting the view
and services are asynchronous and we can
return data as a promise or an
observable using reactive extensions all
right and I'll get into that a little
later so we're just about done with the
slides before we get started I just want
to go over some of the installation
methods so you can create an angular 2
app from complete scratch you'll have to
install it using NPM and it can get kind
of difficult so I would suggest using
the QuickStart this is the github link
to the QuickStart that's what we'll be
doing there's also an angular CLI tool
you can install that with NPM as well
you want to install it globally we're
not going to use the CLI tool in this
video however I do have other videos
where where we do use it alright so
we'll use the QuickStart
now the requirements you're going to
need nodejs installed NPM which is node
package modules that comes with no js'
you don't have to worry about installing
that separately and then you're also
going to need git
all right and I'll give you the links in
a second - to get those set up all right
so that's going to do it for the slides
now we're going to jump in we're going
to set up any other two and we'll get
started
all right so we're going to go ahead and
get started now if you don't have no js'
installed you want to get that set up
just go to node.js org go ahead and
download and install it it's really easy
on Windows it's just a standard Windows
installer and then if you're on Linux or
Mac it's also easy I do have a tutorial
showing you how to install it in a bun -
it's also easy with a Mac just go ahead
and look at the documentation excuse me
now I'd also suggest that you get get
especially since we're using the Quick
Start we're just going to clone it using
git if you're on Windows you just want
to go to get SCM comm click on this
download for Windows and just get that
installed alright once you have that
installed you'll have access to the git
bash utility which is a command line
utility I would suggest using that but
of course you can use your Windows
command line as well so this is the
angular 2 website angular do this is
where you want to find all the
documentation all that good stuff but
what we want to do is get the quick
start ok so that's a github comm slash
angular slash quickstart and you can
download the zip if you want you click
on this here and then click download zip
but we're just going to clone it using
git ok and it has the command right here
that we can use so what I'm going to do
is open up my let's see I'm going to go
to my C Drive and then projects now like
I said if you have the git bash utility
you can right click and then just click
get bash here and that'll open up a
command line right in that folder ok so
what I want to do is clone the
QuickStart into that folder so I'm just
going to grab this command and paste
that in and instead of calling this my
progeny call it my app alright so let's
go ahead and run that and what that did
is it created a folder called my app
with the QuickStart in it so I'm going
to say CD my
app so that we can go into that
directory alright now before we install
the dependencies I'm going to add it to
my editor which I'm using Visual Studio
code which I would suggest either this
or Adam is what I use for angular 2
because it uses typescript and it has
some really good typescript highlighting
so let's see we're going to add a
project folder here of my app alright so
this is the QuickStart this is what it
gives us and I'm definitely not going to
go through all this we have the
index.html file okay if this has the
main my app tag right here that's where
the app can where the main app
components loaded it also has the all
the includes that we need script tags
now if we click on package.json this is
where all the dependencies are you can
see angular actually comes in a bunch of
different packages we have the common
the compiler of the core HTTP and forms
modules comes in a bunch of separate
packages so in order to install all of
this we have to go over and say npm
installed okay so that will get
everything set up it'll create a node
modules folder for us okay it might take
a minute or two and you can see down
here all the other dependencies we have
our typescript right here it comes with
light server that's the dev server that
we can run reactive extensions right
here system J s gets all of our packages
together karma which is a testing
utility which we're not going to get
into but it does include quite a bit of
stuff here the QuickStart alright so it
looks like that's all set you can see
now there's a node modules folder so now
we should be able to run our dev server
by saying npm start and that should open
it up in our browser
and there we go so you can see that mine
is it's running on three three zero zero
two I think that usually it's on three
thousand I might have something on that
port right now running so that's why
it's on that but yours may be three
thousand all right so let's go ahead and
just open up the console it's good to
have that open f12 and Chrome and then
what we're going to do is just look at
the files here so in the app folder this
is where our components go now notice
there's there's a bunch of different app
component files what we want to focus on
is the TS files that's the typescript
files that we want to edit all right pay
no attention to the the map files or the
spec or the J s basically app component
ts gets compiled into app component J S
so this is what we want to work in the
TS the the compiled file is much more
difficult to work with
so we're not going to touch that the
first file I want to look at is main dot
TS this is basically where we bring in
app module okay and then we're going to
bootstrap that hot module now you don't
have to really understand what this is
I'm just going to try to explain it
quickly angular 2 has a bootstrap module
that does just that at bootstrap the
entire application alright if we go into
app module TS this is where we import ng
module that basically binds together all
the components all the modules things
like that and then let's see we have our
app component TS this is the main app
component this is what's being imported
all right now every component you have
to import the component package from
angular core and then it has a decorator
called component a selector okay we
already looked at this in the slides and
then a template and basically we're just
going to say hello and then whatever's
in the name property which you can see
is angular so that's why we're seeing
this hello angular all right
and since the selector is my app
if we look at the index.html file you'll
see that that's what it is right here my
app alright so what we're going to do is
in the main app component file let's
just experiment a little bit here all
right so let's add another property
we'll call it email all right and we'll
set this you know what I'll do is set
the name to John Doe
let's set the email to John at gmail.com
all right so we should be able to put
that in here now I'm just going to put
this on multiple lines now we're able to
do this because we're using template
literals notice that this is a back tick
not a quote that allows us to use
multiple lines all right so let's go
ahead and let's put a paragraph okay we
can put any HTML we want in here
and we'll put email and then we'll use
that double curly brace and in here
we'll say email all right so let's save
that and that should reload and there we
go I'm actually going to take away that
I don't want the h1 around the paragraph
so let's put that right so just put it
right here all right so you can see that
it's it's using interpolation and it's
putting in the email value so let's say
we also want an address we'll say
address and we'll set this one to an
object
okay so we'll say Street say 12 Main
Street we'll put a city say Boston and a
state
okay now if we go up here and we were to
put in another paragraph and then say
address and save you can see that it
just says object okay because it doesn't
know what which one of these to display
so what we can do is if we want the
street we can say dot Street
okay so we'll save that and now it gives
us the street so let's add next to it
address dot city and then address dot
state all right so that gives us the
address and I'll put a label here as
well all right and we can wrap the label
and strong tags now as far as the
application the application isn't going
to do much I just want to focus on the
functionality and the syntax of angular
2 okay so now that you know how to
create variables or properties down here
and use them up here we're going to take
a look at creating our own component
instead of using this app component I
usually like to use this as kind of a
meeting place for all of my sub
components
so in the app folder we're going to
create a new folder called components
and inside there let's create a new file
and we'll call it user dot component TS
alright make sure you use the TS all
right now you'll notice that
automatically it creates user component
J s and a J s map ok so it automatically
compiles the typescript files now I'm
going to copy everything we have in the
app component TS and put it in the user
component and then we're going to change
the selector to user and then we're
going to change the class to user
component
all right so we'll save that and then
what we want to do is when you add a
component you need to add it to the app
module dot TS file you can see we're
importing the main app component now
let's import the user component okay and
that's going to be in the components
folder slash user component all right
now we have to what they do here we have
to also add it to the declarations any
time we had create a component and we
import it we need to add it here as well
why don't I keep the misspelling that
all right so let's go ahead and save
that now if we go to our app component
now we want to get rid of all this and
we can now use user all right now we're
using user because that's what we used
as our selector right here okay and then
down here we can actually just clear all
this out so let's go ahead and save that
and it should look the exact same but
now this is coming from our user
component not the the main app component
so now what I want to do is in our user
component we're going to create a
constructor and this runs every time the
component is rendered so if we say
console.log constructor ran and we save
it and when it reloads you'll see we get
constructor ran now we can change any of
these properties we want down here so if
we say this okay you want to use this
and we'll say dot name equals say Sam
Smith okay if we go ahead and save that
and let it reload now we get hello Sam
Smith now a good way to do this is not
to define the values up here but to
or at least defined the actual value you
can define the variables in fact you
have to define the variables so the
properties but we want the values to be
down here so let's go ahead and just
copy all of this and put it in here
let's move this back all right little
tab these over so we want to set all of
these to have this dot in front of them
all right and then up here we don't want
to actually define the value but we do
want to define the property variable and
then for address just go like that
all right so if we save that that should
still work but it's good practice to use
typing okay so our Taipings
so for name we know that that's going to
be a string so we can actually define
that to be a string okay same thing with
email that's also a string now for
address that's an object and it has
certain fields inside of it so what we
can do is create an interface for this
address property so down here let's say
interface address and we want to define
the fields so name which will be a
string I'm sorry not name Street we have
city string and state string alright and
then all we have to do up here is say
that we want this to be of the type
address
okay so we'll save that and if we look
at the command line that's running the
server if there's any errors this will
tell us all right now let's say that we
want let's throw this off a little bit
and change this
to the word streets all right now you
can already see we're getting an error
here it's saying that the type address
does not have streets in it okay to see
doesn't exist streets doesn't exist in
type address if we save that this should
also tell us that so if we look right
here or is it streets does not exist in
type address so whatever we have here
should match the interface
okay so we'll change that back to Street
so now what I want to do is I want to
add an array of hobbies for this user
okay so let's say hobbies and we want to
set that to string but it's going to be
an array so you want to add the brackets
and then down here we'll say this dot
hobbies and let's say music movies and
sports okay so up here let's put in h3
and we'll say hobbies now if we just put
in our double curly braces and we say
hobbies let's save that now if you want
this format to just have each hobby with
a comma that's fine you can leave it
like that but a lot of the times you'll
want to loop through through an array
and then maybe I'll put a list item or
whatever it is you want to do with each
one so to do that we can use we can use
the ng for directive so let's say we
want to UL and then inside here we'll
have L eyes now we want to loop through
those hobbies and output an Li for each
one so in here we're going to say
asterisk ng for and we're going to set
that to Hobby
of hobbies alright actually there should
be a letter right here
so wet hobby of hobby soon now we should
have access to each one using this
variable so inside the Li we're going to
put our double curly braces and put
hobby okay let's save that and now you
can see that it's outputting a list item
for each hobby now in addition to ng
four we also have ng if so what I'm
going to do here is create another
property called show hobbies and we're
going to set that or when I could have
set it here we're going to set the type
to boolean okay and then down here let's
say this dot show hobbies and we're
going to set that to false actually this
should be boolean so we're setting it to
false now let's wrap this in a div and
we're going to put ng-if equals show
hobbies okay we'll wrap the UL alright
so if we go ahead and save that and
reload
let's see can't bind to NF oh let should
be ng if okay so now you can see the
hobbies are not showing anymore so now
what we'll do is let's create a button
that is linked to that has a click event
that's linked to a function to display
those hobbies so we'll go right above
the ng if we just created and put a
button now whenever you want to use an
event you use parenthesis and then
whatever that event handler okay which
is going to be click and then we'll set
that to a function let's call it toggle
hobbies
all right and then here we'll say show
hobbies all right so if we save that
that'll show a button okay right now if
I click it we get an error because there
is no toggle hobbies function so let's
go create that down here after the
constructor let's say toggle hobbies and
just to test it out we'll say
console.log show now if I click it down
here you can see we get show alright so
what we want to do now is we want to set
show hobbies to true so we can easily do
that by saying this stock show hobbies
equals true save it now if I click it it
shows our hobbies now I want to make it
so that if we click it again it hides
them so it kind of toggles them so what
we can do is do an if statement here so
we'll say if this dot show hobbies is
equal to true then we want to set it to
false and then we'll say else and let's
wrap this we'll set it to true okay so
if we go ahead and save that now if I
click it shows it click it again it
hides it alright now we can also set
conditionals up here for instance if
they're hidden we want it to say show
hobbies but if they're displayed we want
to say hide hobbies so what we can do is
let's open up our curly braces here and
we'll say look at the show hobbies value
if if it's true then we want this to say
hide
bobby's if not we want this to say show
hobbies alright so now let's save it now
if we click that now it says hide
hobbies ok and it switches alright so
we've covered quite a bit already in
this very simple application what I want
to do now is go over inputs ok and data
and binding okay so we can create an
input and bind it to any of these
properties so what we'll do is go let's
see what I want to put will go under
everything and let's create a form we
actually don't even need the form tags
but I think it's good practice all right
so it's a label name put a line break
and then we'll have an input with the
type of text ok that's going to have a
name of name and then we're going to use
what's called ng model and that's used
to basically bind this to a property now
ng model is it's basically two-way so we
have to use brackets and parentheses and
then we're going to say ng model equals
and we want to bind it to the name
property alright now if I save this
we're going to get an error okay we get
an error because we need to we need to
include the forms module in order to use
ng model so we need to go to app module
TS and up here we're going to say import
forms module and that's going to be from
at angular slash forms ok now we have to
include that in the imports right here
say forms module okay we'll save that
and now you can see that we have this
input it says John Doe if I go ahead and
clear that out you'll see that it
actually binds to that h1 up there all
right
I'm actually going to get rid of the
hello I don't need that okay so whatever
we type in here is going to reflect up
there which is really cool obviously
when I reload it's going to go back
because we're not persisting the data
but it is however bound to to that
property all right so let's just add
some for the for the rest of them and
actually put a line break here and we'll
copy that okay so we have name let's
also do the email and when you use
ng-model you also have to have a name
attribute with the same same value so
email what else do we have we have our
address field so let's say Street and we
can actually set this to address dot
Street okay this will be the city and
we'll set that to address dot city this
will be what state
all right
so let's see let's also put on a put an
HR right here
all right let's save that so now we have
our form and it has all the different
values and no matter what we change here
you can see that it's actually changing
it up above as well
all right let's actually put put an h3
here we'll stay edit user all right now
we can also work with forms without
using ng model and using that that
binding technique so what I want to do
is create an input here to add to this
hobbies list so let's go right under the
UL and we'll put an input actually let's
just copy one of these okay we'll just
say edit no not edit add hobby and we're
not going to use ng model here oops okay
so we're not gonna use ng model but we
do want to identify this input so we're
going to use a number sign and then
we're going to call this hobby alright
now we're going to wrap this actually in
a form tag okay and we're going to add
an event handler onto the form tag for
submit so let's put in parentheses and
we'll stay submit and when it's
submitted we'll call add hobby okay now
we want to pass along this input value
so right here we should be able to say
hobby dot value all right so let's add
that down here
say add hobby and that should take in
hobby and then let's just do a console
dot log hobby okay so let's make sure
that works say test and enter and we get
tests so all we need to do now is to
push that on to the hobbies array so to
do that we can say this dot hobbies dot
push and pass along hobby okay so let's
go ahead and we'll say poetry enter and
then it adds there alright we can add as
many as we want if we reload it's going
to go away of course because we're not
persisting it to a database or an API or
anything but you know this is all about
these are interface right now now if we
want to be able to delete these from the
interface that's easy as well so let's
go up here and we're just going to add a
button next to the hobby we'll give it a
click we'll set it to delete hobby okay
and for the text I'm just going to put
an X alright now we need to know which
hobby we want to delete so we want to
pass along the index now when we do an
ng4 we can also add to the end of this
we can put a semicolon and then say let
I'm going to say let's I equals index
all right and then what we'll do is pass
that I along to delete hobby so now
let's go create that
okay delete hobby that's going to take
along the index and then all we have to
do here is splice from that array that
index so we can say this dot hobbies dot
splice passing the index and we just
want to delete one from that index so
let's save it and now if we go and click
show hobbies let's say movies we can go
ahead and delete that all right we can
add them and we can delete them okay so
now what I want to do is create a
service okay so we're going to look at
two things here we're going to look at
services we're also going to look at the
HTTP module okay I want to be able to
make a request to an outside API and
bring data into our application all
right so we want to grab data from I
don't remember the exact URL but it's
this right here Jason placeholder dot
type II code comm okay this basically
gives us a free online rest service and
we can get post comments albums photos
to do our users okay so we're gonna we
want to grab some posts and it shows you
the different routes you can use you can
even make post requests puts deletes but
we want to make a get request to posts
okay and you can see that it gives us I
think a hundred different posts with an
ID title body so what we want to do is
set up a service so in the app folder
we'll create a folder called services
and let's create a file we'll call it
post dot service dot TS alright and then
let's see in here we want to import a
couple things we want to import
something called injectable because we
want to be able to inject this service
as a dependency so that comes from
angular slash core and then we want to
be able to use the HTTP module so we're
going to import HTTP from angular slash
HTTP and we also want we're going to be
working with an observable through
reactive extensions and we want to
import the map operator so that we can
map that data so we want to say import
rxjs slash add slash operator slash map
alright now to use the injectable we're
going to add the injectable decorator
just like that and then we can create
our class which we need to export so
Explorer class and we're going to call
it post service all right now inside
here we'll create a constructor and
let's just do console dot log and we'll
say posts service initialized now in
order to use this HTTP module we need to
import it through here so we're going to
say private HTTP and set it to that HTTP
just like that now we want to use this
in our user components so we're going to
go to our user component and we need to
import the service up here
okay so import posts service and that's
going to be from we want to go dot dot
slash outside of the components folder
into services and then post service
write or no post dot service
all right now we also need to add that
as a provider so we're going to go in
the component decorator under the
template which ends right here
and we need to say providers which is an
array and then we want to pass in post
service all right so if we save that
we're going to get an error or we should
I would think we get an error because we
need to import the HTTP module alright
so let's go into app module TS and just
like we imported the forms module we're
going to add here HTTP module which
comes from angular slash HTTP and then
we also need to add it down here all
right we must not be getting the error
because we haven't tried to use the
service function yet or we haven't
created it yet
so inside post service under constructor
let's create function called get posts
all right and then from here what we
want to do is make a get request so
we're going to return this dot HTTP dot
get and then we want to pass in here the
URL we want to get from which is going
to be this right here okay we'll paste
that in there and then we want to go on
the next line and say dot map okay this
is going to actually we want to return
an observable so we want to map response
to res dot JSON
okay it's going to be in JSON format and
that's it so let's save it and then what
we want to do is call this from our
component and load up the post so let's
go to user component TS and we'll go
down to let's see the constructor that's
where we'll do this and we should be
able to use this
the post service but we need to inject
it into the constructor so we're going
to say private post service and we're
going to set it to posts service which
we import it up above all right and then
in the constructor let's say this dot
posts service and we want to call the
get post function now this is going to
return an observable so we have to
subscribe to it alright so let's do dot
subscribe and then in here that will
give us our posts and we can set it to
an arrow function and for now it's just
console dot log posts ok see what that
gives us save it and there we go so you
can see it's giving us a hundred posts
with titles bodies IDs ok so now we want
to do is we want to have a property up
like we do up here for posts so let's
say I'm sorry up here I'll say posts and
we're going to set it to post ok and
it's going to be an array so now this is
going to be an interface that we create
just like we did with the address
so we'll say interface post and that's
going to have an ID which will be a
number it'll have a title string and a
body striking alright and then what we
want to do is set this dot posts equal
to the posts that are coming in from the
observable from the service
ok so we'll save that and then we should
be able to access the post from our
template so let's go up here under the
form we'll put an HR put an h3 and we'll
say posts
okay just like we did with the hobbies
we're going to use ng for okay but I
want to put that in a div so ng for
equals let's post of posts and then here
let's put an h3 that'll be where the
title goes so let's do post title and
then a paragraph and we'll say post dot
body ok let's save it go back and there
we go there's all the posts coming in
from the API now this is getting a
little cluttered with all this HTML all
this markup in the template so what we
can do is we can actually set a separate
file for the template so if we say
inside components let's say new user dot
component dot HTML all right and then
what we'll do is from the user component
TS we're going to grab from the h1 all
the way down to the last div we're going
to cut that out and paste that in the
HTML file save it and then in here we're
going to change this to template URL
oops I'll change it to template URL and
set it to user dot component dot HTML
now in order to use relative paths here
we have to actually add something else
here to our decorator you know what let
me just have these over so we have to
add module module ID and then set it to
module dot ID
okay and that will give us a text editor
error but it should be fine all right so
let's go ahead and save that and now it
should be coming from the HTML file so
just to test it out and we just say test
and there it is okay so just to separate
things a little bit kind of fins up your
component file so we've looked at quite
a bit so far components binding
templates events directives services the
last thing I want to look at is routing
okay so we're going to just implement
the router now what I want to do is
create another component and this is
going to be called a boat dock component
dot TS and let's just copy everything
that's in the main app component TS file
okay and then we'll just paste that in
it's change is selected to a boat and
then in the template let's just put an
h1 and we'll say above this app okay
then we want to export about component
all right now what we have to do to be
able to use this is bring it into app
dot module just like we did with the
other components so let's go ahead and
do that boat that's going to come from a
boat dock component okay now it's not
going to show up anywhere because we
haven't loaded it I mean we could
include it in the main app component but
I want to add a router so that we can
actually go to slash about and that'll
load that template up or that component
up so to start off with the router we
need to create a file inside the app
folder and we're going to call this app
dot
outing dot TS alright and then in here
we want to import a couple things we
want to put something called module with
providers and that's going to be from
angular core and then we also want to
import routes and router module and
that's going to be from angular slash
router alright now we need to bring in
the components that we want to use in
the router which is going to be the user
and the about component so let's go
ahead and do that
use your component that's going to be
from dot slash components slash user dot
component okay we also want to bring in
the about
all right so now we want to create a
variable I'm going to use Const and
we're going to say app routes and then :
routes and we're going to set that to an
array of objects okay this one this is
going to take a path now this is going
to be for the the route path so we're
going to leave that blank and we want to
use the user component for that route
all right and then we also want the
about so we're going to say path about
component will be oops about component
all right and then finally we just want
to export down here say export Const
routing and then just throw in that
module with providers equals router
module and then we're going to say dot
for route and then we just want to pass
in that out a Prout's variable and
that's it so let's go ahead and save
that then we want to go to our app
module TS file and we're going to go
right here and import routing from app
dot routing and we have to add that in
the imports right here
just like that okay we'll save that now
a couple other small things we need to
do we're going to go into our index.html
and then right below the bot the opening
body we're just going to put in base
href equals and then slash so we're
setting our route our base route all
right so let's save that and then we
want to go to our main app component
and instead of where our main have
component instead of outputting user
we're going to output router
- outlet because this is now dynamic
depending on whatever route URL we're at
all right let's save it and let's see
not part of any ng module let's see what
the problem is here if we go to app
module oh we didn't add the about
component to the declaration okay we'll
save that okay so the the home route is
showing the user component that's good
now let's go to slash a boat and now
it's showing the about component alright
so if we were to add more components we
could add them to our routes by adding
them right here okay so that's how we
can use the router and if we want to put
a link to the about page let's see we
could put that in the main app component
HTML so right here if we want to now as
far as linking to our routes we want to
use router link so router link to slash
for the home which is also the user
component alright let's save that and
then this will be to a boat that's going
to go to slash about alright I'm not
going to focus on what it looks like
it's if you want to bring in bootstrap
and make it look better that's simple
all right so now if we click about takes
us to about home takes us back to the
user component all right so that's how
we can implement the router so we're
going to go ahead and stop here I would
definitely suggest that you move on to
my 12 project course it is extremely
cheap for the amount of content that it
includes if if you don't feel like
spending any money that's fine I would
suggest moving on to one of the angular
2 projects that I have on YouTube all
right so that's it thanks for watching
