installed Ubuntu server and we've
changed the hostname to test server and
the next step is pretty important by
default our server was given an IP
address from the DHCP gateway which is
my neck' router alright so what we want
to do is set it as a static IP address
so that it doesn't change and we're also
going to set a couple of other things so
in Linux if you want to see our IP
information you can use the command IIF
you just click in here ifconfig and if
you're familiar with Windows it's IP
config pretty much does the same kind of
thing all right so let's take a look at
this you can see that our IP address our
internal IP address is 10.00
all right my network I'm on my home
network which is a 10.00 network all
right so my router or my gateway is
10.0.0.0 and virtual machines on my
network alright so I'm going to actually
use this IP address I'm just going to
make sure that I set it as a static IP
address ok so what we want to do is edit
a file so we're going to say sudo nano
et Cie slash network slash interfaces
alright so there's a few things that we
want to do here if we go down here we
want to leave these lines we just want
to change this one here this um I met
DHCP alright like I said by default
we're using the DHCP server and we don't
want to do that we want to set this as
static all right and then there's a few
lines we want to add under here okay so
the first one will be the actual IP
address okay which I'm going to keep as
the one that the DHCP server assigned
which is 10 0 0 1 3 and then add a few
other things here too I'm going to add
in my net mask which is going to be 2 5
5 to 5 5 to 5 5.0
ok next I want to define the network now
if you have a local network it you could
very well be using the 161 98.1 6 2.0 or
whatever my network is on the 10.0.0.0
alright broadcast I don't think that
this is required but I like to put it
anyways which is going to be 1000 - 5 5
all right now the Gateway you do have to
have that which is going to be in my
case my my Netgear router which is on
1000won and then finally we're going to
put in our dns
nameservers and I usually just use the
public Google's public name servers
which is 8.8.8.8 and then I'm going to
put a space and put 8.8.4.4 okay so
those are Google's public name servers
so that's pretty much all we need to do
here so I'm going to do a control X and
make sure I click Y to save and that's
it all right now that we have a static
IP address I want to remove the DHCP
client because I don't want I don't want
to have any more IP addresses handed to
the server so I'm going to say sudo
apt-get remove DHCP 3 - client all right
so now that we have that out of the way
we can now we've start the network
all right so that's how you can make
your IP address static and also add your
dns name servers for your server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
