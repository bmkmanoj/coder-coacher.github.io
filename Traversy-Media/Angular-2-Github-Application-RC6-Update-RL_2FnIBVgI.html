building a github profile search
application now I've had I have a video
that I made a few months ago where we
built this app using angular to release
candidate for well since then our c6 has
been released so that code may no longer
work if you're going if you follow along
and you use the QuickStart and so on
with because the QuickStart now uses our
c6 so I figured I'd make another video
with that application but I'm gonna go
through it a little quicker than I did
the first time all right but I'll still
try and explain what I'm doing as we go
along alright so this is a good
opportunity for you to really see what
what's different about our c6
okay unfortunately when we're still in
the release candidate stage of an
application things can change really
rapidly and really severely all right so
we're going to go ahead and first of all
register our github application so if
you log in to get up and go to slash
settings / developers you should be able
to register a new application now the
reason I'm doing this is because if you
don't do this and you don't get an API
key you'll only get a certain amount of
requests from your application and a few
times using this API I've actually run
out and I've had to do this so really
simple we're just gonna put in an
application name let's take it hub
search for the home page
we're gonna just use localhost port 3000
we're also gonna use that here for the
description I'm just gonna say simple
search app okay so we'll register and
now we have our application registered
we have a client ID and a client secret
all right so we're just going to keep
that page open for now all right now
we're gonna be using the QuickStart so
if you go to github.com slash angular
slash quickstart there is a command down
here to clone it I'm just gonna grab
that alright and then we're going to
open up a command line I'm using Windows
but of course you can
use Linux or Mac whatever it is that you
like alright so we're gonna go to CD I'm
gonna go to projects folder called
projects but you can build it wherever
you like
and we're going to go ahead and paste
that in and I'm going to delete that my
proj and we're gonna call this the
github search okay and that's gonna go
ahead and clone it into that directory
now we'll go CD github search and we're
gonna run npm install okay that's gonna
go ahead and install all the
dependencies now i'm gonna open that
folder in my editor i'm using visual
studio code which is free if you want to
check that out and let's see github
search alright now if we go and we look
at the package.json file here you can
see that our angular version is rc6
alright and if you're watching this in
the future and when they update this i
will try and redo it again so that so
that it's kept up now I'm gonna change
the name right here we're just going to
change it to github search and save it
and that's pretty much all we have to do
in this file so we're gonna close it up
now let's go ahead and run this so we're
gonna say NPM start and that should
start our application alright let's open
up the console with f12 and we have no
errors which is good all right now we're
gonna kind of go over what's changed
here so you'll notice that we do have
the app component TS and the TS files
are all we're paying attention to here
because the Java scripts those are just
the compiled files alright so we want
the typescript files and if we look at
this component ts file there's no
difference from our C for from the
previous applique
we built what is different is this app
module dot TS and this is basically
where we're going to import all of our
components ok so if you have inner
components instead of bringing them into
the main app component you bring them
into here and then just add them in the
declarations array okay this is also
where we define our bootstrap which is
the main app component all right and
then any modules we use such as the HTTP
module you want to bring in and then
import here okay so what we're gonna do
now is in the app folder we're gonna
create a folder called components and
inside there we're only going to create
one component which is going to be the
github component so we'll create a new
file here call it github.com ponent dot
TS alright and then we're just going to
copy what we have in the app component
to yes and bring that over and we're
going to change the selector we'll just
change that to github and then we need
to change the name of the class to
github component all right and for now
let's put a constructor in here and the
constructor will automatically run when
the components rendered so I just want
to do a console dot log and we'll just
say github a component in it okay so
we'll save that now if I reload now
we're not going to see anything because
we need to bring it over to our app dot
module actually no one going to do first
is change this template we're just going
to say github
component ok and then we'll go over to
app dog module TS and we're gonna bring
that in here ok it's gonna come from
slash components slash github.com ponent
ok now we need to add that into this
array right here like that ok we'll save
that and now we're going to go to app
component TS and you see where we have
the template here let's go ahead and
just add in here github
an opening tag and a closing tag and
we'll save that and then you can see
that that's showing up and we also see
the init message in the console
alright so it's as easy as that to
create a component and then import it to
the the module file and then just add
the tag here or the directive rather now
instead of including the template as a
string like this in both this file and
in our github file we want to use a
separate HTML file so in the the core of
the root folder here are the app folder
rather we're going to create a new file
called app dot component dot HTML and
we're going to grab from the TS file
this template ok we'll just copy that
and then we're gonna change template to
template URL and then we can specify a
location which is going to be app
component dot HTML now in order to use
relative paths like this just to have
the file name and not have to do some
long path we have to provide up here
module ID and then set it to module dot
ID
okay so we'll save that and then let's
go into the HTML and paste that in and
save and then we should just get what we
just had okay and I'll just change this
just to make sure and just say welcome
okay so we know that now that's coming
from that HTML file now we want to do
the same thing with our github component
so inside of the components folder let's
create a file called github dot
component dot HTML and then same thing
we're going to go into the github ts
file and change this to template URL
change that to github.com ponent dot
HTML and then we're going to add the
module ID up here and save and then in
the github component let's just say get
up okay so now we know that those
components now have their own HTML files
so now what we want to do is create a
service okay so we're going to create in
the app folder alongside of the
components folder we'll create a folder
called services okay and then inside
there we'll have a file called github
service dot TS now this file is going to
be virtually the exact same as it was in
the rc4 version okay so we're going to
import the injectable package so that we
can inject this service as a dependency
and that's gonna be from angular slash
core ok now we're also going to be using
the HTTP module but we're going to
import that actually no it will import
it here too I'm not exactly sure if we
need to do it here as well as app dot
module but it's not going to hurt
so we're going to import HTTP and
headers and that's going to be from at
angular slash HTTP okay we're also going
to be using reactive extensions because
we want what we want to do is return an
observable using the HTTP module alright
and we want to use the map operator and
that's part of reactive extensions or
rxjs so we're going to say import our
XJS slash add slash operator slash map
ok now we're going to add the injectable
decorator like that and then we can
create our class so we're gonna say
explore class call it github service ok
now we're gonna have a couple properties
here one is going to be the user name
okay so this is gonna be the default
user name I'm gonna just set it to my
github name if I can remember how to
spell my home name and then we're going
to have the client ID and the client
secret
so client underscore ID
client secret okay we're just gonna grab
those from the application registration
that we did so this will be the ID and
the secret all right so now we're gonna
have our constructor and then the
constructor we need to inject the HTTP
module so we're going to say private and
it'll just call us underscore HTTP and
set that to HTTP which is coming from up
here from the module all right and then
let's just do a console log and we'll
just say github service in it all right
and let's just keep it at that for now
so we'll save it and then we're going to
go into getcomponent TS and let's go up
to the top here and we're going to
import that service so github service
from it's gonna be dot dot slash
services slash github dot
and then we're going to add it down here
as a provider so we need to say
providers which is an array and then
we'll just add that github not component
service all right and then we need to
just inject it into our constructor so
we'll say private underscore github
service set that to github service all
right so now we should be able to use
that let's save it and go to our
application
and then down here you can see we get
github service in it so we know that
that's connected to our application into
that component so what we want to do now
is we want to be able to fetch a user's
profile information through our service
so let's go back to github service TS
and down here we're going to create a
function called get user and we're gonna
set in observable in here and we'll do
that using the HTTP module so we'll say
this dot underscore HTTP GET because
it's going to be a get request alright
and then here we need to put the URL so
if I open another tab and I go to HTTP
API dot github.com slash users slash and
then a username it'll give us all this
information ok it gives us the login
which is the username the ID the avatar
URL so we can use the image different
URLs for the profile the blog URL the
number of repositories the number of
followers all this stuff so we
definitely want this URL here ok we'll
paste that in except we obviously don't
want it to always go to mine so we're
gonna get rid of that and then
concatenate on this dot username which
is going to come from here ok and
that'll be dynamic alright now since
it's an observable we're gonna use that
map operator so say dot map and then in
here we want to pass in a response and
set that to res Jason ok we're returning
Jason content save that and then we need
to go on the other side on the component
and basically respond to that observer
or subscribe to that observer so to do
that lets go into the constructor and
we'll save this dot underscore github
service dot get user
okay now since it's a observer we're
gonna call dot subscribe okay we want to
get the users and we'll set that to a
code block and then let's do console dot
log users all right so why is that let's
see what do they do here oh you know
what it's cuz we didn't return it
put return there save it and then that
error should go away so let's go ahead
and go back to our application and
reload and now you can see down here
where console logging an object which
has all that data that I just showed you
all right so we can now use this in our
application so instead of just console
logging it what we're gonna do is set it
to a property so we're gonna add right
above the constructor property called
user and we're gonna set the type to any
and then down here we'll say comment
that out we'll say this dot user equals
this dot user equals this right here
should actually be user that makes more
sense
and it'll go like that so now since
we're setting the part the user property
to that response we can use that inside
of our template all right so if we were
to go into github component HTML and put
in an h1 and here double curly brace
user dot login is it login or maybe it's
oh you know what yeah you know what we
have to actually check for user first so
that it doesn't render before it's
actually responded to so we're gonna put
a div and we're going to say ng-if
equals user so a checking for user and
then we'll put the h1 in and there we go
alright so now it's getting us the user
login so now that we know that we can
get user information we're gonna start
to work on the user interface so we're
gonna use bootstrap I'm gonna go to my
index.html and we're just going to use
the CDN so let's grab that bootstrap CDN
comm and it'll grab this link right here
and let's go here and say link style
sheet paste that in save it and then
we're gonna go to our we're gonna go to
our app component HTML file and we want
to get a nav bar so let's go to get
bootstrap comm we'll go to examples or
is it getting started and then examples
and the starter template right here I'm
going to click on that do a control U
and let's grab this nav tag ok we'll
grab the container too and let's put
that in there okay change a couple
things here we're going to get rid of
the navbar fix top and let's change this
navbar in verse two now our default
project name change that to github
search okay we're not going to need this
any of these many links so we'll get rid
of those and let's see container will
get rid of this starter template div and
in here we're gonna put class with row
okay so we're using the grid system
bootstrap grid system so we're going to
put a class here and this will be the
column class so we want it to be eight
columns wide so call em d8
but I also want to offset it too so call
MD offset too and then in here we just
want our github component save that
let's take a look okay so it looks a
little weird because we still have our
style CSS that came with angular if you
click down here on that we're going to
just select everything and get rid of it
okay save that and now it looks much
better so let's go to now we'll go to
our github component on HTML file and I
want this to be a panel a bootstrap
panel so let's go back to get bootstrap
calm and we'll go up to components and
then panels and I'm gonna grab this
right here the panel with a heading okay
we'll go and paste that right in here
space it out a little
okay so in the panel title we're gonna
put the users name or login actually
wait no I'll do the name because the
name is the actual full name so we'll do
that and then in the body what we're
going to do is we're going to have two
columns one will be the avatar and then
one will have some information so let's
say div class equals row okay so in this
row we're going to have to call to divs
one is going to be four columns wide so
call him D four that'll be where the
avatar goes and then we'll have an eight
column alright so it's in four column
this is gonna be pretty easy we're just
gonna put an image tag and the source is
gonna be user dot avatar underscore URL
and let's see we're gonna give this a
class and give it a class of IMG
thumbnail and also github - avatar okay
so if I go ahead and save that and you
can see that we have the image alright
so that on this side the eight column
div we're gonna have some information
what I want to do is use labels that
will have the number of repositories
number of gists and so on so if we go to
get bootstrap and then labels I'm gonna
go ahead and just grab some of these
pesos in okay and this first one will be
repos so we can get that with user dot
public underscore repos and then we're
just going to put the text public repos
okay this one here will be gists well we
need our braces so user dot public
gist's this one will be followers and
this one will be following okay let's
take a look at that and there we go
so that looks pretty good now under that
under that last fan there we're gonna
have a let's do let's see should I put
you know what I'm gonna put it I'm gonna
wrap these in their own div so this will
be stats alright and then under that
will have a line break and then a UL and
I'm going to give this a class of list
group
which is a bootstrap class and then
let's do Li class list group item and
here let's put a strong tag we'll say
username and then here we can put in
user dot login ok let's copy that list
item okay so after user name let's do
location and we can get that with user
dot location and then we'll do email ok
we will do blog and let's do one more
into that this one's gonna be member
since and we can get that with user dot
created underscore app alright let's
save that reload and now we get all that
information so in addition to profile
info we want to get the repos ok now for
that we're going to create another
service function so let's go to our
service and let's go ahead and copy this
and then we'll change this to get repos
and then we just need to slightly change
the URL we're going to add on to the end
here concatenate slash repos ok now back
in the component we're going to grab
this paste that in change this to get
repos change this to repos
and then this okay and we have to have a
Drita's as a property up here like that
so now we have access to the actual
repos so back in the template the github
component dot HTML we're going to put in
another panel under this one which ends
right here I'll grab that okay so for
this one let's change the title to repos
and then down here again we're going to
have a row and then this is going to be
just one twelve column div so we'll say
div class call MD twelve alright now
what we need to do those repos that we
get it's an array so we need to loop
through those so we're going to use ng
four for that so div ng four set that to
repose actually no we want to set that
to let repo of repos so then for each
instance we should have access to that
repo variable alright so we're gonna put
in actually no we're going to do is
we're going to have two columns in here
so let's create another row
okay so this one's going to be a nine
column div and then next to it will be a
three column div all right so in the
nine column div we're gonna have an h4
and that'll have the repo name alright
let's just test that out so far okay so
you can see it's getting all the names
now we want that to be wrapped in a link
so we can actually link to the page so
inside the h4 we'll put an a tag and
let's make this open in another window
okay and then we can get that link by
saying repo dot HTML underscore URL all
right so if we test that out click on
one of these it opens a new tab and
brings us to that repo alright so I will
also want to have the description
underneath so underneath that h4 will
put a paragraph and we'll say repo dot
description okay so now in this three
column I want to have the number of
Watchers and the number of Forks and
we're going to put those inside labels
okay so I'm just going to copy two of
these labels up here paste those in okay
so we're going to change this to repo
dot Watchers
and then this one here repo dot forks
okay save that and there we go now I'll
make this look a little better with CSS
but yeah that's good for now let's put
an HR we'll put a horizontal rule
underneath each one so that's gonna go
under the row so right here alright so
that looks pretty good so as far as our
profile and repos that's pretty much
done so the next stage is to have a
search box where we can actually change
the user alright so let's go ahead and
do that
we're gonna go all the way to the top
and that's what we're going to put our
input so we're gonna put a row here and
let's make this just a 12 column div
that goes all the way across okay so
we're going to put in a form
and that's going to have div with the
class of form group you can see most of
this code I'm typing is just bootstrap
park up
all right so input which is gonna have a
type of text okay I'm gonna give it a
class of form control give it a
placeholder and for the placeholder will
just say github username and then we're
going to use what's called ng model okay
and that's used for data binding so
that's gonna go in a set of brackets and
parentheses since it's two-way and say
ng model and then we'll set that to a
property called user name alright now we
want that we want a function to run when
we press the Enter key alright so what
we're gonna do here is set up pair of
parentheses that's how you can define an
event or an event handler so it's going
to be key up dot enter and we'll set
that equal to a function called search
all right so now we'll save that and
let's go back to the component now if we
look down here we're getting an input
error the reason for that is with our c6
we have actually have to define the
forms module so we're going to go into
app Dajjal dot TS and let's go up here
and say import forms module
and that's gonna be from angular slash
forms and then we just need to include
that here so now if I save that okay
that should clear up that error and now
we're just getting one because we need
to set a name attribute that's equal to
the same value as ng-model so let's go
back to our component HTML and we set an
NG model to username so we're also going
to set name equal to username all right
there we go
now if I type something and press Enter
we're going to get an error because we
haven't created that search function yet
so let's go back to our component TS
file and let's go right here and say
search actually no not right here we
need to go outside of the constructor
okay now remember we had an NG model
equal to username so we need to add that
as a property so that's gonna be a
string and then if I go down here and
say console dot log this start username
when we submitted it should console.log
whatever we put in here okay so if I
click enter you'll see that it catches
it now if you want we can also set this
instead of just enter we can set it to
just key up and that'll just constantly
search as you type so as I type you can
see down here it's just it's just
running that search function so we'll
keep it like that just to make it kind
of more dynamic I guess all right now
what we want to do is in our component
we're going to move this stuff
I cut that out and we're gonna paste
that in here in the search okay so that
way when we enter the application there
shouldn't be anything there besides the
search all right now once I start typing
it's searching but it's still getting
just Brad so what we need to do is
create another service function to
update the user name all right so let's
uh let's go back to our search I'm sorry
our service and we'll say update
username okay that'll get passed in a
username and we'll set that to string
and then in here all we need to do is
say this dot username is equal to
username save that and then back in the
component we're gonna go at the top of
the search function and we'll say this
dot underscore github service dot update
username and then we'll pass in this dot
username
okay so now save and then as I start to
type you'll see that it changes as we go
along okay when I get to my name that's
what pops up alright so that's it it's
very dynamic even as I delete you'll see
that it changes alright so hopefully you
enjoyed this and you can see that
there's not there's not too much
difference between our c4 and our c6
you do have the angular I'm sorry the
app dot module TS file and ng module and
the routing is also a little different I
might do another video getting into that
so I would suggest checking out the
twelve project angular 2 course right
now the projects are NRC four but they
will be updated
accordingly and that's it all right so
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
