we're going to be taking a look at
electron J s now this is something that
I'm not an expert in and I do need to do
some more research before I can make a
series or a full-blown application but
that will be sometime in the future but
at least wanted to give you guys an
introduction to what electron is and get
a simple application up and running
we're going to build an application that
displays system info so things like the
processor type the total and the free
memory available version info on
different applications and stuff like
that the computer name stuff that you
know you normally can't access with just
a regular web application so before I
get into that I just want to talk a
little bit about what electron is so
electron is an open source library that
was created by github back in 2013 and
it's used to build cross-platform
desktop applications and you do this
with only HTML CSS and JavaScript which
is just awesome and it does this by
combining the chromium browser and
nodejs
into a single runtime okay so if you
don't know what chromium is it's an open
source web browser that Google Chrome
draws its source code from so it's very
similar to Chrome but there are some
differences in features and the
licensing is different alright so apps
can be packaged for Windows Mac and
Linux I'll be using Windows in this
video but the code is the exact same no
matter what platform you're using okay
so before we talk about how electron
works let's just take a look at some of
the applications that are built on
electron so the two most notable here
for me our atom and visual studio code
these are two applications that I use
all the time these are text editors and
I'm sure that a lot of you are familiar
with them but it also is used on the
wordpress.com contessa top application
brave browser which is a web browser
that blocks ads and and stuff like that
there is also postman which is an honest
list but that's enough
when I use all the time that is to test
API you can make make HTTP requests from
stuff like that
slack ism is a messaging app and these
are just some of them if you go to this
URL right here electron atom dot IO /
app you'll see a full list of some of
the really popular applications that are
built on electron okay so I'm going to
try to explain as best as I can
how electron works behind the scenes
alright so there's a main process and
there's a renderer process the main
process runs the package Jason's main
script which is usually called name J s
but you could call it anything it can
display a GUI a GUI our graphical user
interface by creating web pages and then
every web page runs its own renderer
process okay the main process creates
instances of something called browser
window and this browser window runs the
web page in its own renderer process
okay when the browser window is closed
or destroyed so is that renderer process
and the main process manages all the
webpage and their individual renderer
processes okay so this diagram here just
shows you that there's a main process
and then it branches off to individual
renderer processes okay so hopefully
that makes a little bit of sense and
when you see the code that might shine
some light on this as well
alright so installing electron is really
easy obviously you do have to have no
js' installed to make sure you have that
and then we just need to first install
electron globally so that we can access
it from anywhere we can run the electron
command and then also in our local
application ok we'll create the
package.json file the main J's file and
then index.html and then we can run our
app with electron . alright guys so
that's enough with the slides now we're
going to jump in and we're going to take
a look at some code and create our
starter application alright guys so
we're going to get started on our system
info application now most of the code
that we'll be looking at and writing is
going to come from this electron quick
so if you want you can just clone this
but I'm not going to do that I'm going
to go through and create the files and
create the code I just wanted to let you
guys know that this is available and I
didn't want to try to pass it off as my
own like I said I'm pretty new to
electron I'm kind of teaching it as I go
along as I learn so we're going to get
this set up and then we're going to add
some extra functionality to it or extra
content in our application so what I'll
do here is just open up my term my
command line so I'm using git bash for
Windows if you want if you want to use
this on Windows you can go to get - FCM
comm and you can go ahead and download
that if not you can use your standard
commit command line or PowerShell or
whatever you use and like I said this is
completely cross-platform so if you're
on a Mac or Linux this is the exact same
then you can follow along alright so I'm
going to make a directory here and I'm
going to call it this info app okay then
we'll CD into this info app and from
here we're going to create a
package.json file so we're going to do
NPM in it and obviously you do have to
have no js' installed all right so let's
just enter through these description
with a simple system monitor and the
entry point is going to be main j/s
that's the common convention for
electron and author feel free to put
your own name there and we should be all
set so let's go ahead and open up our
project folder and i'm using atom which
was actually created on electron it's
really nice editor i suggest checking it
out if you haven't all right so there's
our package JSON file now we want to do
is install electron and we want to
install it globally annual so to install
globally we're going to npm install - g
for global electron and that will
install it so that we can access it from
anywhere
all right so next we want to install it
locally make sure you're in the
application folder and NPM install
electron - - save so that we can save it
as a dependency okay and now you can see
I'm using version 1.6 - which is the
latest at this time yours may be later
depending on where when you're watching
us alright so the last thing I want to
do in this file is create a start script
we don't need this test so we'll replace
it with start and to start the
application we just want to do electron
dot but we're going to be able to use
NPM start after creating this okay so
let's save that we can close that up now
we're going to create our main JX file
which is the main entry point main
process and we're also going to create
index dot HTML okay so let's open up
main j/s and we want to bring in a
couple things from electron so we've
it's an object so we want to bring in
app and also browser window okay so
we're going to say equals require and
that's going to be from electron all
right we're also going to bring in a
path module which is a node.js core
module so we can just say require path
ok we'll also bring in the URL module
and we're bringing these in because we
need them to load the index.html file ok
so now that we did that let's create a
global variable called win so this is a
global reference to the window object if
we don't create this the window will be
closed automatically when JavaScript
when the JavaScript object is
garbage-collected
so we want to just initialize it there
and then we're going to create a
function called create window which is
going to do just that and create the
browser window let's take that win
object and our variable and set it equal
to new browser window and here we can
put some options
so we'll say width is going to be 800
and height will be 600 okay now I want
to use a custom icon so to do that we
can include in here icon and then our
path so I'm going to create a folder in
here called ing and I have a little gear
icon that I'm going to use so I'm just
going to bring this over and go into our
application and image and paste that in
and you guys can get this in the code in
the description okay now I I heard that
with Mac it's a little different you
have to use the packager and then
include an icon flag but I'm not sure
about that but here I'm just going to do
their name and then we will concatenate
that slash image slash fist info dot pen
okay so that creates the object now what
we want to do is we want to load the
index.html page so we can do that with
Wynn dot load URL and in here we're
going to use the URL module and call
format and that takes in an object and
we can specify the path name and we'll
use the path module and call join we
want the current directory that this
file is in and then index.html and C is
that correct
it looks good this shouldn't be a
semicolon now I'm going to put a comma
here and then we can specify the
protocol and we're going to use file
because we're using the file system you
could also use HTTP and then we have
this slashes true and then that will
load this index.html file okay now we
also have the option to
open up dev tools which is just the same
thing as chrome dev tools and obviously
you only want this when you're in
development so we can do wind dot web
contents dot open dev tools and I will
open it automatically let me just put
comment up here and then here say create
browser the window
all right so down here we want to
basically hook into when the windows
closed and we want to set this value
back to we want to set it to null so to
do that we're going to say when dot on
and the event we want is closed and then
we're going to run a function I'm going
to use an arrow function and then we're
going to set when equals to null all
right so that's the create window
function so now we want to load it by
doing app dot on I'm going to say when
it's ready when the app is ready then
we're going to run create window okay
and then see down here we got to do a
couple extra things let's say quit when
all windows are closed and we're going
to do app dot on there's an event called
window all closed window - all - closed
and we're going to run a function and
what we want to do is check to see if
the users on a Mac because on a Mac it's
common for applications and their menu
to stay active until the user quits
explicitly using command Q so to test to
see if they're on a Mac we can say if
process dot platform are actually going
to test to see if they're not on a Mac
so does that not equal to Darwin okay if
you're on if you're on OSX this is going
to be Darwin if you're on Windows it'll
be win 3-2
I believe all right so all we want to do
here is just app dot quick all right and
that should be it for our main J's file
so let's save that
and all this really does is create a new
browser window a new process we're
setting the width height and the icon
and then we're loading that we're
loading index.html into it so let's go
to index.html and add some HTML tags
we'll say sis info app for the title and
I'm going to use bootstrap you can use
any front-end framework or library that
you'd like I'm just going to grab from
boots watch which is just basically
customized bootstrap click download and
going to grab that
okay so paste that in there and then in
the body for now I'm just going to put
an h1 we'll say my app ok now we have to
create a file called renderer so render
ojs now we're going to leave it blank
but as you can see it says this file is
required by index.html and will be
executed in the renderer process for
that window all the nodejs api's will be
available on this process okay so we're
not getting too deep into this so we're
not gonna put anything in there but we
will require it so we can put script
tags here and then we can just say
require and we want to require renderer
dot jf so let's save that and let's just
create that file I'm just not going to
put anything in it for how I may
continue this later on once I do a
little bit more research so we should
now be able to run our application let's
go to our command line and I'm going to
run NPM start ok I'll see I just got an
error we bring it down a javascript
error uncaught window web content is not
a function
all right hold on let's go back to main
je s call I put parentheses here that
shouldn't be there all right let's try
it again okay let me just bring that
down and there's our application it's an
actual desktop application you can see
our icon right here we have a menu file
with exit later on when we build a real
application will work with this menu but
by default you can see what we have here
okay cut copy paste things like that you
can reload the application force reload
we can toggle the developer tools okay
zoom in we can minimize clothes and then
we have some help on documentation stuff
like that all right so this is an actual
desktop application if we look at our
task manager and you can see an electron
we have this info app with our custom
icon all right so this is pretty damn
cool for that little amount of code that
we just did we can run we can create a
desktop application all right and guys I
know that this this tutorial is probably
going to leave you thirsty for more so
once I get into it and learn a little
bit more I'll be able to teach it and
I'll be able to to create a cool
application all right but let's go ahead
and finish this we're going to go to
index.html and let's create a div here
go to classes container and inside here
we're going to put an h1 this just has
six info app okay and then we're going
to put a div here with an ID of output
because we're going to generate our HTML
through JavaScript okay so down here
let's go let's go above this script tag
and creat another one
and then from here we should be able to
access the process data so let's say
console dot log and we want to log
process ok we'll save it and then let's
go back to our desktop app and reload
and go to the console and you'll see
this process ok so this object as this
has a lot in it has all different
functions and different properties that
we can access all right um let's see so
get system memory info that's this
function we can run that will give us an
object with all the memory on a machine
and a used memory and also the swap use
swap memory and something else I can't
remember we'll check it out what else we
also have this versions this versions
object which will give us the version of
node electron Chrome and a bunch of
other stuff and what else uptime and
then we have this env object here which
has a whole bunch of stuff so has a
process identifier intel 64 family 6
gives you the model gives you all the
path data your public folders your
computer name all kinds of stuff so what
we're going to do is just output some of
this on to the screen so let's go to
let's go down here and we're going to
create a variable called output and set
that equal to and then we're going to
use these back ticks because we're going
to use a template string here so we
don't have to do all kinds of
concatenation and stuff and then let's
put H to give us a class of page header
and this is going to be the app version
data and we're for the UL
and we use a class of Lists group which
is a bootstrap class and then some
allies say list group item and let's see
we're going to put the inversion of node
on this machine okay now we can use
variables in a template string with the
money sign and then curly braces and
we're going to access that process and
then versions dots node alright so let's
see if that works we'll save it and go
back to our app and then let's do view
reload oh wait we didn't output it yet
so we got to do document dot get element
by ID and we want output and we're going
to set that dot inner HTML equal to
output all right let's try that and
there we go this is the version of node
that's installed okay we can also get
the version of Chrome and electron which
I'm going to output so I'm going to copy
this Li and change this to Chrome and
change this to Chrome okay then we'll do
electron
change that okay save it and let's go
over here and reload and there we go we
have two versions of node Chrome and
electron so the next part we're going to
do is system specs now I'm not going to
just type all this in because it will
take too long so I'm just going to paste
it and you can see if we go over here
we're looking at process arc and it
tells you right here
I'm 64 bit and then we're also accessing
the ends and then process identifier
okay and then we can even look at the
printer and n printable will give you
the main system printer so let's take a
look at that and there we go processor
identifier and tells you I have an HP
Deskjet 1050 J 410 series and that's
correct alright so we can access even
system peripherals okay next we're going
to display some memory info so let me
paste that in now for the memory it
there is a function called get system
memory info which returns an object and
we're getting the total memory the free
memory the swap total and the swap free
so let's save that I'm just going to
close that up and down here you can see
my total system memory what's free and
so on alright so that's pretty cool and
then the last thing we're going to get
is the computer info so the name the
username things like that and that's all
available in that env object so let's
save that reload and there we go
computer name the username path system
drive and system route so now we have an
actual desktop application that gives us
information on machine all right I know
it's not that much guys but I you know I
just wanted to kind of do an intro video
here just to show you what what electron
is and a little bit of how it works
all right so I promise I'm going to do
some more research
we're going to build something really
cool all right so thanks for watching
guys if you're not subscribed please do
so and that's it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
