know that I'm creating my own udemy
courses now I released an angular 4
course a little over a month ago and I
just released my next course which is a
front-end course and it's called
bootstrap 4 from scratch with five
projects so this is actually a ten and a
half hour long course that'll teach you
just about everything to do with
bootstrap for now you don't need to have
any experience at all with bootstrap 3
in this video I want to take you through
and show you exactly what you'll learn
and what you'll build in this course it
hasn't been released yet but by the time
this video is uploaded it should be
available and a link should be in the
description now it's set at 50 dollars
but I'm giving you a code a link with a
code to get it for just 15 bucks so just
use the code youtube' and you should get
the $50 course for $15 now teaching
something like bootstrap can be a little
tedious because there's just so much
HTML involved and a lot of people they
don't like copy and paste they also
don't want to watch me type every single
HTML tag so what I've done for the first
few sections of this course which are
the learning sections is I've created a
bootstrap sandbox UI page for every
lecture and every page has a start state
and then as we move through the lectures
you'll code along with me and we'll
basically bootstrap it up alright so
here's an example of the UI and we have
all the four different sections here we
have utilities with things like you know
basic typography floats and positioning
we have colors the color classes spacing
so we'll talk about the margin and
padding classes things like that all the
utilities sizing then we have our CSS
component so we'll look at buttons for
instance the start state of this page
will be just all plain looking ugly HTML
buttons and then we'll go through and
I'll show you all the different classes
to add and all the different markup to
make it look better to bootstrap it up
ok we have a page for the nav bars we
have forms ok all the different
validation classes then we'll move on to
grid system save the grid system we have
flex box bootstrap for now uses flex
blocks we'll go over the alignments all
that stuff javascript widgets I'll show
you how to create carousels and collapse
widgets
so this is this is the UI that we're
going to use for section two through
five okay once we do that we're going to
move on to section six where we're going
to build something called the bootstrap
for starter pack and basically what this
is is it's a it's going to be a workflow
for the next five projects so we're
going to make it so that we can build
bootstrap from source we can compile our
sass and we can even run a dev server
and we're going to do this by using gulp
we're also going to use the gulp sass
plug-in and then all we'll have to do
when we want to start a new project is
npm install to install the dependencies
and then run NPM start and that will
compile everything and run the dev
server okay it'll also have auto load
and that's how we're going to develop
our themes now for the projects the
first one we're going to develop as a
theme called loop lab which is basically
like like a social type theme that uses
Prydz and flex blocks classes it's very
simple but I think it's pretty
nice-looking and elegant so each nav up
here if we click it will go down to that
section we have explore create share so
down here we have a simple contact modal
that opens up so very simple but very
elegant and all of these are completely
responsive all right so if I make this
smaller you see this is completely
responsive alright all the projects our
next one is a theme called Mizuki which
is kind of like a book or a product
showcase theme so you have the big image
here we have a navbar here now in this
case it's a one-page theme just like the
last one but we implemented a jQuery
scroll plug-in so that we can smoothly
scroll to whatever section of the theme
we're also using some collapse widgets
here we have this meet the author
section contact form I created a simple
custom logo so that's the next project
then we're going to move on to our blog
system our blog admin UI called blogging
and there's actually a bunch of
different pages this is the dashboard we
also have a login page we have a post
details page with the save and delete
buttons the form image upload we have up
here these three buttons which are going
to open up modal's we even implemented a
with
you wake editor in the add post modal
and we have posts categories users we
have a settings page and we get settings
and profile so there's about nine or ten
pages total here so it's quite a big
project the next one we're going to
build is a multi-page theme called
glossing which has a nice carousel on
the home page we have some background
images with some fixed scrolling we have
a video that will open an autoplay we
have a photo gallery which uses a plugin
called echo lightbox so if I click on
this you'll see it'll open the picture
up in a lightbox little newsletter at
the bottom then we have our about page
okay pretty simple we're using a
third-party script called slick slider
that will go through the testimonials
here we have a services page again using
the collapse widgets a blog page which
uses the new bootstrap cards and then a
contact page alright and then the last
project is a portfolio theme and this
actually uses the collapse widget for
the different pages this is the home
page we have some progress bars with his
skills and if we go to resume you'll see
it'll just slide up so we have some some
companies that he worked at the work
page has an image gallery again using a
lightbox and we have the contact page
okay and then just a download resume
button at the bottom and this uses a
grid at the top here this is one column
this is one column and then we're using
flexbox so we're using a flex column
going this way and then a flexeril for
each of these icon areas here each of
these navigation items alright so
hopefully you guys that are interested
in learning bootstrap 4 will look into
this I think you'll really like it
there's a ton of content ten and a half
hours I didn't even expect that much
content but you look down here you can
see the different sections and you can
see the the five different projects here
so each one is about an hour so the
gloves and multi themed page is almost
two hours so you have a lot of stuff to
work with I'm actually going to be on
vacation for the next three or four days
so this hex this will give you guys
something to do while I'm gone until I
can get back and start making more
videos
so hopefully guys look into it thanks
for watching and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
