released a video it was a 300,000
subscribers special where I kind of went
over my backstory which you know I had a
lot of negative stuff in my past and I
almost didn't put that video out for
fear of judgment but the response was
just overwhelmingly positive and just an
endless stream of encouraging comments
and praise and and things that I feel
I'm not even worthy of so I really thank
you guys for that
now one comment I kept seeing coming up
was to show you guys my setup in my
studio because obviously you can see
this stuff in the background and that's
what I want to do and I want to do it
now because I'm actually moving within a
week or two we're gonna start to move
out within a week or two so I'm not
gonna be here much longer and I wanted
to do one final tour before we before we
move out and when we get the new place
I'll do another one as well I did do a
tour about a year ago but a lot has
changed since then so I wanted to kind
of update you guys on on what I'm using
and stuff like that and there's a couple
reasons I do these videos one is because
I just I love setups I love tech just
like I love programming I love just
hardware and technology gadgets you know
pcs I'm a PC builder so I love putting
that stuff out and I love watching it as
well another reason is because I know a
lot of you guys you know watch my videos
every day so you might be curious about
where I make those videos and the
hardware I use stuff like that the
microphone the you know the computers
the monitors things like that so don't
take the video as you know haha look
what I have I don't want to come off
that way that's definitely not who I am
I'm very humble I didn't grow up with
money so I know what it's like to to not
have anything and I know that if you
just have you know a little cheap laptop
and you're watching this you might be
like you know fuck this guy but don't do
that just just
know that you can get there because I
was in that same place I I had you know
a junky old laptop to start with as well
and I just I just kept pushing and
following my passion and I got to where
I want to be you know and I'm still
growing so don't take it as that please
I that's that's my worst fear about
making these types of videos alright so
let's go ahead and get into it I'm not
gonna go through every single thing I
don't want this to be too long hopefully
it's not but hopefully you guys enjoy it
and let's let's take a look alright guys
so we're just gonna kind of start at the
beginning of the basement here the
studio and just go around so this is
this is where the stairs are gonna come
down and we have this traversing media
picture here or poster with just some
some totes with with wires and just LED
strips adapters things like that things
for the setup also some some PC building
stuff like fans and you know fan
controllers things like that nothing too
interesting and over here we have my
YouTube 100,000 subscriber play button
which I actually just got because I
didn't realize you had to fill out a
form and apply for it I thought they
just sent it to you so I just recently
got that and I consider that a big
accomplishment hopefully someday we can
get the million subscriber one and
replace that Fenway Park picture there
with it even though it won't be in this
house because they were moving let me
just have just a basic tripod I was just
using that to record the intro some
wooden knickknacks here these are my
dad's he passed away about two years ago
so I have some of his stuff just laying
around he used to collect that type of
stuff I've just got some cubes here with
some business documents and you know
pens and staplers and stuff like that so
over here you can see I have acoustic
foam all over the place to kind of drown
out the echo although I'm not sure how
much it actually helps but I do like how
it looks over here we have some shelves
with some of the boxes of the hardware
that's in my main computer my main rig
and I'll go over that in a second when
we take a look at it
a little security camera there as well
all right so down here we have the Epson
workstation or Workforce wireless
printer we have the Xfinity router the
CyberPower UPS I would highly recommend
using a UPS I have my router plugged
into it as well as my main machine and
one monitor I believe so that way if the
power goes out I still have internet I
still have my machine and it'll stay on
for about an hour and then down there
you can see that white box is my
Synology nas it's a it's a two tube a
disc station it has 2 4 terabyte drives
in it hooked up in RAID one and that's
where I put all my YouTube videos all my
course videos everything I record is on
that that nas right there which I'm
gonna have to upgrade soon to probably a
4 Bay and then next to it you probably
can't see but that's a Western Digital
external drive and that has like family
photos and videos and stuff like that
alright so over here we have just some
crates with random stuff in it some
gadgets some PC building stuff LED
strips adapters things like that I'm not
gonna go through it all but just little
stuff like that alright so now on to the
main setup so I'm just going to kind of
back up a little here so you can see it
this is my main workstation I'll start
with the desk which is an uplift desk
it's a mechanical stand sit desk so you
know if I get tired of sitting and I
want to stretch my legs I can just go
ahead and put it up and stand up and
work which I love uplift they're kind of
expensive there's other companies that
aren't as expensive that have the same
type of desks and I like the black top
but you can get a you know a dark wood
top or a light wood there's all types of
stuff to choose from
alright so the monitors that I'm using
are 27 inch 4k LG monitors
I'll have the model in the description
with a link I'll try to put links
to most of the stuff in the description
but if you watch my setup tour last year
you saw that I had six monitors okay I
actually had six monitors which now I
can admit was overkill I didn't really
need that they decided to trade the six
1080p monitors for three 4k monitors
which is actually twice as expensive and
I just love these monitors I don't know
if you can tell through the the quality
of the iPhone recording but the the
quality of the image on these monitors
is just amazing but I don't know if you
can tell that and I just I love these
monitors and they're on a quad VEVO quad
stand which I could add another one on
top if I wanted to it does hold for that
there's an extension to the stand but I
think three is fine should be fine it's
more than enough actually and then let's
take a look at some of the peripherals
I'm just gonna sit down here for a sec
so from my microphone I mean move remove
this pop filter here should put this way
so I'm using the Audio Technica 2020
microphone it's a USB mic it's it's
awesome I love it it's very clear I used
to use the blue Yeti which I still have
over there and I'll show you that too
but I would highly recommend this mic
it's it's under $200 so it's not like a
really expensive one and it sounds good
and you know people seem to to like the
quality of my videos so I would I would
recommend this mic alright so for
headphones I'm using the Corsair Corsair
void
these aren't the wireless there are
wireless ones but these are the wired
version and you can see they they're
hooked up with RGB as well as all my
peripherals all my peripherals are our
Corsair they're all RGB you can control
the lighting with the software you can
link them all together to so that they
all do the same effect in the same
colors and you'll see that the
headphones are on the Corsair st 100 my
headphone stand
and set the little RGB at the bottom as
well so those are my headphones I would
see back there we have a sony handycam
and i got that to kind of do I was
planning on doing like unboxings and
stuff but the quality of that camera
isn't great I should have got the 4k one
and I just I also just haven't gotten
around to doing those types of videos
alright so let's see for my keyboard I'm
using a corsair k70 RGB mechanical
keyboard and this keyboard has Cherry MX
red switches and you can see it's very
very loud
I love mechanical keyboards but
unfortunately they're they're too loud
for doing videos with so what I usually
do when I do a video is I'll use the
Apple magic keyboard that I have over
there
so I'll kind of just push this back and
use the Bluetooth magic keyboard
alright so for audio it's nothing
special it's these are cyber acoustic
speakers and then we have the subwoofer
down there and it has a nice little
controller where you can control the
volume you can plug your headphones in
stuff like that the keyboard also has
volume control as you can see for my
mouse I'm using the Corsair harpoon
which isn't one of the really expensive
ones it's very simple it's not like a
you know hardcore gaming mouse or
anything like that I don't need that
this is fine and then it's on a Corsair
RGB mouse pad I don't I don't know the
model of this but I'll put it in the
description which I think looks cool and
of course we can link it up to
everything else and then I also have a
stream deck and I'll got i'll stream
deck and although i don't live stream
yet i plan to at one point and also even
if you don't live stream and use like
the twitch functionality you can assign
like programs and websites stuff like
that you can see I have vs code on there
chrome get Photoshop websites like you
to be in YouTube my own website I also
have my record and stop buttons for my
video software
calendar stuff like that they just think
it looks really cool alright so back
there we have the electric LED clock and
this you can actually install apps on I
have the YouTube app installed with
which shows my subscriber number and
it's in real time so just if someone
subscribes there unsubscribes it'll go
ahead and change you can also do you
know of course a clock weather radio is
there's a nice pretty nice speaker and
it other stuff as well but there's other
apps you can install like for instance
if you wanted your bank account balance
to show or something like that you could
do all types of stuff with it it's
pretty expensive it's around 200 bucks
but there's there's a lot that it can do
alright and we also have LED strips on
the back of the monitors so you can kind
of see the the colors there that kind of
match the rest of the the setup here
alright so I think that's it for the top
of the desk have some coasters but yeah
that's it for the top I like to keep it
nice and clean down here let's take a
look at the PC so this PC I built about
three months ago so it's fairly new and
it has an eye in an intel i 9 processor
in it it's on an asus rog Strix
motherboard it has two gtx ten 70s EVGA
for the win graphics cards hooked up in
sli as you can see we have 32 gigs of
g.skill trident RGB ram we have an eight
hundred and sixty watt EVGA power supply
to 500 gigabyte SSDs samsung SSDs a
corsair each 100 i water cooler three
RGB corsair fans and everything in here
all the lights are I can control through
software as well so if I wanted it to be
all red or all blue or something like
that I could do that but I kind of like
having all the different colors as well
as my peripherals so you can see my
peripherals match the the computer
pretty much
exact and then the case is a fan texts
evolve I'm sure if you if you guys know
anything about PC building you guys know
this case it's very popular I actually
did a poll on Twitter
yeah Twitter and Instagram between this
and the Corsair 780 T and this this one
big time you guys like to this one even
though it's smaller it's just much more
sleek it has tempered glass it's all
steel the front is very plain but that's
fine because I think it looks just kind
of slick and and you know minimalist on
the front but the side you can see is
just beautiful so yeah that's my pc and
yeah it's so really all I can say about
that so let's go ahead and let's take a
look at the chair I'm using so this is a
dxracer I don't know the model number
I'll put it in the description it's
really comfortable I love these these
types of chairs I love how they look
they're kind of expensive this one was
about three hundred and fifty dollars
but it has the you know the lumbar
support the the headrest so it's it's
really comfortable
and I want to show you something this
chair here let me just put these two
together you can see it's pretty much
identical even the bottom the feet but
it's not a dxracer it's a GTR racing
chair so this chair is actually 250
dollars cheaper than the dxracer even
though they look just about the exact
same but I will say the dxracer is much
more comfortable so you do get that but
it's just funny that you know two things
they look the same but one has a better
brand name so it's it's a lot more but
again it is the dxracer is more
comfortable but this is for the second
workstation which i'll show you in a
minute which i don't sit at that much so
the comfort isn't that important to me
alright so let's take a look at the
uplift desk in motion so if I'm tired of
sitting I'll just go over here to the
panel
and I have different presets - is my
standing preset so you'll see let's just
start going off let me move back you see
it just Rises - to a level that that I'm
comfortable at standing and then for a
cable management you can see everything
is sleeved I have everything going you
know I don't know if you can see it but
it's going behind that pole there's no
wires hanging down here from the monitor
it's all going show you this it's all
going like through the poles and stuff
and you can see the LEDs here but yeah
so that's the standing standing
orientation I'm just gonna put it back
down but yeah I would highly recommend a
stand sit desk it doesn't have to be up
lift there's other ones as well but
they're great alright so that's it for
my main area and that's where I do most
of my work so let's move on to the
second workstation so I'm just gonna sit
down here and we have a MacBook Pro 13
inch this is the newest one the 2017 I
kind of wish I got the 15 inch because
the screen is just really small you know
when you're used to using that this is
just very small and I use this when I
work remotely if I'm at a hotel or if I
want to work like outside or at a
Starbucks or something like that if I
want to be a hipster I have my Mac a lot
of you guys think that I don't like
Mac's but I actually do I just really
like you know building pcs I love the
whole PC culture even though Windows
isn't you know - a lot of people windows
isn't the best for development
programming but you know it does the
trick it's fine for me but I do use the
Mac and I also love Linux I use Linux as
well but I use Windows a lot in my
videos because of beginners and stuff
like that but I have this hooked up to a
27 inch curved Samsung monitor it's not
a 4k it's just 1080p but if I want to
use this down here I'll just use the
bigger screen because you know
it's just 13 inches is too small but it
is it is a great laptop it's very fast
it has an i7 it has the 500 gig SSD I
did get I do have an iMac as well and
they went the cheap route and got the
i-5 with the non SSD and it's just
horribly horribly slow and just unusable
really but down here you can see I have
another PC that I built probably about
five years ago and it has it uses the
corsair 600 t case as two gtx 770 70s
it's an i7 processor ASUS Maximus
motherboard there's 16 gigs of ram I
believe and in the keyboard is a Razer
chroma so you can see that has the RGB
as well but I have it just set to blue
this is kind of the blue station there's
blue LEDs behind the monitor we have a
Google home right there as well now if I
want to use the PC I can just simply
change the input so that should just put
the yeah so there's the PC right there
alright so it's very easy to switch from
the Mac to the PC with this monitor okay
and then here we have the blue Yeti
microphone again it is a really good
microphone especially for people just
starting out on YouTube very cheap I
think you can get it for under a hundred
bucks now I got it when it was like
$1.99 but I do like the audio technica
much better but this is still a good mic
alright and I'm just using the the
standard Apple Mouse and I get the
smaller magic keyboard here as well if I
want to use that with the with the
MacBook all right so that's that you
guys see that picture poster eat sleep
code repeat used to be a Call of Duty
poster there but I don't really game
anymore at another time so I do a little
bit in the morning on consoles but
that's about it alright so the third
station here is the red station it's all
red LEDs you can
see the the the lights back there these
two monitors are 227 inch 1080p s these
are two of the six that I used to use
and I don't know if you can tell the
difference with this iPhone recording
but the color is just so much better or
the picture just so much better on the
floor case above that I have this
picture that I just got I had some
shelves there before but I replace those
and I think the picture looks kind of
cool or maybe it's kind of gay I don't
know and then down here for peripherals
we have a Corsair strafe this is also of
Cherry MX red switches and this is not
RGB it's just red you can't change the
color I didn't know that when I bought
it shouldn't read the box but it was
fine because my whole setup was red at
that time and then we have the
SteelSeries rival Mouse the dragon
fights mouse pad which is just a huge
mouse pad I really like that I'm an
older dell inspiron laptop I got that
years and years ago it's very slow and I
think it has a pentium in it and then
for the chair this is this is like a
no-name brand chair but I think it looks
really cool
I bought this before I could actually
afford like a dxracer I think this was
like $80 or something on Amazon but I
think one looks pretty nice matches the
rest of this area a little pop figure as
well and then for the the PC this is
what I use before my new one this is a
Corsair 760 T case and it used it has an
Intel i7 7600 K 2 GTX 970 s 32 gigs of
g.skill ram of course they are 860 watt
power supply one SSD with two regular
hard drives so this is a pretty beefy
machine as well and yeah I really like
this machine has a place door you can
just open up and kind of go in and take
a look here so it's all red
and this is really the machine that my
family uses the most my daughter and
stuff she'll she'll do our homework on
this so over here we have the server on
this is kind of my home server slash
experimental web server
I have Plex on here to stream media I
also have Apache and some other stuff
installed and it has it has about six
hard drives in there I think it's like
eight terabytes of storage and that's
running Linux Ubuntu as well so it's
headless I just log in through SSH and
of course I just stream to other TVs in
my house or plex and stuff like that
alright so that's it for the computers
that I use over here we have the gaming
console gaming area so this TV I just
picked up it's a 43 inch 4k samsung TV
I'll come down here in the morning and
play a little Call of Duty but that's
that's about it that's as far as my
gaming these days but you can see have a
ps4 Xbox one s Xbox 360
I got a Wii down there and are an RCA
stereo receiver the subwoofer there you
can see the speakers behind the TV and
then just a bunch of controllers as well
so little gaming setup console setup
alright so over here we have stuff that
I'm not really using and by the way I'm
gonna be doing a giveaway especially
because I'm moving there's a lot of
stuff that I don't use that I think
people could put to use as such as my
old monitors you can see them there
such as the Corsair case that I bought
that I didn't use stuff like that I plan
on giving away I'm at a place where I'm
very grateful so I'm not even gonna
bother selling it I'm gonna do a
giveaway on Twitter and Instagram so if
you're interested go ahead and follow me
on those those platforms and please
don't email me and ask for stuff I'm not
gonna respond to any of those types of
emails
if you're interested just go ahead and
follow me on Twitter and Instagram so
this is the six monitor stand that I
used to use maybe I'll put that in a
giveaway I don't know how many people
actually want to use or could use six
monitors but I know I might I might
think about it and then we get some one
of those 24 or I think they're 22 inch
HP monitors and then just some gaming
stuff some PC building screws and stuff
like that this fireplace we don't use
because we tried to use it once and it
smoked up the whole house
and I think it needs to be cleaned but
yeah that what has been sitting there
for five years
and then up here you can see I have a
little collection of pop figures not
crazy about them but I don't know if my
wife goes to Target I'll have her pick
up a couple just something to collect I
guess and then you can see a picture of
my family this was a long time ago my
kids are a lot older now my daughter's
11 and my son's 8 same thing over here
we get an older picture of them when
they were babies and over here we have
just some kids toys for my son nothing
you guys are really interested in get a
nice pretty nice view of the lake if you
can see that it's really sunny oh and
then over here we just have that's the
780 T that I'm gonna be doing a giveaway
for we have a futon with some traversing
media pillows and just some boxes or
some programming books Python reacts
nodejs restful Web API is I've read most
of those books and a lot of them are
updated and then over here we have the
music area so I used to DJ I used to
have technics 1200 turntables back when
I was younger when I was you know 1718
and I really loved DJing I love hip-hop
I love house music and I decided to get
a DJ controller so this is the Pioneer
DD DD j RX and I really like it it's
it's it's awesome it has a lot of
different
effects and stuff like that I have it
hooked up to an HP Envy laptop this is
an i7 this is a pretty decent laptop you
can see it's running record box which is
the software I use loads your music
counts your beats per minute adds
effects does a little time it's all
types of stuff I'm not sure what these
speakers I forget but they're pretty
nice speakers they have a lot of power
for small speakers and they'll give you
a little sample right here so so pretty
cool I really I really enjoy this stuff
I come down here every night and spin
and my son comes down with me and he
dances he loves dancing to the house
music and stuff but yeah that's the
music station I have a pair of blue
audio headphones that I use with it down
there we got some other cheaper
headphones and just some boxes I really
love keep I keep all my boxes you can
see my keyboard and mouse boxes my video
cards power supplies over here we have
that iMac that I was talking about it's
an i-5 it's really really slow we'll
probably put it like in the living room
or something at the new house and then I
have another custom-built PC that
doesn't have it's not that great I might
do a giveaway for that as well
I also have some studio lights here so
some lime studio lights these are really
cheap these are like 70 bucks with a
green screen that I don't have up
anymore and then finally I have this
shelf here with a drone that I flew once
and crashed into my neighbor's house we
have the diffuser here and my wife's
tend to like the oils and you know the
essential oils and stuff it's also RGB
anything RGB I love
down here we have some more poxes so you
can see my microphone boxes my iPhone
boxes MacBook Pro some more keyboards
there's also like have some fans and
stuff PC building stuff switch they've
been meaning to hook up and that's about
it a raid card so yeah a corsair bag
with some power supply stuff in it but
that's really it guys so we've done a
full circle here and yeah so hopefully
you enjoyed this and you know you got to
see where I work where where the magic
happens
unfortunately it's light outside so I
would show you what the LEDs or what the
RGB looks like maybe we can still try
cuz it looks really cool in the dark
there's a lot of light switches down
here and close the curtains it's really
bright outside
and so that's what it looks like in the
dark
it's not it's not pitch dark in here but
it's it's it's it's alright I mean I
like the the RGB some people might think
it's stupid or it's overkill or whatever
but I like it
I can control unfortunately they're all
controlled by the same one so like if I
want to change this one over here
it might change others as well like
let's see I don't even know where the
thing is but yeah I see that one is now
blinking over there
so you can kind of do effects and stuff
and then it will also work for this one
so I don't know it's alright put that
back to blue alright guys so thanks for
watching that's going to be it for this
video I know it was kind of long and
that's it I'll see you in the next one
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
