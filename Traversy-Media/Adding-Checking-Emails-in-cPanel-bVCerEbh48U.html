Travis II from tech guy web solutions
and this is just a tutorial so I can
explain to you how to add after you
purchase a hosting account from us how
to add email accounts to your to your
domain to your website if you switched
hosting providers if you switch to us
from another provider you can't check
your email through them because your
site isn't pointed to them anymore so
you'll have to login to cPanel to set up
an account and you should when you sign
up for a hosting account with us you
should have got an email called hosting
account details which will have your
cPanel password the name servers or
everything you need to know about your
hosting account and make sure you keep
that email somewhere safe print it out
keep it somewhere safe so you have it
but yeah login to cPanel
this is cPanel right here you should see
something like this and under mail click
email accounts and here you'll see a
little box so you can enter some info
you pick your domain name I probably
only have one I have a bunch here but
pick your main domain where you want to
set the email up and just type in
whatever you want the name to be let's
say test user so this will be test user
at tech guy web solutions com of course
your domain will be different and type
in a password you can generate a
password if you want but chances are you
won't do that mailbox quota you can set
the quota of how much space this this
particular email address can hold in the
account
the default is 250 megabytes which is
pretty big and chances I you won't need
anything bigger than that if anything
you make it smaller
and click create account and that's it
that's all you do to set the email
account up so we should see it down here
here it is right here
test user at tech guy web solutions calm
now I want to go through checking your
email to check your email in cPanel it's
same thing let's just start over here
click on email accounts and you'll see
the the account you just created click
on more and then access webmail and
you'll see this it gives you an area to
put your password and type in your
password login now that you'll see this
screen with this screen is it whoops
what this screen is is just I it gives
you three different options for three
different mail clients which is just the
software you use to check it you can
pick any one you want i usually use
squirrel mail it's just your inbox trash
sent mail all that stuff so that's how
you check it in cpanel if you don't want
to login to cpanel every time you check
your email you what you can do is go to
yes your site so my site is WWE tech guy
web solutions comm slash webmail so
it'll be your site slash webmail now
you'll get a username and password for
your username you have to type you
username which as was test user and you
have to put at your whatever your
website is mine's tech guy website make
sure you do that because it won't it
won't work if you don't add the at your
site password
Wow what happened
there we go let's tape something wrong
so and it'll take you to that same
screen we were just at will you pick a
email client and that's it that's how
you log in you can if you use Microsoft
Outlook or something like that some kind
of third party email client you can use
that you'll have to go into that program
and you have to find where you have to
enter your your pop email info you can
find that by clicking email accounts
find the account that you want to use in
Outlook or whatever you can even gmail
has the same options go to more and then
configure email client and here you'll
see all your just your mail server name
ports anything that you you need to type
into Outlook or whatever client you
using so this info just type it in there
and you should be able to log in and
check your email and do everything from
there if you know if you prefer not to
login to cPanel every time so that
should be it if you have any other
questions you can email support at tech
guy web solution is calm and I'll be
happy to answer any other questions you
have about email so that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
