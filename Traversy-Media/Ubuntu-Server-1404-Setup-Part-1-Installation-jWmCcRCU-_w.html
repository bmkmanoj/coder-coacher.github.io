series in this series we'll be
installing configuring and adding new
functionality to a Linux Ubuntu server
alright so we're going to be using the
latest version which is 14.04 so what
you want to do we're actually going to
be installing this in a virtual machine
inside a VMware Workstation 9 if you're
not using virtualization that's fine
pretty this everything's going to be
pretty much the same even if you're
using a dedicated machine without VMware
alright so the first thing we want to do
is go to a Bluetooth comm slash download
slash server and you want to download
I'm assuming you have a 64-bit processor
so you want to download that version if
not there's also a 32-bit version
alright so it's going to take a while to
download I already have it on my machine
so what I'm going to do is let me just
open up the location real quick
uh-uh what do I have it
one second just waiting for mine ass to
boot up
all right so I have boom to server right
here it's an ISO file which you can use
in VMware all right so what we're going
to do is just click on create a new
virtual machine again if you're not
using virtualization the steps to
install Ubuntu are pretty much the same
so I'm going to just choose to install
with a disk image and I'm going to go to
that ISO file that I just showed you
okay boom - server ok now let's give
this you want to enter your name and
your user name password
okay get now here you're going to give
you a virtual machine a name I'm just
going to call this a test server and I'm
going to give it its own location on my
where do I want this
put it on my backup Drive actually
okay so we'll just give it its own
folder again you can save this wherever
you'd like
okay so I'm going to keep it at one
processor with one core because this is
going to be a headless server so it's
not going to need that much power and
memory I'm just going to keep it one gig
okay so networking when I create a
virtual machine I like to have it as a
physical node on my network so I use
bridge networking basically this will
give it this will give you a virtual
machine its own IP address and just
treat it as if it was a physical machine
okay that's good so we're going to
create a new virtual disk and 20 gigs is
recommended and that's fine
next all right so now I'm going to
create a virtual machine
all right so if you're not using VMware
and you're just using a straight machine
then ah these steps will pretty much be
the same if you were to boot up a PC
within a boom
inside this is basically what you would
see
all right so I just paused it because it
took took about five minutes to install
so now the virtual machine is rebooting
and it's installing VMware tools
and that's it we now have a boon to
14.04 installed on a virtual machine now
in this series we're going to do a bunch
of things there's a there's quite a few
steps that that I like to take after
installing a Linux server I like to make
the the IP address static change the
hostname and do some other things so
we're going to do that and we're also
going to set up samba
which is basically allows you to link to
a Windows network alright we're going to
create a print server we're going to do
an FTP server will install webmin we'll
do a bunch of things alright so now that
we have it installed we can move to the
next video and we'll just set up the
hostname and a couple other things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
