front-to-back now in this video I want
to get to arrays and then maybe loops
I'm not sure it was actually quite a bit
that we're going to go over with arrays
and I want to touch on everything so
what I might have to put loops in the
next video
all right but we'll see what happens so
we have our PHP sandbox folder people
have been following along and we have
the variables dot PHP file which we
worked in in the last video now we're
going to create a new file and we're
going to save that as a raid dot PHP
okay and let's throw in our PHP tags and
an array is basically a variable that
can hold multiple values so variable
that holds multiple values right and is
basically three types of arrays so first
we have index we have associative and we
have multi-dimensional sorry it's hard
to talk and type at the same time so
let's first go over index these are the
biggest the easiest type of array
probably the most common so let's say we
have a list of people that we want to
put into an indexed array so what we
would do is create a variable just like
we would with a regular variable and
then we're going to set that to a
special function called array and then
we can put in our names okay let's say
we have Kevin Jeremy and Sarah okay so
we have these three people that are
stored in this one variable now if we
want to access one of these let's say we
want to echo
let's settle people and let's say one so
let's save that and see what happens
when we run it I'm going to go to
localhost / PHP sandbox / arrays dot PHP
when we get Jeremy now if you've never
worked with the Rays before this might
confuse you might be asking why not
Kevin he's he's the first one the reason
for that is that arrays are zero based
okay and and pretty much pretty sure
every programming language there's zero
base they started zero and they go up so
zero one two so with one we're getting
Jeremy if we were to say people zero
then we get Kevin okay so just try to
remember that they're always zero based
now if we try to access people three
which we know there isn't one zero one
two and try to run that we get an
undefined offset okay so that's not
defined so let's go ahead and comment
that out and then we'll create another
array and this one I want to create an
array of numbers okay because you can do
different data types these are obviously
all strings numbers we could do without
having quotes around them alright so it
was an array of numbers and we could say
echo IDs say - and reload and we get
twelve okay because that's the number
two position now there's also another
way to create arrays so let's say we
want an array of cars and you can do it
without actually using the array
function there you can use just brackets
so if we go OK Honda
Toyota and Ford and this is equivalent
to using the array function and just
putting Honda Toyota Ford inside there
we can act with it the same way so it's
a cars one and sure you guys know we're
going to get we're going to get Toyota
okay so it's up to you what way you want
to define a race I usually use this way
and actually not sure why I guess it's a
little shorter but you can use either
way now if you want to add something to
an array that's pretty easy as well so
let's add a car so this is 0 1 2 so we
know that the next one is going to be 3
so we could do cars cars 3 and put that
to let's say Chevy and then down here so
they cars 3 will get Chevy now in some
cases you're not going to know what
index you're at but you're still going
to want to add to that array so to do
that you could simply just do cars and
then an empty set of brackets and I set
that let's say I don't know BMW ok so
now if we go when we do 4 and reload we
get BMW ok so you can choose to use the
index if you don't know it you can just
use some empty brackets and that'll add
it to the last one now when it comes to
arrays as though there's a whole bunch
of different functions that you can use
I'm not going to go over all of them or
even close to all of them because we
haven't gone into functions yet but
there are a couple that are very
important to know so one of them is
count so let's say you want to know how
many cars you have okay and that array
so you can just use the count function
and you can pass in cars so if we save
that and we reload actually we need to
echo it and reload and we get 5 ok so it
counts these 3 plus p2
um comment dado another one is print our
and this is basically echo for a raise
it'll actually show you the whole range
so let's throw in cars and reload and
you can see it just prints out the
entire array onto the screen so that's a
very handy function for debugging when
you want to see what's what exactly is
in that array now you may want to take
it a step further and look at the data
type that's in there as well for that
you can use fog dump this is the very
popular debugging function as well okay
so that's not in reload and it shows us
that this type what this is is an array
it has five values and it shows us each
in each key and value and it also shows
us the data type and the number of in
this case the number of characters okay
so this is very handy this pretty much
tells you everything you need to know
about not only the array but all the
variables inside of it or all the values
inside of it and var dump isn't just for
arrays you can dump any variable and
look at its data type and you know the
number of characters so now that's
that's pretty much it for indexed arrays
is not much more to look at so now we're
going to look at associative arrays so
an associative array allows you to
define the key and the value with index
basically the keys are the the number so
0 1 2 but with associative arrays we can
assign that key to whatever we want and
any data type we want so let's say we
want an array of people so I'm going to
say array just like we would normally
except we're going to define a key so
let's say Brad please that is the key
and then let's say the age we'll use as
the value okay so you can see we're
using the string as a key and we're
using a number as a value it could just
as well be the other way around all
right
add a couple more here so say Jose and
set him to 32 and let's set William to
37
all right now if we want to access let's
say Brad's age we could do echo people
and then we want to use brackets just
like we did up above with indexed arrays
and we want to put in the key which is
going to be Brad okay so the key is Brad
and then it will print out the value
which is 35 ok let's create another one
called ID and we'll use the other syntax
which is you can just bracket and let's
set IDs to two strings
okay I'll set the idea of 22 to Brad on
set 44 to Jose and 63 to William and
then if we want to echo let's say we
want to find out the name of a certain
ID then we'll do echo IDs and then let's
say 20 to reload and we get Brad okay
now if we want to add to an array an
associative array we can do that as well
so let's do we want to add two people
will say people and set a name here
we'll say Jill I'll set her age to 42 so
now if we echo out people and Jill
it gives us 42 okay and we can just as
well use print are okay now you may be
asking why you know we have people up
here and here and why it's working for
this one because we're just basically
overwriting this people with this one
okay so that's how it works let's reload
this and it shows it shows us the array
with the key and the value
all right and we can of course use var
dump as well and there we go so those
are associative arrays not too difficult
now the last type of array we're going
to look at is multi-dimensional okay so
basically what this is it's an array
within an array so let's say we have a
variable cars we're going to set that to
an array and then within that we're
going to set other arrays so we'll go
ray and let's put on des and let's say
we also want to put the number of cars
that they have in stock and also the
numbers that have been sold so we'll
take 20 in stock 10 sold and there
should be a comma okay and then we'll
just copy that let's get fit in two more
times this will be Toyota let's say we
have 30 and 20 and then this will be
Ford and so we have 23 and we sold 12
now when we echo this out we're going to
take ours and we're going to have to set
the bracket okay so the first one is
going to be which one of these we want
so let's say we want toyou 'te that's in
the one position this is 0 1 2 and then
which one of these we want let's say we
want to
and that's going to be positioned zero
okay so if we reload that we're going to
get Toyota if we want to get let's say
the number sold which is this that's
going to be still in the one position
for this for the array and then zero one
two okay so we want to for the second so
it saved that in reload and we get
twenty okay so that's all
multi-dimensional arrays work all right
so we're going to go ahead and stop here
we don't have the time to do loops in
this video because I'm trying to keep
these videos under you know 15 minutes
at the max so in the next video we're
going to take a look at four loops while
loops and also for each loops which we
use to to loop through these arrays okay
so we'll get to that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
