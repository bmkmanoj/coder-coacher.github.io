project set up on our local machine what
we're going to do now is we're going to
start to get into routes and also
controllers okay so we want to have a
pages controller so we can create pages
like about services or our home page
things like that so if we open up routes
and go into web dot PHP I already kind
of explained this we have route and then
the type of requests we want to handle
the URL and then a function and in here
we can we can pretty much do anything we
want
for instance if I were to just say
return hello world and save that and if
we go to our application and we reload
you'll see we get hello world and the
reason we're seeing it on the home page
is because we have a slash here if we
were to go to let's say hello actually
know what let's copy this and we'll put
the index back and then just paste that
in and then if we go and we say our Apps
slash hello you'll see we get hello
world
all right so routes are very easy to
work with now if you were submitting a
route let's say I'm submitting a form to
a route that would be a post request
most likely so you do route that post
you can also do route delete and so on
so it's pretty easy to create a restful
api with laravel okay we could also
actually throw in some HTML there if you
wanted all right if we go and reload
you'll see that it'll actually parse the
HTML now as far as our views let's go
into resources views and you should you
should probably separate your views into
folders so for instance we're going to
have some views that are going to belong
to the pages controller so we should
also create a folder called pages inside
the views so let's say pages and let's
say we want to create a file in here
called a boat blade dot PHP
okay and in here we'll just say about
save it and then let's go back to our
route file and let's go ahead and just
comment this out I guess I want to try
to keep most of the code that I write
just so you guys have it as a reference
so let's do route and say we want to
handle a get request to slash a boat put
a function and let's go ahead and say
return view now we have our about
template inside of a pages folder so
what we can do is we can say pages dot
about
okay so let's save that and then go to
slash about and you can see it's loading
our about template all right so I like I
like the dot syntax rather than doing
like pages slash about I think it's nice
and clean looking now before we get into
controls I just want to show you how we
can add a dynamic route so I'll just
copy this and then let's say we have we
want to handle a get request to I don't
know users and we want it specific we
want to put in a specific ID into the
URL so what we would do is say slash and
then put some curly braces and ID okay
and then we would pass in a variable
here that's going to represent that so
we'll say ID and then let's return we'll
say return ID I will say this is user
and then we'll just concatenate the ID
so we'll save it and let's go back to
our application and we'll go to users
slash Brad and it says this is the use
of Brad so it'll grab whatever we put
here most of the time your IDs will
probably numbers and then you'll query
the database based on that but just know
that that's how you can insert dynamic
values or parameters into into the URL
so if we wanted to put another one here
we'll say slash name and then we could
just pass that here we'll say this is
user name and then we'll concatenate
back and we'll say with a with an ID of
ID all right so now if we go back and we
say users slash what I do the ID first
yeah
so we'll say users slash to slash Brad
the user is Brad with an ID of two so
you can pass more than one dynamic value
into into the URL if you want I know
none of this has to do with the
application we're creating right now but
I just want to kind of you know explain
a couple things that aren't actually in
this application as well so let's see we
want to actually keep the about route
but for this I'm just going to copy that
I'm going to stick that up here in the
comment okay and then you usually don't
what you pretty much never want to
return a view from your route what you
would want to do is create a controller
and then set the route to go to a
certain controller function and then
return the view so let's go ahead and
create a controller I'm going to open up
our integrated terminal here and we're
going to use artisan okay so this is the
first time we're going to use artisan so
we're going to open up our command line
our terminal so go to integrated
terminal you can also do ctrl backspace
that'll also open it up and then we're
going to do PHP artisan and then the
command that we want so we want to use
the make command and we want to specify
that we want to make a controller okay
and then we want to name it so we're
going to call it pages controller and
you want to use this format this camel
up it's just can't know this is a Pascal
case so capital and then every other
word will begin with a cap
okay and I like to make my controllers
plural so I'll do pages controller
instead of page controller but let's go
ahead and run that and it says
controller created successfully all
right so let's get out of that and then
if we go when we look in app HTTP
controllers so you might have to refresh
this yeah now you'll see we have a pages
controller it created the file for us it
also added the name space which is going
to be app HTTP controllers it brings in
the request library so that we can
handle requests and it creates a
controller called pages controller and
then extends the core the the the
standard controller okay any controller
you create should extend this or you
won't be able to do very much so let's
create a function in here also called a
method when you have a function inside
of a class it's also called a method so
we're going to say public function
public meaning that we can access it
from outside of the class
all right so public function index and
let's go ahead and say let's just do
return index for now okay and we'll save
that so let's go back to our routes file
and let's go up to where we have this
this get get request to the home page
I'm just going to copy that and put it
down here so what we want to do instead
of just having a closure instead of just
having this function here we're going to
replace that and what we're going to put
is the controller and the method that we
want okay and that's going to go in
quotes okay so we know what's the pages
controller that we want and then we want
to do the at symbol and then the
function name which is going to be index
so let's save that and let's go back and
let's go to our home page and we get
index so we know that it's connected to
that controllers method all right now
what we want to do is we want to load a
view so let's say return
sorry about that they'll say return view
and let's say pages dot index so it's
going to look in the views folder in a
pages folder for an index blade dot PHP
so let's go ahead and create that now I
want an HDL structure in here so what
I'll do is go to welcome dr. Singh and
go and paste that in our index and then
I'm just going to get rid of everything
in the body and all of this this whole
style tag here okay get rid of the font
all right now for the title here I
actually want to put the application
name so if we go to dot env this holds
our database parameters but it also
holds the app name you can see by
default it's laravel I'm actually going
to change this to LS app and save and
then what we can do in here is we can
put our double curly braces and we're
going to say config and we want to use
app dot name and if that's not there
then we want to use LS app okay so let's
save that and I just want to see if that
works all right so you up here you can
see now we have LS app if we look at the
source code it has all of our HTML so
for now let's just put an h1 and we'll
just say welcome to laravel ok and then
we'll put a paragraph underneath it
let's go say this is the laravel
application from the laravel from
scratch youtube series okay save that to
make sure it shows up good so let's now
go to the above we're going to copy
everything that's in index and then go
to our about paste that in and we'll
just change the h1 to a boat and then
change the paragraph to we'll just say
this is the about page alright so now we
should be able to go to slash about good
now in any type of programming or web
development you don't want to repeat
yourself and if we look at index and
about we're repeating ourselves quite a
bit the only thing that we're changing
is this h1 and the paragraph so what we
will what we're going to have to do is
create a layout that has all this stuff
in it and then we can extend it okay
I'm not going to do that just yet though
we're going to get into that and blade
in the next video but one more thing I
want to do is create a services page so
let's go to our pages controller we
didn't link the about yet either so
let's just say public function about and
we're going to return the view and it's
going to be pages dot about all right
and we're also going to have a services
page so let's put that in here as well
pages dot services so we'll save and
we'll go ahead and create the services
lay out our template view whatever the
hell you want to call it the services
blade dot PHP and let's just copy this
and let's change the h1 to services and
for now we'll just say this is the
services page
all right let's go back to our routes
file web PHP and right now we're just
loading the view directly for a boat but
we don't want that what we want to do is
say slash a boat and we want to go to
pages controller at about and then we'll
do the same thing for services all right
so now if we go back to our app a boat
should still work and if we go to
services that works if we go to just our
application root that works so in the
next video we're going to look more into
blade templating and creating a layout
I'm also going to show you how we can
pass dynamic data into our into our
blade views all right so please
subscribe if you're not please leave a
like and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
