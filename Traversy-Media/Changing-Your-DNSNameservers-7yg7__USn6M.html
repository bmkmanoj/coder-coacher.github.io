guy web solutions and this is a small
tutorial on changing your name servers
if you had a domain name registered with
say I don't know GoDaddy or enormous um
kind of domain registrar if you had a
domain and you just purchased or even
got the free hosting account with us
you'll need to point your DNS name
servers from your domain to your new
hosting account you'll have to do this
with not just us but with any hosting
account you ever you ever purchase if
you have a domain registered somewhere
else so what you the domain names are
right here right government big letters
so you can read them ns1 tech guy web
solutions calm and NS - tech guy web
solutions com so there's two name
servers I say its name servers and DNS
they're the same thing so when I say
either one and they mean the same thing
so I'll write this down so you have it
now what you have to do is you have to
log in to your domain registrar wherever
you you purchased your domain name
GoDaddy is really popular for domain so
there's a good chance you might have it
there or anywhere I personally use enum
calm which is right here and I'm gonna
log in here and I'm gonna show you where
a ninon to to change your name servers
your your domain registrar will have a
different set up but it's basically the
same thing so I'm gonna log in here once
again your domain registrar will be
somewhere else unless you use e nom
let's go
all right so you'll have a panel like
this so what I'm gonna do is go to my
domains so go in your domain registrar
account just go wherever you see a list
of your domain names now just click on
the one whichever one you use with our
hosting account whichever one you want
pointed to our hosting click on and you
should see some some area where it says
either DNS or name servers right here
this is where Dean arms is now you'll
see probably about four options like
this name server one two three four we
use to like most hosting companies so in
where it says name server one you'll
type in n s 1 dot tech guy web solutions
calm and in name server two you'll type
NS two tech guy well actually this is
our old this says tech guy web hosting
it's our old domain which we have to
change so type in tech guy NS one tech
guy web solutions calm and NS to calm
and then click Save and you know I'm
informs you that it'll take
approximately 24 hours to propagate
which is you know it can take anywhere
between one and 48 hours so that's it
that the domain is now pointed to your
new hosting account and that you should
be all set you can start building your
site or or have us or someone else start
building your site everything should be
all set and if you have any other
questions on this don't hesitate to ask
I can email support at tech guy web
