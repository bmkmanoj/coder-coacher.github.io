Sunday night and I wanted to do a video
but I wanted to do something really
simple and quick and useful so we're
gonna build a full-screen image slider
and I've been asked to do this a few
times because I did the the full-screen
landing page tutorial then I did the
fullscreen video background and I was
asked a few times to do a full-screen
image slider so that's what we're gonna
do we're not going to be using jQuery or
anything it's going to be straight
JavaScript we're also not going to use
an e like advanced CSS transitions or
anything or animations basically we'll
just click on the arrow and it's just
gonna switch the image all right so you
can see it takes up the whole screen we
have three images here we can go forward
and backward and if I resize the browser
the the image is always going to be
fullscreen all right so hopefully you
guys enjoy this something simple it's a
Sunday night just you know relaxing and
wanted to make a video so let's get
started coding dojo is a programming
school that turns beginners into
developers in only 14 weeks over 90% of
their grads land jobs within three
months of graduating often making over
70 K per year to learn more visit coding
dojo com or click the link in the
description below alright guys so I have
vs code open on the left here and my
browser on the right we have the
finished product here first thing I'm
going to do is download the images now
the images I got from pixels dot-com
which is a fantastic resource for free
stock images you can see the images that
I use they're actually on the home page
here trending so what we're gonna do is
is click on this one here and of course
you can use any image you don't have to
use these and I'm gonna grab the
nineteen twenty by twelve eighty version
and download all right now I have a
folder right here open in vs code called
fullscreen slider that's we're gonna
we're going to put our application so
I'm going to navigate to that I have
that in my code production folder and
I'm going to just create a folder called
images I don't know what's up with my
os here doing this there we go we're
gonna call this images and let's save it
as an easier name we'll save it as image
one dot jpg all right so that's image
one I believe image two is down here
yeah this one right here is what I want
so I'm going to just grab the nineteen
twenty by twelve eighty one whoops what
happened I got a click download' alright
so we'll save this one as image to jpg
and then for the last one where the hell
is the last one this one right here
alright so same size nine - this one's
nineteen twenty by twelve eighty will
download this is gonna be image three
dot jpg and now we have those out of the
way at least we have those downloaded so
let's go ahead and create our files here
we're just going to need outside of the
image folder we're gonna need index dot
HTML and we're also going to need a CSS
file called style dot CSS or whatever
you want to call it alright so we'll
start off with the HTML which is going
to be pretty easy I'm using Emmet so I'm
going to do exclamation and then tab and
that's going to give us a basic HTML
layout for the title will just say full
fullscreen slider and we're gonna link
our CSS files so it's a link rel
stylesheet' href is going to be style
dot CSS alright so I'm gonna save this
now I'm using a an extension called live
server for vyas code if you want to use
that you can click on the little
extension icon here and just search for
it and just go ahead and click the green
install button and if you do that you'll
be able to just open up HTML files on
your localhost and you can do that by
just right-clicking and saying open with
live server alright so this is our
application here alright so let's go out
into the body and this is gonna be
pretty easy we just pull
sup real quick alright so we're just
going to create a div with the class of
rap to go around everything and inside
here we're gonna have basically our
right and left arrows and then all of
the slides okay we have three different
images or three different slides so
let's create the left arrow so I'm going
to create a class actually this is going
to be an ID of arrow - left we're also
going to give it a class of arrow okay
and then we'll go ahead and we'll copy
that and we'll put one down here and
we'll call this one arrow right alright
and then all of our slides are going to
go in the middle so in the middle here
we're going to create an ID of slider
that's gonna wrap around everything and
then we're gonna have three different
slide classes so we'll say slide and
then I'm also going to give this a class
of slide one because we need a target
for the images
alright so slide 1 and then in here
we're gonna have a class of slide
content and then a span alright and this
is this is where the text will go so for
the text I'm just gonna say image will
just say image 1 alright and then what
we're gonna do is just copy the slide
div okay so we'll copy what I do here
let's just copy that and I'll go ahead
and paste it in twice the second one
we're going to change to slide 2 we'll
change the text to image 2 and then this
one will be slide 3 and we'll change the
text to image 3 all right and that's it
for the for the HTML so let's save this
and it should look like this all right
we haven't linked any images yet we're
going to do that inside of our CSS so
let's let's go to our style sheet and
we're gonna start off with the body
styles okay so this is gonna be the body
the slider ID the wrap and the slide
content
all right so also all these styles are
gonna apply to these elements here so
I'm going to just margin I'm gonna zero
out the margin and the padding all right
we're gonna set the font family to let's
say arial helvetica sans-serif we're
gonna set the width to 100% and then
we're gonna set the height to 100 VH or
viewport heights and if you don't know
what viewport Heights is you can
basically think of the height of the
browser no matter how no matter how its
resized as 100 slices across okay so
we're saying that we want this to take
up the entire thing all 100 slices if we
were to do you know 50 VH that would
take up 50 of the 100 slices so that's
that's the best way I can describe VH
and then we also have VW which you can
think of going the other way
all right we're also gonna set the
overflow - X here - hidden because you
don't want any horizontal scroll bars
I'm just gonna space these out here all
right so those are basically the the
core styles of a base styles the rap
class all I want to do for that is just
position it relative so we'll say
position relative and then we want to
start to add the slide so we have a
slide class and then we have the slide 1
to 3 which is where we're going to put
our background images so let's slide out
let's let start out with slide and we're
gonna set this to fill this up here
we're going to set the background let's
say background size is gonna be cover
and let's say background background
position
background position is gonna be Center
and then let's set the space here let's
set the background repeat' to no repeat
all right and then we're gonna style
each slide 1 slide 2 and slide 3
individually so let's say slide 1 and in
here we're just gonna say background
image and we want to set that to a URL
and inside the URL we want to put images
that's the folder it's in and then it's
called image 1 dot jpg ok and then we'll
go ahead and we'll copy this and let's
paste it in two more times and we'll
change this one to slide 2 and slide 3
we'll change this to image to an image 3
and let's go ahead and save that and it
should show the images ok so they're all
going to be piled on top of each other
now it's gonna be like that until we get
to our JavaScript and we start hiding
images and showing the you know showing
one at a time so now we're gonna do the
slide content which you can see is way
up here it's black you can barely see it
it says image one image 2 and image 3 so
we want to take care of that so that has
a class of slide content so for slide
content I'm actually going to display as
flex and we'll set the Flex direction so
instead of a row I want it to go
vertical so it's going to be a column
and then we just want to align
everything to the center so we're gonna
say justify content to the center we're
gonna do align items
aligned items to the center and let's do
text aligned to the center all right so
we'll go ahead and save that now you can
see that the words are now in the center
we need to obviously make those a lot
bigger and change the color for that
we're gonna target the span that's in
the slide content so we'll say slide
content span all right so let's say font
size we're gonna set that to 5 REM so
REM is a relative unit basically we're
saying that we want it to be 5 times the
the the font size of the core HTML
element or the root element which by
default is 16 pixels all right if you
want to learn more about REM and M units
I just did a video probably about two
weeks ago on it if you want to check
that out all right and then we're just
going to set the color to white all
right so let's go ahead and save that
and now you can see the words are in the
middle and they're big and white so next
thing we want to do is the arrows so the
arrows are actually gonna they're going
to be pure CSS we're gonna do it using
boy border a border with and borer color
so let's first do the arrow class
remember we have the arrow class on both
and then we also have an ID of left
arrow or our left and arrow right so for
the arrow class we're gonna set
first of all let's do the cursor so
we'll set the cursor to a pointer when
we hover over it and then we're gonna
set the position to absolute we're gonna
set from the top 50% because basically
we wanted to it's going to start up here
we want to go down 50% from the top and
it's going to be a little too low after
we create the size from the border so
we're gonna have to bring it up a little
bit so what we'll do is we'll set the
margin top to let's say negative 50
pixels
all right and then we're gonna set the
width to zero and the height to zero
because basically we're just working
with the border all right and we're
gonna have a border style of solid all
right
and when I say working with the border
this is this is how we can actually
create triangles with CSS or arrows
whatever you want to call them so let's
add the ID of arrow left alright and in
here we're gonna set the border width
and it's going to be top right bottom
left so top will be 30 pixels right will
be 40 top right bottom will be 30 and
left will be zero okay and then we want
to add actually we'll do this after
let's do from the top I mean I'm sorry
from the left zero okay because this is
the left arrow so we want it zero from
the left so it's gonna stay over here
now I don't want it right at the edge so
I want to push it over a little so what
we'll do is we'll add a margin left of
let's do 30 pixels okay so if I go ahead
and I save this you'll see we just get
this black box okay so this is just
going by all these border widths kind of
mushed together so the key to make this
an actual arrow is with the border color
and setting everything to transparent
except for the right all right so it's
top right bottom left so we're gonna say
transparent for the top white for oops
white for the right and then transparent
for the bottom and transparent for the
left and if we save that there we go we
get an arrow now it's right now we can
scroll we're not going to be able to do
this when we get to our JavaScript
because we're only going to display one
image at a time so don't worry about
that so let's see what else you want to
do here then it looks a little high you
know what let's do margin top right here
let's do negative 30 that'll move it
down a little kind of align it with the
text
yeah actually we'll do 35 there we go
all right so now we want to do the same
thing with the right arrow except it's
gonna have some different values so
let's copy that so we'll call this arrow
right and then for the border width what
we want to do is just set the second one
which is the right to zero all right we
want the top to be 30 0 30 and then 40
pixels on the left and then as far as
the border color goes we want the white
to be on the on the left as well so this
will be transparent and then the last
one which is the left will be white
okay and then we obviously don't want
this over here we want it on this side
so we're gonna say from the right we
want it to be zero and then we want to
push it over a little so it's not right
at the edge and that's gonna be a margin
right of 30 pixels okay so let's try
that out we'll save it and there we go
so now we have our arrows all right so
now what I want to do is start to add
our JavaScript so we're gonna go to our
HTML file go down to the bottom here and
let's put in our script tags all right
so first thing we'll do is create some
variables we're gonna have one called
slide our images and we want to set this
to document dot query selector all
alright because what we're doing is
we're selecting all the elements that
have the class of slide okay which is
going to be these three right here so we
want to represent those and query select
are all is what you want to use if
there's more than one it's basically
going to return an HTML collection which
is kind of like an array we can select
each element as we would an array with
an index all right so the next set of
variables we want to for the arrows so
we'll say arrow right and we'll set that
to document dot query selector not query
selector all because there's only one so
this is gonna be the ID of arrow - left
all right
and then put a comma here and you could
just as well put a semicolon and just to
you know keep saying let but I'm just
gonna do it all in one shot then we want
arrow right I'm sorry
arrow I put arrow right there that
should be left and then we'll do arrow
right so I'll copy this and change this
to right
change this to right and then the last
variable that we want is going to be
called current and this is going to
represent what image were on or what
slide we're on it's going to be 0 by
default okay so those are our variables
now what we want to do is I'm going to
create a function here called reset
because each time we change the slide we
want to basically clear out all the
images set them all to display:none so
we're gonna call this reset function
before every you know slide left slide
right so to do that we're going to loop
through the collection of slides so
let's do a simple for loop we'll say let
a equal 0 we're gonna say as long as I
is less than slide our images slide our
images dot length and then we just want
to increment I by 1 so I plus plus and
then we're just gonna do let's say we're
gonna do here we're gonna say slide our
images the current iteration so I and
we're gonna set the style dot display so
we're taking the display and we're gonna
set it to none okay so we're basically
just hiding all hiding everything so
let's go ahead and save that now if when
we reload the images are still going to
be there because all we did is define
the function now what we're going to do
let me just put a comment saying what
this does actually so this will clear
all images and then we're gonna create a
function called start slide which is
basically our initializer okay but
before we do anything we want to call
reset okay and then just to show you
down here we'll go ahead and run
whoops we want to run start slide
so let's save that and that's gonna
clear all the images out now the goal
now what we want to do is just show the
first image now we can grab on to the
first image with slider images and then
we want to use the zero index okay so
it's basically like an array we can
access the first image with zero second
one with one the third one with two and
so on and it's scalable so as we add we
can add more images and we won't have to
tweak the JavaScript all right so we're
gonna say dot style dot display and
we're gonna set it to block so that it
shows so let's go ahead and save that
and now you'll see it shows the first
image so let's go ahead and let's put a
comment here this basically initializes
the slider and then we want to add our
functionality to slide left and slide
right so let's go under the start slide
function and let's start with the we'll
do the show previous which will be slide
left okay if we click the left arrow
so we'll say function slide left okay
and then what we want to do here is
first of all call reset because we want
to wipe the slate clean and then we're
gonna say slider images and then for the
index we want to take the current
whatever isn't that whatever the current
image is and we want to take away one
from it so if we're on the second image
image - which has an index of one
because remember the array or that the
collection is zero based so the second
image is going to have an index of one
if we click the left we're going to want
the index to go to zero which is you
know 1-1 okay it's going to be zero and
then we want to set that to show so
we're gonna say style style dot display
equals block
okay and then we want to take the
current value and we want to just
decrease it by one so we're gonna say
current - - all right now to test this
out of course we're gonna need an event
to run this right now we just define the
function so what we'll do is create an
event listener let's say left arrow
click and we're gonna grab the left
arrow so remember we gave that a
variable of arrow left and we're gonna
say dot add event listener and we're
gonna listen for a click event and once
it's clicked it's gonna call this
function okay and then in this function
what we want to do before we actually
call slide left we want to check to see
if it's at zero all right because we
have a special condition if it's at zero
so let's say if I will say if current is
equal to zero then what do we want to do
we want to basically set current equal
to the total number of slides which we
can get with slider images dot length
all right now if this confuses you what
we're doing right here basically if
we're at zero that means we're on the
first image that has a zero index so if
we click the back button we want it to
go to the third image or the last image
which in this case is going to be the
second index so we're setting the
current to this to the max number of
images in this case is three all right
and then when we click slide left which
is what we're gonna do next sorry for
the bang and my wife and kids just got
home when we click slide left current is
now going to be three right because
we're setting it to the max the or the
slider images length width which is
three and then this is going to be three
minus one which will be the index of two
which is the last image
okay the index of two is the third image
so when we click the back button it's
going to go to the third image which is
exactly what we want
it should go to the
last image in the in the in the array or
the collection so that's what's
happening here I know that may it might
be a little confusing alright so now
we're gonna do is handle the right arrow
so what I'll do is copy the slide left
actually I'm not gonna copy it I'll just
type it in so this is gonna be show next
show next and then we're gonna say
function slide right alright so for
slide right just check this out real
quick we're first gonna reset okay we're
gonna wipe the images clean then we're
going to take slider images and we're
good this is going to work a little
different we're going to take current
and we want to add one to it instead of
takeaway because we're moving to the
next image all right and then we'll set
the style dot display equals block
sorry that's a lot of banging up there
and then we want to increase we want to
increment current by one so we'll say
current plus plus all right now for the
event listener for the right arrow I'm
just going to copy this and it'll paste
that in so this is gonna be the right
arrow click so we're gonna change this
right here to arrow right event listener
click now for the if statement we're
going to do something a little different
we want to see if the current is equal
to them to two slider images length so
slider images length take away one okay
so if that's true
then we want to set current equal to
negative one all right because when we
get to the last image we want it to go
go back to the the first image all right
and then we're gonna call slide right I
probably should have tested the left one
first but whatever we'll just test them
at the same time so let's go ahead and
save that let's let's click on the left
one goes back to image three two one it
just keeps going let's click the right
one goes to two three and it just
restarts so it's working exactly how we
want it to
all right so that's gonna be it guys I'm
gonna stop because they're making a ton
