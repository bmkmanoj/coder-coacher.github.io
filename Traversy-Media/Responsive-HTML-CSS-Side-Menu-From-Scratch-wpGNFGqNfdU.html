web development tutorial in this video
we're going to be building a responsive
side menu or a collapsible menu
hamburger menu whatever you want to call
it
now you often see things like this in
frameworks like Twitter bootstrap but if
you're not using a framework you it's
really a good thing to know how to do
this type of thing on your own just
using you know HTML CSS and a little bit
of JavaScript so let's take a look at
what we'll be building this is it right
here we have a navbar it's very very
simple but also very clean looking and
we have our main links here and then we
have this icon and if we click that we
get this sidebar that opens up nice and
smooth okay and you'll see the main
content gets pushed over as well so the
main purpose of this is so when we were
looking at this on a small screen no
matter how small we can still have our
navigation and you'll see the main
navigation has actually disappeared when
we get to a certain point it'll you know
disappear and reappear so that's what
we'll be building hopefully you guys
enjoy it it's not going to take too long
so let's go ahead and get started if
you're looking to host a website or a
small application at an incredibly low
price check out a host and get started
for as low as 275 per month plans also
include over $200 of extras click on the
link in the description below for more
info alright so I have my Adam text
editor open and you can use whatever
editor you want Adam Visual Studio code
sublime text they're all really good
choices it doesn't really matter and I'm
also running a plug-in or a package
called Adam live server which just opens
our index.html file on my local host and
you'll have to use that you can just
open it in your file system alright now
I have an index.html file and a style
dot CSS file those are the only two
files we're going to need for this
project so let's go ahead and add some
structure to our HTML now I'm using
Emmet so and it is a plug-in that allows
you to do really fast
HTML ok so we can do an exclamation and
then tab and it's going to give us an
entire HTML head and body document so
let's go ahead and change the title here
we'll just say responsive side menu and
then we're just going to link to our
style sheet so it's going to go to style
dot CSS we're not using any frameworks
or anything like that so everything is
from absolute scratch now as far as what
we'll be doing we're going to first
start with the HTML which isn't a lot at
all and then we're going to add the tiny
bit of JavaScript and then we're going
to move to the CSS which is the the meat
of this project that's where most of our
time is going to be spent ok now I also
have the finished project open on
another tab here just so we can kind of
look at this and I can let you know what
work what we're working on all right so
let me just open this project up in
another windows so I can because I mean
I don't remember every single style and
all that but we're going to start off
with just creating a nav tag here and
we're going to give this a class of
navbar ok and I'm just calling a navbar
I tend to use I tend to use the class
syntax from bootstrap I don't know why I
guess because I use bootstrap so much
that I just tend to to be comfortable
with those class names so inside our nav
here let's just take a look at the
finished product so this whole thing is
the navbar
right and then we're going to work on
this this icon here which is actually
created through SVG or scalable vector
graphics now you could use something
like font awesome or another icon
library but I didn't want to block this
up with any extra library so this this
icon is simple enough to draw with SVG
so that's what we're going to do so
let's wrap this in a span ok so I'm
going to give this a span and give it a
class of open - slide all right and then
we need a link in here which is just
going to go nowhere so we're going to
put a number sign alright and then this
is where we want to put our SVG element
all right now I'm no pro at SVG but this
is this is pretty simple I'm just going
to paste it in here so basically we have
an SVG tag which is available with HTML
5 and then we're setting a width of 30
and a height to 30 so we're looking at
this right here
30 by 30 and then each one of these
lines here we're drawing with this path
this path element okay and it takes an
attribute for a draw for which is a D
attribute and then we're basically
saying we want this to go over 30 pixels
and then we want to we're going to give
it a stroke color of white so each line
is going to be white and then a width of
5 pixels so each line here will be a
width of 5 pixels so if we go ahead and
we save that and we look at our file
we're not going to see anything because
the lines are white and so is the
background so for just for now I'm going
to make these black just so we can see
it make sure that it's actually working
all right and now you see we can see the
icon okay and like I said this is just
SVG is just one choice I think it's I
think it's nice and clean though all
right now we're going to work on these
links here which are the main nav bar
links so let's go under the span ok
still in the nav but under the span and
then we're going to create a ul here and
I'm going to give this a class of nav
bar - nav again kind of adopting the
bootstrap class names and then let's put
some allies here with some links now
these links aren't going to go anywhere
because they're not it's not going to be
a working navigation it's just one page
so we'll copy that and let's do home
we'll do about services and contact all
right so there's our main navigation if
we take a look it looks really ugly
because we haven't added any CSS yet so
now we want to work on is this here the
actual slide menu that that is going to
pop out so we want to go under the main
nav here now and we're going to create a
div and we're going to give this an ID
of side when I say side menu and then
also a class of side nav now the only
reason I'm giving this an ID is because
we need to grab on to it from within the
JavaScript okay so that's all the IDS
going to be used for the classes where
we'll add all the styles so in here
we're going to need a few lengths we're
going to need all the
as well as the close button so let's go
ahead and start with the close button
now this isn't going to go to a specific
page so we're going to put a number sign
I'm also going to give this a class of
BTN - close all right and then as far as
what goes in here we're going to do
ampersand x and then semicolon that's
going to give us that x mark all right
then we just want to put our links in so
let's say these aren't going to actually
go anywhere but that'll be for home I'll
just copy that
so we'll do home about services and
contact all right and then the last
thing we need to do as far as HTML is
this main area here so let's go under
that div and we'll create a div with the
ID of main and in here I'm just going to
put an h1 and we'll just say responsive
side menu and that's it for the HTML so
if we save that it should look like this
which again is horrible-looking but we
haven't added any CSS yet now before we
get to the CSS let's add our JavaScript
which is going to be very very simple
basically all we want to happen is when
we click on this icon we want to run a
function called open what I call it open
slide menu and that's going to take care
of taking the slide menu and setting the
width to 250 so this width right here
should be 250 and we're going to
initially set it to 0 and the CSS later
on and then we also want to take this
main ID here and we want to add a margin
left because we want to push it over 250
this is 250 wide so obviously we want
this to push over 250 so we're going to
add a click event to the to the a tag
right here that wraps around the SVG so
let's say on click and we'll set that to
open slide menu which is a function and
then we're also going to add an event to
the close button here so let's say on
click
and we'll set that to close side menu
okay so two functions will go down here
and create our script tags and let's say
let's say function opens slide menu okay
and again we're just going to set the
width of the slide menu the side menu so
what we'll do is a document dot to get
element by D okay remember we gave it an
idea of side dash menu and then we just
want to set the style we want to set the
width property equal to 250 pixels all
right and then I'm just going to copy
this and then we're going to grab the
main div and we're going to change we're
going to stay margin margin left
yeah margin left 250 pixels so that'll
open it let's go ahead and save it now
if I click this you'll see that the main
gets moved over because it's adding the
margin you don't see any difference here
because the width is not going to change
because it's not initially set to zero
we're going to do that from the CSS all
right so let's copy this the whole thing
and we're going to change this to close
side menu and then we want to set the
width to zero when we close it and we
also want to set the margin left of the
main div to zero as well so we'll save
that now if I click it you'll see it
goes it gets pushed over if we click the
X nothing happens because because why
did close side menu
isn't that working they grabbed the
console here closed side menu is not
defined
oh I said slide menu so we just need to
add an L right here all right so if we
open it and then we click that you can
see it goes back and then this width
gets set to zero okay so that's actually
it for the HTML and JavaScript very very
simple I tried to make this so you did
as little markup as possible so now
we're going to open up the style.css and
this is like I said this is where the
meat of the project is and I'm going to
be checking over to the right because I
can't remember every single style so I'm
going to be looking over here as well
all right so let's start out with the
body and I'm just going to change the
font family we don't need to do this but
I want to make it look a little better
so we'll say Ariel and serif alright and
then we're also going to set the
background of the body and say
background color and we're going to set
that to a really light gray all right
save that and you can see that that's
changed so let's go ahead and add styles
for the navbar itself so that's going to
have a background or background color
and that's going to be the the dark blue
of the Facebook blue which is that right
there
three B five nine nine eight we're also
going to set overflow:hidden and let's
set the height of the navbar to sixty
three pixels okay there we go
now that it's blue we can change the
icon back to white that's how I want it
so I'm going to change triple zeros to
triple F's alright and if you wanted to
for some reason you could make these
different colors if we wanted the bottom
one to be black we could do that alright
so let's go back to the CSS and then
we're going to style the links in the
nav bar all right so let's say we want
links to float:left we want to display
them as a block
we want the color to be it's going to be
very very light gray so f two three
times and then we're going to do
text-align:center okay and then we're
going to do a padding top and bottom is
going to be 14 pixels and right and left
will be 16 pixels then we're going to
add text decoration of none because we
don't want any underlines and then we're
going to set the font size to 17 pixels
all right so let's save that now this is
going to pertain to all the links the
sidebar and the main links but we're
going to target each one later on so for
the UL by default you l's have a padding
of I think it's 10 pixels so we want to
remove that we're going to say navbar ul
we actually we don't want to remove it
what we want to do is set only some
padding to the top of the UL and none to
the rest so we'll add 8 pixels on the
top oops
I'm going to took padding so we'll say 8
pixels on the top and then 0 everywhere
else all right and that's all we're
going to do for the UL and then actually
let's set list-style:none as well
because we don't want to need bullet
points all right now for the link hover
let's say now bar a:hover and for that
we're going to add a background color
and that's going to be a light gray and
then we're going to just set the color
to black looks alright so now if we
hover you'll see has the grey background
and the text turns black alright so now
let's start to add some styles to the
Navitus side navigation which is this
right here
alright so let's say dot so I call it
side nav
and we're going to set the height of
this to 100% want to take full height
we're going to initially set the width
to zero so if I save that you'll see
that the width is now set to zero by
default so if we open it goes like that
close it goes back to zero all right and
then we want this to stay in stay in its
place so we're going to say position
position is going to be fixed and then
we're going to set the z-index because
we want it to be on top always so step
to Z n index to one we're also going to
position it make sure it's in top zero
position and the left arrow position all
right and then let's add a background
color and the background color is going
to be a black color a little lighter
than pitch black so triple ones and then
I want the opacity I want it to be a
little bit see-through so we're going to
do 0.9 and by the way what we're talking
about here is this this whole thing okay
let's see what else we're going to add
we're going to disable the horrors of
the scrolling horizontally so we want to
do overflow overflow X which is
horizontal and we're going to set that
to hidden and then we're going to set a
padding top to let's say 60 pixels and
then we want to add our transition
alright because right now let me just
save that so right now if I click this
it just you know it just appears and
then disappears okay
what I wanted to do is smoothly open so
we need to add a transition here so
transition and we're going to set that
to 0.5 seconds so half a second so now
if we click it you'll see that it's
smooth it opens nice and smooth you can
change this if you want let's say one
second it'll open a little slower but
I'm going to keep it at a half a second
alright so now let's style the
individual links inside of the
so let's say side nav a grabbing all the
a tags and we're going to set the
padding of these to ten pixels
everywhere except for the left which
will be 30 pixels okay so it's top top
right bottom left and let's set the text
decoration to none because we do not
want underlines I don't think I've ever
wanted an underline on my links I don't
know why that's the default but let's
set the font size to 22 pixels and we're
going to set the color to of light gray
and we're going to make sure that these
are displayed block and let's add a
transition transition of 0.3 seconds so
let's see what that looks like there we
go it's pretty good now when we hover
over these I want them to change just a
little bit so let's add dot side nav
a:hover and we're just going to stuff
the color let's see it's initially light
gray let's just just set it to white
when we hover so you can see there's a
little bit of change now we want to do
the close button I don't want it right
here I want it to be pushed over here so
it's a side nav and remember we gave the
button a class of BTN close alright so
for that we're going to set the position
to absolute to its container and we'll
set the top to zero we want it at the
very top and then from the right we want
it to go over 22 pixels
okay so top zero will be around here and
then it will go from the right over 22
pixels and let's make the font size a
little bigger we'll make it 36 and then
we're just going to add a margin left
here of 50 pixels
okay so now it's placed nice and neat
good alright so next notice that when we
open this this response this this main
ID here this content just kind of you
know up here is over and we want it to
have a transition so we're going to go
over here and save ideas main and then
we're going to add a transition so let's
say transition which will take the
margin left and we'll set it to 0.5 or
0.5 seconds that should work
and then let's set padding to 20 pixels
and let's set overflow to hidden and
let's set the width to 100% all right so
now you'll see when we open and close it
gets nicely pushed over instead of just
appearing over to the right alright so
that looks pretty good
see let's take care of these blanks
right here why are those pushed down so
let me just go back up here so oh wait a
minute
what am I missing you know what it is
guys it's the path this should actually
be the navbar ul this should be margin
not padding there we go so now it's it's
pushed down eight pixels and it should
be equal on on both sides vertically all
right so that is pretty good I think
that that's that's basically it now if
we were to make this smaller right now
you'll see the links are still there so
what we need to do is just add a media
query down at the bottom so we'll say at
media and then this is going to take in
a parameter which is going to be the max
width and we're going to set that to 568
pixels 568 now what this does if you've
never worked with media queries any
styles we put inside here are only going
to be in effect if it's a max width of
568 so once it gets above 568 and you
can see it even has the sizes right here
in Chrome once it gets above 568 this
stuff will not kick in okay well it
won't it won't do anything so what I
want to do is grab just these links
which is the class nav bar - nav and we
want to set that to display:none all
right so now if I go smaller and you'll
see that they disappear when we get to a
certain size and the sidebar still works
perfectly all right now if you want to
make this so it doesn't show when it's
big because I'm there's really no other
reason - other than just you know
physical aspects because you have the
same links right here but I mean if you
wanted this to be different and always
show you could do that as well but if
you did want to hide that what we could
do let's copy that let's create another
media query that will be min with 568
and then remember we wrap that icon in a
span called open slide and we're going
to set that to display:none so now if I
save that you'll see it goes away and
then if we get to a certain point
there it is okay we get to 560 or less
it appears alright but I'm just going to
comment that out just because I do want
it to show initially alright so oh one
more thing this right here if you don't
want that to show what we could do is
add on to the body
let's do overflow will say overflow X
and we're going to set that to hidden
there we go so that gets rid of that
scrollbar alright so that's it guys
hopefully you enjoyed this I tried to
make it as simple as possible but yea
that's it thanks for watching please
subscribe please leave a like a comment
whatever you can do is great and I will
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
