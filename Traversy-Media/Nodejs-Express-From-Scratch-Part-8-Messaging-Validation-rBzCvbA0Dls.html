our node and Express from scratch
project now up to this point we've
created a full crud application we can
create read update and delete articles
but I do want to move on and add some
more stuff eventually we're going to get
to authentication but in this video what
I want to do is set up a couple things I
want to set up messaging flash messaging
so that for example if we add an article
and it redirects us after we submit it I
just want a message saying like article
created or article updated and so on
we can also handle error messages so I
want to do that we're going to use
something called Express messages for
that and it's pretty easy to implement
we just have a little bit of middleware
that we have to add it has a couple
dependencies such as connect flash and
also this right here Express session
this obviously handles such sessions and
Express and then connect flash handles
storing those those messages all right
so we need to setup those two things as
well and then I also want to add some
validation now we do have we look at our
model our article model we set these
fields to required so it won't submit
but it's not elegant at all it's just
going to basically just show us a
message in here which isn't what we want
we want it to display on the client you
know in the application so we're going
to use Express validator for that and
that's pretty easy to set up as well and
then the last thing I want to do is if
we look at our app j/s this is the entry
file and it's full of routes for
articles you know for adding and editing
articles and so on and I want to clean
that up a little what we'll do is create
a routes folder and then we're going to
use the Express router to to transfer
all of our routes here into a file
called articles G is inside the routes
folder and this will just clean it up a
little bit and if we want to add more
resources like I don't know maybe pages
or to do is or any resource at all any
model we're going to have to create
routes for it so we can have a separate
file for that alright so that's a little
going to be doing so let's start off by
just installing all these modules I'm
just going to stop the server from
running and we're going to do an NPM
install - - save and we want express
message book messages we want express
session connect flash let's see and
Express validator think that's all so
let's go ahead and run that that'll get
those things set up alright now what we
want to do is start to add the
middleware okay so we're going to go to
app j/s and let's go down - right under
where we put the public folder and we're
going to go to Express
actually the first thing one included
Express session because that's needed
for some of this other middleware so it
should have it on here we want this
right here this app dot use and then
passing in that session function so
let's copy that and we'll say Express
session middleware paste that in so the
secret you can put whatever you want
here I'm just going to leave the default
and resave if you want to know what this
stuff means you can look through here
let's say let's search for resave so
this forces the session to be saved back
to the session store even if the session
was never modified during the request
okay so that's what the resave does save
uninitialized forces the session that is
uninitialized to be saved to the store
its uninitialized when it's when it's
new but not modified okay so this is
just standard configuration now we're
going to also add some middleware for
express message so let's go there
and we want to go down to see where is
it love this right here so Express
three-plus that's what we want and we're
just going to put that put a semicolon
there and we'll say Express messages
middle we're all right so this is
basically setting a global variable
called messages to the Express messages
module okay it's also requiring connect
flash and that's one thing we need to do
is add the requires up here I should've
did that first so let's bring in Express
validator okay so it'll be expressed -
validator and we want to bring in flash
set that to require Express flash I mean
connects flash alright and then we also
want to bring in session and that's
going to be Express session all right
and the messages we're actually bringing
in down here we're setting this variable
and we're requiring it here so next
thing we're going to need is the Express
validate or middleware so let's go to
the github page and go down to right
here middleware options we're just going
to grab this thing here alright so we
shouldn't have to change any of this
stuff so let's save that I'm not going
to explain every line of the middleware
honestly I don't know what every single
line means I just know that we need to
have this alright so now that we have
that stuff set up let's work on the
Express messages so I'm going to go back
to the github page here now when we want
to call a message we can just do request
dot flash we can add in a type and then
the actual message but we need to make
sure that that this can render in our
pub templates now on this on this page
here it refers to plug is Jade because
that's what it used to be called now you
can do this to output the messages
it's going to it's going to look like
this this type of HTML all right so it's
going to have the UL with the class of
info it's very hard coded what we want
to do is we want to create a custom
template because we're using bootstrap
and we want to wrap every message in it
in an alert ok in a div alert so we're
going to go to our views folder and
let's create a new file in here and
we'll call it message message dots hug
and this is going to be an include ok so
it's just going to be part of the
template that we can just bring into
into our main layout and then if we look
over at the documentation we need to do
something like this ok so it's going to
say each type because we want to be able
to add different types whether it's an
error or a success message because we
want the output to be different if
success messages should be green they
should have a green background and then
you know red ones will have them on a
red background all right so we're not
going to use this exact code right here
but it's going to be similar so let's
say messages hey when it does that
ok so messages and we're going to indent
and we're going to say each type in
object dot keys and then we're going to
wrap messages alright so we're just
doing what it says right here ok now we
don't want a ul so we're not going to
use that and now we're going to loop
through the messages so each each
message in messages and then we want to
pass in type looks all right and then
we're going to have a div and this div
is going to have a class of alert and
then you guys have probably worked with
alerts in bootstrap you know if we do -
danger it'll be read if you do - success
it'll be green so we want this to be
dynamic so that we can change it on the
fly so we're going to concatenate in
here
type okay and that's going to be passed
in and then we just want the actual
message so we're going to spit that out
in a variable message so let's save that
and then we need to add it to our layout
we're going to put the messages right
above the block content here so we're
going to go right here and if we look
over on the documentation we need this
right here all right now we want to
change this to the name of our template
which I called message okay and then
we'll save that so now we should have a
custom template so let's go over to app
J s and go to where we submit an article
okay if we go to add article we get an
error
oh I didn't start the server okay so
when we add an article remember it goes
to our post row which is this right here
post articles add and we want to go to
where we redirect after everything is
okay you know after we submit the
article and we're going to say request
dot flash and then the type which is
going to be success and then the actual
message and we'll say article added all
right so let's see if that works so
let's go title we'll just say test
article submit okay so that didn't work
you know where I think it maybe is the
session middle layer yeah right here so
this isn't exactly what I had in mind
when I was creating this so I had save
uninitialized yeah to true and I had
resave also to true so let's try that
and then I didn't have this cookie value
here so let's see if that works I'm also
going to clear my cache with ctrl f5
just in case and then let's go ahead and
try to add another one here
so let's just say another article say
John Doe and submit there we go okay so
was the session middle where you want to
save Risa or setri save to true and we
get article added and then I'm just
going to add it to the update function
as well or the update route which is C
post to edit articles edit ID and I'm
just going to put right here request dot
flash and it's as easy as this now if we
ever want to do any kind of messaging if
you want it to be an error you want to
do danger because that's the bootstrap
class to give it a red background
success is green okay I will just say
article updated so now that we have
messaging set up let's go ahead and set
up some validation so if we go to add an
article and we try it we leave all these
blank and we try to submit if we look
over at the console here it says message
path body is required author is required
the reason it's doing that is because in
our model that's what we set these to
required but you'll see on the front end
this is a horrible experience it just
hangs it doesn't do anything and it's
not what we want so we're going to use
Express validator to fix this so let's
go over to our app J s and go to where
we submit the the add article form which
is going to be the post request to
articles ad all right and then what
we're going to do here is we're going to
set some rules so right here let's do we
can say request dot check body okay and
then we're going to check for and I feel
an input with the name of title and then
we want to set the message that this
will say if this is if this you know
doesn't validate correctly and we want
to say title is required and then we
want to set the rule which is going to
be not empty
okay so we're saying that the title
field can't be empty and if you want to
look at all the different types of
validation you go to the documentation
you can make sure that something is an
array or is an integer you can even what
the hell is this called chain you can
chain different validations as well you
can also create custom sanitizers and
custom validations as well so there's a
lot you can do with this but we're going
to keep it very basic so we just want to
add this rule for all three
so title author and body all right so
those are all required now what we need
to do is we need to get the errors if
there are any and for that we're going
to set a variable called errors and
we're going to set it to request dot
validation errors all right and then we
want to check to see if there are any so
we'll say if errors and then we also
want to have an else now if there are
errors all we want to do is rerender the
template so the add article template
right here so we'll say res dot render
okay and this is going to be add article
and then we want to pass along the
errors that we get from here so we'll
say errors and set that to the errors
variable now as it is if we look at
where we actually load the page here
we're passing in a title called add
article now this is a necessary you
could just as well put the text add
article inside the template but I'm just
going to keep it but we need to make
sure we add it here as well or it'll
just be blank okay and then let's see if
everything goes okay then we just want
to do what we've been doing so we're
going to grab all of this
and cut it and put it inside of the
elves all right and then we'll save and
then if we go back here and reload and
we submit it doesn't let us which is
what we want but we also want to have
messages telling us what's wrong so for
that we're going to go to the layout and
let's go right here and first thing we
want to do is we want to check to see if
there is if there are errors so let's
say if errors then we want to loop
through them so we're going to say each
error I n errors okay and then for each
one we're going to have a div and it's
going to have a class of alert and alert
danger okay we can hard code this class
because an error is always going to be
read so we want the alert danger class
and then we simply want to output the
error and this is actually an object we
want the MSG value which will be the
actual message so let's go ahead and
save and reload actually let's just
resubmit and now you can see we have an
error for each field if I fill in the
title and submit it it just says author
and body is required all right and just
to test it out let's just say article
one two three
submit and there we go okay so let's go
ahead and delete these okay so now we
have validation now the last thing I
want to do is I want to clean up our
code a little bit and put all of our
article routes into a separate file so
what we'll do is create a new folder and
we're going to call it routes and in
here we're going to create a file called
articles j/s alright now we need to
bring in the Express router there's no
separate module that we need to install
or anything it's included by default so
let's say Express equals require
Eyre Express and then we're going to
create a variable called router and set
that to the Express dot router ok now
let's go to our app J s and we're going
to get all the routes except for the
home route okay because we're going to
keep that separate anything that has
article slash is going to go in this
file so let's start here go all the way
down to here and we're going to cut it
and let's go into back into our articles
J s and paste all that in now when we're
using the router we actually need to
call router get or dot post and so on so
let's change all of these to router dot
instead of app dot because it doesn't
know what app is in this case in this
file ok and also since we're doing this
we're going to set anything that goes
slash articles slash something I want to
refer to this page so in our app j s
we're going to first bring in the wrote
file so let's say let's articles equals
and then we want to point to that file
ok so we want to go see dot slash routes
slash articles and then we can simply
say app dot use and we'll say for
anything that goes to slash articles is
going to go to that file
ok so save that and go back over here
and now since that's going to go article
slash and then anything in here we want
to get rid of the slash articles here
alright and there's also an issue
because some of these have article and
some have articles so all of these
routes will have to change two articles
any links that are pointing to any of
these we're going to add an S to
if there isn't one but for now let's
just get rid of all the slash articles
okay because like I said everything's
rerouted to this file alright so we'll
save that and actually one more thing we
need to do is make sure that we can
access the router from outside so to do
that we say module dot exports equals
rather so let's go ahead and save that
oh one more thing we need to bring in
the model because when we're using the
model for instance right here it doesn't
know what article is so just like we did
an app J s if we go up here we're going
to grab this alright and we'll just say
bring in article model now the rut this
needs to be different because we're now
in a routes folder so we need to go out
of the routes folder into models so
we'll do dot dot slash that'll bring us
out save and now we shouldn't have to
touch any any of this pretty sure let's
just double check yeah it should be good
all right so let's go back and reload
and we're getting an error see it's
actually Rada dot use requires
middleware function by God
what router slash index J s cars
middleware let's see I guess we're not
done with that file conser outer equals
expressed dot or oh this has to be a
capital R
huh
that's strange
hello
what's going on here module dot exports
equals router C let articles equals
routes slash articles oh we need to
require this alright so hopefully that
works there we go now if we click on one
of these we're going to get an error
because it's looking for article
singular slash ID and we need to change
that to an F so these links we need to
change so if we go to index plug let's
just add an S right here and then go
back and reload and if we click on that
now it's correct if I click on edit
we're still going to we're going to get
an error because again it's not adding
the s so let's go to the article dot
plug layout art view and then add an S
right here save it and now it should
work good now for delete we're actually
making the request from H from jQuery so
we want to go to public J s main J s and
right here where it says article / ID we
just want to add an S on to that alright
and then we should be able to delete all
right now if we click on add art oh oh
you know what I know what this is I had
this issue before so if we go to our
articles jsr routes file what's
happening is we do slash article slash
add it's actually looking at this route
here because this is a placeholder so
it's looking at it like this is this or
I'm sorry ad is the PID so what we can
do is just move this down to the bottom
so that all of these routes get called
first all right so let's go away down
here and paste that in down at the
bottom all right so now if we go back
and we click on add article now that
route work
all right so let me just do another test
here just make sure everything's okay
all right let's try to edit just a test
one submit okay that works and delete
and there we go so everything is
functioning so we're going to go ahead
and stop here guys now we have messages
we have form validation so we're going
to start I'm going to start to look at
ways to implement authentication will
most likely use passport with a local
strategy but yeah so thanks for watching
guys if you're not subscribed please do
so and I will see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
