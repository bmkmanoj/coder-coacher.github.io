series now for you guys to watch the
mean stack front to back series don't
worry I'm eventually going to get back
to that I know we still need to deploy
it and we're going to do some other
stuff as well but I wanted to do another
project in the mean time so we're going
to get into working with firebase which
is an absolutely awesome platform and
application infrastructure to work with
it's a no SQL database with
authentication file storage testing and
a whole bunch of other stuff so what I
want to do is create an angular 2
application and use the angular fire to
module to work with the firebase API
okay so what we'll be building is a
property listings application where we
can create property listings with a
couple of fields we'll be able to create
read update and delete these listings
and we're also going to use
authentication through firebase and
we're going to use Google with firebase
you can use email and password Google
Facebook Twitter and a bunch of other
methods
okay so Google is is one of the easier
ones to implement so we're going to
start with that and then we might add
more along the way all right now I know
some of you are probably hating that
we're using angular again in this series
I did have some people complain about
the mean stack series because they
wanted me to use view j/s but then it
really wouldn't be the mean stack but I
do promise you that the next series will
use something else on the client side
and then for you beginners that think
this is a little too much for you I do
have a lower level courses planned as
well in fact I did decide to break down
my PHP crash course into a long series
so that we can do more than just one
hour of content and we can really dive
in and really look at the language all
right so I do have a lot more in store I
do have a lot of requests to get to so
just try and hang on and be a little
patient and I will get to the
technologies that you're looking for all
right so before we get started I just
want to mention that I did set up a
patreon account and you guys can now
support the channel directly and if you
can do $1 a month or anything like that
every little bit helps I really love
having the freedom to pick
choose the technologies that I teach and
I really want to do this full time but
unfortunately YouTube doesn't pay enough
unless you have millions upon millions
of views so you can also look into my
edge wanax courses just make sure that
if you do purchase a course that use the
affiliate link from the traverse
comedian website and of course you can
you can do one-time donations through
PayPal as well alright so let's take a
look at some of the features and what's
included in this series so we're going
to get angular 2 setup using angular CLI
will use the CLI to generate components
and services okay so to interact with
firebase we're going to use be using the
angular fire to module which makes
things a lot easier this gives us the
power to use firebase angular and
reactive extension observables
okay so I'll show you how to get
everything set up from within the
firebase console we're going to set up
the database the no SQL database
basically stores data in JSON format
we'll have one database collection for
our listings and we'll be interacting
with it through the angular fire module
alright so firebase also lets us
implement different kinds of
authentication you don't have to use it
your data is protected by default but if
you wanted to you could turn it off and
you could have it so you don't have to
do any kind of validation now you can
use Google Facebook Twitter etc we're
going to start off with Google and users
will have to they'll have to log in
through there go with their Google email
or whatever whatever you want to call it
Gmail password to be able to use the
site and be able to view with things and
also to be able to add listings all
right and you'll actually be able to go
into your firebase console and look at
all the users that have authenticated
with your app okay another thing that
we're going to be implementing is image
upload okay all this things will get an
image and we're going to upload these
images to firebase storage you can
actually store files and firebase as
well this is something that you can't
really find on YouTube and on the
in general as far as tutorials it took
me quite a while to figure all this help
actually had to spend hours reading the
documentation so I think you guys will
enjoy that so we're going to use the
angular flash messaging module which we
used in the mean stack series as well as
a form validation service okay so we use
that as well in fact a lot of the stuff
that you're going to see is stuff that
we did in the mean stack series because
again we're working with angular 2 but
this will give you some even more
knowledge on on how to set up an angular
2 application and how to work with other
services like firebase alright and then
we're going to compile it and we're
going to deploy it somewhere I'm not
really sure yet we're probably digital
ocean or Heroku or possibly at AWS but I
don't know we'll go look at that when
the time comes
alright so now what I want to do is just
jump in and take a look at the demo
application and what I have set up so
far alright guys so this is what I have
so far this is our angular 2 application
and I have it up on the dev server now
I'm trying to use a used boot swatch
which is a customized version of
bootstrap and I actually try to get it
to look like the firebase I like the
fire based application if you look at
that it's pretty similar color structure
so basically this is the home page and
it's just there's not much here just a
sign-in with Google button you also have
a login button up here and if we go
ahead and click that you'll get your
your Google Account username and
password and so on so I'm going to go
ahead and log in here okay so we'll
sign-in and I actually have a 2-step
verification so just give me a second
here all right you guys won't have that
issue unless you setup 2-step
verification with Google okay so now I'm
logged in and you can see that now we
have a listings and an ADD listing' link
up here so if I click on listings you'll
see that we have a couple with mansions
here that I have listed and if we click
on one of them we get the title the city
that it's in the owner the bedrooms the
the type whether it's in a
date or condo on our an apartment the
price of it and then we have an image
okay we can also edit it if we want to
and we can also delete it all right now
if we go to add a listing you have a
form and then you have an image upload
here so let's go ahead and just add a
listing I'll just say test listing and
say city will just say Santa Monica and
owner will say Will Smith bedrooms 13
bedrooms I don't know why but I've been
just adding mansions here with
celebrities so for the image I'm just
going to go ahead and choose a file I
have which is in my downloads and I want
this mansion 5 okay and then price will
say I don't know 14 million and submit
and now you can see test listing if we
click on that we get our listing here ok
so the application as far as
functionality is pretty simple just like
we did with the mean stack the the
actual function is pretty simple but
when you look into the code it really
teaches you a lot and it's very very
scalable ok so let's take a look at
firebase now this is the the console and
this is the database that I've been
using on the application I've been using
it's actually a lot more than just a
database but if we click on database
you'll see that we have a collection
here called listings and let's see
where's the one we just uploaded so they
have these keys there these IDs and this
is the one we just added you see Will
Smith and for the image that we have it
so path is one of the fields here so we
have paths as well as the image name and
if we look at storage we should have the
actual file going into this listings
image folder
okay so there's mansion 5 jpg right
there and we can manage these files from
here as well and then as far as
authentication
go there and let's see if we go to
sign-in method unknown error refresh
your browser
okay let's refresh so there's my my
account right here my email traversing
meteor at gmail gives us the signed-in
date the created date things like that
the provider which we only have Google
enabled if I go to sign and method
you'll see that Google is enabled and
you can also do email and password
Facebook Twitter github and anonymous
okay and there's other options as well
so firebase gives you kind of an
all-in-one infrastructure for your
application which is really cool alright
guys so that's what we'll be building in
this series I have no clue how many
videos it's going to be or how long it's
going to take I you know I usually like
to upload my videos on YouTube if it's a
series I like to upload them after I've
created all the videos but I'm doing it
different this time I'm just taking it
as it comes the last one worked out
really well and you guys seem to really
like it so I'm going to try to make it
you know an occuring thing alright and
as far as the next video I'll try to get
it out soon within a couple days or so
and I should be able to release at least
one every couple days okay I'm not going
to wait you know a week or two between
each videos so that's it hopefully you
guys enjoy it and if you're not
subscribed please make sure you
subscribe and that's it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
