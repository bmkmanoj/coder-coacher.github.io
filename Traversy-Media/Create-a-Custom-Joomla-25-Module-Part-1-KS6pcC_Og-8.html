showing you how to program a custom
joomla 2.5 module now i'm making this
video because i realized that there
isn't too much on the subject it's
really hard to find a good tutorial to
develop any kind of joomla components or
modules or even plug-ins so what i want
to show you how to do is build a module
that will grab all the featured articles
from it from the database and post them
in a module position and it will be able
to show the title as well as the intro
text and we're going to give it some
parameters so that you can choose for
instance how many words you want the
intro text to put out so yeah so the
first thing we're going to do is create
the stuff file and folder structure so
you want to create a new folder and
you're gonna call this mod featured
articles that's going to be the name of
the module and in that folder you want
to create a few files first of all we
want to create in index.html file
next we want a a mod featured a mod
featured articles dot XML file and this
is where I will put all the information
about the module next we want a mod well
we want a mod featured articles dot PHP
file which is the entry point of the
module and we want to help her helper
PHP file which you don't need if we were
making an extremely simple sample module
just to display some text or something
we wouldn't need the help her and we
wouldn't need to plus some of these
other files that we're going to create
but this is gonna be a pretty
intermediate tutorial so in the next
file is one that we don't need it's one
that I just like to have just extra
functions functions PHP you won't see
that in a lot in most modules but I just
like to have it just for certain
functions and then we want to create a
new folder and that's going to be the
template folder which will be TM PL and
in that folder we want to create a file
called default PHP we're only gonna have
one one layout for this module if you're
gonna have more we could add we could
add them here and we also just want to
add that index.html file
and these index.html files don't really
do anything as aside from not letting
people access that the directory because
when you access a folder on the internet
it looks for either index.html or
index.php if we didn't have this here
then they would be able to see the file
structure depending on what kind of
server you're running it on so that's
what those are and we actually show you
the content we put in there we just want
to have some tags
well I don't want to open it with a
browser I want to open it I'll just open
it with notepad plus plus and all we
need is just the HTML and body tags so
just save that and close all these up
and now going to the other index.html
file and put the same thing okay so now
what I usually would do next is create
the XML file so here what I'm going to
do is just copy and paste that the
content in and I'll explain it
and I'll try to go over at all so you
can I mean if you want to go along can
pause the video so we just have an XML
opener here and then we have this
extension tag and in this extension tag
it says what type of extension it is
which is a model I'm come on a module
and then the version of Joomla which is
2.5 and then we have this this is for
the site part it's not an admin model
mod module and then the method I put
upgrade you could put install here the
reason I put upgrade is that you if you
already have a version of this installed
and then say this is updated to version
1.1 you'll be able to just install it
right over the old version so I always
use upgrade here and then some just
simple meta information named author
creation date copyright license your
email authors the URL the version of the
actual module which for this one is 1.0
a description this is the description
that that comes up after you install it
and then we have the files tag which has
file name tags that include all that
every file and folder that you have in
this module which which shows us the
ones all the one that we just created
the main entry point is mod features
that featured articles dot PHP so you
just have to have this argument here I'm
just showing you that that's the entry
point
and then this config tag holds all out
fields in field sets so you want to have
this fields tagged with the name params
and then the field set is basic for the
next few parameters and what this is is
when you go into module manager and you
click on a module all the options that
show on the right-hand side that's what
these are going to be we have one for
the count for the for the number of
featured articles we want to show okay
it's a type of text so it's just a text
box next we have a show text parameter
and this is just going to be a boolean
it's gonna be either 1 or 0 no or yes
it's just going to tell us it lets us
tell them if the intro text will be
shown or not so if it's that no then
it's just going to show the title no
intro text the next one we have is a
word limit this is just how many words
will display for the intro text the
default is 25 and that's just a type of
text as well she'll read more another
boolean parameter that'll tell it if we
want to show a link that says read more
or if we want to just leave the title as
the link and then we have a new field
set of advanced which will be below the
basic and all we have here is the module
class suffix and this is just you can
add a class that'll be tagged on to to
the modules code and then you could
style it separately and then you close
up the fields and field set and that
should that should do that should work
for us so I'm going to save that
now
the next thing I want to do is open the
entry point file mod featured articles
dot PHP so here I'm actually gonna copy
I'm gonna copy the code and paste it in
so here we have some opening comments
just the name of the module and the file
this is GNU GPL license it's all
open-source feel free to use it and we
have this line here this je exact line
hi and what this does is it makes it so
people can't access the file directly
they have to go through through the
Joomla site and pretty much all files in
Joomla have this next what we're doing
is including the helpers
we're actually including from the
components folder of the Joomla site and
the content helpers in the route because
what this is actually doing is grabbing
the featured articles through the comp
the content component which is called
com content so it's including that that
helpers in the row and here's the params
this is where we grab the params I just
showed you if we go back to the XML file
you'll see we have this command called
arc count which is the number of
articles to show in that actually that's
not here this pretext should be here
actually
so show text if we go to the XML we have
this show text and the name is what's
important here because that's what
you're going to use here because we can
actually get it through this params get
show text just like this params get word
limit we get in from right here and what
we're doing is we're just putting those
into single variables here so we can
reuse these next we're including that
functions PHP file that we created and
then we're including that helper dot PHP
file which is where all our data base a
lot database logic will go down and then
we have this rows we're assigning this
function this get rose from the helper
we're signing that to a variable called
rose okay so the Rose will hold all the
featured article info and then we're
requiring this is where we define our
layout by default we're gonna have it
have show the default which is this
default dot PHP file so we're basically
including it here so that's the the gist
of this of the entry point file
so I don't want the video to get too
long so I'm actually going to continue
this in the next part so try to get this
done in two or three videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
