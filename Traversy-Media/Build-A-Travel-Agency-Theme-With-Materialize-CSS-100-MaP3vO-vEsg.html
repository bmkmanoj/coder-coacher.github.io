give a huge shout-out to our sponsor
male tag male tag is a free Chrome
browser extension that allows you to
track your emails in real time schedule
your emails to be sent later and
automate your email follow-ups and the
best part is it's completely free be
sure to check out male tag in the chrome
store the link is also in the
description below hey what's going on
guys so in this video we're actually
gonna be creating a full travel base
theme for like a travel agency or
something like that
using the materialized CSS framework now
a lot of you know that I have a course
on udemy on materialized where we build
five different projects and this is
actually one of those projects but we're
gonna be using the newer released 1.0
let me just go to the home page here
1.00 beta in the course we use see I
believe it was zero point one hundred
point seven or something like that
and most of the the class names and
stuff like that are all the same what's
different and what is awesome about this
version is that you no longer need to
depend on jQuery you can actually use
vanilla JavaScript to initialize your
plugins so you can use the carousel the
side nav the modal's all this stuff
without jQuery of course you can still
use it if you want but you don't have to
and that's I've been waiting for that
for a long time for these these UI
libraries to drop the the dependency on
jQuery and hopefully bootstrap and and
some other frameworks follow suit so
we're going to be building this without
jQuery and we're using quite a few
plugins we have the carousel at the top
we have the the net the side nav so if I
were to make this small we have the nav
that comes out we have autocomplete so
if I start to search for Aruba I have
some predefined options or predefined
locations that will pop up we're also
using the material box so if I click on
one of these images it opens up a nice
lightbox and then we're also using
scroll spy which if I click on one of
these links it'll just smoothly bring us
down to that
area all right so that's what we'll be
building guys hopefully you enjoy this
and even if you did take the udemy
course I would suggest going through in
giving it a shot with the newer virgin
and I will be updating that course in
the future I just have a couple other
things I need to do before I get to that
all right so let's go ahead and get
started
all right so this is a single page theme
so all you really need is one index.html
file okay and we're gonna be using CD
ends as far as including materialised so
this is really all we need now to get
started to get our boilerplate I'm not
going to use Emmett what I'm gonna do is
go to the materialise website and you
want to from the home page just click on
get started and if we go down to here
HTML setup there's kind of a little
boilerplate and this includes the
materialise icons library which we're
gonna use for some icons we're also
gonna use font Austin because the
materialise icons they don't have these
social icons that I want to use these so
we're also going to include and font
awesome so let's make sure you just copy
that and then we'll go to our index
index HTML and paste that in now as it
is it shows that we're using a local
version of materialized CSS and j/s I
don't want to do that I want to use the
CDN so again we're going to just go to
the materialise get started page go to
the top and grab the CSS link which is
this here and I think it's great that
this doesn't actually include jQuery we
don't need it and we're gonna paste this
we're gonna just replace the local
version here with the CDN and same thing
with the JavaScript so we'll grab that
and we'll replace this
all right now the last thing we want to
bring in is font awesome so I'm just
gonna go to font awesome calm get
started and we're gonna grab the script
tag so we'll grab that and let's just
put that right below both of these links
and now we should be all set okay we can
put a title in here and let's say travel
vill alright so I'm gonna save that now
you saw that it changed up a little bit
it just formatted it because I'm using
the prettier extension for v/s code I'm
also using the live server extension so
if you want that it's it's right here so
you can you can install that if you want
and what that'll do is it'll open an
HTML page on your localhost and it'll
also include live reload so for any
static website or anything like that I
would definitely suggest using using
this if you're using vs code Adam also
has a nice one I think it's called Adam
live server so if I want to open this up
I can just simply just do open with live
server and it should just open right up
alright and we obviously don't have any
markup in the body yet so let's go ahead
and let's actually snap this over real
quick and go like that ok we can close
the sidebar because we're only basically
working in one file so let's start off
with if we look at the the theme here
let's start off from from top to bottom
okay so we have the navbar then we have
the carousel the search this area with
the icons the popular places the social
icons the photo gallery the contact area
and the footer those are the main
sections that we'll be working on all
right so let's start off with the navbar
so I'm going to go over into the body
all right we're gonna do the markup
first and then we'll add in the GM sorry
that's the jig the JavaScript stuff
afterwards okay or as we go as we once
we complete the slider will add the drop
JavaScript for that and so on so let's
put in here a div with the class of
navbar fixed and the reason I'm doing
that is because I want the navbar to
stay at the top even when we scroll down
and if you want that to happen to
materialise you need to wrap it in this
class in a div with this class and then
we'll go ahead and put the nav in now
I'm gonna give the navbar class of teal
okay and materialise we can add these
color classes if I save that I don't
know if yep it does show up so you can
see it shows up I could call this blue
and it'll change to blue and so on so
inside here we're gonna put a container
because I want everything pushed into
the middle and I spelt that wrong and
inside the container we're gonna need a
div with the class of nav - wrapper
okay just standard nav nav bar markup
now for the logo let's put an a tag here
we'll give it a class of brand - logo
it's just gonna go nowhere and for the
text we're gonna say travel bill all
right and if you're familiar with
materialized if you took my course
you're gonna notice that pretty much all
the CSS classes are the same there are a
couple differences in classes and
attributes and I'll point those out I
think the only thing that's different as
far as the class names and this is the
the hamburger menu class which is this
here the side nav and it has it a
different attribute as well so let's add
that it's going to be an a tag and it's
going to have a class of side nav -
trigger okay so that's actually new to
this version and then used to have a
data activates attribute now it has a
data target
okay like bootstrap and we're gonna
target let's say mobile - nav that can
be anything you want it just has to
match the ID of the the list when we
create it alright so inside the a tag
we're gonna have an icon we're gonna use
the material icons library so we want an
eye tag here with the class of material
- icons and the way that this library
works is you put the actual icon name
inside of the tag like that so we want
to use the menu icon alright so if we
save this it's gonna look like that
alright and the default is that when it
hits
I think medium is that medium or is that
large I don't know when it hits this
point here it turns basically turns
responsive as far as the menu goes and
this isn't gonna work we haven't added
any links yet but even when we do it's
not going to work until we initialize it
in the JavaScript so let's continue to
create our menu items so we'll go right
under let's see where we go and under
the a tag here and we're gonna put a ul
it's gonna have a class of right because
I want it to go on the right-hand side
and we're also gonna say hide - on -
medium or meed
- and - down okay so it's gonna hide
this menu when that when the screen is
medium or lower because then we want
that hamburger menu to kick in alright
so we're gonna add those classes then
we'll put our links so let's say this is
going to go to hash home and and here
we'll say home
all right and then I'm just gonna grab
that so we'll also have let's see we
have one two three four more and we'll
change this one here to search all right
and see this one is gonna be popular
places so we'll change this to hash
popular and then this one here will be
the gallery oops
ah and then this one here will be
contact alright so we'll save that now
since it's medium and down its you'll
see it's not showing up if I go a little
bigger then they'll show up on the side
there alright so that that's responsive
now we're gonna basically have a
separate menu for the mobile version
okay when we click this and it shows the
side menu it's gonna I mean we could
have the same thing which is what we're
going to do but you could also have it
be different items so since it's going
to be the same let's see we're gonna
just copy the whole UL and where we want
to go is outside of the nav we actually
want to go outside of this entire div
here the nav bar fixed which ends right
here we want to go outside of all of
that paste that in and we're going to
just add a class we're going to get rid
of these classes and add a class of side
nav okay and then we need an ID of
whatever we put right here which is
mobile nav whatever we put for the
target should be the ID because that's
what it's going to target all right and
we can leave all these because those are
gonna be the exact same now again if I
save you'll see that it's still not
working so what we need to do is
initialize it in our JavaScript so let's
go down to the bottom
and let's create a script tag and within
here we're gonna say side nav and to do
this we want to create a variable I'm
gonna call the call this side nav you
could call it anything and we'll set it
to document dot query selector and we
want to select the class of side nav ok
and then all we have to do is basically
use the materialized javascript library
by saying m dot and we're gonna use side
nav dot and knit
okay so we're initializing the side nav
and then we just pass in our variable
alright and it takes in the second
parameter of options but I'm not gonna
put any options I'm just gonna put an
empty object alright so if we save that
now hopefully it works so let's click it
and there we go alright awesome so let's
move on now to the carousel so what we
want to do is go under just go to the
bottom under the UL and I'm just gonna
put a comment in here let's say section
slider it's not actually the carousel
it's a slider there's actually two
different things let me see that I put a
that's what a comment up here as well
for the nav bar alright so for the
slider we're gonna put in a section if
you guys are familiar with how I build
interfaces and in websites I like to put
I like to put things in sections so
we're gonna give this a class of slider
okay and that's actually required if we
look at the documentation it's not the
carousel that we're using where is it
JavaScript it's not the carousel it's
under media so if you go to media we
have the material box and if we scroll
down you'll see the slider this is
actually what we're using so you can see
class slider and then we'll have a UL
with the class of slides and then a list
item with the image and the captions and
so on okay so let's go ahead
and do that actually to save some time
let's copy the whole UL here save us a
little time and then we'll go ahead and
change some stuff up now for the images
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna include a
zip file in the description with the the
images that I'm using and they're big
images so they're gonna take a lot of
time to load if this were a production
Apple website you probably wouldn't want
to use images that big or you'd want to
compress them or something like that but
I'm gonna grab those images now actually
so let me go to our project folder which
I put on my desktop and I'm just gonna
create a new folder called IMG and paste
those in okay so we have resort 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
dot jpg those are our slider images the
images that are going to be in the
gallery so if we go down here the
gallery images these are actually going
to come from
I believe unsplash which is an image an
image serving service or application
we're not gonna actually include these
in our local files but these ones we are
so let's go and just replace the source
here too let's say I am G slash resort 1
and then for the tagline you can choose
where you want this took the caption to
come from I'm going to keep this as
Center aligned and then for the h3 we're
gonna say take let's say should we do
caps yeah I will say take your dream
vacation and let's see another thing I
want to do is when when it's really
small I don't want the subtext to show
so we can actually add a class called
hide - on - small - only and then for
the slogan I'm just going to use Emmet
I'm going to use larom 20 and hit tab
and that will give us just 20 sample
words
and yeah that should be fine so that's
our first one second one is going to be
resort to so image slash resort to and
let's see we'll keep the left aligned as
well for the caption and let's change
this to we work with all budgets and
then again we're gonna grab this class
hide on small only for the subtext we'll
paste that in there and then for that
we'll just sail arm 20 tab okay and then
the final one is gonna be image slash
resort three will keep right aligned so
that basically all the captions are
coming in from different angles and for
this one let's see we're gonna say group
and individual getaways and again we'll
paste that class in here Orem 20 good
and then I'm just gonna get rid of the
last Ally because we only have three
slides all right so let's save that and
let's go back to our version and it's
not going to show up yet because just
like with the side nav this has to be
initialized in our JavaScript so let's
go down to the bottom here under the
side nav and we'll just say slider and
we're gonna create a variable called
slider set it to document dot query
selector and we're gonna select the
class of slider and then we're gonna do
m dot slide or dot and knit and this is
going to take in slider and then some
options all right now I'm gonna put some
options I want to set the indicators
which are the little dots I'm gonna set
that to fault so I don't want those to
show I'm gonna set the height to 500 I'm
gonna set the transition
- 500 speed of the transition and then
the interval - 6000 so 6 seconds this is
milliseconds so let's go ahead and save
that and that should kick in all right
oh you know what one thing I wanted to
do is change the h3 to 1 h2 because I
want the captions to be or the heading
to be a little bigger so let's change
these to h2s and then for the H fives I
think I put a little too much text so
let's see we'll go to like here yeah
we'll take we'll take this off let's see
are these all different yeah just just
take off 10 words or so I should add
alarm' 10 instead of 20 there we go all
right so that's our carousel that's all
set the next thing we're gonna do is the
search area so let's go right here and
let's say search or we'll say section
search and the section is gonna have an
ID of search and we're gonna give it a
couple classes now materialise has a
section class which kind of it adds like
margin and padding or no no I think it's
just padding so that we don't have to
add it ourselves and it's not all stuck
together we're also gonna add a section
oops we're gonna add a class of section
- search we're gonna add teal because we
want it to be teal but I want it to be a
little darker than the nav bar so we're
gonna add the class of darken - 1 and
we're gonna add the class of white -
text we're gonna add the class of center
to center align everything and then this
is going to be part of the scroll spy
it's going to be part of the navigation
so you want to make sure you add scroll
spy as well okay so quite a bit quite a
few classes and then one other thing
that I didn't do up top is for the
I'm actually gonna add I want that to be
part of the scroll spy that's where the
home should go so we're gonna add an ID
of home which should correlate with this
ok whatever we have here and then we
need to also add the class of scroll spy
okay and it's not gonna work yet because
scroll spy has to also be initialized
all right so let's go back down to the
search area and inside here I want to
container
to restrict everything and inside here
we'll use a little bit of the grid we'll
use a row and let's put a 12 column div
so call an s12 and here we'll put an h3
and we'll say search destinations and
we're gonna put a class of input - field
and let's see inside here we'll have an
input with the class we're gonna have a
few classes here it's gonna be white
because by default materialized forms
they don't really have like a background
they have just a kind of a line so I
want to add a background of white and
we're gonna make it great xed and let's
also add the autocomplete class so we
can add that later because it needs that
alright so we'll go ahead and hit tab
and the type will be 'text that's good
let's do it's gonna need an ID of
autocomplete - input we're gonna need
that for later and then let's also add a
placeholder
of just some hints so for instance Aruba
Cancun etc so let's save that and there
we go now one thing I just realized is
we do have some custom CSS I wanted to
make this bigger and give it some
padding and stuff so we are gonna create
a CSS file I didn't realize that so
let's create CSS folder whoops that's a
file let's delete that let's create a
folder called CSS and then inside here
we'll go ahead and just create a new
file and we'll call it main dot CSS all
right and then what we'll do is take
that section and we gave that section
search class so for this we're going to
add some padding and you may have some
issues if you don't use the important
flag here so we're going to go ahead and
do that we're also going to change the
font size we're gonna make it a little
bigger let's say 18 pixels and let's
also change the width to 90% of its
container and let's also set a border of
light gray so f4 3 times let's say 3
pixels solid
all right now we need to save that we
need to bring it into index.html so
we'll go to the top
let's go underneath both the other link
tags and we'll say link to CSS slash
main dot CSS and save let's see so I
messed something up here and that's
because instead of section search we
want the input that's in section search
save and there we go alright so the
autocomplete we're going to be adding
actually we can add that now so if we go
down to the script just like with all
the other plugins we need to initialize
it so let's go ahead and create a
variable let say autocomplete and we'll
say Const let's call this AC we want to
use query selector and we want to select
the class of autocomplete okay I
remember we added that and then we want
to just do m dot autocomplete we want to
initialize it so in it and we want to
pass in that variable AC we also want to
pass in some options all right now this
is where the data comes in what we
actually want to show is autocomplete so
we need to add a data object and then we
want just basically our key value pairs
it's just going to be our key so like
aruba and for the value we're just gonna
say no all right so we'll just go ahead
and copy this down a bunch of times
so after Rubel let's say can
Mexico then we want to do Hawaii Florida
all places I've never been California
let's see what else do we have Jamaica
and Europe all right that should be good
so let's save that and now it should
work because we already have the class
let's see we have our autocomplete class
on the input we also have the idea of
autocomplete input so let's go ahead and
type in a okay so we get that if we type
in a our whoops a our if we type in like
FL Florida good all right so that's our
search box next thing we want is the
area with the 3/3 icon boxes so let's go
underneath the search section put in a
comment here we'll say section icon
boxes so we'll have a section tag with
the class of section let's also give it
a class of section - icons we'll give it
a class of grey and give it a class of
lighting
let's do light and - 4 and let's do
Center alright and then we're gonna put
everything in a container we're gonna
use the grid here so we need a row and
then what we'll have is three different
columns so we're gonna say call let's do
s 12 so that they stack so it'll take
it'll take up the entire the entire
window when it's on a mobile screen but
on medium screens and up we want it to
be a four column div so we want to do m4
okay that's how the
the grid system works in materialise so
inside each column here we're gonna use
a card panel which is just it's like a
border with some shadow and some padding
and we want to have an icon so we're
gonna say I class material
- icons now I want these to be large so
we're going to use the class large we're
also going to use the class teal - text
can't remember these are font based
icons so we want that and then the
actual icon is going to be called room
okay and you can go to the material icon
site and you can see all the different
names for the icons if you want and
we're gonna put an h4 and we're gonna
say pick where and then under that we'll
have a paragraph with let's say lorem 10
tab so 10 words okay so if I save that
it should look like that okay and then
what I'll do is just copy the call div
and we want two more of these so one two
if I save that they're all going to be
the same we obviously don't want that we
want to change the second one to have an
icon of store and the h4 we're gonna
change that as well to travel shop okay
the last one here we're gonna change the
icon to this is a kind of a weird one
it's airplane mode active so airplane
mode underscore active and then for the
h4 we're gonna say fly cheap and let's
save and there we go so the icons
changed and the text change alright so
that's a pretty easy section next we're
gonna have our popular places
okay so let's say section whoops through
section dot so our classes here actually
this is going to have an ID as well so
ID will be popular and then as far as
classes we want section we want section
- popular and it's also part of scroll
spy alright so in here we're gonna use
we're gonna use a container and then the
grid so row and as far as columns it's
gonna be the same as what is what we did
above we did call s12 so they stack and
then we want m4 and then in each one
we're gonna have a card class okay and
then we're gonna have a card image class
now inside the card image we're gonna
put image we're actually going to use
the same images we used in the slide the
resorts so let's say image and give it a
source of IMG / resort one for the first
one and then underneath the image we're
gonna have a span and this is gonna have
a class of card - title okay this will
actually show over the image so let's
say Cancun - or comma sorry Mexico and
then we want to go outside of the card
image div so the card image div ends
right here we want to go outside of it
or under it and we want a class of card
- content okay and then in here let's
say lorem 10 tab actually let's do 15
all right and that should be the first
card there are bar the first place so
let's save it take a look and it should
look like that all right now we just
need two more of these so we're gonna
copy the whole column which ends right
here so we'll grab that so paste in one
two more if I save they're all going to
be the same we obviously want to change
the image so the second one will be
resort to third one upsets the third one
that'll be three second one will be
resort to let's see second one will be
the the Bahamas we can leave the
description that's fine the third one is
gonna be Nova Scotia I think that's how
we spell it Nova Scotia and let's save
and there we go one thing let's see one
thing I forgot is the heading the
popular place is heading so let's go
right above the first column that we did
here which is right here so still within
the row and let's put an H for with the
class of center okay and then we'll say
popular
places all right now I'm actually gonna
make the popular have a different color
than the places so let's put a span with
the class of teal text like that and
then we'll wrap will wrap the span
around the word popular and save and
there we go so it looks pretty good now
underneath this we're gonna have the
social media section or the follow
section so let's do that when it closes
the sidebar up so say section follow so
section this is going to have a class of
section section follow
let's do teal and we want to darken it
by two white text and Center okay and
we're gonna have a container which will
push everything to the middle we're
gonna have a row and it's just gonna be
a column it's just gonna be a strait s12
so full size column and we'll put an h4
here let's say follow travel Vil I'll
put a paragraph will just say follow us
on social media for special offers
alright and this is where we're going to
use font awesome so we're first just
gonna have the club the a tag with the
class of white dash text and we'll just
put in here I'm not going to put the
actual social media sites we'll just do
that and then inside the link let's put
an eye tag and we're using font awesome
here so it's gonna have a class of FA B
and we're using font awesome five by the
way
and then a class of FA - Facebook and
then also we want it bigger so we're
gonna give it MA - 4x which should make
it four times the size so let's save
that and see if that actually shows up
which it does good now I'm just going to
copy this the a tag with the icon we're
going to put in one two three more and
let's change these up a little bit so
the second one is going to be Twitter so
we'll change that icon and let's see
this next one will be LinkedIn next one
will be Google+ and then we're actually
gonna have one more we want Pinterest as
well
and yeah it should do it let's save all
right now those are awful close together
so let's see let's add to our CSS
remember we have these are wrapped in a
class of section follow so what I'll do
is say section - follow and actually
what we just want to include the icon
here so we'll say dot F a they all have
a class of FA - for X so we'll hook on
to that and let's add margin we'll say
five on the top and bottom ten on the
left and right and save and there we go
so now they're more spread apart okay so
that's the follow section so we're
almost there guys next thing is the
gallery and that's going to use the
material boxed plugin which is basically
just a lightbox so let's say section
gallery this is gonna have an ID of
gallery it's gonna be part of the
navigation of the scroll spy section
let's say section gallery and scroll spy
alright so this is gonna have a
container just like everything else and
it's also going to have a heading so
let's say h4 we'll give it a class of
center and let's put a span of teal text
just like we did with popular places and
this is gonna be photo and then we'll go
out of the span and we'll say gallery
alright and then underneath the h4 we
want to have our row okay we're gonna
use the grid here and we're gonna have
four three column divs so we're gonna
say call s 12 M 3 okay for three column
divs and then as far as the images go
they're gonna have a class of material
box okay and it's very important to use
that class we're also gonna have a class
of responsive
- IMG which is going to keep it within
its container so let's go ahead and -
tab that and then for the source let me
just paste this in actually so we're
gonna be using unsplash so source dot
unsplash.com we're gonna set the size to
a pretty big size because it's gonna
open up in a in a lightbox and then you
can also attach keywords to what you
want this image to be so I'm gonna put
beach on this one I want them all to be
to look like they're travel based right
so let's copy this div or not the div
yeah yes the div with the image and then
we're gonna put in three more so one two
three I'll go ahead and save and you can
see down here they're all the same image
which we don't want so I'm just going to
change up the keywords a little bit this
next one is gonna be travel and then
this next one I'm gonna change it to
nature and then this last one here we
can actually add more than one so I'm
gonna say beach comma travel and let's
save that and now you'll see that
they're all different images now we're
gonna have three rows of these okay so
I'm gonna grab the whole row here and
we're going to go right under it
I'll put I'll paste it once and then
I'll paste it again I'm gonna save it
just to format it with prettier and
let's go to the second row and change up
these these titles as well are these
tags so let's see we'll change
beach - let's say water
this one will change to building let's
see we'll change this one to trees and
this one we'll change it to crews all
right now we have a couple more we want
to change so this last row will say
let's actually just do beaches and let's
see this one will say traveling and this
one will say bridge and this last one
will say travel and boat so those should
all be different images they might take
a minute to load because they're coming
from a third party but you can see that
they're all loaded now if I click on one
we're not gonna it's not going to open
because we need to again initialize it
because it has to do with JavaScript so
let's go down to the bottom here and
let's see this is material boxed all
right now just a little hint if you go
to the website and you go to media
material box and they show you they they
show you this example if you use query
selector in this situation where we have
multiple material box classes it's only
going to work for the first one okay and
that that's that that's because of the
way that query selector works it doesn't
work like jQuery where it'll select
everything it'll just select the first
one what you want to do is use query
selector all instead so let's say Const
will call this MB document dot you want
query selector all in this case and then
we want to choose the class of material
boxed
okay then what we want to do is say m
dot material box not boxed dot in it and
we'll pass in the M B and then let's
just pass in some empty options okay so
let's try it out
if I click on one of these images all
right nothing's happening see what'd I
do wrong here hmm oh I know what I did
this shouldn't be camel case or Pasco
case just the first letter should be
capitalized let's try that and there we
go now if you do what the documentation
says and do query selector let me show
you if I click on any of these these
it's not working it's only gonna work
for the first one okay because it's only
looking at the first one so make sure if
you have more than one you use this
query selector all that almost got me
and I almost had to use jQuery until I
actually thought about it until I
thought about how query selector
actually works all right so let's move
on so under the photo gallery I believe
we have the contact area right yep so
we're going to do this area here
so we'll go ahead and let's just add in
a comment let's say section contact
we're gonna have section we're gonna
give it an ID it's part of our
navigation so it needs an ID of contact
we'll give it a class of section class
of section - contact and a class of
scroll spy alright so in here we're
going to add a container and in our
container we're gonna have a row and
we're gonna have a column we're gonna
say call s12 and then let's do on
medium-sized and bigger
make it a six column div okay so half
and half and on this side we're gonna
put a card panel so a class with card -
panel I'm gonna make it teal and I'm
gonna give it white - text and center it
okay I love the classes of materialise
they're very very straightforward and
then we're gonna have an email icon here
so let's do i dot material
- icons and it's called email okay and
then underneath that we're gonna put an
h5 and let's say contact us for booking
and then a paragraph with some dummy
text so I'm gonna just do lorem 20 all
right now underneath the div okay so
this div is the end of the the card
panel we're gonna put a UL with the
class of collection okay a collection is
like a list group in bootstrap
and we also want to put with header
because we wanted to have a header so
that's that's also a class okay and then
we'll have an Li this is gonna be the
header so it has a class of collection -
header and we're gonna put an h4 in here
and just say location alright then we'll
have another class and this is just
going to be a collection item just like
a list group item in bootstrap and we'll
just say travel Ville agency then we'll
have another collection item and this is
gonna be the address I'll just say five
five five Beach Road Suite 33 all right
one more so for this we'll say it's in
Miami Florida I don't know the zip code
we'll just put all fives and that should
do it for that side so let's save it
take a look okay so that's that's the
sixth column div now we want to do the
other six column div over here which
will be the form so we want to go under
the call which is right here so we'll
say call we want s12 and m6 and in here
we want to form but we're also gonna put
this in a card panel okay so card panel
let's say gray for the background and
let's also lighten it a little bit so
we'll say light and - three all right
and in here is where we want to put the
form we're gonna have an h5 that just
says please fill out this form and then
let's put our inputs so we'll have a div
with the class of input field and in
here we'll have an input and this is
going to have just a type of text and
let's also do a placeholder
so we'll say placeholder name all right
underneath that we'll put a label name
let's save it see what that looks like
all right good so there's our first
field actually maybe we don't need the
label
I had it actually let's put an ID in
here maybe that'll fix it hmm you know
what let's get rid of the label will
just keep the placeholder yeah that's
better
all right so let's add a couple more
fields so we'll copy this div and let's
do one two three more okay and we're
gonna change the second one to email
this one will be phone and then this one
will be message we'll say enter message
but this is going to be a text area so
I'm gonna change input type text to text
area all right and that needs an ending
tag and then underneath that we'll go
ahead and put our input our button so
it'll be an input we'll put a type of
submit value will just say submit and
let's give it a class of BTN and save
alright now that the message looks a
little weird because in materialized you
actually have to give you a text area a
class of materialized - text area for it
to look normal
there we go all right so that's our form
so the last thing we need to add as far
as the UI as far as anything is the
footer which is very very simple so
we'll go down here and let's say footer
okay so footer is gonna be an actual
footer tag we're gonna give it a class
of section let's give it a class of teal
I'm gonna darken it so darken - to white
text and center and our footer is just
going to be a paragraph and we're just
gonna actually give this a class of flow
text which makes it a little bigger also
makes it very responsive and we'll say
travel Ville 2018 we'll do a little
copyright symbol like that actually put
the 2018 on the other side and save and
there we go alright so that's it guys
let's go ahead and test out the
responsiveness so if I make it big looks
really good
just clear that out all right so you can
see that all the links are on the side
here
Oh scroll spy that's what we've that's
what I forgot to do shoot let's let's
fix that real quick or add that we just
need to initialize it so down
let's see down at the bottom here it's a
scroll spy
and we're just gonna create a variable
I'll call it SS document dots and this
is another one you want to use query
selector all scroll spy and then we just
want to call em dot
scroll spy dot and knit pass in the SS
variable and let's pass in an empty
object all right so let's try that now
so if I click on one of these now you
can see it just nicely slides to that
area awesome okay and to test out the
responsiveness so that's medium if we
make it really small see that's like
tablet size so I guess looks good side
bar works let's make it mobile size or
smartphone size and notice that the the
subtext now disappears and that's what I
wanted I didn't want too much text on a
small screen alright so you can see that
looks good okay everything stacked all
the cards that's fine photo gallery is
good if I open up the lightbox good
contact form alright so I think that
this is a pretty decent looking theme
now most of the the classes and stuff
like that are all the same in in this
version and the old version so if you're
interested in creating more projects
