application done basically the just the
UI we have materialized now we want to
bring in our data and then output that
so firefire store has some pretty good
documentation so if you go to firebase
google.com slash Doc's slash fire store
and over here on the side under cloud
fire store you have some good
documentation if we go to query data and
then get data this will show us how we
can get a document so basically we need
our collection in this case they have a
collection called cities and then
they're calling dot get and then what
that does is it returns a promise and we
we handle promises with dot then and
then a callback function inside there
and then we can do what we want with
that data all right so what we're gonna
do is go to our dashboard component
that's where we're gonna work first I'm
just gonna make that smaller and we want
to first of all go to our data object
right here and we want to create a value
called employees and we're gonna
initially set that to just an empty
array so this is the property that we
want to fill when we fetch our data now
under data which ends right here by the
way I'm using bracket colorizer which is
really handy you can tell exactly where
data ends because it's purple just like
where it starts but we're gonna put a
comma here and we're gonna say created
now when we use it this created method
this is going to run when the component
is created or when it's loaded
so it'll automatically run now when it
automatically runs or it's automatically
created we want to fetch the data from
our collection now remember how we have
our firebase and net if we look right
here and we're exporting firestore from
here so that's basically our database so
in dashboard right above the export
default we're going to bring that in and
we're going to bring it in as DB so
we'll say import DB from
fire base and knit actually should be
dot slash firebase and knit because we
put it inside the components folder if
it was outside here somewhere you'd have
to make sure you have the correct path
so now we have this DB object to work
with so in created we can say DB dot
collection and we want to work with our
employees collection which we created in
the first video and we can say dot get
and then dot get takes in it's gonna
return a promise so we want to do dot
then alright and then inside here we
want to put in a parameter of a query
snapshot okay so query snapshot we're
gonna use an arrow function here so
we're gonna go like that and then we
want to take that query snapshot and we
want to loop through we want to use dot
for each okay and then for each takes in
a callback function I'm gonna use an
arrow function here as well so I'm going
to just say doc and then set that to a
code block and then in here is where we
want to take our data okay I want to
create a variable called data and set
that equal to an object with all the
data that we get from the document
that's fetched from our fire store so
this will actually run right away so
before I do any of the data let's just
console dot log doc and see what we get
so if I save this and let this
componentry render we get this document
snapshot and that's not what we want
what we want is actually in the
prototype for this object and it's a
function called data ok this function
will give us the actual data so if we go
back up here and say console to this
console log dot dot data like that which
is a function or a method now you can
see it's actually getting each each
object so we can see the name the employ
all that stuff now if we want to get
just the ID the firebase ID we can get
that with dot dot ID so if I save that
and just go down here you'll see it
gives us each ID so we can get the
firebase ID like that but the rest of
the fields we need to do dot dot data so
just remember that and now we'll create
our data object down here so this
actually needs to be formatted with
quotes like this and then ID and we can
set that to doc dot ID remember that's
the firebase ID then we want our own
employee ID that we created so we'll set
that to doc dot data dot employee ID
okay and then we'll do the name so the
name again will be dot dot data dot name
and we want the department that'll be
dark dot data dot de PT and then we want
the position
all right so now we have our data object
now we want to push this on to this
employees property right here so all we
have to do is go under where we define
the data object and say this dot
employees don't push and we want to push
on the data okay
so we'll save that let's make sure we
get no errors or anything okay we're not
gonna see any anything in the UI yet but
it is in fact being pushed on to
employees so now we should have access
to it up here in the template so what
I'm gonna do to render this is use a
collection a materialized collection
which is like a fancy unordered list so
and you can actually do it with a
heading so I'm not going to use an h3
here what I'm going to do is put in a UL
with the class of collection and also
the class of width - header inside here
we'll put in an Li with the class of
collection item
I'm sorry collection header and we'll
say we'll put an h4 and we'll say
employees and then the next Li is where
we actually want to loop through and
output each each employee so we're gonna
put an li and we're going to use the V -
for directive and we're going to set
this to employee in employees okay
that's how we loop through if you're an
angular user this is similar to ng 4 so
we also need to include a unique key
when we do this or we'll get an error so
we're going to use V bind so you want to
be bind a key and we're going to set
that to the employee ID so employee
underscore ID or I'm sorry employee dot
ID we're going to use the firebase ID so
that's actually accessing this right
here the fire
be not the employee ID all right so now
that we have that let's just add a class
to this list item which is for
materialise called collection - item so
let's save that and let's why did I not
put on I didn't put in an ending li okay
so now this Li you can see there's three
empty L eyes generating and there's
three objects in our database so we just
want to go inside this Li and now put
what we want to put in here so let's say
employee dot name and now we're getting
each name and this error is still down
here but if I reload that should go away
all right so we have the names now I
also want to put the department right
here on the side actually I want to put
the ID and the department so I'm going
to go ahead and put in here a colon
before the name and then we'll put our
double curly braces and we'll say
employee dot employee underscore ID so
that gives us the ID and then before
that I'm gonna wrap I'm gonna create a
div with the class of chip which is a
materialized class which is kind of like
a label in bootstrap just gives it a
background and some padding and in here
we're gonna put in the employee dot DEP
tee and now you can see we get each
one's Department now right now these
aren't ordered I want these to be
ordered by a department it looks like
they are just because of the way that
that we did it
but they're not if we want to order them
by department we can go down to where we
did our get so right here where we did
dot get and then we did dot then right
before the dot get we can say dot
order look I'm gonna say dot order by
and then we can pass in here de PT and
save alright it looks the same but now
it'll definitely be ordered by
Department so there's some other stuff
we need to do here I want the little I
icon so we can click and we can go to
the view page
so in materialise we need to have a link
with the class of secondary content now
remember we're not using links we're not
using a tags we're using router link
tags so I'm going to go right at the
bottom here and we're gonna put in a
router link with a to attribute ok the
router link I'm also going to give a
class of secondary content ok and then
the two we're gonna set that actually
we're going to use a V bind so we're
gonna say V bind colon 2 equals and then
in here we're gonna put some curly
braces because we're not just going to a
link we actually need to include a
parameter which is the employee ID it
needs to know which employee to use in
the view component the view employee
component so we put name of the
component which is view - employee and
that name comes from the router if we
look right here view employee it also
needs this employee ID so in addition to
name we're gonna have params so put a
comma and then params let me just close
this up so params is gonna be another
object so we'll set that to another set
of curly braces and we want to say
employee underscore ID and set that to
employee dot employee underscore ID okay
which is coming from this right here
just like all the rest of these
properties so that should work now
inside the router link I want to put
that I icon so it'll be an eye with the
class of FA and also the class of FA -
ey e like that so let's save and now we
have our little icon let's click it and
it takes us to slash and then whatever
that idea is so Sarah has the the
employee ID of zero zero two if I click
that it brings us to zero zero two now
we haven't added any mark up we haven't
added a template here with that info
what we're gonna have to do is get this
from the I from the URL and then make
another fetch to fire store with that ID
to get that that employee info alright
so we're going to go ahead and do that
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
