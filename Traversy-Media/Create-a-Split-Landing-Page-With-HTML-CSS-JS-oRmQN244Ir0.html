a splint landing page from scratch using
just HTML CSS and a little bit of
JavaScript so the idea of this would be
for someone that is a designer or a pro
and a programmer and of course you can
substitute this with anything at all but
you may have different sections or pages
for each of these these categories so
this is a nice sleek way to give your
visitors the option to choose where they
want to go do they want design services
or programming services and you'll see
if I hover over the designer it's going
to extend and push the programmer part
over and make it darker and we can hover
hover over this button as well and this
would go to a specific part of the site
and then the same thing over here if we
go hover over programmer it'll push
designer over and we could go to that
part of the site alright and as far as
responsiveness it's pretty responsive if
I go down to a certain point you'll see
that the button and the heading will get
smaller you can tweak this this around
if you want when we get to about here it
starts to mash up a little bit but if
you hover over one of them it comes into
focus okay even on very very thin
screens and then for the height you'll
see that if I make this smaller I don't
want them to mash into each other so I
added a media query that when we get to
a certain point the button gets moved to
the bottom that way you can have it even
at this height and it'll still look good
alright and we're using some background
images from pixels com
and I will include the code pen and
that'll have a remote link to the images
another thing we're going to do is we're
going to use the native CSS variables or
CSS custom properties which I did a
tutorial on about a week ago but I
haven't created a project yet using them
so we will implement those in this
project so you can easily change for
instance the background colors you can
change the width for instance this is
75% in the programming is 25% but you
can change that up easily with the
variables all right so that's what we'll
be building guys hopefully you enjoy
this and you can use this on your own
website if you want it's open source and
let's get started hey guys if you've
been watching my videos for a while and
you really like what I do when I've
helped you out a lot
consider becoming a patron even for one
dollar per month it pushes me to keep
bringing you guys the best content I
possibly can
there's reward tiers for discounts for
you to me courses personal support and
more so check out the patreon link in
the description below for more info all
right so we're gonna get started here I
have vyas code open and what I've done
is I've created three files index.html
mange a s and style dot CSS and they're
all completely empty and then I have an
image folder an IMG folder with the
designer dot JPEG and programmer dot
JPEG which isn't going to display it's
too large but I have those images and I
will include a remote link with the code
pen but if you want to download these
yourself what you can do is go to pixels
com so PE X Els dot-com and I just
search for programming and these are all
free to use images and I grab this first
one here and then for the other one I
search for design red and it's this
brush one right here and for both of
them I grab the nineteen twenty by
twelve eighty version alright so let's
start off with the HTML it's gonna be
very very simple so let's go ahead and
add our basic boilerplate with Emmet so
we'll do exclamation tab and that will
give us just our basic boilerplate here
and we'll add a title of let's say split
landing page and I'm gonna add in a link
to our style sheet
okay and let's go ahead and add a
container class this is going to be very
minimal and then we're gonna have two
classes with split so I'll go ahead and
say split times to tab with Emmet and
then this one will also have a class of
left and then this one will have a class
of right okay so each of these they're
gonna have an h1 this one will say the
designer and then let's do an a tag here
with the class of button it's just gonna
go to a hash and then for the text we'll
just say read more all right so now I'm
just going to copy the h1 and the link
and put that into this div and we'll
change the text here to the programmer
and we should be all set now we just
need to add in our script tag and it's
going to point to main dot J s all right
and that's it so we'll save that now I
am using live server which I have
running let me just stop it real quick
if you want to use live server and vyas
code you can go to the extensions icon
and just search for it here and it'll
come up and you can just click the green
install button and that'll set it up and
then you can simply right click and just
say open with live server okay so that's
what it's gonna look like for now so
let's uh let's see I would say let's do
the JavaScript next because it's pretty
easy all we need to do is remove and add
classes the hover left and hover right
classes from certain elements so we're
just going to create a couple variables
we're going to create one called left
and we're going to use document dot
query selector and we're gonna grab the
class of left
all right put that in a variable and
let's see we'll go ahead and just copy
that and then we're gonna have a couple
more here so this is going to be for the
right class of right call that right
this one's gonna be for the container so
it'll be dot container all right so
those are our variables from the Dom
we're gonna take left and we're gonna
add an event listener onto it
please don't use jQuery for this it's
this this is exactly what you should not
use jQuery for there's no reason for it
we're just gonna add an event listener
for mouse enter and we'll put a function
here I'm just going to use a callback
I'm sorry an arrow function and then
we're gonna take the container and we're
gonna say dot class list what we want to
do is add a class so classless dot add
and we're gonna put in here hover - left
that's the class we want to add so for
the left class which is this right here
okay this div right here when we mouse
enter it then we want to add the class
of hover left that's that's all this is
doing all right so let's let's go ahead
and copy this down and
let's add an event for Mouse leave so
we're going to actually now remove that
class so we can say class list dot
remove hover left and I'm going to just
copy that again and then this is gonna
be for on the right element for a mouse
enter and then we're gonna add the class
of hover rights okay and then we want
one more and this is gonna be for the
mouse leave so right mouse leave then we
want to remove hover right okay and
that's it that's all we need to do for
our JavaScript we can go ahead and save
this and we're done here so the
style.css this is this is where most of
our work is going to be done so like I
said we're using CSS variables also
called custom properties and I'm gonna
scope them all to the root element so
that we can use these variables anywhere
in any other element all right so first
thing we'll put is the container
background color and we're gonna set
that to hexadecimal 333 which is a very
dark grey and then let's do the left
- BG - color and for this we're going to
use an RGB alpha value and I want to
make this a red so it's going to be two
two three three nine three nine that's
the red green red green blue and then
for the opacity or the Alpha value we're
gonna do 0.7 okay so that's the left BG
color now let's do the left button -
hover - color and for that we'll do our
GBA and this is gonna be just like a
darker red so we'll do one six one 11
eleven and let's do 0.3 for the
transparency okay then we're going to do
our right bgcolor
so for that this is going to be a dark
gray almost black so it's gonna be 43
what whoops we need to do our GBA and
then 43 3 times and let's do for the
alpha 0.8 and you can experiment with
these colors if you want but if you want
it to match exactly what I'm doing then
use these so now we want the button
hover color for the right side so our
GBA and this is gonna be just a lighter
dark grey so it's gonna be 92 three
times and then for the opacity let's do
0.3 okay now we want the hover width
variable so I'm gonna set this to 75%
and then the other width is what I'm
calling it
I'm gonna set that to 25% and then the
last variable we want is the speed that
we want it to move and I'm gonna do 1000
milliseconds which is one second okay so
that's it for our variables now we're
gonna move on to the HTML and body so
for the for this we want to zero out the
padding and margin so margin zero and
let's do a font family of franklin
gothic medium let's see you'll do a
width of 100% and a height of 100
percent and then I'm gonna do an
overflow - X so we prevent any any
horizontal scrolling so we're gonna set
that to hidden
okay so after the hgm body let's do the
h1 so we're gonna set a font size here
and I tried to use all REM units if if
you don't really understand REM and M
units I have a tutorial on that I did
about a month ago or so you can search
for that if you're interested let's do
four REM basically one REM is equal to
whatever the pixels of the of the roots
HTML element which by default is 16
pixels so for REM would be 4 times 16
pixels okay
and I go more into that in that tutorial
so color is gonna be white and then
position is gonna be absolute and we're
gonna say from the left 50% and then
from the top 20% alright and if we look
at the finished product here what we're
talking about this h1 so we're saying
from the left 50% from the top 20% okay
so let's continue here and let's do
transform because we need the h1 to
actually move when we do our
transformation or our transition so
we'll set translate X we want it to move
along the x axis and we're going to do
negative 50% all right because when we
look and we hover over this see how the
h1 moves same thing with the button
we need that to move and not stay in
place and then I'm also gonna add in
white space of nowrap because when this
moves over when that moves over I don't
want the programmer to go on the next
line even if even if this gets too small
I want it to just stay on one line so
I'm adding the nowrap all right so
that's the h1 now let's do the button so
this has the most Styles out of all the
elements
we're gonna display it as a block level
element we're going to position it
absolute and as far as its position
we'll do left 50% just like the h1 and
then from the top are gonna do 40% ok
the h1 was 20% this one we want below so
we're going 40% from the top so for the
height of the actual button let's do 2.5
REM for the padding we're gonna actually
just do padding top and we're gonna set
that to 1.3 REM and then for the width
of the button I'm going to do 15 REM and
then let's align to the center and let's
make the color white and then we want to
add a border so the border will also be
white not 4f solid and I'm going to use
a REM unit here so we're gonna do 0.2
REM for the the width of the border
alright the font size we're gonna use
one REM so 16 pixels and let's make the
font-weight:bold and let's make it all
uppercase with text transform and let's
make sure there's no underline so we'll
say text-decoration:none and we also
want to add a transform on this which
will be translate X just like the h1 and
then here we're gonna say negative 50%
okay so that should be good alright so
the next thing we're gonna do
is the the button:hover so I'm going to
do button:hover actually there shouldn't
be a space there so button:hover and I'm
gonna set the background color now
remember we have a variable for this so
this is the first time we're going to
use a variable so we need to use the var
syntax and then just pass in the
variable we want which is going to be
left button hover color and if you're
using vyas code you'll get these nice
dropdowns and then the border color is
going to be the same thing so that'll
also be left button hover color actually
you know what this is going to be only
for the left part because yeah this is
going to be for the left so let's add
dot split dot left button hover alright
and then what I'm gonna do is just copy
this and let's do split right button
hover
alright remember we had that we have a
variable called right button hover color
as well all right so now let's do the
container so the container is actually
going to be positioned relative and I'm
not showing you it yet because it's just
it's gonna be nothing if we look at it
you can see there's nothing I mean the
words are there let me see if I can
highlight it they're just white yeah we
can't we can't see it yet so we'll get
back to it after we add some more stuff
let's set the container with to a
hundred percent and the height and for
the background remember we had a
variable for that so that'll be
container BG color alright so now if we
look at it now it should look like this
so far okay so let's see that's it for
the container now let's do the split
class so for the split we're gonna set
left to zero and this is where we're
gonna set our I'm sorry not left zero
this isn't that's not right
we want position
absolute and the width is going to be
50% for the split
okay member the right and the left clap
elements have the class split on it so
each one will be 50% wide and a hundred
percent high and then we're just going
to set the overflow to hidden we don't
want any kind of scroll bars or anything
like that
so that'll be hidden okay now we'll do
the split left so it'll be split dot
left and this is where we set left to
zero and we're gonna set our background
URL so background set that to a URL and
it's gonna be the design our image so
it's in the image folder slash designer
and then we want to Center the image X&amp;amp;Y
center and then no-repeat okay and then
for the background size we're gonna say
cover all right so let's see what that
gives us so now it's pushed over you can
see that it's split where's the I guess
it doesn't show the background image yet
or is that not loading
hmm why is that not loading oh I didn't
put that dot JPEG there we go okay so
that's that side now to add the the
overlay for the image because we don't
want just the image we want a color
overlay for that we're gonna use the
before pseudo-class and CSS so we're
gonna say dot split dot left and then
colon before alright and this can be
used to add content so first thing we're
gonna do is just position it absolute
we're gonna say content but it's going
to be empty we don't want to actually
insert any content here we want to set
the width and the height to a hundred
percent
just like the split left and we'll set
the background to the variable of left
bgcolor
all right so that'll be the overlay so
now you can see that the picture is
darker because we have the overlay of
the red alright so we're getting there
now we're gonna start to work on the
right side so let's do split dot right
just move this up for you guys alright
so split right and we're gonna set right
to zero and let's set our background URL
here as well
so say background URL and center center
no-repeat and for the URL it's gonna be
in our image folder slash programmer dot
jpg
all right and then we just want to do
background size and that should be cover
okay now just like we did with the split
left we need to have split right before
for our overlay so split right before
and we can actually just copy yeah we'll
grab this and let's set the background
color to right BG color all right so
let's take a look at that and there we
go now there's no effect yet or anything
like that but we do have our split-level
design so pretty cool now we want to add
the transition so we're gonna go down
here we're gonna add for split left
split dot left and also split dot right
also for the split dot right before and
split dot rights
I'm sorry split dot left before so this
is where we'll add a transition you know
transition so transition takes in the
speed and also if we want the way that
we want it to to move we're going to use
ease in out but the speed is actually in
a variable so we're gonna use that here
and then we're gonna say all and then
ease in out so basically you know start
off slow and then oops
and then end slow all right now this is
where we want to add our hover left and
hover right stuff now remember this is
an apply
until we do our Mouse enter and mouse
leave that's what we did in the
JavaScript file we're adding and
removing these classes so add the class
of hover - left and then on the Left
element so we want to set the width here
and we're going to use our hover width
variable okay and then for the right so
hover left and the right this is where
we want to use the other width variable
okay so when we hover over the left we
want the left to be the hover width
which is the the larger one the 75%
also when we hover on the left we want
the right side to be the other width
which will be the 25% all right so
hopefully that makes sense and then
we're gonna want the like the heading
and the button to fade a little bit so
we got a we got to go to the before so
hover - left and then we want the right
before
and we're gonna set the z-index to two
because we want that to come up front
all right and then let's do the right so
what I'm gonna do is actually just copy
all of this and then we'll go ahead and
just bring that down oops just clicked
outside and then this will be hover
right let's do hover right right and
then for the width let's see hover right
right we'll have the hover width which
will be the the large one and then let's
do hover right left which will be the
other width okay and then for hover
right and then we want to do left before
we'll have Z index of two all right so
what I'm gonna do is save this and let's
go over here now if I hover over it it
gets pushed over but this side does not
let's see why isn't that
that sides working perfectly but this
one's not so what did I screw up so
hover left left right before left before
all right well you know what let's look
in the JavaScript here so we enter the
left side
it adds hover left we leave the left
side it removes however left we enter Oh
most enter I spelled this wrong I forgot
an e here should be mouse enter all
right let's try that that should work
stupid mistake so that side works that
side works good
okay the button isn't hovering this one
is so that works but this one doesn't so
I must have a mistake somewhere else
let's go up to where the button is let's
see split left button hover left button
hover color
I'm sure you guys have seen you guys
probably notice that spelling mistake
earlier left button I recolor rgba okay
something's wrong here I put a dot
stupid mistake all right so now that
that hover works good so you see how the
when I went on this side the programmer
you see how it fades kind of the h1 and
the button and stuff that's what the Z
index is doing so right here if I were
to get rid of this and now that side you
can see it fades out but this side
doesn't so that's why we need that Z
index there in case you are wondering
about that but that's pretty much it
aside from our media queries everything
else it looks good so let's just add in
some very simple media queries for
responsiveness I want to do it for the
height in the width so let's do at media
and we're gonna say for a max width of
800 pixels so basically when it gets
down to 800 pixels or anything less than
that then for the h1 I want to reduce
the font size I think it's for R M but I
want to reduce it to 2 R M and then for
the button I want to set the width to
twice it's 15 by default I'm gonna set
it to 12 all right and then I'll add one
more media query for the minimum height
so when its height of 700 pixels or less
then we're gonna take the button and
we're gonna change the top property
which by default I think is 40% from the
top we're gonna set it to 70% which will
move it down
so let's save that and let's go ahead
and try it out
so reload everything works good let's go
ahead and make this smaller and when we
hit a certain point 800 pixels then the
heading and the button gets smaller okay
and then for the height if I were to
make this smaller wait a minute I think
I have it backwards yeah this should be
max height
all right so it should the button should
be close to the heading until it's on
it's very small and then it goes down to
the bottom good alright guys so that is
it so I bet this was a little easier
than you thought especially on the
JavaScript side all we need to do is add
and remove classes there's no need to
use jQuery for something like that so
I'm gonna put this in the code pen and
put the link in the description if you
guys want to take it and use it and
tweak it you can use different
background images feel free to put it as
the home page of your website if you
have you know more than one section
maybe you could even tweak it and add a
third section and have that kind of do
some cool effects whenever you guys take
my work and take my tutorials and modify
them and can create something new and
are add to them feel free to put a link
in the description I'm not in the
description in the comment section and
I'll always approve those links they
usually go right to spam but if it's
something that you worked on that has to
do that's relevant to my tutorial I'll
always approve those if you want to
share them with other people alright so

can go to help each other out for
programming issues as well as just a
place to discuss new ideas and get
feedback I also check in daily there's a
