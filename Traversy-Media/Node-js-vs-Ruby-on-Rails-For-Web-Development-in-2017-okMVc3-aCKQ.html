going to be doing a comparison of nodejs
versus Ruby on Rails for web development
now the main reason I do these types of
videos is because I'm constantly being
asked which language or which framework
is best to learn and I never give a
simple answer to that because they're
almost always isn't a simple clear-cut
answer so I think the next best thing is
to look at all the facts and statistics
and valid points on both sides and
that's what I kind of want to do in this
video so we're going to take a look at
some of the advantages and some of the
disadvantages of both no js' and Ruby on
Rails for server-side technologies so
before we begin I just want to make a
couple of points so I can already hear
the critics saying how are you going to
compare no js' which is a runtime to
Ruby on Rails which is a framework and I
get that argument but what I'm comparing
is the two server-side technologies and
web stacks
all right so looking at what's better to
learn right now also what's better to
implement for a business so I'm not I'm
not saying you know compare straight up
features of Ruby on Rails to no DJ s if
it makes you feel better replace nodejs
with something like Express or some
other node based framework even
something like meteor then you have two
frameworks which still isn't quite
apples to apples because Express is much
lighter and much more flexible and it's
in its structure so think of it more as
compared comparing back-end structures
and stacks not the individual technology
all right so hopefully I explained that
right so as far as what I base this on
I'm basing it on statistics on the
internet facts my experience and opinion
i've worked with both technologies and I
like both technologies I'm not promoting
one over the other all right it's also
important to understand that what works
for me may not work for you and vice
versa and remember that everyone's brain
is different there's no cookie cutter
answer for this question just like there
is there isn't with most technology
comparisons so I encourage interaction
and even arguments all that I ask is
that your
spectacle to one another and listen to
the other points of views all right a
lot of you guys asked how I got to where
I am today and how I know so many
different frameworks and you know
languages and so on
and I attribute to that a lot of that to
not picking one thing and saying it's
better than the rest I take the time to
learn about multiple languages and
frameworks and technologies and it gives
me kind of a good overview of everything
and really realizing that there are
certain tools for certain jobs okay
there's not there's not a clean-cut
answer for everything
all right so enough babble let's go
ahead and get started with looking at
some of the similarities between both
technologies all right so both no js'
and rails are there well respected and
popular server-side technologies that
can do many different things that can
work with many different stacks and
databases and so on both are fairly easy
to learn node uses javascript and rails
uses ruby but they're both of them Ruby
and JavaScript are easier to learn than
something like Java or C sharp or some
of those higher-level languages they're
both pretty forgiving languages and
there's a ton of resources for learning
both both perform really well and we'll
talk about the level of performance of
both of them in a little bit there's
many examples of popular websites that
use both technologies and I'll go over
some of those as well
both node and rails have very strong and
opinionated communities rails has been
around a little longer and has more old
timers but note is becoming more popular
every day now MVC or Model View
controller is a design pattern and Ruby
on Rails is hard MVC you have a folder
for your models your controllers and
your views MVC is possible with certain
frameworks in
nodes such as Express but Express is
much more flexible in its structure than
rails is you can just take certain
aspects of MVC it's not the only
structure possible all right and both
are used for rapid development and
prototyping rails has an awesome
a folding feature and Express as
generators and command-line tools as
well all right so first we're going to
take a look at the advantages of Ruby on
Rails and then the disadvantages and
then we'll look at nodejs
alright so like I said in the previous
slide rails has a very strong MVC
structure most rails applications are
going to look very similar in terms of
the core files and folders you know you
have that strong foundation and then you
build upon that with gems and custom
packages and libraries alright to add to
that rails is very opinionated meaning
that it makes you adhere to its way of
doing things
rails is going to assume that you're
going to write code in a certain way and
some people may say that's a little
restrictive but it also makes for easier
and much cleaner code and it also makes
it harder to to have errors and issues
all right it's not restricting in the
sense that you can't create what you
want but only the way that you're going
to get there and if you do it the right
way it'll most likely be the easiest
path possible all right with Express or
some other node frameworks you have a
ton of freedom as far as structure but
you also have enough rope to hang
yourself in some cases
all right rails has really good database
migration functionality they allow us to
do things like create and edit tables
and columns in our database without
having to manually go in and add and
change things it also gives you a nice
little log or a path that you can follow
to see exactly what's been done to the
structure of your database now with node
there are some packages or modules for
migrations such as DB migrate which can
work really well but it's not as
in-depth and easy-to-use as the rails
chord migration system when it comes to
prototyping and rapid development
there's not too many technologies out
there that can beat rails so some basic
configuration and a couple scaffolding
commands and you have yourself a full
functioning crud application and again
database migrations add to that speed
nodejs and Express is fairly good with
fast development if you use third-party
tools and
modules but rails has all that stuff
right out of the box all right now there
are some pros and cons to the Ruby
language but for the most part it's well
respected it's very clean a lot of it
actually looks like plain English and
that was the intention of UK hero mutt
Matsumoto I think it is I don't know if
I pronounced that right but he was the
creator of the language it's a
multi-paradigm language you can do
procedural code functional but for the
most part its object-oriented all right
everything can be looked at as an object
all right rubygems is a package manager
for Ruby on Rails and it's it's used to
extend the core functionality of the
framework it's similar to NPM for nodejs
which we'll talk about a little bit all
rails applications have a gem file where
you can specify your gems and then you
can run a bundler command to install all
of them similar to NPM install with
node.js alright so another great thing
about Ruby on Rails is that it's been
around for a while and it has a very
respected and intelligent community the
developers that maintain Ruby on Rails
are extremely smart and very passionate
about the framework there's a ton of
resources on the core framework
including forums blog posts and
documentation to help you out if you get
stuck all right however I do often hear
complaints about lack of documentation
for for a lot of the gems and the real
advanced programming alright
so those are the advantages of Ruby on
Rails let's talk about some of the
disadvantages so one of the biggest
complaints that I hear about Ruby on
Rails is that it's relatively slow
nodejs and Express is really fast but
it's also really light rails is a big
framework with a lot of features in its
core so it makes sense that it doesn't
perform you know as well as some of the
lighter frameworks you also have to
factor in the gem and file dependencies
of an application now when I say that
rails is too simple what I mean is that
when a new developer decides to learn
rails and they set up a new application
there's so much automation and
scaffolding that the developer doesn't
really learn very much about you know
about the Ruby language about the syntax
or the structure of their application so
for someone that really understands how
Rails works this is great because it's
it's rapid development but for someone
just learning they really have to go the
extra mile to really understand certain
things Rails is also way more difficult
for big projects than small applications
and it can have some issues with scaling
as well so another disadvantage is that
rails is not as popular as nodejs at
least at this time note is on the
cutting edge of web development and the
excitement for Rails has really settled
at least in my own opinion if you are
looking for a job I would definitely say
learn node and and probably Express more
companies are hiring JavaScript
developers than any other language if
this was five years ago rails would be
or Ruby would be one of my top three
languages to learn but these days it's
just not as popular so I briefly
mentioned earlier that the core rails
framework has some really good
documentation and examples learning
simple scaffolding commands and database
migrations that's all fine however when
you're trying to learn more advanced
programming and you're trying to learn
about specific gems sometimes it feels
like looking for a Newton uh needle in a
haystack
I've experienced this myself and I've
also heard other developers complain
about it as well alright so some pretty
big names have used or do use Ruby on
Rails in their platform I don't think
you can get much bigger than Twitter
although they have moved a lot of their
back-end services to Scala and Java due
to some scaling issues but they get used
rails for a long time and I'm pretty
sure they still use it in other aspects
of their platform Shopify which is a
huge e-commerce solution they use rails
back-end services Basecamp which is a
project management solution they have
said that rails is the heart and soul of
the Basecamp project
all right the software that runs github
was built on Rails in Erlang Blumberg
which is a news and political empire
they use Ruby on Rails they actually had
a recent
job opening for rails position let's see
SoundCloud Hulu which is a popular
streaming service was built on Rails
from the beginning Groupon and
LivingSocial SlideShare urban dictionary
these are all huge names that have used
rails and they're in there in the
structure of their platforms at least at
one point all right so now that we
looked at rails let's start to look at
nodejs
so we'll start with the advantages and
one huge plus two no js' is that it's
extremely popular it's it's you know
basically the new cutting edge
technology and web development there's a
very high market demand it's extremely
popular in startups at least for the
moment I know things are always changing
there's a flourishing open-source
community around node and the Express
framework with you know many well
developed modules on NPM when it comes
to speed and performance node knox rails
right out of the water actually it
pretty much knocks anything out of the
water it runs on the Google v8
JavaScript engine which is lightning
fast note is used to build real-time web
applications that almost feel like
desktop applications so nodejs is also
asynchronous which means that when a
program sends a request to the server it
doesn't have to wait for the reply it
can continue to execute it runs on one
single thread as opposed to other
languages that send the request they
wait till that request is done then they
send the next one and so on now there's
a there's a downside to that which I'll
get to soon so note is also very
scalable and being on a single thread
plays a big part in that
something like apache has to have to
handle a pool of requests to a set of
threads which gives it much more
overhead and it slows things down node
also works really well with no SQL
databases like MongoDB which are much
more scalable than traditional
relational databases like MySQL all
right almost all big companies that I
read about that have shifted to no js'
they've reported at least at least a
decent rise in productivity all right
another great advantage to note is that
it use
javascript which is widely used with
many web stacks the language on the
front end is different from the back end
and that's not the case when using
node.js we're using JavaScript on the
front and back end there's a ton of
client-side frameworks that are
dominating the industry react angular
view j/s so that's a huge plus to no js'
all right now and obviously javascript
works well with jason api's which are
very popular all right so no js' and
let's say Express or happy Jas any of
these frameworks they have a really
flexible file structure and they let you
construct your applications however the
hell you want you could Jam everything
into a single app j/s file if you wanted
to or you could have more of a
traditional MVC structure
I think there's both good and bad sides
to this but for the most part if you
know what you're doing and you're a good
programmer then flexibility is a good
thing all right so like rubygems node
also has its own package manager called
NPM or node package manager the the
biggest difference between NPM and ruby
gems or even pip which is the python
package manager is the way that
dependencies are managed with ruby and
pip dependencies are installed globally
so we have to use the bundler and you
have to kind of manage them on your own
when NPM actually takes care of all that
for you your modules you know they get
put into the node modules folder and
then those those modules can also have
their own node modules folder with their
own dependencies and NPM modules also
seem to have better documentation at
least in my experience all right so we
looked at the positives the pros and
advantages of node.js now let's take a
look at some of the disadvantages now as
good as note is for many crud style
applications it absolutely sucks for
applications that are CPU intensive the
reason for this is that whenever it does
something that takes a while such as a
CPU operation it'll queue all the
incoming requests because it runs on a
single thread something like apache
which has more available threads
it'll divvy up that that CPU time
between them
and only IO operations are parallel
because they're executed asynchronously
all right an example of a CPU intensive
task is something like 3d rendering
video encoding scientific modeling
sorting things like that all right
another complaint with note is that it
can be a little inconsistent some feel
that the API keeps changing at frequent
intervals and it's it's sometimes not
very backward compatible not only that
but the structure of an Express
application in general is very free and
flexible and it can sometimes you know
like I said before it can give
developers enough enough rope to hang
themselves rails is very strict which
means that it's harder to write bad code
so node and Express our new technologies
or new or I shouldn't say new but
they're newer than rails and there's not
as many developers working with them as
you know that have as many years under
their belts like you would find a
through V on Rails developers but on the
other hand since node uses JavaScript
most developers learn it really fast
because they already know the core
language okay from working with
JavaScript elsewhere so since node is
asynchronous you're going to be dealing
with a lot of callback functions and
they can often bubble up and get into
what's called callback hell now there
are solutions to this such as async
utilities and using promises and there's
a few things that you can do to prevent
this this personally doesn't bother me
but I know that some developers that
aren't used to asynchronous programming
have a problem with you know a lot of
callbacks
all right so frameworks like Express and
happy Jas they're very light which of
course can be a plus but this also means
that any extra functionality needs to
come from third-party modules for
instance templating you have all kinds
of options with node and expressive bug
ejs handlebars but you need to install
them separately unlike rails which of
course you can use you know third-party
template engines but it does have
embedded Ruby by default expresses and
as full-featured is Ruby on Rails which
it makes it hard to compare just Express
to Ruby on Rails which is why I called
this nodejs
versus Rails alright so some big names
that have used nodejs linkedin which is
right up there with Twitter and Facebook
they actually switch from Ruby on Rails
to node.js quite some time ago and they
switched mostly for scaling reasons
because node happens to scale better in
in most situations
all right most of eBay's front-end stack
is built on node paypal widely uses
nodejs yahoo as far as I know Klout
equalist and Storify all use Express
they all use node with the Express
framework Shutterstock ancestry.com some
pretty big names alright so as you can
see both of these back-end options have
their their you know pros and cons but
they're both fantastic technologies and
you guys know that I hate saying one
thing is better than another overall but
if I had to choose I would go with
nodejs
and something like Express over Ruby on
Rails in most situations node stacks are
more popular they're highly scalable and
they perform much better these are
points that really can't be argued with
the evidence that that we've seen all
right but again everything should always
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
rather than just saying one is better
than the other in all situations alright
guys so that about wraps it up thank you
