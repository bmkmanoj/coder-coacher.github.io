real-time application real-time polling
application but it doesn't save any
votes okay you can vote and if someone
has if someone else has the screen open
they'll see that or that response using
pusher but it's not really a great
application because it doesn't save or
persist the data so what we're gonna do
is create a database now instead of
deploying a local MongoDB database I'm
gonna use M lab which is a great service
that gives you a free MongoDB database
obviously if you have to scale it to
production then you'll have to pay but
what we're doing is free so no credit
card needed just sign up for M lab if
any of you guys are no js' developers
I'm sure you already have an account but
we're gonna create a new database and
you can choose different providers
different cloud providers I'm going to
choose the Amazon sandbox which is free
and click continue choose us East my
database name I'm gonna call pusher poll
and we're gonna say submit order ok
everything's free 0.5 gigs of data I
think
and once this turns green there we go
now this push up old database is active
so I'm going to click on it and we need
to create a user so I'm gonna click
users and add database user I'm just
gonna use Brad for my username and
password
alright so now up here you'll see the
the connection string when we want to
connect to this database yours will be
different and then that's it that's all
we have to do for now we don't have to
add collections that those will get
added automatically so we can go ahead
and just minimize that and then let's
implement Mongoose now we already
installed it in the beginning you can
see if we look in our dependencies
Mongoose is right here so I'm gonna
create a model alright mongoose uses
models and schemas so we're gonna create
a new folder called models
and we're gonna have a model called vote
J s okay and I gave that a capital
because my models I like to uppercase
alright now to create a model we're
gonna first bring in Mongoose so we're
gonna say require Mongoose we'll do the
connection in a minute and then we need
to create schema set that to Mongoose
dot schema and then we're gonna say
Const vote schema and let's set that to
a new schema okay this is gonna take in
an object of fields and we're only gonna
have an OS field which we give a type
and that's gonna be a string okay and
then let's say required let's set that
to true all right and then we'll put a
comma here and next we'll have points
which I'm gonna set to type string and
set the required to true okay the so
those are the only fields we need in our
schema now we're gonna do is go
underneath the vote schema and let's say
create collection and add schema so to
do that we'll create a variable called
vote set it to Mongoose dot model and
it's gonna take in the model name which
is going to be vote and in the schema
which will be vote schema all right then
we just want to export it so we'll say
module dot exports equals vote and
that's it that's our model so we'll save
now we need to connect to MongoDB so we
could put all the stuff in the app J s
but what I'm going to do is create a
config file so we'll create a new file
they're called config and let's call
this will just call it D bjs okay and in
here we're gonna bring in mongoose
so we'll say require Mongoose and then
we're going to say Mongoose dot connect
it's actually going to give us a promise
so no semicolon and then we want to put
in our connection string so this is
actually going to be in the EM lab let's
see is this it yeah so this right here
this is this string right here I'm going
to grab that and just put that in and
I'm going to change the user to the one
I use which was Brad and then use the
password I used which is also Brad okay
yours will be different and then the
promise we get we need to use dot then
and we're just gonna do a console dot
log and we'll just say MongoDB connected
okay and if there's an error we'll do
dot catch so that'll take an error if
there is one and then we'll just console
dot log that okay and that's it that's
all we need here actually one more thing
I think we still need to do this map
global promises because before I haven't
used Mongoose in maybe a month and a
half or so we we were getting an error
message or not an error but a warning
about promises and we had to do Mongoose
dot promise and then map it to global
dot promise so we just have to add that
and that should be an uppercase P
like that and we should be good we'll
just say Mongoose Connect and save so
prettier just map just kind of clean
that up for me and then we're gonna go
into our app J s and we need to bring in
we need to bring in that DB config file
so I'm gonna go right here
DB config so we just want to require dot
slash config and then DB just DB and
that should bring it in so let's save
and then down here notice it now says
MongoDB connected all right so we're
making good time here let's now go to
our routes pull J s file and from here
we're gonna bring in Mongoose okay we'll
bring in Mongoose and there's basically
two things we want to do one is get the
the the votes because we want to
initially display them here the other is
to actually add the vote to the database
when it's submitted so we're going to do
the ad first so what we'll do is when we
hit this this endpoint when we click
vote instead of just automatically just
triggering this to the client we need to
save it in the database so let's push
this down a little bit and I'm going to
create a variable called new vote I'm
gonna set it to an object and we want
the OS which we can get from request dot
body dot OS okay so if they choose
Windows Mac OS whatever and then points
we're gonna set that to one okay so this
is where it will set the number of
points whether we want it to be one or
ten or whatever and then what we'll have
to do to add
the database is say new vote okay
because we have a model called vote that
we brought in actually we did not bring
in we need to so let's put a pin in that
for a second and just go up here and
bring that model in so vote equals
require and that's gonna be in dot dot
slash models slash vote okay now we can
go down and we can say new votes and we
want to pass in that new vote variable
that object that I just created above
and we want to call dot Save and then
that gives us a promise back so we want
to do dot then okay and then inside this
promise it'll give us the vote that was
added to the database so what do we want
to do with this we want to then send out
the trigger and the return so I'm just
going to cut this from here and move it
into the promise okay or the promise
response so we're going to trigger OS
poll OS vote that's all the same except
instead of just putting a one here we
want to put the vote dot points okay
because it's basically give them giving
us an object with the points the OS the
ID so we want vote points but this is a
string okay it's going to be a string so
what I'm gonna do is wrap it in parse
int because what that does is it takes a
string and turns it to a number okay and
then for this one we're simply going to
say vote dot OS so what's going to
happen is when we hit vote the the
option is going to go into well first of
all the OS is going to go into this
object here it's going to get put into
new vote we're gonna then call new votes
because we have votes set up as a model
as a schema we can save the new vote and
then it'll give us a response from that
as a promise give us the data and then
we're gonna then do the push or dot
trigger
and we're gonna pass in that response
from the date from that promise the
points in the OS okay so hopefully that
makes sense so let's go ahead and save
that and then hopefully let's reload the
front end hopefully if we vote fir let's
say Windows it goes into our database so
let's try it out it's not going to stick
down here if I reload the page but it
should go into the database so let's
vote
so it shows down here which it was
before if I reload it's not going to
that's fine because we haven't added
that yet but let's take a look at the
database so we're gonna go to
collections reload and notice we had now
have a votes collection and if I look at
that we have a Windows vote alright so
it looks like that's working we can try
it again let's do Mac vote okay it shows
down here initially it's not gonna stick
though but it should be in the database
so now if we go back and I reload our
database there's the Mac alright so
that's all set now what we want to do is
make it so that when we initially come
to the page the votes we can grab the
votes and put them in the chart all
right so we're gonna make the request to
do that to this route here this get
route so we can get rid of this and then
this is actually going to be really
simple we can take the model vote and we
can call find okay so fine we'll do just
that it's going to give us a promise so
we'll do dot then we'll call this votes
okay there the whatever it's returning
we're calling votes and then we're
simply going to return let's say res dot
Jason and we'll send success true and
let's send votes as votes okay so the
response will get is just a success true
and then the array of votes will be
inside of votes so let's save this and
now our back end should be complete
let's go to our front so we'll go to
public main je s and let's see where we
want to do this now we want to stay out
of the form submit so we'll go right
below it here and let's make a fetch
request - HTTP localhost 3000 slash pol
now this is going to hit the get request
the one up here we did pull but we said
that it was the post request okay this
one will be the get which is what we
just created so let's pass in actually
we don't need to pass in anything we
just need to do our dot then and
remember first we have to take the
result turn it to Jason and then do
another then and that's when we get the
actual data alright so in here we'll say
data and now this data actually I'll
just log it you can see what it looks
like and make sure that it works so if
we save this and we reload the front-end
let's go up to right here and this is
what we're getting back from this right
here success true and then votes is an
array of the vote which has the ID the
points and the OS okay so let's let's
actually put it instead of having to do
data dot votes let's just put it into a
variable called votes so we'll say Const
votes equals data dot votes all right I
also want to get the total votes which
is really easy so total votes and we can
get that by just saying votes dot length
all right now what we want to do is
count the vote points for each one
and the reason we're doing this is
because we need to know what to put here
here how many Mac votes how many Linux
votes we need to know how to do that so
the the best way that I could find to do
this is to use the reduce high array
function all right so what I'm gonna do
is say Const vote counts and this isn't
to get the total votes this is to get
each one okay how many windows how many
Mac so we can say votes dot reduce oops
reduce just close this up all right now
this reduce is going to take in two
parameters an accumulator and the
current current value alright so inside
here let's put in we're gonna use an
arrow function so I'm going to say a cc
for the accumulator and then vote for
the current value and we're gonna use an
arrow function here and then this is
gonna be a little difficult I actually
had to kind of look I had to look on
Stack Overflow for a solution for this
because it was kind of confused me a
little but what we're gonna do is we're
going to take that accumulator and we're
gonna say vote dot OS OS and we want to
set that equal to another set of
parentheses and we're going to say that
accumulator and then again vote dot OS
and then we're gonna say or zero and
then we just want to add the points
okay whatever the points are so we'll
say plus vote dot points okay which we
get the points right here now points are
set to one if I just wanted to hate to
use one all the time I could just put a
one
here but I don't I want to be able to
change points to let's say ten if I want
and have them each worth 10 points so
that's why I'm using vote points now
this is going to be a string by default
so what I want to do is wrap it in parse
int which will change it to a number all
right so it should look like that and
then reduce is gonna take in a second
parameter of the accumulator like that
all right I think that's right we might
get an error but I think that's right
and I understand that this is a little
confusing so now we want to do is let's
say the data points all this stuff down
here it needs to go inside of the the
promised result here inside the dot then
because we need to use for instance vote
counts and if we use that here then it's
going to be undefined because it's out
of scope so we're gonna grab everything
from here down to down to the very end
and we're going to cut that and we're
going to put that right under the line
we just wrote and paste that in all
right let me just format that so now we
want to do instead of just having 0 for
each vote we want to actually take the
vote counts so we can now say vote
counts and we should be able to do dot
windows we should be able to do vote
counts dot Mac OS make sure it matches
the label vote counts dot Linux and
vote counts dot other okay and that
should work let's go ahead and save and
close this up
reload okay so we're getting an error
let's see what it is
ACC is not defined at fetch dot then see
we have an issue with this freaking line
here Oh actually you know what I think
we need to pass in an empty object yeah
let me just put this on one line because
this is multiple lines it's confusing me
so volt points we have the accumulator
and then that should and should actually
have another
what am I missing here
Oh there should be two parentheses there
we go alright so that should work let's
try that let's save and reload all right
so no there we go good so now it's
actually getting it from the database
we're getting the vote counts with this
reduce right here and then we're adding
the vote counts for each system as the
data point as the correct data point we
make this smaller again and the whole
reason I did this right here the total
votes equals the votes length is because
for the text or it see where it says Oh
s results I actually don't want it to
say that I wanted to show the votes so
I'm gonna put some back ticks in here
and just say total votes and then we can
simply put in a variable and we can put
in the total votes variable and let's
reload and we get total votes - all
right so let's go ahead and test it out
we'll open up a new tab and let's paste
that in there so let's vote for let's
say Mac vote and now we have two Mac
votes okay and if I reload it stays
because it's in the database all right
guys that's it all right so that didn't
take as long as I thought it would so
hopefully you learned a little something
from this application I will put the
code on github up with the link in the
description and I might add on to this
actually I might add maybe make it so
you can only vote once or maybe add some
login functionality maybe Google OAuth
or something like that and maybe do a
