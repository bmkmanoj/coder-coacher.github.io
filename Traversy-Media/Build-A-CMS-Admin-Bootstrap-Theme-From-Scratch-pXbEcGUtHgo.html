build a custom admin theme using
bootstrap okay so this would be
something that you'd have for CMS a
content management system to manage your
website pages and blog posts things like
that all right now of course this is
just the front end I guess it's the
front end of the back end it's just the
UI we're not going to have any
functionality we're not going to use a
back-end server side language or
anything we're just creating the UI
maybe somewhere down the road we can add
some back-end functionality to it but
for now it's just a UI video all right
to help people learn bootstrap mostly
beginners I just released a crash course
a beginner's crash course on bootstrap
and this is kind of a follow up to that
so we can take those skills and create
something with them all right and for
you back-end developers don't worry
we're going to get back to you no no js'
and other back-end programming languages
and step away from the UI for a little
while but I do want I just wanted to get
some beginner videos and some front-end
developer videos out there all right so
this is what we'll be building it's not
the best looking dashboard you've ever
seen but I think that it's a good
example for for beginners to get into
bootstrap so let's start at the top here
we have a navbar and there's going to be
four main parts to this theme we have
the dashboard pages posts and users okay
over here we have just a welcome message
and then a log out now if I click logout
it'll actually take us to a log in HTML
which is a basic login page that will
create alright and obviously there's no
back-end functionality but when we click
log in it just redirects us back to the
dashboard okay so under that we have
this heading area create content is a
drop-down where we can go to add page
add post add user which we'll get to
those pages in a minute then we have a
breadcrumb here then we have a we're
using the grid system for a sidebar and
then the main area on the sidebar we
just have another
a list group for the pages post users
and we just have we have some icons some
bootstrap glyphicon x' now when I build
front ends I and I use icons I like to
use font awesome but I didn't want to
use any extra library so we just stuck
with the bootstrap icons alright and
these are also also have some badges
here to tell us you know the number of
users and posts and so on and then here
we just have some progress bars for the
the hosting the disk space used in the
bandwidth used on this side we have an
overview with some wells for users pages
posts and visits
okay so we're using icons here as well
and just tells us the number of each
resource and then we just have the
latest users that have registered to the
site in the table with the name email
and joined date and then just a simple
footer so pretty simple let's click on
pages okay so this we just have
basically have a table here tells us the
title of the page whether it's published
or not okay we have using an icon here
edit and delete buttons and we have a
filter our search bar here as well and
like I said later on down the road we
may add some functionality to this and
be able to actually filter through and
all that stuff alright posts pretty much
the same thing except their posts and
then users same thing okay so those are
pretty similar pages let's see so create
content if I go to add page we're
actually using a modal for this I think
that it looks pretty nice and pop up
with the title notice that the body we
act we're actually using an editor here
WYSIWYG editor this is the CK editor and
it's really easy to implement and we're
just including a CDN and then just
adding a little bit of JavaScript
alright so we have a
professional-looking editor published
checkbox and then some meta tags and
description boxes
alright the form actually isn't going to
do anything if you submit it again it's
just the UI now I didn't add an add post
or add user because those are very
similar and I don't want this to take
too long so there are
I did cut some corners and you guys can
add that later on if you'd like I'm same
thing with the edit page if we go to
pages and click Edit it'll take us to a
page like this which basically has the
same the same UI as the modal the same
fields and stuff already filled in now
it's the same for any page that click I
didn't create a separate one for each
one it's all there all the about page
all right and if we go to posts and we
click Edit that's going to go to the
same page the Edit dot HTML and again
you guys can add that in later if you
want separate edit pages for each for
each resource alright so I believe
that's it yeah
so let's go ahead and get started what
we're going to do is create I'm just
going to create a folder on my desktop
and we're going to call this admin strap
underscore theme okay
and we're going to create our index.html
which is going to be the dashboard okay
and we need to grab bootstrap I'm just
going to download it download the
compiled files so there's a million ways
you can install bootstrap but I want to
do the easiest just for um you know
beginners hope that's not what I want
this is actually what the final the
final files will look like let's see
what though
alright see downloads where is it where
is it go oh it's downloading to my
desktop for some reason
alright so let's grab the bootstrap
files from the zip we just downloaded so
bring those over alright and let's open
up out I'm going to be using atom for my
editor okay I'm just going to add that
folder as a project see admin strap
theme alright let's open up index.html
okay let's go let's get started here now
rather than type everything out we're
going to do a little bit of copying and
pasting just to kind of move along so
what I'm going to do is go to get
bootstrap comm and then get started and
then let's click on examples and then
we're going to grab this starter
template right here which just has a
navbar and we'll do a control you to
look at the source and then I'm just
going to grab everything here copy it
and we're going to paste it in index
okay and we're just going to go through
and just get rid of things that we don't
need alright so we want this stuff the
doctype I'm going to get rid of let's
see let's get rid of this comment we'll
get rid of the description the icon I
don't need that stuff alright the title
let's change that to admin area I will
say admin area and then dashboard okay
now for linking the bootstrap CSS let's
see we don't need the dist it's going to
basically just be in a CSS folder
alright and then we can get rid of this
stuff I don't need the ie10 viewport
hacker all that stuff so let's get rid
of this okay I want this to be as simple
as possible alright so let's see the
navbar we're going to leave that let's
see we have a container here let's you
know what let's just get rid of this for
now just want the navbar and then for
the JavaScript
okay we're linking to jQuery here which
we want to keep we I don't want this
right here okay we're just going to use
that Google CDN for jQuery and then here
let's fix this path it's just going to
be j/s slash bootstrap minjae s and
we'll get rid of this as well okay so
really simple so let's go ahead and save
that and let's open up let's open that
up Chrome and there we go so now we have
a navbar alright now there's a couple
things we want to do here navbar fixed
top I don't want this class I don't want
it fixed to the top we're going to
change this project name to admin strap
okay and let's see for the links we have
the home let's change home to dashboard
and then we're going to change this to
index dot HTML okay we'll leave it
active and then this is going to be
pages which will go to pages
dot HTML this will be posts
and then we're just going to have users
okay and then on the other side we want
that welcome and that logout link so
what I'll do is copy this ul go right
under it paste that in and then we just
want to add the class navbar right okay
and then this will be that welcome so
it'll say welcome and obviously you can
put your own name get rid of the active
class okay and that's just that's just
going to go nowhere I mean you can make
an account page I guess or profile page
if you want and then this one is going
to be the log out and that's going to go
to login dot HTML okay and then we can
get rid of these all right so let's take
a look at that okay good
now this navbar is going to be smaller
than usual so we need to add some CSS so
we're going to create a custom style
sheet and while we're in here the CSS
folder let's get rid of some of this we
really don't need so let's see all we
need is bootstrap mndot CSS okay so
delete everything else and then we're
just going to create a style dot CSS
okay that'll be where we put all of our
custom styles in the j/s folder let's
also get rid of bootstrap Jas and NPM
Jas clean it up a little bit alright so
in the style let's first of all add the
body is going to have a really light
gray background so f4 three times now
for the navbar you can do this different
ways to you know to make it smaller what
I do is take navbar - nav and then we
want
let's see we're going to add a minimum
height of 33 pixels and we want to make
this important so it overrides anything
else all right and then we'll add a
margin bottom of zero and let's also get
rid of the radius we don't want rounded
corners so we're going to set that to
zero okay and then we want again navbar
nav and then we want in the LI and then
in the a tag and then also the nav bar
brand which is where the logo is okay we
want to set the padding here we're going
to set padding top to six pixels and
let's make that important okay that just
overrides anything else and then padding
bottom is going to be zero all right and
then let's set the height we'll set the
height to thirty three pixels all right
so let's take a look at that hope we
didn't link the stylesheet so let's go
ahead and put this make sure you put it
below the bootstrap so that it takes
priority
okay let's see oh you know what this
this should just be navbar there we go
okay so now it's smaller than the usual
navbar now as far as the colors we're
actually going to use a website that
will generate a color scheme for us so
this is the URL right here it's work dot
smart shell dot-com /t WBS color okay
and let's see we where do I go here I
forget select your colors oh you know
what
I'm not sure the exact colors I used it
actually was the default when I came
here last they must change this all
right I don't want purple so let me just
look real quick at what colors I was
using here all right so the default
background is this accident this right
here okay and the active background is
that okay that hexadecimal value right
there and let's see the hover I don't
want that to be purple so that's going
to be that right there choose okay so
that's good so what we'll do now is go
down and it gives you the sass or less
or whatever we just want the standard
CSS and we're just going to grab this
okay notice that it has the media query
as well for smaller screen sizes so
let's copy that and then we're going to
go and paste that right here media
queries I want to keep at the bottom so
all of our other CSS will go above it
and let's see what that looks like now
notice that it's a four navbar default
so let's save that and go back and we
have now for our inverse we're just
going to change that to default alright
so let's see hopefully that works and
there we go so now we have our reddish
orangey color now I want to be able to
apply this color to things like panels
and other other areas so we're going to
create a class okay we're going to
create a class called main color dash PG
okay and then we're going to put let's
see
this background color here and the
border color okay and let's just make
this important and then we also want to
just make the color white alright so now
we have that class that we can apply to
other elements as well okay so now that
the navbar is done let's go back and
we'll create the header so we're going
to use a header tag and I'm going to
give this an ID of header as well okay
and let's put in a container here
because we want everything pushed to the
middle okay excuse me now we're going to
use the grid system here so let's put a
row and in that row we're going to have
two columns I'm going to do call MD 10k
110 column and also call MD - all right
so in the ten column we're going to have
the the heading so that'll be an h1 and
let's say dashboard and I'm also going
to put some small tags for some subtext
so just say manage your site okay
so let's save that now I want to have an
icon here a dashboard icon so let's go
to get bootstrap and we'll go to
components and glyphicon x' and then I
want the gear which is right here it's
CEO G now when we want to use an eye
on we want to just put it in a span tag
like this so let's copy that and we're
going to put this make sure it's inside
the h1 and make sure there's a space
after it and then we're going to change
this to see og okay save that and there
we go so now we have our dashboard icon
now on the other side we're going to
have that create content drop-down so
let's go to get bootstrap and go to
dropdowns and we're going to grab this
right here save us some time and we're
going to paste that right in there
alright and let's change this text right
here to create content and let's see as
far as the links we're going to have add
page and post add user okay I can get
rid of these now
add page is going to be a modal and I'm
not going to do that just yet so we're
going to just leave it as is for now
let's go ahead and save that and check
it out okay so now we have our drop-down
and as far as the header that's that's
good for the mock-up now we're going to
have to style it a little bit so let's
go to style.css and let's let's put a
comment in here we'll just say Heather
should probably comment up here to the
navbar
here we'll just say custom okay so for
the header remember it has an ID of
header and we're going to give it a
background of 3 3 3 3 3 3 and that's it
I'm almost a black I really dark grey so
we need to make the color of the text
white ok let's give it a padding bottom
of 10 pixels and let's do margin bottom
let's do 15 now for the drop down let's
see where is it right here div class
drop down let's also add a class of
create and in here we're going to say
header create and we just want to move
that down a little so let's say padding
top 20 pixels
ok let's reload that and there we go ok
it looks pretty good so the next thing
we're going to do is the bread crumb
which is really easy we're going to go
under the header I'm going to use a
html5 section tag for this
we'll say I D bread crumb
and let's see so this is really easy
we're going to put our container and
it's going to actually be an au l and
ordered list tag with the class of bread
crumb and we're just going to have one
li here with the class of active and
it's going to say dashboard ok let's
save that
alright now I'm just going to add a
little bit of styling here basically
just a background so let's go to our
style okay you don't have to comment
everything but it is good practice
alright so bread crumb we're going to
give that a background of let's see see
see that's six alright and let's give it
a color of really dark gray okay and
then for the links oops
so bread crumb a the links we want that
same dark color alright let's take a
look at that and there we go so the
bread crumbs done now we're going to
move on to the main area so that's going
to be in a section as well I like to
break everything up into sections we're
going to give it an idea of main
okay and of course we need a container
and let's say we're going to use a grid
here as well so we need a row class okay
and we're going to have this is going to
be that the area with the boxes so
actually no it's not not yet this is
going to be the sidebar in the main
column so let's do div class which div
class and we'll say call MD three for
the sidebar and div class call MD what
do we want nine yeah nine okay and so
that'll be the main area so start with
the sidebar we're going to have a list
group so for a list group let's see
let's go to get bootstrap go to list
group and we don't want this one we want
we want the one with the links so we can
just copy this and paste that right in
there tab that over and let's say for
the active one and that's going to be
for the dashboard okay then we have
pages posts
and users get rid of that one and then
let's do the actual links this will be
index.html this will be pages posts not
HTML and users dot HTML all right let's
take a look at that and cry now
obviously we don't want this to be blue
that's pretty ugly that doesn't match so
what we're going to do is we're going to
add that custom class we created onto
this active alright so we want to say
main color BG and then reload and now it
matches okay now we also want to have
icons here and badges so let's put the
icons in I'm going to just grab let's
see where's that icon this span right
here copy that and go ahead and put this
right here it shows a space after it and
that's going to be the co G we can leave
that for pages let's paste that in and
we're going to change co g to let's see
what is it list
- alt alright font awesome has much
better icons but like I said I didn't
want to use an extra library for posts
let's paste that in and we're going to
use pencil for users we're going to use
I think it's just a user so let's take a
look at that okay so now we have our
icons now for the badges we're going to
put that after let's see after the text
dashboard doesn't get one so after pages
let's put in a span the class of badge
okay and let's say we have 12 pages
let's make sure that looks all right yep
so now we'll copy that span put one
after posts and we'll change that to 33
users I'm going to stay 203 and I don't
know where I got those numbers all right
so that is our side menu now under that
we're going to have our progress bars
for the disk space and bandwidth so
let's go directly under the list group
and this is going to be in a well okay
well is just that gray background with a
border and some padding now for the
progress bar let's go ahead and grab
that so progress bars we want the one
with the text inside of it so we're just
going to grab this
okay paste that right in there
alright now let's see so we will just
leave that at 60% so that's going to be
the disk space so let's put an H 4 right
above it and we'll say disk space used
alright and let's see we're going to
copy that progress we're going to put
another one right underneath let's put
an H form will say bandwidth used and
paste that in alright now this one I'm
going to actually change to 40% so let's
change that and change that and that ok
save it I'm just going to close that one
up
ok now by default it's blue and we don't
want that so what we're going to do is
go to our style and let's put a comment
and let's do dot progress bar okay let's
do background I'm going to make it that
black dot gray color and the text has to
be white
okay so our sidebar is now done so now
we can move on to the main column so we
want to be in this call md9 now we're
going to put every put the boxes in a
panel so let's go back to our
documentation and click on panels and we
want this right here okay with a heading
so we're going to grab this and go ahead
and paste that in okay so let's see what
that looks like
all right now for the panel I want the
heading to have this same color here
remember we have that class we can use
so we want to put that on the panel
heading that's going to be main color BG
and as simple as that changes the color
now that text should be white let's see
so let's see maybe we need to put an
important on here as well there we go
okay so in the panel let's first of all
change this title will say website
overview and we're going to have in the
body here we're going to have four three
column divs okay so let's say div class
call MD three and they're all going to
be pretty similar so I'm just going to
do this first one and then we'll copy it
say div class and it's going to be a
well all right now you want to put the
wet the div the well div inside of the
column you don't want to just add it to
this because then there'll be no space
in between okay you want that padding so
on this well let's also actually I don't
think we need to add any more classes
there let's put in our h2 and in this h2
we'll have the icon this is going to be
for users so let's see let's grab this
span right here this is the icon for the
user copy that and we're going to put
that right inside the h2 all right and
then let's see we're going to put the
number of users which is 203 and then
underneath the h2 we'll put an h4 and
just say users okay so then what we'll
do is just copy the call md3 and we'll
paste that in three more times okay so
if we take a look at that good now I'm
actually going to add a class to the
well because I want to Center it and
stuff so let's just say - - box ok we'll
add that to all of the wells okay and
then we're going to change the content
this is going to be for pages so pages
had the icon list alt and pages we have
I think twelve and then we just want to
change this text okay this next one will
be posts which have what did that have
pencil for the class for the icon 33
posts and then we'll change this text
okay and then we had visitors so
visitors had for the icon stats and for
visitors let's say twelve thousand three
hundred and thirty four okay we'll just
change that save it okay now I want to
Center this content so what we're going
to do is go to let's see I'm going to go
to our style sheet and we have a class
called - box and just going to text a
line text-align:center and there we go
so that takes care of that now the next
thing we're going to do is the users
down below the latest users which is
going to be a table and it's going to be
inside of a panel so let's grab that
panel code again and we want to make
sure we put this in the right place
which is going to be under the first
panel so that starts here and ends here
okay
and we should probably put a comment up
here let's put
just say website overview alright so
latest users let's paste in that panel
okay now in the body is where we're
going to put our table now I'm going to
paste the table in just to save some
time okay
so paste that in now table by default is
going to look pretty ugly so all we need
to do is add a couple classes to our
table tag we want a table we want table
striped and let's also do table hover
and there we go it's as easy as that so
our dashboard is pretty much complete
all we need to do is add the modal for
the add page all right now what we'll do
let's see let's go up to our where our
drop-down is which is right here and
what we want to do is on the a tag we're
going to put type equals button okay
we're going to we're going to get rid of
the a traffic completely and say data
toggle and set that to modal
okay and then data-target and that's
going to target the ID of the modal okay
which we're going to call ad page all
right now we need to create that the
modal content we're going to put that
down at the bottom okay it's not going
to show unless you actually click to
open the modal so let's put a comment
here for our modal's
and this one will be the add page modal
and like I said that's the only one I'm
going to do but if you guys want to do
the ad post and add users that's
absolutely fine so what I'm going to do
is go to get bootstrap and we're going
to have to go to the JavaScript section
and modal okay so we have let's see this
right here
what we're going to do is we don't need
this this is what we just did the data
toggle the data target we're going to
grab this and put that there now the ID
we need to change that to add page all
right and then let's just test it out so
we'll save it and it should open okay
good so now we just need to basically
edit the content all right so let's
let's go to the right here modal title
and we're going to change that to add
page all right and in the body you are
going to have a form now I want to save
some time so I'm going to pick I'm going
to paste this in now the form tags
basically the buttons down here in the
footer I want those to be inside of the
form tags so we're going to put the
first one right below modal
content right here and then the last one
is going to be right here okay that way
that the buttons are within the forum
and then in the body I'm going to paste
this in so I paste it in this right here
let's see that ends there yeah so from
here to here you want to just put that
in so basically we have a form group
label is that we have the page title
with an input we have the page body with
a text area a checkbox for published and
then our meta tags and meta description
alright so in the footer the Save
Changes we just want to change the type
of that to submit okay and that should
be good so let's save it and now we can
say add page now we have our form now
it's time to implement the editor the CK
editor which is actually really easy so
what we need to do is get the the link
for the CDN so let me just search for
that
so you've this is it yep
so this tells us how to implement it
we're going to grab this script tag and
we're going to put that in the head okay
I'm just going to add right here HTTP
colon okay and then all we have to do is
we're going to add a name attribute to
our text area where we want to implement
the editor okay which is going to be a
page body it's going to be right here oh
I already have it they already have that
okay so make sure you have that and then
all we have to do is add this script tag
with this one line of code
at the bottom okay we're going to put
that right there and that should be it
okay this is so easy to implement so
save it go back reload and let's go add
page and now we have an editor okay now
I also forgot to mention this is
completely responsive if we go down to
size of a mobile device which is
probably right there okay click on that
you can see we get the whole menu we
have our create content we click Add
page you can see the modal fits right in
there okay we have our list group the
progress bars overview and users oh one
thing we forgot was the footer which is
really simple so let's put that down at
the bottom here okay let's just give
that an ID of footer alright and then
inside the footer all we're going to
have is one second here all we're going
to have power graph and we're going to
say copyright admin strap then we're
going to put an % copy semicolon 2017
all right I actually want to put this
above the modal the modal should be at
the bottom so let's just cut that and
paste that here alright and then as far
as the styling that's going to be very
simple
we're going to have background dark gray
color white text-align:center
padding:30px I would say 90% of this of
this site now all we need to do is do
the pages post users and the login
alright so let's go ahead and add the
pages we need so new file pages dot HTML
post dot HTML
users log in and edit okay so let's go
back to our editor and let's open up
pages HTML and then what we're going to
do is copy everything that's in the
index and paste that in alright and then
let's go to the top and just kind of
start to change some stuff so admin area
will change this right here the title to
pages navbar all we want to change here
is the active class we're going to take
that off that list item and put it on
the pages okay
in the header we're going to change the
title right here will save pages and
then let's just say manage site pages ok
drop-down that's all going to stay the
same for the breadcrumb what we'll do is
change this active to pages but then we
also want to link to the dashboard above
it
okay just like that and then in the main
section we're going to have we're going
to leave the sidebar alright but let's
go down to here where we have the column
d9 and we're going to change the panel
title to pages and then let's clear out
everything that's in the panel body okay
so everything inside here okay latest
users we're going to get rid of that
whole section which ends right there
alright and let's save that and see what
that looks like so if we go to pages
good that's what it should look like so
in the pages we want first of all we
want the filter so I'm just going to
paste this in right in the pic panel
body we're going to just put a row and
then we're going to put a twelve column
div okay which goes all the way across
and then just an input for filter pages
and then under that we'll have our table
which I'm going to paste in okay this is
going to go directly below the row div
just straighten that out
okay so paste that in and let me just
highlight what I pasted it in so this
table class of table table striped table
hover we have our headings title
published created and then just an empty
one for the buttons okay so in our
columns we have the page title we have
whether it's published or not width
which is an icon okay which is either
going to be okay for a check or remove
for an X then we just have the date
create date and then our buttons we have
an edit button it's actually a link
that's formatted as a button button
default and then the delete button has
button danger which makes it red alright
and that should be it so let's save it
reload and let's put a line break below
the input so let's see right here we'll
put a line break okay so there's our
pages and notice that the edit button
goes to edit dot HTML the delete button
goes to nowhere okay because we're not
we don't have that functionality so the
posts and the users are pretty much the
same thing so we're going to copy what
we have in pages everything and then go
to posts paste that in and all we really
have to do is we'll change the title
we're going to change the active class
in the nav bar take it off that and put
it here okay we're going to change the
title that'll be posts I'll say manage
blog posts we're going to change the
breadcrumb just to say post right there
that's all the same let's see so for the
table what I'm going to do is just paste
in I'm going to overwrite this table
with the post table okay so I'll just
highlight
just highlight the table and I'm going
to paste that in and basically the same
thing I just changed up the titles okay
let's change this to filter posts and
that should be good so we'll save it and
now we go to posts okay we do have to
change this right here the panel heading
and that's good so now for the users
same same idea let's copy everything we
have in pages and go to users paste that
in okay I'm going to change the title
I'm going to remove the active class put
it on this one okay let's see the title
right here manage site users let's see
the breadcrumb
panel title okay we'll say filter users
and for the table I'm going to go ahead
and do the same thing pace that end so
we have the name the email the joined
and a blank for the buttons
okay the Edit it'll go edit dot HTML as
well save and go to users and good so we
have all these pages done the last
things we need to do is the login page
and then the edit page and we should be
all set so let's do the Edit first we're
going to go to our edit HTML and I'm
going to actually copy pages again it's
a good starting point alright so let's
see copy that and then go back to edit
paste that in okay let's just change
this title to edit page now as far as
the active class from the menu I'm just
going to remove it all okay we don't
want it at all then for this let's see
say edit page and for the small we could
have the name of the page which in this
case would be about okay now for the
breadcrumb say edit page for the active
and then we're also going to include
after the dashboard a link to go back to
pages
okay let's go down leave the sidebar
alone now in the main panel here let's
change the title to edit page and then
I'm going to get rid of everything in
the panel body so the table and the
filter input alright so we'll save that
and let's go to pages and then edit all
right now we're basically going to have
the same thing that's in the modal so
what we can do is go down to the modal
and let's grab we're not going to want
the modal header and all that so let's
grab everything in the modal body so the
form group the page title body all these
fields down to here okay and then we're
going to copy that
we'll go back to or we'll go back up and
let's just stick in form tags and then
we'll paste that in alright so save that
and then let's reload edit HTML and
there we go okay we're just going to
need a submit button so let's see go
right here input type equals submit give
it a class of BTN BTN default say submit
oops it's an input so it needs of value
I'll say add page or just submit
okay alright so there's our edit page
now we're going to want some values
because this is an edit so let's see in
the title let's say value equals about
page body inside the text area let's put
some sample content Adam has a plug-in
where we can just sale arm and tab and
that'll add in a bunch of sample content
alright published let's just put checked
and let's see for tags save value tag
one tag - and then description save
value and that will just copy some of
this paste that in alright so now all
the fields are filled in that's our edit
page last thing we want to do is our
login so let's see we're going to copy
I guess we'll copy pages again and then
go into login HTML okay
let's change up the title and let's go
ahead and change this will say admin
area account login okay now for the
navbar I do want the nav bar but we're
not going to have any links available so
get rid of both you ELLs okay and then
for the header we're just going to have
one column I'm going to get rid of this
whole column D - okay and I'm going to
change this to a twelve column we're not
going to have an icon we'll get rid of
this span and let's just say right here
admin area and we'll say account login
alright and then I just want this
centered so we'll give this h1 a class
of text Center okay we're not going to
need a breadcrumb get rid of that and
let's see we're not going to need we're
not going to need a sidebar so in the
main section we have this div class call
md3 let's get rid of that whole thing
and then inside this column d9 we're
going to change that to column D for all
right and then everything in there we
can get rid of oops
okay and we can also get rid of the
modal stuff all right so let's see what
that looks like
login HTML should look like that let's
put a space right here and then all we
need to do is put in our form inside the
column d4 so I'm actually going to paste
that in okay so form with the idea of
login action is index.html we're putting
it in a class of well we have a form
group with an email address a form group
of the password and a submit okay submit
button has a class of button block as
well so let's take a look at that all
right now we want this to be in the
middle so but we still want it to be
just a four column so what we can do is
set an offset okay so we want to move it
over four columns so we'll say call MD
offset four okay so now if we reload now
it's in the middle all right and then I
just want to push this down a little bit
so it had this form has an ID of login
so let's go ahead and just say login
margin-top 30 pixels and there we go so
now we have our login page okay so
that's it we created a an admin theme
for a CMS for a website back-end
