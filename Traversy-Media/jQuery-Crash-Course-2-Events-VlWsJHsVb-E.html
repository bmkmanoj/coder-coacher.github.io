cleared everything out I kept the UI so
we still have the header and the
container and all that so now we're
going to move on to events so I'm going
to go down into the container and I'm
going to put a heading and we're going
to first discuss most events all right
so let's create a button okay we'll say
button we'll give it an ID of BTN one
and that's it for now we'll say button
one all right and let's just let's
create another one as well create button
to that alright so let's go down to our
script tags and I want to add a click
event on button 1 so what we can do is
we're going to use our selector which we
learned about in the last part and we
know that it has an ID of button 1 so we
can use number sign BTN 1 and then we're
going to say dot click and then inside
this click we need to put in a self
calling function ok now and here is what
we want to happen when the button is
clicked so let's do alert and we'll just
say button clicked so let's save that
and reload if I click it we get button
clicked now before we move on there is
one thing I want to address and that is
that sometimes people they like to put
their JavaScript in the head okay I
prefer it down here in the body at the
end but if I were to move this up here
like that and we reload and I click
button 1 nothing happens the reason for
that is it's trying to grab button 1
before it actually loads on the page all
right so what we can do to prevent this
from not working is use document dot
ready which you've probably seen before
so what that is
is we're going to take our jQuery and
we're going to say the whole document
dot ready meaning so when it's ready
then we're going to run this function
okay and then what we want to do is just
take any of our jQuery and put it inside
that okay so what it's saying is don't
run any of this code until the documents
ready till it's loaded so now if we go
and reload and now I click button one it
works alright and even if you're going
to put your JavaScript and jQuery down
at the bottom it's still a good idea to
have this so I'm going to move it back
but I'm going to keep that document
ready okay I probably should have
mentioned that in the last part but
better late than never
okay so anyways button dot click we run
a function now behind the scenes this
actually runs what's called the on
method alright I'm just going to give an
example of that
so if we say BTN one dot on and then
that's going to take two parameters it's
going to take the event we want which is
click and then it'll take that function
okay so if I go ahead and grab that and
then let's comment this out and we
reload click it and it works in the same
way okay so you can use this dot on if
you want or you can use the shorthand
and just use the actual event alright
some people say that doing it this way
does save a couple milliseconds but it's
not really a big deal now a lot of times
you'll want to have an event that when
fired it does something to another
element on the page somewhere so what
I'm going to do is under the button here
let's put a paragraph and I'll just give
it a class of para one all right and I'm
just going to grab some text here this
is actually from the jQuery site and
what I want to do is when I click button
one let's save this first of all when
click button one I want this to
disappear to hide so from what we've
learned already probably know how to do
that so we'll take our event will say
button one on click and then what we can
do is grab power to and say dot hide ok
so now if we want to reload and that's
not working button one on click power -
oh it's power one ok and it makes it
hide and then what we could do is take
button 2 so if we take button to here
and say on click and then we'll change
hide here to show so now click that it
hides click that it shows all right now
in a lot of cases you might want to have
the same button be able to basically
toggle back and forth so for that we can
use the toggle method so I'm going to
change this right here comment that out
and we'll say power 1 dot toggle so now
if we reload and I click that and then
click it again
it's going to go back and forth alright
now let's talk about some of the other
events oK we've just covered click up to
this point so let's comment these out
and then we're going to take let's take
button 1 and we're going to say dot dbl
click for double click and then put our
function and let's just toggle paragraph
1 okay so now if I reload if I click
once nothing happens if we double click
then it toggles okay pretty simple
now the next one I want to look at is
hover so I'm going to copy that and
we're going to change this to hover okay
now if I go in it goes away if I leave
it comes back now what's interesting
about hover is it's not an actual event
this is just the shorthand but you'll
see if we were to use on just copy this
if we were just say button one dot on
hover and we'll do the toggle okay
let's comment these Oh okay so we have
on hover now when I enter it nothing
happens because it's not a real event
it's just a shorthand syntax for two
other events okay which is mouse enter
and mouse leave all right so you'll see
if I change this to Mouse enter it goes
away now when I leave it doesn't it has
to go enter again to toggle what hover
does is it combines that along with most
leaves so now if I go mouse
leave and reload go in goes away leave
comes back okay so that's what this
hover does the shorthand syntax takes
both of these and applies that
functionality
all right we also have mouse move which
is pretty cool so what I'm going to just
comment this out and we'll go ahead and
take that
and let's change this to Mouse move and
now if I go into the element and then I
start to move you'll see that it toggles
if I move once it comes back move again
goes away and it just kind of keeps
doing that and we're going to work with
that more later on
so let's comment that and then the next
two that I want to show you is Mouse up
and most down
so if we say button one on Mouse up hey
I'll just do that actually I'm sorry
let's - most down first okay so if I go
and I hold the mouse down it goes away
okay when I let go it doesn't come back
it's waiting for us to do most down
again but what we can do is combine that
with most up so if we go ahead and we
say Mouse up toggle now if I click down
it goes away and I release it comes back
okay down it goes away release comes
back so that's how mouse up and Mouse
down work so those are most events now I
want to show you that we can pass an
optional parameter for the event so for
instance let's let's take a click event
which I'll just grab up here copy that
okay so we have this button one click
and what we're going to do is pass in an
e parameter here and then let's do a
console dot log e to see what that gives
us okay make sure you have your console
open down here just click f12 and it
should open and then we'll reload and
I'll click this and now every time I
click it you can see we get this mouse
we get this event which has a ton of
stuff okay most of it is useless to us
at least but it gives you a bunch of
stuff so basically every event has its
own little database with a bunch of data
all right so
if we look at current target right here
we open that up it's going to give us
some information such as the class name
which it doesn't have one but if it did
we could access that we can access the
ID which is BTN one we can get the inner
HTML the inner text so there's a lot of
things we can get here so let's see it
let's examine the ID so we can say
console.log dot what is it current
target dot ID okay so we'll click that I
will save that and let's actually do an
alert instead of a console log so now
click it and we get an alert that says
BTN 1 ok so it gives us the ID if we
want to get the actual inner HTML we can
do that as well so we'll say e dot
current target dot inner HTML and then
I'm just going to comment that out and
it gives us button 1 ok let's copy that
and we can also get the outer HTML which
will basically include all the tags and
stuff ah let's see
undefined I put a uppercase ho and now
you can see we get the actual button tag
and all that stuff ok now if we wanted
to add a class let's say for our first
button here we'll say class equals BTN
class alright and down here change that
to BTN I'm sorry nup you want to change
it to class name
now if we click that we get button class
all right so there's a lot of things you
could do with being able to access all
the all these values so before we move
on to forum events I just want to show
you something pretty cool that we can do
with mousemove so let's grab this right
here this mouse move and we'll go down
here and let's pass in that E and then
we're going to say console dot log and
in here let's say chords and this will
be the Y chord which we can get let's
concatenate on e dot client Y alright
and then we're going to concatenate and
say X and that will be client or e e dot
client X and that should give us the
coordinates of that button when we mouse
move so you can see down on the console
it's changing as we move ok if you want
to not use the button we could actually
use the whole document reload and now
anywhere on the document it's going to
give us our position okay now if we want
to bring that into the browser we could
do that as well so if we put right here
we'll put h1 and we'll give it an ID of
let's give it an idea of chords and then
down here instead of console.log we'll
get that chords ID and we'll say dot
append
and then reload maybe we'll do append
actually adds it so it keeps adding to
the last one so let's do HTML which will
replace it so now as I move you can see
our exact mouse coordinates which is
pretty cool and this HTML we're going to
get into that in the dom manipulation
section so don't worry about that just
wanted to show you that we could in fact
do that and you can imagine this could
be good for very interactive
applications that use animation and
stuff like that so let's now move on to
form events okay so let's see we're
going to put in let's just put in a
horizontal rule and then we'll put in a
form and just to save some time I'm
going to paste in the inputs okay so we
have a label with name input ideas name
the name attribute we don't really need
but I just put it there anyway and then
we have the email and then we have a
gender which is a select box so let's
save that reload and we get our select
box all right I'm going to get rid of
that chords for now because it's kind of
distracting okay so now let's go down
here and we're going to comment out the
rest of this stuff for now and let's
look at the focus event okay now focus
is when you click into an input that's
setting off focus so let's take I will
just say input so all the inputs dot
focus and in here we'll pass in a
function and let's just to alert focus
okay so now if I reload and I click in
here we get an alert that says focus now
one common thing that I see a lot is
when you click enough a field it'll
change the color or add a border so that
you know that you're in that field so
we'll comment that out and then let's
say ID what do we have for IDs I think
we have name so say input ID name dot
CSS and in here we'll say background and
we'll set that to pink
all right let's save that and now if I
click in it you'll see it's pink now the
way we did this is not ideal because
even if I click an email that turns pink
and this is a perfect case for this okay
using the keyword this which means
whatever event whatever element you're
currently in so in this case whatever
input we're in so we can just remove
that and say this dot CSS okay so now if
I click in there click in there okay so
it'll it'll pertain to whatever one you
click in now notice that when we click
out it doesn't go back so we can handle
that very easily with the blur event
blur is the opposite of focus that's
when you click outside of the box all
right so let's copy this and we'll say
turn this to blur and then we'll change
background to the background of the of
the body which I believe is that
actually no we'll make it white so now
click in click out and you can see that
it's working correctly so that's an
example of focus and blur now we also
have a key up and key down event okay so
basically when you push a key in or when
you release it when it goes up so I am
going to actually we'll just keep that
that's fine but then we're going to add
another I'm going to say input and then
we're going to do dot key up and inside
here have a function and let's see we'll
do console dot log key up okay now if I
go and click and I start to type you'll
see that key up keeps logging down here
now what if we want to get the the
actual data that we're typing in we can
do that by passing in E and then we'll
change this to console log e dot target
dot value so now if I start to type
you'll see that it's going to give us
whatever we're typing in alright in the
next event I want to look at its change
and we can actually pertain this to
select so we have a select here with the
ID of gender so let's go ahead and bring
this comment down to here and then we're
going to say we want input with the ID
of gender and then we're going to say
dot change and in here we'll be function
and we're going to alert
changed okay we'll save that and now if
we go ahead and change the female that
didn't work let's see oh I put input
should be select there we go
so you can have something happen when a
user chooses a specific value and we
should also be able to get that value if
we pass in E and then we get e dot
target dot value
okay so female and we get female okay
now I just want to show you the submit
event so if we want to submit a form
right now up to this point we've been
dealing with separate input so now we're
going to deal with the form itself so
we'll take that form which I think has
an ID it doesn't so we'll just say ID
equals form and then we'll go ID form
dot submit okay now if we were to
console dot log submitted whoops can't
type today so let's try that and see
what happens and fill in whatever we
want and submit I guess that has to be
an email address you know what let's
change that type to text just so we
don't have to deal with that okay right
now it's email
all right so just type anything in
submit and you'll see that we're not
seeing the console log down here that's
because the form is actually submitting
what we need to do to stop it is pass in
E and then we'll say e dot prevent
default okay save that and now submit
and you can see we get our submitted and
if we want to grab the value here let's
say we want to grab the value of name
then let's actually we'll create a
variable called name we'll set it to
that input which is input with the ID of
name and then we want to get dot Val
that'll give us the value all right and
then we'll console.log name so for name
we'll just say John Doe and submit and
we get John Doe so we could proceed to
do whatever we want with these inputs
all right so this video is getting quite
long so what I'm going to do is stop it
here we've went over all the basic
selectors events now we're going to move
on to Dom manipulation which will
continue in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
