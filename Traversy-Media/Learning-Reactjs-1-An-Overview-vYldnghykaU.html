series in this series we're going to be
looking at the JavaScript library react
j/s alright so I'm not exactly sure how
many videos we'll have in the series but
in this video we're going to take a look
at basically an overview of react and
talk about what it is and what it does
and why you should use it alright so
let's go ahead and start so what is
react j/s it's a JavaScript library and
it's primarily focused on user
interfaces all right it doesn't have any
assumptions about the rest of your
application as far as models and
databases or anything like that it's
strictly for the UI it's create it was
created and is still maintained by
Facebook it's considered the V in MVC
and those of you that don't know what
MVC is it stands for model view
controller so react is the view of MVC
all right like I said react makes no
assumptions about anything else in your
application react can be ran on both the
client and on the server alright so you
can have an ojs or an express server and
you can run react through there as well
as well as on the client so react has
something called a virtual Dom and this
abstracts the Dom away giving you a
simple much simpler programming model so
it basically creates a slimmer version
of the Dom in the browser and it only
updates the part parts that need to be
rear-ended all right and in turn this
makes it much faster when you're dealing
with a regular JavaScript application
and you want to make some kind of update
to the UI the entire page has to refresh
the browser refreshes the whole page and
that's it with react it can pick and
choose which parts it wants to refresh
all right and it has a one-way reactive
data flow so we have one-way
data-binding
it's possible to have two-way
data-binding if you want to use an
add-on I know there's one called react
link
and there's some other ways that you can
get to a data binding so why would you
use react well it's simple
react manages all of the UI updates for
you
it's declarative it knows to refresh
only the changed parts of the
application as opposed to the entire
page it's read this is probably the the
most beneficial reason it's readable and
reusable because everything is
considered a component and it's
self-contained making it easy to read
and to reuse code either in that
application or in other applications all
right so let's say you have just a
regular website and you have a user
interface you have the navbar that can
be its own component with with its own
functions and it's all encapsulated in
that component you could have I don't
know maybe a SIA
sidebar or menu something like that
slider whatever it may be a foot or a
header you can you can make these into
their own components and you can just
plug them in wherever you want and you
can reuse them in other applications so
that's the domain that I think react is
so beneficial so react Jas uses
something called JSX which is JavaScript
syntax extension and this is basically
XML or even HTML inside of your react
components all right that's what we use
to actually present present the markup
now using JSX
isn't actually required you can use
straight JavaScript but it's not
recommended for one thing it's it takes
a lot longer and it's a lot more code
and it's just it's just difficult and
not necessary if you can use JSX alright
so it's not required but recommended now
in order to use JSX
we need something to transform that into
JavaScript and there's actually some
stuff online some utility tools that we
can look at that will show us if we type
in some JSX it can convert it to
JavaScript and show us exactly what
it turns into and how it works and we'll
take a look at that later but one way to
do this is using Babel
okay Babel is a JavaScript compiler and
it can transform that JSX code for us
all right I in addition to that it lets
us write code that is lets us write es6
or es2015 syntax all right so it's just
a different way to write react
components we can we can build classes
and the importing files is different and
it's just different I wouldn't say that
it's better it's just an alternative and
we'll take a look at both both ways es5
and es6 but anyways babel will convert
the es6 into es5 for the browser
alright babel works very well with web
pack which is something we'll take a
look at it's a module bunda bundler and
it also has a really nice dev server
that you can use in development now when
you're writing JSX inside javascript if
you're putting it in your HTML file for
instance you'll need to add the type of
text slash babel to your script tags
alright if you don't do that it's not
going to work so here is a very very
simple example of a react component all
right so what we're doing here is we're
creating a component called Hello
message all right we're going to set
that to react dot create class and then
we're going to pass in an object that's
going to have all of our functions for
that component now the render function
will talk about these different
lifecycle functions in a second but this
is required this is the only one that is
required and what that's going to do is
it's going to return the component
markup this is the JSX oops right here
okay you can see we have a div and we're
just saying hello and then this right
here is a property that we can include
in the component all right and then down
here this is where we're going to render
the component okay so we're going to
call react Dom now the latest version of
react right now the latest stable
version is 0.14 point
seven back in version 0.13 you didn't
have to do the react Dom all right you
could just do react out render but if
you're going to use the latest version
you can use react on render and then in
here we're going to include our hello
message component okay this is JSX
syntax we have our tag and we're adding
an attribute of name setting that to
John all right now this is called a
property this is a name property we're
passing it in and then we're accessing
it up here in the component now the way
that we get this to actually show on the
screen
is by this second parameter here where
we tell it where to put it
okay so we're using just regular
JavaScript document dot get element by
ID and we're going to pass an app app is
going to be the ID of the element where
we want to insert this component
alright so we'd have in our HTML in our
regular HTML we'd have a div with the ID
of app and that's where this would show
up alright so that's a very simple
example and we'll we'll get more into
the syntax in the next video so another
really important part of react j/s are
States States and props or properties
alright so components can hold
properties or props that can be passed
in as attributes and we just saw a good
example of that with the hello message
and the name we passed in alright
components can also maintain an internal
state or internal state data alright so
you can set States for just about
anything objects strings numbers
whatever and when a state has changed
the component is re-rendered and the
mock-up will be updated so this makes
react very dynamic alright and to change
it we have to call this set state and
with if that changes its going to
re-render
and make all the updates necessary so
lifecycle methods are specific methods
that are fired off when a component is
rendered or updated
all right and these are not all of them
these are just the more common ones like
I said render is the only one that's
actually required and that just renders
the application just like we just saw
all right these other ones here we have
get initial state and this is going to
allow you to set default values for your
state's same thing here we have get
default props this will allow you to set
defaults for properties component will
mount this is a method that's invoked
once on the client and server before
rendering and then component did mount
is going to invoke after the first
render all right so you do different
things in these different methods and
we'll get into this a little later and
then we also have react add-ons which
are modules that can aid in the
development of reactions we have things
like animation add-ons we have add-ons
to use two-way data-binding such as
react link and then we have testing
add-ons and as others as well alright so
that's going to be it for this video in
the next video we'll go ahead and setup
a really simple component I'll show you
how to to include the JavaScript for
react and all that so we'll get into
that next all right thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
