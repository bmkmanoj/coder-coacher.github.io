our application is complete now we want
to move on to the task lists alright and
we want to do is create a list
controller which will interact with a
list model and then we'll have a couple
different views for the list so the
first thing I want to do is I want to
add a link up here I want to go to the
list controller but only if we're logged
in so I'm just going to go ahead and go
into my layout my main layout and I'm
gonna put this right after the home list
and what we're doing here is saying if
we're logged in then show this link to
the list controller and from this point
on I'm gonna be copying and pasting more
than I have been just because this is
getting kind of long and a lot of the
stuff that we're doing yeah it has to do
with what we what you've already learned
so you know interacting with models and
things like that so maybe copying and
pasting a little more all right so let's
go ahead and login
so now we have this link which goes to
nothing because we don't have a list
controller so let's create that
under controllers new file I'm going to
save this as list on PHP and let's just
try to speed things up here fast lists
okay so what do we want here we want to
have first of all we don't want to be
able to access any of this if we're not
logged in all right so what I'm gonna do
is create a constructor and that's one
thing we haven't gone over yet although
if you're familiar with other languages
you may know what a constructor is but
it's basically something that just runs
it'll run when this class runs you won't
you don't need to have a special method
for it to run so that's where we can
create our logic for a login for
authentication
so I'm going to say public function and
we do this with a double underscore and
then the word construct all right and
what we want to do is we want to enter
our parent construct
because what this is doing is calling
the constructor the constructor of CI
controller all right and we need that or
things won't work part won't work like
they should all right so we're gonna say
if this session user data logged in well
we're gonna say if not logged in so I'm
gonna put an exclamation mark here which
means not so if they're not logged in
then we're going to set a message okay
so let me just
grab the syntax
okay and we'll say not logged in or
we'll just say no access
and they're gonna go to back to the
homepage all right so
this isn't gonna do anything we need to
create a view all right so let's create
an index method
public function index and remember index
is called when you go to a controller
like lists without any method without
any second word or whatever all right so
let's say user ID
yeah so I'm going to set the user ID to
the session to the user data ID so this
session user data
user ID
all right so we're gonna create a view
for this it's going to be under lists
index so let me just paste that in
all right so let's create that view so
in our views folder we want to create a
folder called lists
and in that list folder we want a file
called index.php this is the list index
all right so we're in the ListView now
what we want to do now is try out the
the the access so let's go to home slash
lists all right so oh I'm sorry we don't
want home slash lists we just want lists
all right so it just redirected us we
didn't catch that
that flash data there's no access so we
got to throw that in the home page and
you can see you are your home view can
get quite cluttered with these messages
no access
no access all right so let's try that
again
go to lists alright sorry you're not
logged in so that should that should
actually be danger this class
all right that's all you want so let's
log back in now that we know that that
works all right in my list
so what are we gonna do here what we
want to do is grab all the lists which
we don't have done yet so in our
database I'm just gonna manually insert
a couple lists so if we go to lists and
then insert list name say family stuff
this list is for family basis tasks I
guess I'm just making stuff up all right
so the user ID would be me let me just
check my ID so under users my ID is -
all right so
- and then let's see the park stuff
this is business
I don't know too
all right so now we have two less in our
database and we want to grab those and
present them here so we can do that in
the index controller we want to create a
data variable which will be called lists
and we want to set that equal to this DB
I'm sorry this list model catalysts all
right so we have to create a list model
so I'm just gonna be going just a little
bit faster than we were all right so our
list model we have to auto load that so
in our auto load file you just want to
add that right here okay
now let's go to our lives model and
let's
see I model and what was it get list so
public function get lists basically here
we want to create
basically we just want to get all the
lists
so we'll say query equals this DV get
well
and inside here we want the name of the
table which is lists and let's create
actually we don't need any where clauses
we want to grab all of them so all we
want to do here is we want to return we
want to return query result and that
should give us an array with the lists
all right so that's being passed to this
data lists okay and then what we're
adding the the data array in our view so
we should now be able to access it in
our view so let's see and what we want
to do is loop through them so we'll say
PHP for each
for each list as list
what we just want to end for each all
right so let's see if we can if we're
grabbing the list so in the in the
middle of the loop let's just echo list
and then we should be able to access all
the fields for instance the title is it
called title not list name so I should
be able to say this name and then we'll
just add on a break all right so let's
go back to the lists and reload and we
get our family stuff and work stuff
lists all right so now we can create our
view and we can include our lists all
right so what we want to do is we want
to make the view a little nicer let's
put in and each one
paragraph this is
I don't know what should I say I'll just
say these are your current let's alright
so we're gonna have we what I want to do
is make each each list item an actual
HTML list item so we're gonna create a
ul and give it a class of list items and
it's gonna end after the for each and
then in between here we want list tags
take away this break
all right it looks good and then we'll
just have a link let me add in a break
and then a link to create a new list
let's just put that in a paragraph okay
so let's reload
and there's our lists now what I want to
do is add a link to be able to go to
that actual list page so what we're
going to do actually we want the body to
show there as well so actually in
between these list tags we're going to
do a couple things
I'm going to create a div with the class
of list name and that will go there
and then we want the list body
this body and this should actually have
a link to the list name so in here have
a link which will go to
jeez URL
go to BC URL list slash show which will
show an individual list and then we want
the ID of the list so PHP echo list ID
okay let's close that link
this
this button here this create new list is
gonna go to this slash ad
all right let's take a look at that
all right
we will add a little bit of styling for
this actually let's do that now I'll
just throw it in so we want to go to our
assets and then CSS and then custom and
I'm just gonna throw in a style just
give it a border a couple things alright
so that's good we have a list of lists
so let's create the show method so we
can actually view these so you can see
we go to lists last show and that should
be slash one let me fix that
right here he's a slash all right so
that should be it for our index for you
next let's create a view under lists and
save this as show dot PHP and that'll be
our show view so we need to create a
show function so show and this is going
to take in an ID and that'll be the list
ID
and where this comes from is the URL
alright so well that's ad C so we're
going list show and that's the idea of
the list alright so in here I'm going to
throw in some data values after throwing
the whole thing all right so we're
saying list this value here is equal to
we're just going to get the list and
we're going to include the ideally me
I'm just gonna make this ID all right so
this ID is coming from here and next
we're getting the completed tasks which
actually I'm not going to do this yet
it's comment that out all right so
basically we're just getting the
information for this particular list
sending it to the show view alright so
then in the show view
I'm gonna paste in our actions so this
will basically just be a little box that
has links to add a task to edit the list
or delete the list all right and we have
a little click Handler that's just gonna
give us a confirm and say are you sure
when we only click delete all right so
this should now list model get list all
right so we need to create that sorry if
I'm skipping around here this is the
list controller we need to create this
list model get list
and this is basically pretty easy just
say get list and it's going to take an
ID you're gonna say this query equals
this DB get and we want to get this from
the list table and we need a where
clause so I'm going to say this DB where
ID is equal to that ID and then we're
just going to return same thing query
result and that should do it
all right what do we got here
find a property of non-object
with Slash show
three four and five
Oh list ID
now why is that not showing
the list
get list all right so let's ah
oh I know why since we're getting one
record alright we're getting one record
by the ID we don't want to return a
result we want to return a row
okay cuz result is for an array if
you're returning an array a row is for
I'm sorry
result is if you're returning more than
one column all right so we got ad task
edit alright let's go back to the show
view and let's see
I'm gonna piece some stuff in we're
gonna have a heading which will be the
list name
we'll have the create date in the body
so let's save that
all right
and I'm gonna throw some more CSS in so
if we go to the custom CSS to put in
these this is for the actions for these
right here alright so it puts that over
there
now ultimately we're gonna want our
tasks for this list to show down here
but we're not going to do that yet
what I want to do now is I want to be
able to create a new list alright so
let's go to our list controller and
we're just going to paste in a new
function called add which is basically
stuff that we've done the form
validation let's see we're loading a
view called lists slash add list which
will create we're creating an array with
the post data as well as the session
user ID and then we're calling this
create list from the list model and
they're just redirecting it so pretty
pretty easy stuff that we've done so
let's create that view under
under lists we want to create a
we want to create a new file and we'll
call it add list dot PHP okay so and
let's let me just let's just test this
out so if we click on that now we're in
the add view
now this is gonna be a form using the
forum helper I'm gonna paste in same
stuff again same you know same idea we
have a list nameless body that's pretty
much it so save this is being sent to
the hat to the list controller and the
add function which we have here
so let's reload this and see if actually
we need to create the model the model
method which is create list alright so
just copy that little
and this is taken our data array which
includes log post values and this is
going to be pretty quick we're just
going to create an insert variable it
will say this DB insert data and then
we're just going to return that variable
all right so let's reload this and we'll
add a new list let's say I don't know
we'll say sports
all sporting events okay add list all
right so again you must use the set
method to update an entry
not sure why that happened let me see
insert
this TV insert oh we don't have the
table name then I put lists
all right and we also need a message we
have this list created message which we
want to show in the list index view
which is here and I actually have quite
a few messages that I want to paste in
here um do you don't these don't matter
right now the only one that matters is
the created but we're also gonna delete
and update a list so put those in there
now and let's go back to my lists create
a new one say sports all right your task
your task list has been created and
there it is alright so now we can view
we can select all our lists we can add
them now we want to be able to update
them so if we click on this we want to
click on edit list and go to the the
Edit control method so if we go to lists
and I'm going to paste in the edit
method
okay so we have edit and we have to pass
an ID a list ID form validation and here
this date of this list we're going to
grab all of the the list data for this
particular list by ID all right and then
same thing down here we're just creating
a data array and then we're submitting
it through the model through edit list
alright so now we got to go to our model
just go to our model and I'm gonna say
public function edit list and any time
you have an edit anything you need to
pass in an ID alright so we're going to
pass in a list ID and we want to pass in
the data array as well
and this what we say in this TV where we
want to see you say where ID is equal to
list ID
query this DB yet and then the table
name which is lists okay and then we
just want to return the query the row
all right so that's that
at at list now that's the Edit function
now we want to get the we want to get
the list data from the model as well so
let's go back to list model and you know
what I did this wrong this is actually
shoot
let me just get rid of this I put the
wrong function in there let me just grab
it
all right so if saying we're ID equals
list ID we want to update will do this
DB update and we're passing in the data
array and we're returning true
now let's paste in the get list data
which is basically what we just did up
here it's just returning the data from a
single list all right and the last thing
to do is to create a view and edit view
so I know the ListView we want a new
file save it as edit list dot PHP
and I'm gonna paste in a form okay same
thing that we've been doing and let's
try that out so I'll go to edit lists
let's say family stuff we'll say it's
that a base task we'll say stuff okay
it's been updated and you can see that
it's changed to this family stuff
alright last thing delete we want to be
able to delete the list so in our
controller we need a delete function
and it's basically calling delete list
in the model okay so I'll go to the list
model and we'll paste in delete list all
right so that should do it
let's reload this
in delete list are you sure alright so
called two undefined method delete tasks
of list all right so what this function
that we don't have does is it deletes
all the tasks that are associated with
this list and we haven't done tasks yet
so let's just hold off on that alright
so that looks good basically the lists
are done it shows on our home page
actually no they don't that's what we
need to do we need to go to the home
view and I'm just gonna paste in a table
that'll show all our lists and let me
see reload
okay so it's not getting that
the lists and that's probably because
this isn't set this lists so if we go to
our home controller
we just want to say if we're if we're
logged in then get the list all right so
if session data logged in then we're
grabbing the user ID and then we're
getting all the lists from that user it
will also get the tasks but we'll hold
off on that all right so we just need to
create this get all lists in the model
in the list model I guess you could also
put it in the home controller if you
wanted
all right so paste that in same thing
we're just getting it with the where
clause with the user ID and we're saying
this DV order by we want to order it by
the create date and ascending okay so
that's how that works
and there's our lists for view
all right so our lists are basically
done next we'll be creating our task
functionality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
