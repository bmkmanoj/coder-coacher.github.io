up to this point and I want to show you
how to deploy it to github pages now
github pages as a service that's used to
basically host static websites or
storefront ends now since we're using
firebase it is separate from our
application it's a cloud database so
it's not something that we need on our
own server so we don't need like a like
digitalocean our Heroku or something
where we need a back-end we're using
firebase a separate cloud database as
our back-end or I should say fire store
so we can use a service like github
pages we can use a hostgator shared
account we can use stuff like that we
could even use firebase which offers
hosting but I do have a video on that
already so I wanted to do something
different now before we get into github
pages we need to compile our application
because we don't take all this stuff
here and upload it okay what we need to
do is just run a command so I'm gonna go
down here and stop the server with ctrl
C and let's just clear this out here and
we need to run NPM run build and what
this does is it takes our application
and it compiles it into static assets
that we can deploy okay you see it says
building for production and what it's
going to do is it's going to create a
dist folder with the index.html file
along with all the static assets you can
see right here dist and it has the index
file with a static folder and this is
what we upload to our web host so what
I'd like to do is make this dist folder
our actual git repository for our github
pages website excuse me
so if I open up the github pages
homepage here it tells us how to do this
so we need to create a repository in
github named after your user name dot
github dot
oh okay once you do that you can simply
clone it to a local folder on your
machine and then you can add your
website or whatever it is you want and
then you can push to it
okay you can just do get add commit and
then push so that's what we're gonna do
now I'm gonna go to my github account
and create a new repository and you want
to make sure you call it your username -
Brad Travis e and then you want to do
dot github dot that you name it that
okay and then description I'm just gonna
say testing deployment and create
repository alright so now we have the
repository created so we're gonna go
back over here and we're gonna open up
I'm just gonna open up my folder my
project folder and this is the dist
now in order to clone it we want this
dist folder to be empty so we can simply
delete these these folders and files
because once we've run npm run build
they'll come right back
it'll recompile everything back but we
want this empty right now and then we
want to open a command line in the dist
folder so you can either either navigate
to disk down here and your editor or you
can just open up a command line or
terminal in the dist folder which is
what i'm gonna do all right
and then what we want to do is just like
the github pages says which is right
here we want to get clone and then this
URL okay I'm just gonna copy this and
we'll go back over here now we're gonna
paste this in and there's some things we
need to change so obviously we want to
change user name to whatever your user
name and then right here as well
and then one other thing I want to do is
just at the end we want to do space dot
if we don't do the dot what it's going
to do is it's gonna create a new folder
called your user name dot github dot
I don't want that I want it's right in
the dist folder so if we put a dot it
tells it to do that so let's go ahead
and run this
alright so it says you appear to have
cloned into an empty repository that's
fine it is empty but now what we want to
do is recompile our application if we
look in our disk for door we now have a
git folder meaning it's now a git
repository so let's recompile we'll go
back to vs code and let's go ahead and
run NPM run build again and now if we go
over to our folder it should do this the
files should show up once it's done so
we should get our index.html and the
static folder ok so now there's our
application so this is essentially our
website so what we're gonna do now is go
back to the command line inside the dist
and let's clear this out and we'll go
ahead and we'll say git add dot I want
to add all clear it out then I'm gonna
say git commit I'm gonna put the am flag
here and just say initial commit and
then we want to say git push so I'll
clear this out first so you can see so
get push - u origin and then master ok
we want to push to the master branch
okay so that's what that what it's doing
is it's taking our site our application
and it's adding it to the repository so
now if I reload the repository you'll
see the files there and now if I go to
the URL brad traversée github I oh
there's our application so it's now live
on the internet and you can add your own
domain you do not have to use this okay
so notice that it's the same data
because we're still connected to the
same firebase so if we were to go ahead
and add a new employee here say Tom
Jackson Department will say IT will say
tech lead submit and that works okay Tom
Jackson if we want to visit that
employee we can if we want to edit him
say Tom Jackson's submit ok we're able
to edit if we want to delete them we can
delete so we now have our view jeaious
and firestore application live on the
internet now you've also created a very
easy workflow where you can build on to
your application go in your source and
add new components new functionality
maybe add view X out of state manager
and then you can just simply compile it
npm run build it goes to the dist folder
you go to your dist folder command line
and you push it to your repository and
it uploads your your website so it's a
very nice and smooth workflow
alright so that's gonna be it guys
