for beginners in this video I'm going to
give you an introduction to the c-sharp
programming language and the dotnet
framework this is actually the first
c-sharp video on my channel I've been
working with it recently and I really
want to start working in videos and
projects using C sharp and dotnet so
this video is definitely going to be
geared towards beginners if you've never
used C sharp before that's fine you're
in the right place if you have any
experience at all with object-oriented
programming on any level then you should
be able to keep up with with this video
just fine and then if you've never
actually typed a line of code in your
life you'll still take stuff away from
this but of course I would suggest that
you you look at other resources as well
alright so without further ado let's go
ahead and get into it this video is
sponsored by dev Mountain if you're
interested in learning web development
iOS or UX design dev Mountain is a
12-week design and development boot camp
intended to get you a full-time job in
the industry to learn more visit dev
mountain comm or click the link in the
description below
alright so initially I was going to do a
crash course and go through things like
all the different data types and how to
create functions and all that really not
building an actual application similar
to Derrick banners tutorial on YouTube
which is awesome and I would definitely
suggest checking that out as well but
instead I chose to start from scratch
and we're going to install visual studio
set up a project and we're going to
build a really simple windows console
application okay so many of these of
videos like this they'll do like a
simple hello world will just print text
out onto the screen and I want to go
more in depth than that so we're going
to build a console program that will
generate a random number and then let us
guess it and we're going to add logic
we're going to make sure that the the
input the user types is actually a
number we're going to be creating custom
functions we'll look at code
organization loops conditionals
variables all that stuff alright so it
is kind of like a crash course but
structured in the way that we're
actually building a simple application
alright so what I'm going to do before
we actually jump in and install Visual
Studio and get going I just want to talk
about some of the main points of c-sharp
and
dotnet justjust for people that are
completely new to it so what exactly is
c-sharp
it's a general-purpose object-oriented
programming language now I know a lot of
you guys are web developers and may be
new to languages like C sharp and Java
but even if you know PHP or JavaScript
Python any of these other languages that
worked with that work with objects and
classes you're going to see a lot of
similarities and you should be able to
pick this stuff up really quick all
right once you get to a certain point
it's really easy to learn new languages
because they all have the same general
fundamentals
all right so c-sharp was created by
Microsoft and it's one of the languages
of the dotnet framework which I'll talk
about in a second now as far as
difficulty c-sharp is relatively easy to
learn in my opinion I think it's easier
to learn than something like Java but
some people do disagree with that I also
think it's a great first language it
really encompasses all the things that
you need to know for you know learning
common principles in programming and it
really prepares you to work with other
languages as well so if you want to
learn how to create Windows applications
c-sharp is a great choice it can be used
to create applications on other
platforms as well but you may need to
use some extra tools such as mono which
you can check out I think it's the mono
project net Java is probably a better
choice for for building applications on
other platforms but c-sharp is
definitely the choice for Windows
alright so let's talk a little bit about
dotnet and what what that is okay
because it really confuses some people
between C sharp and dotnet it's kind of
a blanket term but generally when you
talk about dotnet you're talking about
the framework okay it's technically a
framework in a runtime that runs
primarily on Windows like I said there's
other tools you can use like mono which
allow you to create applications for
other platforms like Linux and and so on
but for the most part you're going to be
dealing with windows with c-sharp
now c-sharp is is not technically
it doesn't technically require the
dotnet framework in simple terms if you
want to do anything meaningful though
you will need it you can kind of think
of it as c-sharp as the airplane and
then dotnet is the runway you can
technically use the airplane without the
runway but you're most likely going to
use the runway in all situations to get
your plane up off the ground all right
unless you just want to blindly drive a
plane into the woods so c-sharp is not
the only dotnet language as a bunch
including visual basicnet net c++ / CLI
which is a certain version of C++ it
includes extensions for CLR objects and
I'll go I'll go over CLR in a second
there's also f-sharp this kobold is
there's a lot of them and you can look
those up just google dotnet languages
and you'll find them all all right in
dotnet is made up generally made up of
two main components which is the CLR and
the class library also called F CL or
framework class library and that gives
us a ton of reusable classes interfaces
value types and much more all right so
it's basically the foundation of the
dotnet framework so what is CLR and
don't worry about it this stuff confuses
you this isn't stuff that you really
need to know and master in order to
start learning c-sharp all right but I
do want to just go over it because I
don't think it would be fair for me not
to say anything about it and jump right
into the syntax so CLR stands for common
language runtime and this is the virtual
machine component of the.net framework
okay it manages the execution of
programs it's similar to the Java
runtime it provides an environment for
our applications to run alright so it
has a process called JIT JIT are just in
time and it converts your compiled code
into machine instructions that your
computer understands okay it also
provides services like memory management
type safety garbage collection if you're
a web developer then you're going to be
new to this kind of stuff compiling your
software and I think that you're going
to find it really awesome when you start
messing with system resources and you
get
use some of the stuff that's in the
class library all right so you can
interact with you know the hardware on
your machine which is really cool and
it's much different than working with
just you know web development on a
server so CLR also lets use components
that were built in other languages which
is really nice all dotnet programs are
executed by the CLR okay whether it's
you know f-sharp or whatever else it may
be now don't like I said don't worry if
this stuff confuses you do it you don't
need to master it to write c-sharp code
especially for what we're going to be
doing in this video
I just wanted you to be somewhat
familiar with these terms and what goes
on behind the scenes okay so this this
is the type of stuff that books are
really useful for they drill that into
your head but what I want to do in this
video is just get you started with the
syntax and structure of building a
c-sharp program alright so this is I
believe this is the last slide we're
going to use we're going to need a tool
to write our code obviously and also
compile it and for that we're going to
use an IDE which stands for integrated
development environment as I said
earlier I know most of you guys are web
developers and you probably know what an
IDE is even though you don't really need
it for most web development okay so for
you know when we're coding JavaScript or
PHP something like that we can use our
standard code editors like sublime atom
and even Visual Studio code which kind
of has a feel like Visual Studio just
without the extra tools
alright so an IDE is kind of like a text
editor on steroids
it has compiling and build tools
extensive debugging and tell a sense and
much more all right there's a few
different versions of Visual Studio
we're going to use the community version
which is absolutely free the
professional and the Enterprise Edition
is not free it's actually very very
expensive if you're working for a
corporation building apps and stuff you
would be--would promotes likely use that
alright guys so like I said I don't want
to spend too much time on this stuff
just talking about C sharp and dotnet I
want to jump right in and get our feet
wet so let's go ahead and we'll install
Visual Studio and then we'll get started
on
our simple application alright guys so
we're going to start on our application
first thing we're going to do is install
Visual Studio Digital Studio is the IDE
that we're going to use to create C
sharp and dotnet applications so this is
Visual Studio calm and like I said
before there's a few different versions
so we're going to go into downloads and
you see that first we have the Community
Edition here and that's what we'll be
using it's it's fully featured it's
completely free and it's for individual
developers so then you have the
professional version which offers extra
subscription benefits for small teams
and then Enterprise is an end-to-end
solution for you know larger scale
corporations and things like that and
then Visual Studio code which is just
the text editor which you've probably
seen me use quite a few times it's
similar to something like sublime text
or atom or webstorm something like that
so we're going to grab the Community
Edition right here so let's click the
free download button just close that out
and that should download okay let's go
ahead and open that up okay so so we're
going to get this pop-up here we're just
going to say continue and remember this
is a large program so the in some of the
installation may take quite a bit of
time so you may see me kind of like you
know pause if something is taking too
long so we don't sit here and awkward
silence all right so now you're going to
get a screen like this and this is
basically allowing you to set up
different types of environments so up
here we have windows we have Universal
Windows platform development using C
sharp or VB JavaScript and then over
here we have dotnet desktop development
that's what we want to choose alright
but just to look at some of the other
ones here we have desktop development
with C++ we have web and cloud
development so asp.net Python if you're
deploying to Azure nodejs
go down here you have mobile and gaming
we've xamarin all types of gaming
development C++ and then we have other
tools that
Linux development for C++ so there's a
lot that you can do and it can get very
complicated but try not to get
overwhelmed with stuff like this because
we're only using a certain part of of
this IDE so let's go ahead and click
make sure that that's checked and we'll
click install all right and this could
take a little bit depending on your
system and how powerful it is so we're
going to go ahead and pause this and
when this is done I'll be back alright
guys so the installation is complete and
unfortunately I'm getting a reboot
required message here I'm not sure why I
don't think I've ever had this before so
if you have it just go ahead and reboot
I'm going to have to restart so I will
be back after that all right guys so I
am back I just reread it or real aughh
din whatever and I started up Visual
Studio we get a screen like this so this
is going to ask if you want to sign in
using your azure credits we're going to
go ahead and skip this and say not now
maybe later and you can choose a theme I
prefer to like dark code editors over
the light so I'm going to choose dark
but of course feel free to use one of
the other ones and then we're going to
say start Visual Studio all right and
that should go ahead and open up it's
opening up on a different screen let me
just pull it down maximize this so this
is the start page or the Start screen
and try not to let this overwhelm you
there is a ton of stuff up here a ton of
options there's these icons you have
these different panes on the right and
left so don't don't get overwhelmed by
that stuff we are not going to need most
of it so this is just the start page
gives us some some help some
documentation we're going to go ahead
and just close that up
and then what we want to do is go to new
project and then you're going to get a
bunch of different options here because
we can build desktop applications we can
build console applications which is what
we want so make sure that you have
visual c-sharp highlighted over here and
then we're going to go and we're going
to build a console app with the.net
framework okay and down here we can name
our application so I'm just going to
call this I'm going to call it number
guesser
alright and then the default location is
going to be in your
mine is actually my Dropbox documents
because that's set to my main documents
but if yours isn't it'll just go right
in your regular documents and then a
folder called Visual Studio 2017 and
then the folder called projects all
right now I'm also going to uncheck this
create directory for solution because I
want to have everything in one directory
I don't want it separate alright then
we're going to just click OK and that's
going to open up our project inside of
the IDE
alright so every c-sharp project you
create is going to look like this by
default and let me make this a lot
bigger so you guys can see what's going
on here so we start with one main file
with one name one main class and it's
called program and if you look over here
in the solution Explorer and we look
under program dot CS that's our actual
program okay that's the actual this file
that we're looking at here program dot
CS all right and then this other stuff
here right now we don't really have to
worry about this it gives us some
properties if we look at this assembly
info dot CS file this is kind of kind of
a configuration you have the the title
the description the kata year all that
kind of stuff
and if we look in app config that's an
XML config file and we're not going to
really deal with that but just know that
it is there okay and then let's go ahead
and look at the main file so we'll start
with a namespace a namespace is
basically like a container for classes
and functions so in the event that you
have two classes called the same thing
or two functions you can you can
reference the namespace so you know
exactly what's going on and then your
program doesn't get confused so by
default the namespace is going to be
whatever you called the application but
of course you could change it if you
want now up here we have these using
statements using system using system
collections generic these are basically
bringing in other namespaces with other
functions and other things that we can
use inside of this program alright or
inside of this namespace so the only one
we're actually going to need here is
system so I'm going to get rid of these
other
here we wanted to let we we don't want
to have code that is doing nothing for
us just to keep things simple all right
good because we're going to be using for
instance the console class which comes
from system so inside our namespace our
number guests our namespace we have a
class and the class is used to create
objects from okay whenever you're
working with object-oriented programming
you're working with classes in this case
it's called program by default and
inside classes we can have functions and
we can have variables also called
methods and properties
all right so whenever you hear the word
method it basically just refers to a
function inside of a class so let's add
some comments here so this is the
namespace this is going to be our main
class and then this is going to be
basically the entry point for our
application okay so we'll say entry
point method sorry about that and
actually before we get into that let's
talk about static and void so void is
going to be the return type of this
particular method or this function
basically that means that there isn't
going to be one there isn't it's not
going to return anything now you can
have functions and or methods you can
have them return things if it's a string
or an integer you would you would put
that here but in this case we're not
going to have any return value and then
static is a little tough to explain to
someone that's new to object-oriented
programming but basically when we create
a class we can instantiate objects from
that and we can create multiple
instances of that object using that
class well when we use static we don't
have instances we're referring to the
class itself or the I'm sorry the
function itself all right so that's what
static means and then in here is where
we can start our code so let's just say
start here all right now I'm going to
start by just outputting some text now
like I said we're using this system
namespace here which comes with a whole
bunch of stuff we can use
so there's actually something called
console
Jesus I can't type
so console and you'll see we get this
nice little intellisense drop-down that
tells us of all different all different
information about each kind of library
or class or object so it says represents
the standard input output and error
streams for console applications now if
I go console dot you'll see that we get
another drop-down and these are all
different functions and properties of
this console so we have background color
we have clear cursor left cursor right
all these different things that what we
want the method that we want is actually
right line so if we go down here very
bottom you'll see right line okay of
course you can just type it in but you
can also select it and then that is
actually a function so you want to put
your parentheses and then in here we
want to we want to output a string we're
just going to put some double double
quotes in here and let's just say hello
world now I'm going to save it with ctrl
s and then if we want to run this
program it's very simple all we have to
do is do a ctrl f5 now Mike my console
actually opens on another monitor and
that's that's how I want it when I
develop unfortunately I'd rather it open
on this monitor just for this video but
I don't know how to do that I've never
had to do that so I'm just going to have
to drag it down when I open it but
anyways you can see that it's outputting
the text hello world ok so if we look
down here console.writeline is going to
write that line now if we just did
console right which is another function
that we can use let's save that and run
it and then if I drag that down you'll
see it does it prints out hello world
but the next line is going to be it's
not going to be a next line it's going
to be on that same line ok so that's the
main difference between right line and
right in most cases you're going to use
right line now as far as variables go
c-sharp is a typed language meaning that
we need to define the types of data
that's going to go into a variable for
instance if we want a variable called
name we can't just do name and set that
equal to
to use double quotes and set that equal
to something here you'll see we have an
error and if we look at that if I hover
over it says the name name does not
exist in the current context so what we
need to do is we need to mark this as a
string because that's what it is okay
any to any string in between quotes it's
going to have any basically any
character you want is going to be a
string now we have this green squiggly
line which is basically kind of like a
warning or notification or just like a
heads-up and it's telling us that the
variable name is a sign but its value is
never used because we assigned it the
word that we're not using it anywhere so
it's kind of giving us a heads up saying
do you really need this alright and if
we go down here let's replace hello
world with name and now that little
squiggly line disappears because we're
actually using it so let's go ahead and
and save this and we'll do a control f5
when we bring this down and you'll see
that it's outputting Brad Travis E press
any key to continue if we hit any key
it's going to just should just close up
there we go and if we wanted to
for instance add some text like say
let's say hello so we could just put in
double quotes and then we can
concatenate with a plus sign just like
we would in JavaScript I know a lot of
you guys are JavaScript developers so
you can also think of console write or
write line as console.log okay same type
of thing so if we save that and we run
it with ctrl f5 and bring it down you
see hello Brad Travis E alright and
close that now if we wanted to create an
integer let's say my age an int is what
is the type that we would define for
that sorry about that
that dinging actually I'm going to put
this on vibrate alright so we would say
int and let's call this age and we'll
set it to 35 and then down here let's
actually get rid of the hello and then
we'll say name and then we'll
concatenate on to that and we'll say is
space and then concatenate age
all right so if we go ahead and run that
then we get Brad travesty is 35 now
there is actually a better way to do
this and that would be to say console
dot write line and then here we can use
placeholders for our dynamic values for
our variables so if we put some curly
braces and let's say 0 I'm sorry these
need to be in quotes so it's a zero and
then we'll just do space is and then one
and then we can add parameter here we'll
put a comma and then we want to put the
name and then another comma and the age
all right so let's go ahead and actually
let's comment this out and save it and
run it and if I bring this down you can
see Brad travesti is 35 so you can use
these placeholders and then whatever you
want to fill them with just put them in
here in the correct order
okay so for example if we had another
another value here we would just put
curly brace and then two okay so you
just want to go from 0 up all right so
these are actually not part of the
application I just wanted to kind of
explain some of the some of that stuff
before we begin
so for application when we first opened
it up I wanted to have kind of a header
with the name of the application the
version and the author's name so what
we'll do is set a couple variables here
so let's say set I will say set apt VARs
and let's say these are all going to be
strings so string and then we'll say app
name and we need to use double double
quotes here and let's call this number
guesser and then we'll do at version and
we're going to set that to 1.0.0 and
then let's do app author and we'll set
that to I'm going to put my name but you
can put yours find everything I do here
is totally open source and you're free
to do what you want with it so now we
have the variables now let's just do a
console
console dot write line and we're going
to use the those placeholders so we'll
say zero this is going to be where the
app name is and let's put a colon and
then we'll say version 1 and we'll say
bye and then 3 and then we just want to
add in here app name app version and app
author all right so let's see what that
looks like we'll save it and run it ctrl
f5 and getting an error here index 0
base must be greater or equal to 0 what
do they do
I put a 3 there that should be 2 all
right so now if I bring this down we get
number gets our version 1.0.0 by Brad
Travis City so that's kind of the itty
header I guess you could call it so now
what I'm going to do is show you how we
can actually change the text color on
the console because I want this this
application intro or header I want this
to have a different color so what we're
going to do is go right above where we
did the right line and let's put a
comment in here and let's say change
text color and to do this we can say
console dot and then if we look here
these are all the different properties
we want the foreground color you also
have the background color if you want to
change that but let's choose foreground
color and then what we'll do is set that
equal to and then we have to do console
dot console dot and I'm sorry
what is it console color dot and then
you'll see all these different options
so you can choose any of these we're
going to we're going to go with green
all right so let's save that and we'll
try and run it and I'm going to bring
this down now notice that the color has
changed to green but it's not just for
this line it's going to be for anything
after that as well so what we have to do
is we need to set it back after we're
done with that
color so after we write it out let me
just I want to put a comment basically
for every single line of code we write
so you guys know exactly what's going on
all right so let's just say right out
app info and then down here we're going
to say console color dot not console
color we want to do console dot reset
color all right and that's going to set
it back to the default of white let's
put a comment here preset text color so
now if we run that let's bring this down
and now you can see only this line here
is green okay it goes back to white
after that so now that we have our
application info at the top we're going
to proceed on now before we do the
actual game where we need to guess a
number I want to I want to ask us our
name and we'll put the name in and it'll
give us a greeting okay very simple so
let's go down here and later on we're
going to separate all this into separate
functions so it's not you know all
inside of this main function makes
things a little cleaner so see how we
greet user all right so we're going to
just let's put a comment here we'll say
ask user's name so console dot write
line and let's say what I keep with the
single quotes in here I want to use
double what is your name
all right and then they're going to
answer that and we're going to put that
input into a string okay so let's say
string input okay it's just a variable
called input and we're going to set it
to console dot read line okay and that's
going to put whatever the user enters is
going to go into that variable
so after that what we want to do is just
write out basically hello and then their
name and then we'll say let's play a
game so let's do console dot write line
and then in here we'll say hello put our
placeholder and then we'll say let's
play a game okay save that let's try it
out bring this down and we get our
application info here and then we get
what is your name so I'm going to say
Brad enter oops we need to write our
second parameter here which is going to
be whatever they put as input
okay whatever they put into the console
and it'll be put inside of input and we
want to replace this placeholder with
that input let's try again it's close
that up control at five bring this down
what is your name Brad hello Brad let's
play a game
good so that works good now we're going
to start the game so first thing we're
going to want to do is we're going to
set our number okay so it's a set
correct number we're going to it's going
to be random but for now we're going to
actually set it manually so let's create
an int we'll say int correct number and
we're going to set that equal to seven
by default all right and ignore the
squiggly lines here it's green that
means that it's kind of just a heads up
it's telling us that we haven't used
that value anywhere now we're also going
to set another variable for the guess so
we'll say init init guest var
let's set this to an it correct number
so int and we'll call this guess and
we're going to set it to zero by default
all right then what we want to do is
tell the user or ask the user to guess a
number so it's a console dot write line
and let's say guess a number between
what's between one and ten okay these
should actually be double quotes so let
me do a few things I try to explain this
the way that we want this to work is
once we put in the number if it's not
correct we want it to ask us again so we
have to use a loop for this because we
want it to want to basically say if the
number doesn't match then we want to
loop through and we want to ask again
and again until the user actually gets
it right okay and you can make it work
differently if you want but that's how
this this is going to work we just put a
comment here so they ask user for number
so we're going to need to use a loop so
we'll say while we're going to say wild
guess okay so guesses remember it's
initially set to zero so wild guess is
not equal to the correct number then
we're going to do what's it whatever is
in here all right let's put a comment
here as well say while guess is not
correct okay and then we're going to
want to get the user's input
so let's put that in a variable now by
default it's going to be a string so
we're going to set our variable to a
string set it to console dot readline
why is that what's going on cannot be
declared in this scope because that name
is used in an enclosing local scope oh
because I used it up here right okay so
this this later on is going to go into
its own function so we can use input
then but for now we want these to be
different so let's change this to input
name that makes a bit more sense to it's
more descriptive and then we will just
want to make sure we change it here as
well and then down here we'll just keep
that as input okay which is going to be
a string because when we get the user's
input it's a string now we're going to
want to take that input and we're going
to want to parse it into an integer and
put it into the guest variable which is
initialized up here is zero all right so
let's do that let's say cast two int and
put in guess put it into the guest
variable so let's do guess which is
already defined as zero and we're going
to set that to input that the user
enters but we need it to be an integer
so for that we can use we can use a
function called int 32 dot parse okay
and that will parse it into an integer
it'll put it into this event into this
guess so now we have the user's guess so
we need to match it to the correct
number up here that is seven so let's do
that so match guess two
correct number so if all right we're
actually going to say if guess is not
equal to the correct number so if they
don't answer seven then what's going to
happen we're going to want to spit out a
message looks let's spit out a message
just like we did up here and I want to
change the color too so let's copy this
which is changing the color while
putting the message and then resetting
the color back later on this will put
this into a function so that we can
reuse it and it's not we're not
repeating ourselves as much but we're
going to change this to red because it's
kind of an error message and then let's
change the the actual message here get
rid of all that and we're going to say
wrong number please try again so it
saved that ctrl f5 let's bring it down
and put our name in gets a number
between one and ten we'll say one which
we know isn't correct wrong number
please try again two and so on now if I
put seven and enter it just ends because
we're not doing anything after that so
what we want to do is now go outside of
this while loop right here because now
guess is actually going to be equal to
the correct number so that ends and if
you just put the cursor before the curly
brace you'll see where it ends so you
can see the while loop ends right there
so that's where we're going to go and
we're just going to output success
message okay so basically actually
basically doing the same thing here I
want to change the color to yellow so
I'm just going to copy that and just
replace that this needs to be changed
this is going to tell user its
the wrong number then down here we're
going to say tell user it's the right
number and I'm going to change it to
yellow not red so for this we'll just
say you are correct and then we'll reset
the color so let's try that ctrl f5 okay
let's give it a shot against the number
one wrong number wrong number let's do 7
enter you are correct all right
so we are getting there now we have a
major issue in our code and that is if
we go back here and it asked us for a
number and I put in B and enter you'll
see that it we have as our input string
was not in a correct format so that's
that's a big issue in our code so what
we need to do is we need to check to
make sure that the input the user puts
in is actually a number and not a letter
or a special character so we're going to
have to go to where we capture that
input which is right here okay so this
is where we get the user's input for the
number and we put it into input and then
here is where we actually translate it
or or or parse it into an integer so we
need to go in between those two all
right let's say make sure it's a number
so to do that we can put an if statement
here and we're going to use something
called try parse all right so let's see
we're over here so we're going to say if
not int dot try parse and if we look at
that it says converts the string
representation of a number two it's
32-bit signed integer equivalent
alright so it'll take a string of what's
a seven and then turn it into the actual
integer seven and then it says a return
value indicates whether the conversion
succeeded okay so it'll tell us if it
actually if it succeeds so if it if it
is in fact a number so let's do try
parse and then we get we need to pass
into here input okay which comes from
the user input and then we're going to
say out and then the guess variable here
all right and then if it's not a number
then we're going to just print a message
so let's let's just copy this right here
and put that in there and you can see
we're repeating ourselves quite a bit
with this that's why later on we'll put
it into a specific function so we're
going to keep it read and then we need
to tell user it's not a number
all right so we'll say sorry or now
let's say please enter an actual number
all right and then we just want to go to
the bottom here and let's say keep going
so we just need to say continue all
right so let's try that okay what is
your name
guess a number that's wrong let's let's
now put something that's not a number
we'll say D please enter an actual
number so as long as I don't enter a
number it's going to say that let's put
in four so it's wrong number please try
again seven you are correct
alright so now we're making sure that a
user has to put in a number so
everything's working but what I want to
do is instead of having a fixed number
like seven I want to generate a random
number each time so let's actually just
comment this out and then we want to
create a new random object so to do that
we can say let's see we can do random
random equals new and then there's
actually
a class called random are an object that
we can set that to so we have this
variable now that we can use that has
methods attached to it so we're going to
set a correct number just like we did up
above whoops not in it I want to say int
correct number and we can now take that
random object and we can call dot next
okay which just generates a random
number and we can pass in a parameter or
two parameters here and say that we want
it to be from 1 to 10 and that will give
us a random number you can see how easy
and how sleek that is let's just put
that comment here alright so now let's
try it out and now we don't know what
what the actual answer is so it's like
we're playing the actual game so let's
just start at 1 wrong number and we'll
just go up and it was 3 all right so the
functionality is is just about done but
what I want to do is make it so that
when we're done we can play again
because right now we'll just exit so to
do that we're going to have to put
everything inside of a while loop all
right so we want to go under where we
set the application title and all that
we want to go under the greeting of the
user we want to go right to right under
where it says let's play a game and
let's say while true and that'll be an
ongoing loop ok it's always going to be
true we want to wrap it around
everything so we want to wrap it till
right here oops
okay and you see it pushes everything
over which is really nice so now we have
this wild true and then all of this
stuff is inside of it okay and then it
ends here so at the bottom here right
under this reset color we're going to
ask the user if they want to play again
all right so we'll say ask to play again
and we're going to just do console dot
write line and we're going to put in our
double quotes and we'll say play again
and let's let's put in brackets here Y
or n okay we want them to put in yet
either wire n for yes or no all right
and then let's get the answer so we'll
say string and we'll just call this
answer and we'll set it to the console
dot read line now they might not know to
make it an uppercase Y or n so we want
to just change it to upper no matter
what and we can use a simple function we
can just chain on to this and we can say
to upper and that will make it an
uppercase alright so now we want to
check to see if it was either a yes or a
no so let's say if okay this is going to
actually be an if-else okay so let's say
if answer is equal to uppercase Y let's
put this on a different line too and
then if yes all we need to do here is do
a continue okay and then it's else then
we want to return outside of the loop
actually you know what we don't want to
do else let's not do an else
let's do
actually not yeah let's do an else but
we want to do an else--if because we
need to check for the answer if it's no
so let's say else if and here let's say
if answer is equal to N and then we're
going to return all right so it'll only
continue if they answer why so I think
that's it let's go ahead and try that
all right let me bring this down I guess
a number just going to start from one
and go up you are correct
play again let's say yes guess a number
five okay let's say no enter and there
we go it end it's good so our
application is done as far as
functionality now we want to clean this
up a little bit because we're repeating
ourselves quite a bit also things like
where we did the application intro I
want to put that into its own function
so let's go underneath the main function
here for you hi like we put the cursor
right here at the beginning of the curly
brace and go down you'll see where it
ends okay so that ends there so now
let's create a function to get the app
info so we'll say static void get app
info actually I want to start this with
a an upper case we're using Pascal case
okay and then what we'll do is grab
these variables we're also going to grab
the foreground color the right line and
the reset color and we're going to cut
all of that and then in its place we're
going to say get app info we can put a
little comment here if we want I'll say
run get app info function
to get info I don't know just writing
whatever and then down here we'll paste
that functionality in so let's save it
and make sure everything still works
even though we added that function okay
so it it set you can see it's putting
out the info which is that's the part of
the the program that where we put into
that function everything else should
work good and then I also want to put
the greeting into its own function so
we're we asked the name we get the input
and we say hello let's play the game
we're going to cut that stuff out as
well and then let's say we'll call it
greet user and we'll say ask for user's
name and greet okay there's an error
here because it doesn't know what that
is yet so we need to go down and create
that let's go right under the get the
get app info function and we'll say
static void greet user and let's go
ahead and paste that in alright and we
should probably put calm comments here
as well we'll say get the will say get
and display app info and then this one
here will ask a user's name and greet
okay so that looks a little cleaner now
what we'll do is let's create a function
to basically print to the screen with a
color so we're doing this in a lot of
different places if we start up at the
top here we go down and let's see right
here so this part where we're telling
the user to use an actual number if they
didn't enter a number so we'll grab the
foreground color the right line and the
reset color and we're going to cut that
out and then let's go down here
and let's say print color message and
then we'll call this print actually we
need to do static static void print
color our print color message
okay we'll paste that in now this is
this function is actually going to take
some parameters it's going to need the
color and it's going to need the message
because those are always going to be
different so right here we need to
define the arguments now the first one
is going to be the color but it's
actually going to be the console color
so we need to define it as that
so console color and then color alright
and then for the message that's just
going to be a regular string okay and
then we're going to just replace this
with color which comes in through the
first argument and then replace this
with the message like that so then we
can go back up to where we took this
from which is right here and let's say
print
I guess print error message and we can
say print color print color message and
then remember the first parameter has to
be a console color so we'll say console
dot NOC dot just console color dot and
then whatever color we want in this case
it's going to be red okay and then you
can see it has a red squiggly line
before we put that comma in because it
takes in two parameters but we only have
one okay you can see it gives us some
pretty good descriptive information
about what this takes in so console
color red and then the message was what
was it please use an actual number
so now whenever we want to print out a
color message we can just do this which
is much cleaner so let's copy this
actually we'll just copy that and then
let's see where else we can plug this in
so we're also doing it here when we
check to see if it's the correct number
if it's not then we're setting the color
to red we're printing out this message
and we're resetting the color so let's
just paste this end and then we want it
to be red so we'll leave that but then
we want this message so we'll just paste
that in and then we can get rid of these
lines okay so it really tightens up the
code and I guess we'll just say set
error message or print error message
I know these comments aren't the best
but I'm just trying to try to be
descriptive so let's see where else can
we do this we can do it right here we're
saying you are correct which and the
color is yellow you are correct and then
reset so let's go ahead and just replace
all that copy this and replace that and
this is going to be actually a success
message so this is going to be a console
color yellow and then we'll say correct
you guessed it I think that's it so
let's save it and make sure everything
works okay what is your name number
wrong number please try again let's put
something else in it's not a number
we'll put a character in good and now
we'll keep guessing numbers 9 is correct
do I want to play again we'll say yes
guess a number
correct let's say no and we exit good so
we now have a working c-sharp
application now if you want to get your
actual file that your executable we can
go to the Documents folder mine is
actually my Dropbox and then if I go to
visual studio 2017 and go to projects we
have our number guesser folder this
includes everything all the configs all
the properties everything but if we go
to the bin and then debug you'll see
number guests or exe this is our
application just make sure that it says
type application and you can take this
and you can give it to anybody I'm just
going to copy it and put it right on my
desktop and let's go ahead and run it
and I'm just going to bring it down here
and you'll see it has the the
application info that we have that we
output put our name we'll get some let's
get something that's not a number and
then we'll start guessing numbers and
correct you say yes you want to play
again correct if you say no enter it's
going to exit all right so we've created
a Windows console application hopefully
you guys enjoyed this and hopefully it
wasn't too confusing I know it was a
little more difficult than doing like
your standard hello world but I wanted
to create something that was actually
you know a little bit cool so that's it
guys I do plan on having more c-sharp
videos and more higher-level language
videos in the future so hopefully you
like this kind of thing and that's it
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
