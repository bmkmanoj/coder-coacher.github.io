tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to build a a blog with
joomla 2.5 and i already have a video
called I think it's called building a
Joomla blog but that's with version 1.5
which is now it's not supported anymore
and it has a lot of general security
flaws so if you still have a 1.5 website
I definitely suggest that you upgrade to
either 2.5 or 3.0 so with that said
let's get started I have a local Joomla
installation that we'll be building this
on the blog will feature a comment
system and pretty much that's it it's
gonna be just a basic blog with
categories Joomla isn't the best
platform for blogging if you're having
if you just want a straight blog I'd
suggest WordPress but this is good for
people that have maybe a Joomla business
site that want to add blog functionality
so let's log in here
and this is just a pretty much a default
installation I have a couple custom
components that I'm working on but that
has nothing to do with anything else so
in the backend first we want to create
some categories so if you want to go to
content category manager and I have a
lot of the default template categories
I'm going to create a new one and I'm
gonna call that blog
now in that category I want to have some
subcategories so let's create another
one and let's call that call that web
design and we want to put that as the
the blog category as the parent and you
can also add a description if you want
I'm not going to do that
so let's click Save and new and create a
couple more let's say web programming
once again you want to choose blog as
the parent let's say an SEO
and do web hosting
so now we have four categories for the
blog now what we want to do is create
some posts so let's go to article
manager and add new article and I just
want to grab some content you want to go
to lorem ipsum I think that's how you
say it alarm if some and what I did is
just click generate so it generates this
paragraph I mean these paragraphs for us
so I'm just going to grab some of this
I actually don't want that styling so
what I'm gonna do is click the HTML
button paste it in here and just put
some paragraph tags in here
you'd probably be typing this as opposed
to copying pasted so you shouldn't have
any issues with formatting so I'm just
gonna copy that what I just just for
some so I can add a couple other posts
and let's just call this sample post one
and we want to choose the category so
let's choose web design and let's click
Save and new and let's add in some more
sample content I'll just change it up a
little bit I'll take out just take out
some text here
all right so let's do sample post two
and we will put that also in web design
and let's create one more let's put that
in web programming and add in these the
dummy text
all right
save that alright so now we have our
categories and articles now what we want
to do is create a menu item I'm going to
create it on my top menu and you want to
click select and category blog the
category blog is under the articles
heading and we'll just call the menu
item blog and then we want to choose a
category which we want blog and save
that if we reload we should see the blog
link and if we click it we don't see our
articles what we want to do what it's
doing is it's looking just in the blog
category for the articles it's not
looking at its listing the subcategories
but it's not grabbing the information
the text so what we want to do is go
back to the screen the menu item edit
screen and we want to go to category
options where it says subcategory levels
we want all and then click the blog
layout options and include subcategories
all now if we save it and reload now we
have our our articles are showing and
you can see by default we have the
category we have the published date and
then the author and the hits I want to
get rid of these icons and and I want to
get rid of the hits keep them keep the
other stuff I guess so we'll go back to
this menu this edit menu option on menu
item and we want to go to article
options and we what we don't want the
icons so let's choose hide for all these
icons in this also the hits we'll also
want to choose hide
and that looks good
I want to show the publish date only so
I'm gonna get rid of this show this show
modified date and the choose hide for
that as well as this create date I just
want the date that it was actually
published and saved on so if I save that
go back and reload and the icons are
gone and the hits are gone now as of now
this it's showing us the entire body of
text so we don't want that we want it
like any other blog where it cuts off
and you have to click a read more link
so if we go back we have to go back to
our articles
we can narrow down we can filter our
article display to blog and let's go
into post one and right now it's showing
all this I want to show only the first
paragraph I'm gonna make that a little
shorter as well and we just want to put
the cursor where we want the text to end
and then click the read more button all
right so save that and do it to the rest
of them
three
read more save so if we go back and
reload it cuts off where we want it to
so let's see if you if you don't want to
click that read more button in every
post you can download and plug in
that'll cut every blog post off at a
certain point I forget that the name of
it but there's actually a few of them if
you just go on the the GED the joomla
extension directory you should be able
to find something like that so you'll
notice we have no commenting
functionality and that's one of the
fallbacks of Joomla is that they don't
have a core commenting system so we need
to use some kind of third-party
commenting plugins so what I usually use
is J comments so let's go and get that
I'm just going to search for J comments
and you should get this extension
directory link and it's it's
non-commercial it's free so you don't
have to pay anything and just click
download
and let's get the latest version Jay
comments two point three stable looks
like the latest version so let's
download that and you can also see these
these other modules might as well throw
these in the J comments latest is just a
module that will display the latest
comments you can put that in any module
position we have most commented taught
posters and you can put these on your
home page and just makes for a good blog
so we'll just take those two and you can
install them just like any other
extension and we want downloads J
comments
all right click Next and it takes us
right to the configuration page now
there's a few things we need to do here
we need to choose the categories that we
want J comments to work in we don't want
comments on our boat page a contact page
or anything like that
so you want to definitely want to choose
which categories you want obviously we
want all these blog categories
notifications I'll keep to know some
miscellaneous stuff RSS feeds we don't
need any of that the layout looks like
there's only one layout by default but
you can edit it enable smiles I don't
really like that so I'm going to choose
no it doesn't look very professional
just a bunch of smiley faces and you can
enable custom bbcode if you want them to
be able to use BB code votes you can
choose if you want the author's real
name or the user name keep it at real
lay out
comment form you can choose if you want
it after the comments or before website
you can you can let the users put in
their website or their own title which
will keep disabled so that looks good
we'll keep that and permissions you can
edit permissions for public public means
that they're not logged in so you see
public doesn't have auto published
checked which means that if a guest
posts a comment it needs to be approved
by an admin registered users you'll see
the auto publish is checked so if
they're logged in it doesn't need to be
approved but obviously you can change
all these settings you can create more
user groups and had change settings for
that so really handy restrictions filter
messages we don't need any of that so
let's just save that the most important
thing is that you choose the correct
categories so let's save that
now if we go back to our front-end and
reload you see we now have an add new
comment link and if you go to the post
you have this comment form let's just do
email like I said you can set this to
required or not or you can just disable
it all together you get the users
website they can put in if they want and
we have the CAPTCHA and qb6 three nice
and easy because like I can't stand when
sites have these and you just can't read
it for the life of you so it's these are
pretty good
oh so it says this email address is
already used by registered user so let's
just just say test a test com
okay so thank you your comment will be
published once reviewed and it's doing
this because we're not logged in so if
we go back this is how you would manage
your comments on your Joomla site you go
to components J comments and comments
and you'll see this is our comment it
shows that the users information as well
as the comment so if you want to publish
it you just click yes and that will
approve the comment so we save that and
if we go back to the post page and
reload you'll see here's the comment and
people can quote other people's comments
we have RSS enabled but you can disable
that you can refresh the comment list so
it's more like a real blog now that this
comments because if there's no user
interaction I don't know I don't really
consider that a blog so let's see what
else can we do let's enable the module
ok actually let's create one let's make
no nevermind
alright let's create the module or
enable the module for the latest
comments I'm sorry the latest posts so
if we go to extensions module manager
you should see
what we want to do is just have a module
on the homepage that shows the latest
posts and we can use the core component
I mean the core module latest news I
think it's called yeah so latest news
will show a list of the most recent
published articles so we want that so
what I did was just clicked new let me
show you that again
we're in module manager and I just
clicked new and then latest news and you
can choose the category you want the
post all the articles to be in we want
only the blog category latest posts and
we'll say we'll keep going all pages and
the position I'm using the B's five
template I think it is it's the default
template as far as positions I think
I think position seven is the sidebar Oh
No yeah the left top all right so let's
choose position seven and save that and
let's go back to our home page and here
you can see the latest posts now this
core module doesn't show anything else
except for the title there are modules
out there that you can add you can show
the title maybe the first paragraph and
also an image if you have images in your
blog those look a little nicer and just
have better functionality I'm not going
to go into that but one one of them that
I do use is called ADA news I think it's
a ID a news which is very handy and it
has it looks good
so yeah last thing I want to do here is
I want to have some blog categories in
the sidebar so that people can just
filter by category and we have we don't
have a module to do that to switch
category so what I will do is create a
new menu and call it category menu
you don't have to do this this is just
something that I like to do when I build
vlogs so if we go to menus category menu
add new menu item and what we're going
to do is just select category blog again
and we're going to restrict it to only
the web design category and we're going
to click Save and you do the same thing
category blog and this will be for web
programming
same thing
SEO
web hosting okay so save that and go to
module manager and we want a new module
and that'll be a menu and we want to
choose category menu from the side here
and we'll say blog categories we'll put
it in position in seven and we only want
this only on the page selected we want
to clear all the selections and we only
want it on the blog pages blog and
obviously we want on the category menu
pages as well okay save that and now if
we go to our blog reload now we have our
blog categories I'm gonna get rid of
this featured articles here that's just
a module that I built that I was working
on
so I'm gonna disable that
all right so reload now we have a nice
blog page we have the intro text we have
the latest posts the categories you can
see you can filter now this only shows
the web design category posts we have
comment functionality
it displays the author so now this
you'll see the hits are back in the
icons and to get rid of that you just
need to go to each category and do what
we did earlier under article options you
want to hide all the icons I mean you
can keep them it's just I don't really
like to have them I
so I mean that's it there are some
there's are some more third party
extensions you can have to enhance the
functionality you can have maybe an
author avatar or an about the author
blurb at the end of each post and
there's just a whole bunch of stuff you
can do but this is a base Joomla blog
that you can add to so it's really
helpful to have so you can have dynamic
content on your site always updating
your content because search engines like
that so you know just generally just
bring in more hits to your website so
that's it for this tutorial please
