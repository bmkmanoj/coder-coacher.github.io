so a few days ago I created an AJAX
crash course where we looked at Ajax and
xhr the XML HTTP object which is used to
make asynchronous calls from your
browser to a server and you know get
data asynchronously and so on now there
was a comment from someone that had
mentioned that they think that xhr is
outdated so I don't personally agree
with that I don't think that that those
terms outdated deprecated should be
thrown around and the reason for that is
because when someone is learning
JavaScript like let's say right now
someone wants to learn JavaScript they
have to learn about xhr and Ajax they
can't just go right to the fetch API you
know because they're gonna run into this
at least for the next ten years you have
new standards like fetch that aren't
even fully compatible a lot of the
different parts aren't even fully
compatible with every browser so these
are very new technologies so you can't
just you can't just throw away the old
ones okay especially when they're very
reliable they've been used for a while
and they're used in you know millions
and millions of applications so I don't
agree with that but I do agree that you
should learn newer standards okay I
believe that you should learn the older
ones you know get wrap your head around
that and then move on to things like
fetch just like with JavaScript I
believe you should learn es5 first and
then move on to es6 because you're gonna
run into it but enough of that what
we're gonna do is we're gonna focus on
fetch today we're gonna build this
sandbox thing here I actually added some
bootstrap styles and made it look nice
we're not gonna do that till the end
because I want to focus on the API first
and then we'll just you know for fun
we'll make it look nice but basically
we're gonna do kind of the same stuff
that we did within the Ajax crash course
where we fetch data from a text file
asynchronously we fetched from a local
JSON file we also fetch from an external
API okay we use the github API in the
Ajax video we're going to use the JSON
placeholder API in this video
which allows you to make all kinds of
requests so basically this button here
if I click it it's going to get the text
asynchronously from a text file this one
will get JSON and get all the users and
display them in the browser and then
this one will actually fetch from the
Jason placeholder and it'll get a
hundred posts with titles and bodies and
we'll put that in the browser
alright we're also going to make a post
request to the API you'll see if I say
test actually let me open up my console
so if I say test and then test test body
and we submit that will actually make a
post request using fetch and it'll give
us a response you'll see the ID is 101
initially it's a hundred different posts
so I the ID being 101 shows you that
we've basically added a new post okay it
doesn't physically get added to their
database but it does you know make a
successful response so that's what we'll
be building we're also gonna learn a
little bit about some new es6
technologies like arrow functions and
template strings you can see we're using
a template string here which is much
easier than doing the old concatenation
which is what we did in the Ajax course
but like I said you should know both
ways okay so yeah that's what we'll be
doing guys hopefully you enjoy it and
let's go ahead and jump into it hey guys
I've just created a new discord server
that's open to the public the goal is to
have a place where people can go to help
each other out for programming issues as
well as just a place to discuss new
ideas and get feedback I also check in
daily there's a channel to request
videos on YouTube and much more so if
you want to check it out just go to
discord GG slash traversing media
alright guys so we're gonna get started
here I'm using Visual Studio code I'm
also using the live server extension if
you want that you can click on the
little extension icon search for a live
server and just go ahead and install
that okay if you're using atom atom live
server is another good option if you're
using xampp just any any kind of server
you need to use okay what else npm has a
bunch of them npm install - g live -
server will give you
a nice little one a nice little autoload
server as well so I have a folder here
called fetch sandbox I'm gonna create an
index.html file alright and we're just
gonna put some basic head body tags
stuff I use Emmet so I did exclamation
tab if you want to use Emmet on another
editor like Adam or sublime text you'll
have to install it as a plugin so for
the title let's say fetch API sandbox
and we're going to actually its first of
all just add a button in here so we'll
say button we'll give it an ID of get
text and let's say get text alright now
to run this on live server I'm just
going to right click and say open with
live server and that's gonna open it up
in our browser alright so we have our
button now let's go ahead and put some
script tags down here and we need to add
an event listener so we'll say document
dot get element by ID as the idea of get
text and then we just want to add an
event listener what so add event
listener the event we want to listen to
is a click and then we want to run a
function called get text all right so
let's create that function get text and
let's just do a console dot log and
we'll just log let's just log one two
three
all right so we'll reload let's make
sure Chrome tools is open with the
console click the button and we get one
two three all right so what we want to
do is we want to fetch a text file okay
asynchronously so let's create a new
file over here and I'm just going to
call it sample dot txt and inside here
I'm just gonna say I am a sample text
file and save and we can close that up
okay so we're gonna call the fetch
function here whoops and then it's going
to take in a parameter which is going to
be either a URL or a file name whatever
it is you're trying to get
our case is sample dot text now fetch
returns a promise so what that means is
it's kind of like a placeholder for the
response that we're gonna get
asynchronously so to work with promises
we need to use dot then okay make sure
you don't have a semicolon right here
it just goes dot then if you want to put
this on the same line like that you can
do that as well but I like to put it on
a separate line so this then is going to
take in a function and then what's
passed in here res or response whatever
you want to use and we're gonna console
dot log that res that response
okay so let's save that and click the
button and it gives us a response with
some stuff here gives us the status you
can see 200 if you watch the Ajax crash
course you know 200 is the status that
we want that means that everything went
okay I've found the file or the URL
gives us status text of okay gives us
the URL of the file so just a basic
response now what we want to do is we
want to get the text okay now there's
different I guess functions you could
call them so for instance if we say dot
text like that okay that's going to give
us the response of the promise with the
text you can see right here promise
value is I am sample text file whatever
is in that file if this was Jason then
we would want to do res dot Jason okay
now I want to get the actual text not
just this promise status and value so
what we need to do is return this res
dot text right here and not just log it
so we'll get rid of the console.log and
then we'll just say return all right and
then we need to add another dot then
okay so dot then and we're going to put
a function in here and then this is
going to give us our data so we can pass
in data and then
we can console dot log data okay we'll
save it and then we click the button and
now we're getting the actual text that's
in the file all right so this this is
cleaner than you know a standard xhr
Ajax request but we can make it look a
little better if you want to use arrow
functions so what I'm gonna do just to
show you the difference is comment this
out and then we'll do fetch sample
sample dot txt and same thing we're
gonna do dot then except we're just
going to take the response and we're
going to use an arrow right here and
we're gonna say we want that to res dot
text like that and then we'll do our
second dot then and in here we'll take
the data and use an arrow function and
say console dot log data that semicolon
shouldn't be there so let's save that
and click the button and we get the same
result so this looks much cleaner than
this okay but it's up to you what you
want to do now if you want to do
something else with the data aside from
just logging it with this one line then
you're gonna have to set it to a code
block or to a set of curly braces all
right and what I want to do is insert it
into the Dom into the web page so I'm
gonna put a div up here with an ID of
output and then in here what we'll do is
we'll say document dot get element by D
output and let's set that equal to the
data okay so now we'll save that click
the button what did I do
oh nice forgot to do inner HTML
there we go so now we're taking that
that data that's being fetched and we're
putting it into into the browser all
right so that's a simple text file oh
one more thing if you want to catch
errors with these promises you can
actually add on dot catch and pass in
error actually what we'll do is say
error and set it to an arrow and then
just console dot log error all right so
now let's do a JSON file so I'm gonna
create a new file called users dot Jason
so I bought those freaking seagulls out
there and I'm gonna grab I'm just gonna
copy this so this is the same JSON file
we used in the Ajax crash course it's
just a couple users couple of walking
dead users and what we'll do is copy
actually let's create a new button
so we'll do button we'll give it an ID
of let's say get users all right
so we'll create another event listener
and this will be get users it's going to
call a function called get users let's
create that function down here okay
actually I need to put in the word
function all right so let's see forget
users pretty much doing the same thing
so we're gonna say fetch users dot jason
and we want to do i keep spelling fetch
wrong so fetch users dot jason then we
want to do our dot then and we're gonna
take the response and this time instead
of setting it to res dot txt we're gonna
do res dot jason like that alright and
then we need our second dot then and in
here actually i'm not going to use that
semicolon in here we're gonna get our
data set an arrow function to a code
block and let's go ahead and get ready
to put this output into the browser so
we're gonna set a variable called output
notice i'm using let i'm going to be
using he has six standards in this video
so we'll say let output equals and let's
just make this an h2 to begin with so
we'll say h2 users and then what i'm
gonna do is i'm going to loop through
our result actually you know what let's
console.log our result first just so you
can see that it actually works so we'll
console.log data
let's click get users and there's our
three users okay so we're going to look
through these and i'm gonna do it a
little different than I did in the Ajax
course we're gonna use the dot for each
okay so we can do this with arrays dot
for each and then pass in a function and
then we need an identifier so let's
let's say user all right and then for
each iteration we want to add on to that
output variable so we want to add on or
a pen
and we do that with a plus equals okay
now I'm also going to use template
strings here so we want to use backticks
not single quotes these are backticks
these are to the left of your number one
key so with with template strings we
don't have we can just have multiple
lines we don't have to you know
concatenate with quotes and plus signs
and all that we can just simply put in
some HTML here so let's go ahead and put
a ul will close that ul and we'll put in
some hell I tags and in here let's get
the ID now if you want to insert a
variable which we want from this user
right here because it's looping through
and then we can access each user with
this so to put a variable in here you
need to use money sign and then curly
braces see how it changes color and then
we can say user dot ID okay we can
access any of these values ID email or
name okay so we're gonna get the ID
we're also going to get the name so
that'll be user dot name and then we're
going to get the email so that'll be
user dot email all right so that's gonna
get all that stuff in that output
variable then we want to go outside of
the loop and we want to grab let's say
document dot get element by ID we want
the output element and we want to say
dot inner HTML and set that to that
output variable and save get users and
there we go okay so this is a much nicer
way of doing it then we did in the Ajax
crash course okay but again this isn't
these are newer standards you know so in
my opinion you need to know both ways
all right so let's see what else we want
to do here now let's fetch data from an
outside API so we're gonna use this JSON
placeholder and you can fetch post
comments albums photos to do's and users
we're gonna grab some posts
click that you'll see they'll give us a
hundred posts if we go all the way down
here you'll see the last one has an idea
of 100 so what we want to do is create
another button I'm just going to see
I'll just copy this so for this one
we'll say actually I'm gonna change this
text to get Jason and this one will be
get API data all right and then we'll
change this button ID to get posts and
then we want another event listener you
can see the pattern here so get posts
and we're gonna call a function called
get posts alright let's go down here and
let's actually copy get users cuz it's
pretty similar so we'll change this to
get posts and instead of fetching you
know a local file we're gonna grab this
URL right here so we'll copy that paste
that in okay we it is Jason so we want
to keep this line let's see we also want
for let's see the output right here
let's change this to posts and then in
the output if we look at what we have
available we have an ID we have a title
and a body so let's use those but
instead of using a UL here what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna put in a div and
later on we're gonna add some bootstrap
classes to these but we'll have a div
and then we'll do an H let's do an h2 so
what I did h2 now h3 and this is where
the title will go so we can use these
variables we can say let's use post here
because we're not working we're not the
data is not users anymore it's posts so
we'll change that to post and we'll say
post dot title
all right and then we'll put in a
paragraph and we'll say post dot body
all right and we'll put it in the output
so let's save let's go back and click
that and you'll see we get all of those
posts
all right so pretty easy so now what I'm
gonna do is create a form so we can make
an actual post request to the API so
let's see we're gonna put the form let's
see actually know what I want to do is
put an HR right here above the the
output and under the output will put our
form okay so the form is gonna have an
ID of add post okay and let's see inside
the form let's put a div and inside here
we're going to have an input
let's do input type text and we need to
give it an ID of title let's also give
it a placeholder of title and then we'll
copy that div will add the bootstrap
stuff later don't worry this is going to
be body actually this is gonna be a text
area so I'm going to change this okay
let's change the placeholder to body all
right and then we just need an input
of submit and give it a value of submits
alright so there's our form let's save
it looks horrible but that's fine now we
need to add an event listener here now
this is going to be an event listener
for our forum let's go ahead and copy
this okay so remember the forum has an
ID of add post so we wanted to add an
event listener except this time it's
going to be a submit and we want to call
add post okay that's the function we
want so let's go down to the bottom here
and create a function called add post
okay now since it's a forum we're gonna
pass in an event parameter we're gonna
say e dot prevent default which is going
to stop it from actually submitting to a
file alright now what we want to do here
is we want to get the values of the
title and the body fields so let's
create some variables we'll say let
title equals document dot get element by
D gave it an ID of title and we want to
get the value okay let's do the same
thing for the body
I'll change this right here to body and
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
call fetch okay now inside here we're
gonna put our URL which is gonna be it's
gonna be the same URL is this that we
made the get request to because if you
look at the the routes for this API you
can make a post request to slash posts
okay just like you can make a get
request to slash posts so we'll go ahead
and paste that in alright now this is
actually going to take a second
parameter which is going to be an object
with with some stuff here so we want to
add in a method we want to let it know
that this is a post method okay we also
want to add in some headers all right so
for headers this is actually going to be
an object and we're gonna say accept
so for accept we want Jason so
application slash Jason and also let's
say text slash plain and let's say
anything slash anything and then we also
want to apply the content type okay so
content type is going to be application
Jason there should be a comma there
alright so those are the headers that we
need and then we need a body
okay so body is going to be where we
apply the data now we have our variables
here but it needs to be inside it needs
to be jason so it needs to be inside of
curly braces and then we're going to say
title
I'll say title title body body now we
just want to wrap this in a function
called Jason dot stringify okay which
will actually convert it to a string
before it's sent okay and then we just
need to go down here and just like we
did with all the other requests we need
to do a dot then we're gonna set res to
res dot Jason and then we're gonna do
dot then and we're gonna say data and
then we can do whatever we want with the
respondent the data that is responded
we're just gonna log it okay and the
response it gives you is the actual post
that you're adding okay all right so
let's see I think that that should do it
so that's a standard post request using
fetch so let's save let's go over here
and reload for good luck and let's say
title test body test body and submit and
there we go so that's our response you
can see it has an ID of 101 okay it's
not gonna get added to right here you're
not gonna see it on their site it's not
going to persist to the database but you
see it ends this ends at 100 so ours is
101 okay it just doesn't get persisted
so that's it as far as making our
requests um now there's there's more to
with the fetch API but I'm not gonna get
too deep into it this is just an
introductory now what I want to do is
just make this look a little better with
some bootstrap just for fun so let's go
to get bootstrap calm and we'll grab
we'll go to get started we'll grab just
the CDN for the CSS so this link right
here and we'll put that up in our
head area and let's see what are we
gonna do here as far as classes
let's wrap everything in a container by
the way if you're interested in
bootstrap for I do have a udemy course
on it called bootstrap for from scratch
with five projects let's see we're gonna
end the Dib right here so that wraps
everything in a container all right and
then let's see we're gonna wrap it's put
an h1 right here first of all let's give
this h1 a class of display - for I'm
also going to give it a class of MB 4
which is margin-bottom 4 just to push
things down and then we'll say fetch
fetch API sandbox alright and then all
these buttons here I'm going to wrap in
a div and I'm going to give this div a
class of D flex so we can use flexbox
and that'll just align everything and
then for each button let's give these
some classes so say BTN BTN secondary
secondary let's also do mr four which is
margin right four just to push the next
button over so go ahead and copy that
class paste it in here let's change it
to success make it green okay this
button here paste it in and we'll change
this one to yellow
alright let's see what that looks like
alright cool
actually the first one I wanted primary
not secondary I want that to be blue
alright so that's that now for the form
which looks horrendous let's add to
these divs right here a class of form
group and we'll add to these inputs a
class of form control ok and the submit
let's add a class of BTN and BTN
secondary and save and there we go now
for the responses let's go down here for
the get jason these users right here I'm
just going to make this ul a list group
give it a class of list group and then
these lis will give a class of list
group item I'll just copy that okay save
that there we go so that looks better
let's also give the d UL a class of
margin bottom three that way they're not
right on top of each other all right so
let's see what else we got here
for the API data let's go down there and
we're just going to give this div a
class of card and card body save that
and also let's do MB 3 oops what
happened
card there we go
and I think that's pretty much it oh
let's give this post this Sh to right
here we'll give that a class of mb mb
for cool i'll do it to the users h2 as
well and that's it
so now we have our fetch API sandbox now
if you guys want to read more about
fetch and maybe look into doing put
requests and things like that delete
requests maybe use some different api's
if you want there's some really good
public API is out there or maybe even
create your own maybe use you know
create an express mongoose api or
something some kind of restful interface
but that's gonna be it for now guys
hopefully you enjoyed this and you
learned a little something about fetch
and maybe a little something about es6
so that's it and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
