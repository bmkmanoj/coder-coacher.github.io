in this series we're going to be
covering the fundamentals of angular 2
it will be multiple videos I'm not
exactly sure how many I'm guessing
between 7 and 10 we will go over the
differences between angular 1 and 2 but
I'm not really going to focus on the
syntax of anything from angular 1
because people that don't know it it's
just going to confuse them alright so
we'll be solely focusing on angular 2 in
this course so what is angular before we
get into what angular 2 is and any
differences let's talk about what it
actually is so it's a client-side
framework for building powerful dynamic
web applications using javascript
alright so it runs on the client meaning
it runs on the user's computer in the
browser on their machine doesn't it
doesn't run on any kind of external
server anywhere else all right it's it's
referred to as what HTML would be if it
was made for dynamic web apps all right
we all know that hTML was created to
build static websites but if it was made
to build dynamic web apps it would look
a lot like angular ok we have custom
tags that we can add functionality to
all right and angular they're called
directives so angular has a very modular
code structure meaning that one part of
the code is totally separate from
another part especially in ngo to where
we're working with components more so
than angular 1 where we had scope and
controllers and all that stuff
components really make it very modular
which is a good thing so what is angular
not it's not a library like jQuery or
underscore or something like that it's
not a design pattern like MVC or mvvm
and it's not a plug-in or any kind of
extension okay it's a framework and it's
commonly used for single page
applications or spas which are web apps
that load a single HTML page and then
dynamically update that page depending
on the users interaction with the
okay so we don't have a bunch of
different pages like like a static
website so what's new in angular 2 so
angular 2 is much different than angular
1 so even if you know angular 1 you're
going to still have to do some learning
because things are very different so the
biggest difference is components its
component based there's actually no more
controllers there's no more scope
everything is done inside of the
component alright it also uses a lot of
es6 or es2015 syntax and it also uses
typescript which is a superset of
JavaScript and it really simplifies
things like components and metadata
things like that it also uses reactive
extensions for JavaScript and this gives
us observables and it gives us a method
to work with asynchronous data much like
we did with promises in angular 1 all
right you can still use promises in
angular 2 as well but observables for
the most part work much better so let's
take a look at some of the reasons for
angular 2 why why all the changes so for
one thing they wanted to make it more
modular more reusable code whether
that's code that's reused on the same
application or another application
performance it is it's faster than
angular 1 ok performs better there's a
better learning curve there's better
mobile support it uses the newer
JavaScript syntax es6 or ES 2015 and it
also uses observables over promises
alright there's other reasons as well
but these are some of the big ones so
typescript typescript is a superset of
JavaScript and it compiles to plain
JavaScript alright so it adds static
typing so we can define things as
strings or numbers boolean or whatever
it may be they get it gets transpiled at
runtime so what that means is when we
run the application it then gets
compiled
into regular JavaScript and then the
browser can can actually process it as
JavaScript all right now typescript
gives us much cleaner code and it also
runs on all browsers alright so the
JavaScript data compiles is compatible
with most modern browsers so some of the
benefits of typescript so it gives us
class in module support it's more
compatible with the es6 or es2015 syntax
it gives us a clearer API library
support for javascript packaging and the
syntax is a little closer to something
like Java or Scala or some other type of
object oriented program language so
there's a lot of different ways to start
to build an angular 2 app the most
common way I think is to use the angular
2 QuickStart ok so if we go to the
angular aisle website there's a big
button that says get started and that's
going to take you to a kind of like a
little tutorial that's going to tell you
to download the QuickStart
so what's included with this QuickStart
there's a package.json file and that has
obviously all the information
description of the application that
stuff but it also has all the
dependencies all right so that you can
just get the quick start and run npm
install and it'll set all that up for
you
it also includes the app component every
angular 2 application has a root app
component and then all of the custom
components are built off of that the
bootstrap function that's the function
that the app component is passed into
and then that will bootstrap the angular
2 app it also has the index.html file
with all those different script includes
and also of course typescript along with
the transpiler and the type definitions
okay so the transpiler will convert the
code from typescript to JavaScript at
runtime and if that sounds like absolute
gibberish don't worry about it it's not
as difficult as it seems so if you look
at the package.json file
quick start this is what you'll see for
dependencies okay we have angular 2
obviously system J s is a modules loader
for common J s modules and AMD modules
es6 six shim has to do with
compatibility and es6 reflect metadata
reactive extensions which is gives us
observables zone j s concurrently so we
can run different scripts concurrently
light server is a really light
development server that we can use
typescript of course and then Taipings
which is takes care of the the type
definitions for typescript all right so
hopefully I didn't bore you to death
with slides in the next video we're
going to jump in set up our environment
will download the QuickStart and we'll
go from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
