another project series in this series
we'll be building an application using
Python as well as the flask framework
now that may surprise some of you
because I haven't done too much with
Python on my channel but I've been using
it off of YouTube quite a bit and I've
really grown to like it and I think a
lot of you guys could benefit by at
least getting your feet wet with with
the Python programming language okay
even if you've never used it before I
would suggest watching it because you
should be able to follow along as as
long as you have some basic
understanding of programming principles
and if you've ever used an MVC type of
framework and you understand routing and
views and stuff like that
you should be just fine the only thing
is I would suggest that you watch the
Python crash course that I did about a
week ago before doing this project all
right now flask is a micro framework
which in general means that it has very
little dependencies to external
libraries it's also very light and it
gives us the freedom to basically do
what we want alright so this is the
application here now as far as
functionality we have full
authentication you can see we can go to
the register page and we're using the
flask WTF or WTF or WT forms I believe
it is and that comes along with some
really nice validation you'll see if we
try to submit
we'll get the validation info under each
form here under each field and once we
register we can log in so I already have
an account so I'll just go ahead and
login and that will take us to a
dashboard you can see it says welcome
and then the username we're using flash
messaging we have some articles so
that's basically what I used as just a
crud resource so we could do create read
update and delete and you see we have an
ID title author date we can edit the
articles we can create articles with the
title and body and you can add more
fields if you want and you can see I
implemented a WYSIWYG editor we're using
CK forms for that and go ahead and
create an hour
I'll just say another article and in
here the body I believe it has to be at
least 30 characters that's what I set it
to so I'm just going to paste some text
in and submit and I can see we have our
article okay now as far as the the front
end we can view the articles even if we
log out we can still go to articles we
can see the title click on one that
takes us to the individual page for that
article we also have an about page and
that's pretty much it so on the surface
it's very very simple but there is quite
a bit of code as we're doing everything
basically from scratch now as far as a
dev environment I'm using Linux Ubuntu
which is obviously UNIX based if you're
using Linux or Mac you should be able to
follow along pretty much exact but for
Windows you will need to download Python
from Python org you know run the
executable go through the installation
and you'll also have to set up pip which
is the Python package manager and if
enough of you are having issues with
that and you can't find any other
resource let me know in the comments and
I'll see if I can do a an extra video to
show you how to get that set up alright
now we will be using MySQL as our
database so we're going to get that
installed - if you're using Windows you
might want to look into xampp
which i've worked with quite a bit on my
channel if you guys have been following
along that gives you basically apache
gives you an Apache server PHP as well
as MySQL it says Maria DB here with but
that's just a drop-in for MySQL alright
so as far as um python 2 or 3 you can
use either for what we're doing it
really doesn't matter as long as if
you're using 3 it's 3.3 or higher okay
because flask does not support Python
3.2 or older than that okay so I think
that's it as far as you know explaining
the application and what we're doing so
let's go ahead and get started alright
guys so we're going to go ahead and get
started on our flask application now you
need to have Python installed
obviously if I'm using Linux Ubuntu and
it comes packaged with Python two and
three so if I were to do Python versions
I have two point seven point twelve and
I can also do Python three version and
we have three point five point two which
should be fine so what I want to do
first is install pip which is basically
the package manager for Python so we
want to do sudo apt-get install and I'm
going to say Python three - pip okay so
I actually already had it installed
that's why it went so quick let's see
what I want to do now now we're going to
use pip to install flask I'm just going
to go to my project folder first so see
what I have here so I have a folder
called PI or Python apps I'm going to go
in there and let's make a folder or a
directory and I'm going to call this my
flask app and it'll CD into that alright
so now what I want to do like I said is
install flask so we'll say pip install
flask alright I actually already had it
installed so it went really quick now
I'm getting this message saying that I
can upgrade pip if I want to but I'm
going to just ignore that so what we
need to do now is I'm going to open up
the folder in my editor now I'm using
atom but you can use whatever you'd like
in the crash course of Python crash
course I used Eclipse but I used it
because I wanted to basically run the
the Python interpreter within the IDE
when I'm doing web development with
Django or flask I want to use either
atom sublime text or Visual Studio code
okay those are the three that I kind of
switch back and forth from so I'm going
to open up the project folder and it's
going to be my flask app okay so the
first file we want to create is going to
be called app dot pi and this is
basically like the entry file if you're
familiar with node
you know that there's there's one file
that kind of leads to everything else
and it's usually a PJs or index J s
server J as something like that this is
kind of what that is all right it'll
probably make a few references to no js'
because i know a lot of you guys work
with JavaScript and node so what we want
to do here first is just import flask so
we can say from flask we want to import
uppercase F flask okay so that's going
to bring it in and then we want to
create an instance of the flask class so
let's say app equals flask and then we
need to wrap in here double underscore
name double underscore so this is kind
of like a placeholder for the current
module so in this case app dot pi and
then down at the bottom this is going to
be at the bottom of the file we want to
test to see if that value that double
underscore name value is equal to double
underscore main okay because that means
that it's the script that's going to be
executed and then right in there
oops we're going to put a colon here
what we want to do is just run the
application so we'll say app dot run and
just this code here should allow us to
actually start the application so if we
were to save this and go over here clear
this out and we're just going to do
Python app dot pi and you can see it
started on on port 5,000 so I'm going to
go to my browser and go to localhost
port 5000 okay so initially we're going
to get this not found the reason for
that is because we haven't created a
route for our home our index so let's go
back to app dot pi and we can now take
this app variable we can say add app and
say dot route and in here we want the
route which is going to be just a slash
and say we want to create a function
right here
and say def let's call it index you can
actually call it whatever you'd like and
then we're just going to return
let's return a string called index all
right this should actually be on the
same level as the row all right so let's
save it and we'll go back and reload
okay now we're going to have to restart
the server and then reload and you see
we get index now it's kind of a pain in
the ass to have to keep restarting for
instance if I put in index two right
here and reload it's not updated okay we
have to restart the server if you don't
want to have to do that you can put it
in you can put your application into
debug mode so you can do app dot debug
equals true or you could simply pass
into the run right here debug equals
true excuse me so I'll save that and
then we'll restart one one more time and
you can see it says debugger is active
and if we go reload we have index two if
I were to take that out and save reload
and now you can see it updated and we
didn't have to restart the server so as
you can see it's pretty simple to create
a route in in flask now normally we're
not going to return a string like this
we're going to return a template so we
can use a function called render
template but that has to be imported
from flask as well so right here we're
going to bring in render underscore
template and then we can simply say
actually we want to return render
template and then pass in here let's say
index alright because we want to render
a template called index.html actually we
should put that as well HTML so let's go
over here and create a folder called
templates and it's going to look inside
here and it's going to look for
index.html so let's create that
Oh actually you know what I don't want
to call it index let's call it home so
let me just rename that to home dot HTML
and then back here will render home HTML
so in the HTML file I'm just going to
say home we'll save that and reload and
you can see it's now displaying home
it's reading from from that template
alright so next thing we're going to do
is we're going to look at layouts so we
don't want to have to repeat ourselves
and put HTML head tags body tags on
every single template we want to have a
layout that will include the include
that stuff and then wrap the current
view or the current template so what we
can do is in templates create a new file
called layout dot HTML and here we can
put our you know our normal HTML head
tags and body tags and all that for the
title just say my flask apt and we can
include our scripts and all that and
then in the body what we want to do is
we want to use this syntax the curly
braces and then percent symbols okay and
then we'll say block body and then we
want to end this looks so they need to
do that we want to end this with n block
so now that we have this block we can go
into our home file we can extend this
layout file and then insert content into
here ok and have this wrap that view or
that template so if we go back to home
let's go and say please do extends so
extend layout HTML and then we want
those block tags so say block body and
then we want to end it
and then here we'll just say home all
right so now if we save that make sure
layout saved as well and we go and
reload you'll see that now in the title
bar it says my flask app and if we look
at the source code it includes the head
the body all that stuff that's in the
layout file so now we don't have to
repeat this stuff on every single
template or every view when I say
template in view it's basically the same
thing so now we want to do is we're
going to use bootstrap for this now
initially I was going to use the flask
bootstrap module but it's a little weird
and I think it would kind of throw some
some of you guys off it doesn't allow
you to use your own layout HTML you have
to extend theirs and then put in
separate blocks or everything so it's a
little weird so what I'm going to do is
just use the CDN so let's go to
bootstrap CDN calm and we'll just grab
this CSS file here and then in the head
and the layout we're going to say link
style sheets and then we'll include that
href so we'll paste it in right there we
also want to include the JavaScript I'm
going to put that right above the ending
body tag so let's say script and we want
to do that don't want that so source
equals and we'll copy this right here
and paste that in alright so now
bootstrap should be enabled if we save
and we go back reload and now you can
see the fonts different and there's no
padding on the sides and top here all
right so now that we have bootstrap
another thing we're going to want on
every single page is a nav bar so to do
that we want to put it in the layout
because everything in the layout is
going to show on every page now instead
of putting all the mark-up right here in
the layout I'm going to use an include
so in the templates folder I'm going to
create a new folder called includes
and in here we're going to create a new
file and I'm going to call it underscore
yeah underscore navbar dot HTML and I
used an underscore because it's only a
partial file alright so let's go to get
bootstrap calm and go to getting started
and then two examples and I'm going to
click on the starter template do a
control U and we're going to grab this
nav tag right here okay so we'll paste
that in nav bar I'm going to change a
couple things I'm going to get rid of
the fixed top class I'm also going to
change navbar inverse to navbar default
that will make it lighter and then the
project name will just say my flask app
okay menu here home is going to go to
slash about is going to go to slash
about and then we're also going to have
an articles link here and that's going
to go to slash articles these aren't
going to work yet though and then I just
want to remove this class active so
we'll save that now to include it in our
layout all we have to do is use that
these tags and we can simply say include
and then we want to include under Stone
includes which is the folder it's in
underscore nav our dot HTML so let's see
if that works
good so now we have a nav bar these
links aren't going to work yet just the
home now I want to move everything
that's down here into a container class
so it's pushed over to the side so what
I'll do is just wrap the body block here
in the class of container
all right we'll save that and now reload
and that gets pushed over so let's see
the next thing I want to do I guess we
could just add the home the home content
the HTML so we'll go to home HTML and
I'm just going to grab this it's really
simple just paste it in so we have a div
with the class of jumbotron and Tech
Center we have an h1 and then we have a
paragraph with the class of lead okay
whether it's a sentence here and you can
you could put whatever you want so if I
save that and reload
there's our home page so now we'll do is
add the about route so let's go back to
app PI and right here we'll do app dot
route and then the URL is going to be
slash about and we need to put in a
function so def call this about and we
want to return render template and this
is going to be about HTML save that and
then let's create the template okay and
I'm going to copy what we have in home
okay this is basically the core
structure of all our pages it's going to
extend layout and have a block body okay
but we want to get rid of that and let's
just do an h1 say about us and then a
paragraph and let's see in the paragraph
I'm just going to type in lorem and then
tab and that gives us a bunch of dummy
text all right so if you're using atom
you can do that then we'll save that and
now we should be able to go to about
good so home and about is pretty much
taken care of I do want to login and
register button here but we're not going
to add that just yet so let's let's
let's do the articles now I'm not going
to do anything with MySQL in this video
but what I will do is create a file that
will hold the data for our articles and
then we can pull the the articles out of
that file and put them into the page so
and we're just doing that for now later
on we're going to implement a database
so I'm going to create a new file in the
root here called data dot pi and then in
here what we're going to do is define a
function called articles okay and then
in here we're going to create a variable
called articles and set that to a set of
brackets and then each article is going
to go in these curly braces okay so each
article will have an ID in this case
we'll just use one it'll have a name
they'll say article 1 actually I want
this to be title not name okay we'll
have a body I'm just going to type lorem
and then tab and we want to comma at the
end here okay and then after body we're
going to have author just going to put
my name and then we launch a create date
okay for now we're just going to use a
string I'll say oh four to five 2017 all
right so there's one article let's go
ahead and just copy this and then we'll
put a comma paste it in again change
this to two two and we'll change the
author okay and then we'll put well put
a comma we'll do one more this will be
three and that should be fine now in
order to use this data we have to export
it so we're going to go down here and
not export but return articles and that
should do it so let's save it and now we
should be able to import that for in
here we'll say from
data because that's what we call the
data pie we want to import articles okay
and then let's see let's go right here
and we're going to create a variable
called articles and set it equal to that
articles function to the return value
which is going to be articles which is
this here alright and now what we want
to do is create a new route just copy
this and this is going to be slash
articles change the name of the function
okay it's going to render a template
called articles but we want to also pass
in the data so to do that we can just
add in a second parameter and we'll say
articles equals articles okay which is
the data and then we'll save it and
let's go to templates and create a new
file called articles dot HTML and then
in here I'm just going to copy what we
have in home doesn't really matter and
we'll get rid of this stuff and what we
want to do is loop through we want to
loop through these articles so let's put
in first an h1 okay and then under that
we're going to use a for loop okay so we
need to use these percent symbols and
just to let you know when when we use
the percent it's it's logic okay when we
want to insert a variable or dynamic
value we use the double double curly
braces and this is all from the ninja
templates template engine okay that's
what we're using not ninja Jinja ji n J
a so in here we're going to do four
seriously for article in articles and
then we need to end that down here
by saying n4 so this right here this
article's is coming from here okay which
includes the data which is coming from
our file
okay the data file so let's go back here
and then for each article we're going to
just output the name so remember this is
value so we use the double curly braces
and we can say article dot title alright
so we'll save that lets go click on
articles and there we go article one two
and three so I want to put these in a ul
so let's open up ul and we'll give this
a class of list group which is a
bootstrap class okay go down here and
we'll end it and then for each loops for
each one for each article it should be
wrapped in allies with a class of list
group item alright so let's save that
and reload and there we go now we want
these to be wrapped in a link that's
going to go to the individual article so
right here let's put in an a tag and
this is going to go to articles slash
and then the ID okay we're just going to
go in double curly braces and article
dot ID all right and then let's end that
a tag save that and now you'll see that
it goes to articles slash and then
whatever that idea is okay so we need to
create a route for that so let's go back
to app dot pi and we're going to just
copy this and we'll paste that in so
this is going to go to articles slash
and then the ID which is going to be a
dynamic value so we can't just put in a
1 here because it would always be 1 so
what we can do is put in some angle
brackets and say the type of day
we want as a string and it's going to
have a value or not a value but a
parameter of ID then we can pass the ID
into the function and we can use it okay
I'm actually going to put a slash here
so in here we can use this ID now later
on what we'll do is take this ID make a
query to MySQL to fetch to that
particular article and then pass it
along since we're not using MySQL yet
I'm just going to pass along the ID
itself and we'll change it later all
right so I would see this app route
articles let's change that function to
just article and you can do excellent
yeah let's take the S off there just so
it's not confusing okay but we'll also
have to change it in the articles HTML
right here all right
so last thing we need to do for that to
work is create the actual template
article dot HTML so let me make sure we
yeah we have to change this take off
that s we want to render the article
template okay so now we'll go back to
article and we're going to have to
extend the layout okay and then we'll
have our body block
and n block okay so in here all I'm
going to do is put in an h1 and then put
in the ID that's being passed in okay so
if we reload and click on one of these
now it will show the ID and no matter
what this value is it'll use that so if
we put 100 it's going to display 100
okay but like I said when we implement
MySQL we'll be we'll be passing in the
entire article all right so let's see
we're add now I think this may be a good
place to stop so in the next video what
we'll do is we'll install MySQL we will
install the flask MySQL module and we'll
start to work on the user registration
ok we'll create the form and possibly
the logic and we'll go from there all
right so if you guys like this please
