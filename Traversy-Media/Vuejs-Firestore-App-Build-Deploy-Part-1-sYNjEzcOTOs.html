another project series in this series
we're gonna be building and deploying a
view j/s application that uses firestore
on its back-end so firestore is similar
to the real time database that firebase
offers but it's supposed to be more
scalable so it's supposed to have a more
of an intuitive data model it's also
easier to administer so once we build
this application we're gonna compile it
for production and we're gonna push it
to github pages for hosting okay since
we're using firebase which is a cloud
database it's not an actual back-end
that we have to manage we can use just a
simple shared hosting account or
something like github pages so we're
gonna set up a workflow where you can
easily update the app and then you can
compile it and then easily push it to
your live site okay and as you can see I
already have it deployed but I'm gonna
delete this after and we're gonna start
from scratch you can see it's on my brad
traversée github do and I just want to
give you a quick demo so we just list
our employees here and each employee has
a department so we have IT and sales and
we're ordering them by department and if
we go down over here you'll see we have
this eye icon if I click that it takes
us to the employee page where it shows
us the employee ID the department there
in the position we can delete the
employee if we want so if I go ahead and
click delete click ok and you can see
that employee was deleted we can edit
the employee by clicking this button
down here and and as I should mention
we're using materialized CSS so let's
say we want to change
Karen's position to let's say senior
sales person I don't even know if that's
a real position but doesn't matter we'll
click Submit and you can see it
redirects us back to her page and she's
now a senior sales person we can of
course add a new employee so we'll say
zero zero six for the ID name let's just
say
white Department will say IT position
will say say software engineer and
submit and you can see that now Harry
has been added okay so that's what we'll
be building guys will be building it
deploying it meant creating a fire store
which you can see here this is the
firebase back-end using the the new fire
store platform and we have all of our
employees here
alright so that's what we building
hopefully you guys enjoy it I apologize
if my voice is still a little raspy it's
taken me forever to get over this
infection or whatever the hell this is
but hopefully you enjoy the series and
let's get started hey guys if you've
been watching my videos for a while and
you really like what I do when I've
helped you out a lot
consider becoming a patron even for one
dollar per month it pushes me to keep
bringing you guys the best content I
possibly can there's reward tiers for
discounts for you to me courses personal
support and more so check out the
patreon link in the description below
for more info alright so the very first
thing we're gonna do is create our fire
store database so you want to make sure
you're logged in to Google and go to
consult firebase google.com and we're
gonna go ahead and create a new project
you can see I have this view FS dev this
is the initial project I created so I'm
going to create a new one called view FS
- prod and we're gonna create that
project okay so now that's been created
and what we want to do from here is go
over to database now I'm not going to
implement authentication we can look
into that in another video or possibly a
course I do plan on doing a view and
view X course but what we're gonna
choose here is the cloud firestore
option not the real time database so I'm
gonna say try fire store beta at the
time you're watching this it might not
still be in beta and we're gonna use
test mode okay so that we don't have to
authenticate or anything like that and
we'll click enable
and if you guys watched my angular
firestore series this is all the same
thing we're just setting up fire store
and you'll probably if you did watch
that and now you're gonna do this series
you'll notice that that view is actually
much easier to work with in angular I
love both frameworks but I think angular
is really good for a large projects I
think view is great for smaller projects
they're both great frameworks so let's
say add collection and we want to add a
collection called employees okay that's
gonna be our only collection and each
employee will have a couple different
fields so the disc document ID this is
basically the unique ID that firestore
uses this is auto-generated we don't
want to mess with this we do want an
employee ID though that we enter so
we're gonna say employee underscore ID
that's the field for this one we're
gonna just do 0 0 1 it doesn't really
matter what you use I'm just going from
0 0 1 0 0 2 and so on so the next thing
we want for this employee is the name
and let's do I will just say John Doe
he'll do another field this is gonna be
the department so dep t and we'll say
John Doe is in IT and then we'll do his
position and for the position will say
database admin and save and we should
get one we have our employees collection
here and we have one document in that
collection and you can see the different
fields so let's create another one so
we'll go add document and again employee
underscore ID we'll say 0 0 2 let's do
name I'll say Sara Johnson just making
up names here and then departments for
Sara let's say she's in sales and
position we'll just say sales
Sales Lead and save will go ahead and
add one more document so add document
ploy Eid zero zero three say name Sam
Smith Department is gonna be IT excuse
me
and position let's say server admin and
save alright so now we have our database
at least an our initial database that we
want to work with so now we're ready to
begin on our application alright guys so
first thing we're gonna do is we're
going to install the view CLI which is
the command line interface to create
view applications to compile them and
build them out to run the server and a
whole bunch of other stuff so we need to
install that globally and you're gonna
need nodejs installed because no js'
comes with the node package manager and
that's what we use to install it so if
you don't have node installed just go to
node.js org and download and install it
then you're gonna want to just do NPM
install - g4 global and then view - CLI
and I actually already have it installed
so mine may go faster than yours
all right so we'll clear that out next
thing we want to do is you want to go to
wherever you want to create your project
folder I'm in I'm in a folder called
projects this is where I want to create
it so I'm gonna just go ahead and save
you in it
I want to use webpack and then I'm gonna
call this employee manager okay so you
want view in it the template which we're
using webpack and then the name of the
application so that'll create a folder
called employee manager I will actually
have to go through these questions first
but it will create the application
folder for us so project name
description will say simple employee
spilt arrow
whatever doesn't matter
author so that's fine let's see so you
want to choose runtime and compiler you
can install you can install without the
compiler but it's only 6k lighter which
is nothing so you always want to choose
the compiler and we want the router so
we're gonna say yes yes lint I'm gonna
say no to that I don't like to use
linters and tutorials because I don't
want unnecessary errors that aren't
really errors they're just you know
formatting recommendations we're not
gonna use unit testing so we'll say no
no end-to-end testing and then I'm gonna
use NPM for my package manager but you
can also use yarn and then that's it all
right so this spawn II NPM II net error
I'm not sure exactly what that means it
doesn't effect anything but if you guys
know what that is then you can let us
know but let's go ahead and clear this
out so now we we've initialized our
projects let's CD into employee manager
and from here we're just gonna run npm
install and that will install all the
dependencies that we need so it'll take
a look at the package.json file all the
dependencies which we'll take a look at
and it's installing all those for us
well I'm really losing my voice it's
been like I don't almost a week okay so
now we want to do is one more thing to
install and that is firebase so npm
install firebase if you're using NPM
less than version 5 you want to make
sure you do - - save and it doesn't hurt
even if you are using version 5 but
that'll make sure that it's included in
your dependencies
all right so that should be all set now
what I want to do is open this folder up
in my code editor I'm using Visual
Studio code so I can simply say code dot
if you're using atom you can do atom dot
or you can just open it up you know
manually from within the editor close
the welcome page and there we go so now
this is our our application structure so
if we look at package dot Jason we have
in our main dependencies view itself the
view router and firebase and then all of
our dev dependencies including web pack
including tools to minify
tools to compile es6 and ES 6 plus with
babel so just a bunch of dev
dependencies and to start our server we
can do npm run dev or npm start to build
we can do NPM run build and that will
build it all out into static assets and
we'll do that towards the end
all right so close that up and if we
look in source that's our main
application so we have our main JS file
this is like the entry point where we
bring in view we bring in our main app
component we bring in the router we
instantiate view with a main element so
this is saying look for the div with the
ID of app or the element with the ID of
app and then insert the app template and
if we look at our index.html file excuse
me we have a div with the ID of app so
this is essentially where our view app
goes all right I'm just going to change
the title here look a little better all
right we'll save that and we should be
able to start our server up to this
point so what I'm going to do is open my
inline terminal or my integrated
terminal with control tilde or you can
go to view integrated terminal and we're
gonna run npm run dev and it should open
I believe on localhost 80 its 8080 by
default but I think I have something
open on that port so mine's 8080 one so
I'm gonna go ahead and just grab a
browser
and we'll go to localhost 8080 one and
here's our default view application I'm
just gonna snap it to the side here well
I have a lot of stuff open all right and
we'll go ahead and open up our chrome
console with f12 now you may you may
want to install the view extension for
your from chrome dev tools it can be
really helpful I'm not going to get into
that I want this to be kind of a quick
series focusing on just firestore and
view we're also not going to be using
view X which is the state manager I do
plan on doing more videos on view
because it's been a while
I actually am actually considering it
for either my next udemy course or the
one after the next because it is a great
framework
I actually prefer view overreact and I
know a lot of you guys are gonna hate me
for that but I do I prefer a view and
angular overreact but it's all
preference you know there is no best
framework it's it's all about preference
it's also about the the particular
project you're working on now what we're
looking at here is if you look in the
source and components it's this hello
world view dot view file and this is the
hello world component that comes
standard with the CLI and you can see we
basically just have a template a
template needs to have one single
element and then every everything inside
of that single element and down here you
can see where we have our script tags we
have the name of the component and then
the data object and then down here are
some simple styling all right so a view
component is very simple and that's what
I really like about it this message
right here this is this welcome to your
view j/s app and that's coming from this
right here okay so we're not going to
use this hello world component this is
just the the boilerplate what I want to
do now before we stop and get into the
next video is just create our firebase
config files so we're basically going to
need two files firebase config and
firebase and knit and I'm gonna put
those right in the components folder so
let's say new file
and we'll say firebase config dot J s
and let's also create a file called
firebase and knit dot J s ok camelcase
so we'll start with the let's start with
the config so we'll open that up and
then you need all your specific firebase
info or firestore info in here and you
need to export it as a default object so
we're gonna say export default and then
if we go to our fire store and let's go
just to the project overview and then
click Add firebase to your web app
you'll get all this information it'll be
completely different from mine but you
want to get everything that's in this
config object so I'm just gonna grab all
of these key value pairs copy that and
then I'm gonna paste it in this export
default and that's all we need in this
file so we'll save that that's our
config so now we'll go to our init file
and we want to do a couple things here
we first want to import firebase
remember we did NPM install firebase
that's what we're bringing in here
so we're saying import firebase from
firebase and we're using our es6 module
syntax here we also want to import the
firestore so let's say import you know
what I'm gonna do I'm not gonna use
semicolons I'm gonna try not to because
that's the standard for view and I want
to try to stick you know try to try to
be consistent here so let's say firebase
slash fire store okay now we want to do
is import the config file we just
created so we'll say import firebase
config from and that's gonna be from dot
slash meaning the same folder we're in
and then firebase config ok then we want
to create a variable called firebase app
and we want to initialize the app by
setting that to firebase dot initialize
app and then we just want to pass in our
firebase config okay and then the last
thing we want to do here is just export
default and we want to export the
firebase app dot firestore no it's not
camel case it's just fire store all
lowercase just like that so that's our
initializer so we'll save that and that
should be it as far as configuring
firebase okay and just to make sure our
app still works okay so in the next
video we're gonna start to build out
some of our components we're gonna use
the router or basically going to have a
couple different pages one to add the
the employee one to edit the employee of
course we need the home page where we
list the employees so we're going to get
to that in part two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
