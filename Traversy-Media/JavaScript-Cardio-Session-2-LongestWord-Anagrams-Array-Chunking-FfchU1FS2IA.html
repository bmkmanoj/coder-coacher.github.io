hey guys welcome to JavaScript cardio
session 2 this is where I give you a few
whiteboard style challenges to exercise
your brain a little and also prepare you
for these types of interview questions
alright so we got a pretty good response
from the first session if you haven't
watched that I would suggest going back
and watching that I explain what this is
a little bit more now I understand that
a lot of you guys are newer JavaScript
developers or people that are just
getting into programming and web
development and this may seem a little
overwhelming if you look at this and you
just don't even wouldn't even know where
to begin don't worry about it this is
not this is not stuff that you would do
in your everyday work but it is stuff
that will really help you learn the
syntax will really help you learn about
different methods and stuff that you
wouldn't normally use and also of course
prepare you for whiteboard type
interviews because they do this this
kind of crap all right now we had a few
github pull requests for session 1 and
we got some really good solutions some
stuff I wouldn't have even thought of on
my own but I did have to deny quite a
bit of requests because people were
editing and erasing stuff and I didn't
want that I just want you guys to add
your own solutions so what I've done for
Session two is I've added an index extra
file and this is for you guys to make
your changes to or add your solutions
and make a pull request just make sure
you comment out your solution before the
request you can also add solution by
your name or your handle or whatever you
want to do ok just keep it neat keep you
know a good amount of lines in between
the set the solution before yours and
stuff like that alright so let's get
started here so the first challenge is
the longest word challenge and basically
we're going to input
a sentence into this function here and
we want to pluck out the longest word
okay whatever word has the most
characters in this case hello my name is
Brad it would give us back the string of
hello now in some cases you may have
more than one word that have the the max
amount of characters came multiple
longest words in that case we want to
put these words into an array so hello
there would be put into an array alright
so that's the first problem if you guys
want to pause the video and try it on
your own you can do that now but I'm
gonna go ahead and give my solution
alright so the first thing we want to do
is strip away punctuation so we don't
want this comma here to be part of the
they're part of this word so I'm gonna
use the match method which takes in a
regular expression and returns an array
basically a filter DeRay based on our
regular expression so let's go ahead and
say const word array and we're gonna
take the sentence that's passed in i'm
also going to just change it to
lowercase so we'll use to lowercase and
then we're gonna call dot match so in
here we put a regular expression which
we have to put in between two forward
slashes and my expression is going to be
anything between a and Z and also zero
and nine okay that's all that's going to
be accepted and then we also want to add
global at the end okay so it doesn't
stop at the first match it just keeps
going so once we get that we can
actually console blog that just so you
can see what that is and obviously you
can't do this in a whiteboard interview
or anything but this is for learning so
we're going to alright so we have hello
there my name is Brad all in separate
array values you can see that comma
after there is gone so that's good it
strips out any punctuation all right now
the next thing we want to do is sort by
length so basically the longest word we
want at the beginning so to do that I'm
going to create a variable called sorted
let me just put a comment here is
we'll just say create filtered array
okay so here we're gonna create an array
called sorted from that word array and
we're just gonna call dots sort and sort
takes in a function okay and as far as
parameters we're gonna pass in a and B
but this could really be anything you
want and then we basically just want to
return b dot length take away a dot
length so so what the what it's gonna do
is it's it's really just gonna take the
current the current iteration and
compare the length to the length before
it and then sort it based on the length
so now if I were to console dot log
sorted let's see what that gives us and
now notice that the the order in this
array is from the the highest length to
the lowest okay and of course we have
hello there and by the way this is all
coming from this right here but we have
hello there which have the same amount
of characters so we're gonna have to
deal with that now if you wanted to just
have it so it returns the first longest
word it finds you could simply return
sorted and just grab the first element
in the array and run that and that will
give you hello all right but I don't
want to do that because I want to return
all of the strings if there's more than
one or all of the array values so let's
say if multiple words then put into
array so we're gonna create a variable
here called longest word array and we're
gonna set this to that sorted array and
we're gonna use filter here so filter is
an array a high order array function or
an array helper and it takes in
a function as well and we're gonna just
put word in here this could be anything
but it basically represents the current
iteration it's going to iterate through
the array and what we want to do is
return true if the word matches the
first the length of the first word
because we know the first word is the
longest right we've already established
that but we want to go through this and
when it hits there it's going to compare
it to this if it's the same length it's
going to return true when it hits name
it's going to compare it to the first
word it doesn't match the length so it's
going to return false which will discard
it from the array all right so we could
do an if statement but an easier way to
do it would be just to return the word
dot length equals 2 sorted the first one
and length ok so that will return either
true or false again if it returns true
it'll stay in the array returns false it
will not so from here let's console dot
log the longest word array and there we
go so we have hello there now if I were
to change this and add an extra oh and
hello that not a zero and oh that will
make this the longest it no longer has
multiple words so if we do that you'll
see that only hello this hello will show
up but remember the instructions we
don't want to return an array if there's
only one word we want to return a string
so we're gonna go back up here and we're
going to get rid of this I should have
returned that not console.log but that's
fine you're seeing the undefined because
I didn't return it so let's go ahead and
check if I'll say check if more than one
array value and we'll do that by saying
if the longest word array dot length
this will look at the length of the
array if it's equal to one then we want
to return
the word okay not the array the actual
word which is in the first position so
we'll say return longest word array and
we want the zero position else that
means that there's more than one so we
want to just return the entire array
like that okay and then finally down
here we're gonna just actually yeah
we're not mind there's nothing else we
need to do here so let's try that it'll
clear this out and run it so we get
hello there inside an array but again if
I add an extra oh here and we run it now
we just get a string okay we don't get
the array we just get that one word
which is what we want
so that was my solution to the first one
now I can clean this up by using arrow
functions so I'm gonna get rid of the
function put in an arrow here and then
we don't need the parenthesis or the
return not the parenthesis the curly
braces or the return and we can make
that much neater looking same thing here
get rid of that and get rid of the curly
braces the semicolon the return and this
curly brace alright and yeah it should
be good and if you wanted to you could
chain the sort on to this and you can
make it a little bit neater but I think
that that's fine I think that's good
alright so let's look at the next
challenge array chunking so we want to
split an array into chunked arrays of a
specific length so if we pass in this
right here as a first parameter an array
with 1 through 7 and we pass the second
parameter of 3 we want to break this
array into chunks of 3 so it should
equal this which is an array with 1
value which is an array of 1 2 3 next
one is an array of 4 5 6 and then the
next one is going to be just 7 because
it just ends there's no more so we can't
do a 3 chunk it'll just put whatever is
left over here alright once it hits 3 if
we added 8 and 9 that would be put in
here and then 10 would go to the next
the next chunk ok and if we put 2 the
array would look like the
one and two three and four five and six
seven and so on all right so let's go
ahead and get started with this I'm just
gonna go down here and change the
function name to chunk array and then
I'm gonna grab let's see well grab this
right here and pass this in okay make
sure you grab the array in the length
like that all right so first thing we're
gonna do here I'm actually going to give
you two different solutions the first
one I'm actually going to use a while
loop which I don't use too much but I
think that this is a nice simple
solution so we're going to initialize a
chunked array so we'll say Const chunked
array equals just an empty array and
then we also want to set an index for
our loop so we'll say let a equal 's and
we're going to set it to zero all right
and then we want to loop we want to loop
while the index is less than the array
length so let's say while and we're
gonna pass in here while I is less than
the array dot length and this array here
is coming from the actual array that's
passed in so while that's true I'm gonna
use the slice method which allows us to
basically slice stuff out from an array
so what we want to do is slice out from
the index to the index plus
the chunk length and then we want to
push onto the chunked array okay so to
do that we're gonna say chunked array
dot push which just adds something on to
an array and then we're gonna take the
array that's passed in and we're gonna
slice from it so if you want to slice an
array like let's say we wanted to get
just the first one we would use 0 as the
first parameter because that's where we
want to start and then one as where we
want to end so it'll grab that first one
and if we wanted like two to three we
would do one and then two as a second
parameter so what we'll do is put the
index as the first parameter and then
for the second it'll be the index plus
whatever the length is okay the length
is what's passed in here in this case
it's gonna be two okay so we want to do
that and then all we need to do next is
increment by the chunk length
okay whatever the length is in this case
two so we can say I whoops let's say
increment by chunk length and we'll say
I plus equals the length all right and
that should do it now we just need to
return the chunked array no chunked arr
all right so let's go ahead and try that
well like an error here chunked array is
not defined that's because I forgot the
IDI see it would have failed that
already all right so now we passed in
one through seven in a single array with
the parameter of two is a length so we
have an array with two chunks each chunk
has two values okay I'm not I shouldn't
say two chunks but chunks with two
values now if I were to pass in three
and run it now you can see we get chunks
of three okay if I were to pass in one
it should just give us basically just
you know one each value in one chunk
okay or one chunk in each value so
that's one way to do it I'm going to
change this back to two and let's go
back up here and let's go ahead and
comment this solution out actually I'm
going to just put a comment here that
says solution one and we'll grab this
comment it out and this second I mean
there's a lot of different solutions you
could use for this but for this next one
I'm going to use a for each high order
function the first thing I'm going to do
is initialize the array and slice
chunked array so we'll say Const the
hell is that
Const
chunk DeRay equals an empty array and
then we want to loop through the will
just say loop through array so array dot
for each and you don't have to use a for
each here but I think it's the most
elegant way to do us a simple loop so
this takes in a function and basically a
value for each iteration I'm just gonna
use Val and we want to get the last
element okay so let's say get last
element console ass'd and we can get
that by taking the chunked array and
then passing in here
the chunked array oklet chunked array
and then the length okay so the entire
length of the chunked array -1 that'll
give us the last value in this case it
would be 7 all right so it's gonna do
that through every loop now the first
loop it goes through it's actually going
to be undefined because there's nothing
here there is no last value ok just to
let you know that I can actually show
you that so let's do a console log of
last all right we're gonna have to
actually I think I think that No so
that's going to give us all undefined
because we're not we're not doing any
kind of adding to the array or anything
it's just empty and we're always asking
for the last one so what we're gonna do
next is we're going to check if if there
is a last ok or if it's undefined and if
last if the length if the last length is
equal
to the chunk length okay or the chunk
length parameter which in our case is
two right now so let's to put an if
statement here and let's let's say if
not last okay so if it's if it doesn't
exist or it's whatever undefined or last
dot length is equal to the actual length
if that's true then we just want to push
on to chunked array chunked a are not
push push and then we want to pass in an
array with the value all right
else okay so if that's not true then
we're just gonna take the last and push
on the bat just the value like that okay
and now let's do console dot log last
all right let's look at chunked array
first
okay so through each loop you'll see the
first one it's going to give us one and
then it's going to give us one and two
okay now remember the chunk length is
two so in the next one it's gonna add
three to the next chunk next one will
add 4 to that same chunk next one we'll
start a new chunk ok see how it's if I
passed in 3 and we ran it you'll see
that now when it gets to three chunks it
then starts the next chunk ok I'm just
gonna put that back to 2 and if we want
to look at last this will show us all
the last ones let's clear this up so you
can see last we have 1 2 1 2 3 4 3 4 5 6
and so on
alright so that's really all we have to
do here we can now return it so we're
gonna make sure we go outside of the for
each and we're going to return the
chunked array and there we go if I were
to pass in 3
each chunk has three values all right so
that's another way to do it and there's
there's a lot of different ways to do
this so I'm sure I'll see a lot of pull
requests for this one so let's move on
to the next one and this is kind of the
opposite of what we just did we're going
to take chunked array and turn it into
we're gonna basically going to flatten
it into just a single array now these
solutions are actually going to be a
very very small amount of code cut and I
wouldn't say easy but a small amount of
code the first solution I'm actually
going to use reduce okay so let's I'm
just going to do or do the return here
so we'll say return and it gets passed
in arrays let's actually run the
function so it's going to get passed in
something like this so I'll copy that
and go down here and say flatten array
and then we'll pass this in okay so
we're gonna say return arrays dot reduce
and reduce takes in a function and just
gonna pass in a and B now a is basically
the starting point and then each
iteration will be B so all I want to do
is concatenate B onto a okay so a is the
starting point and then B as it goes
through it'll concatenate on and then it
should flatten the array out so if we
say return a dots can cat be that should
actually work so let's run it
and there we go so we just have an array
of 1 through 7 so very very short
solution and the next ones are even
gonna be shorter so it's a solution too
and with this one we're going to use the
apply method which basically applies a
function or a method so we're gonna use
concat dot apply and let me just write
it out first so we'll say return and
we're actually going to take an empty
array and say concat so you can
concatenate first I'll leave out apply
I'll just do concat and let's say arrays
let's comment this solution out and if
we run that we basically get the same
thing we passed in we're just
concatenate a so what we want to do is
just say can cat dot apply and then for
our first parameter here pass in an
empty array so let's try that and there
we go so very very short solution what
the apply method does is instead of just
taking a list of arguments to be passed
to concat it takes a single array and
passes all the array elements and this
works since all the elements of the
arrays parameter which is this right
here are also arrays okay so apply will
kind of unravel a level of the array and
use that so it's it's really hard to
explain actually I don't know if I'm
doing a very good job explaining it but
this this does work and then the third
solution
it's a solution the three the search
solution third solution is going to be
very similar except instead of using a
ply I'm going to use the spread operator
which is part of es2015
and the spread operator it basically
allows an iterable such as an array to
be expanded into multiple arguments so
before I do the solution I'm going to
give you a little example of how it
works
so if we say function add and let's say
this add function takes in three
parameters a B and C and then all it
does is returns all of those add it
together so a plus B plus C alright so
we have that function and then we'll
have an array and I'm gonna set this to
an array of just 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
ok so now let's just console dot log and
let's say add and then let's add the
array which is this here but use the
spread operator so it treats each one as
an individual so we'll do three dots and
then array so let's see what that gives
us we need to actually call a function
so what did I call this oh no mind it's
already being called but let's run this
oh I got a comment this oh okay so we
get six because it's basically just
looking at this array and it's taking
each separate value and using it as
these parameters and adding them
together so that's that's the basics of
how the spread operator works so I'm
actually gonna I'll keep this here for
you guys but I'm gonna comment it out
but all we have to do is let's grab
solution two and instead of using a ply
we'll just use concat and instead of
passing in this empty array with just
the regular arrays we're just gonna use
the spread operator and use arrays okay
so we'll go ahead and save that and run
it and there we go so that's an even
shorter solution
okay I'm finding it hard to kind of
explain what what I mean in my head with
this some of this stuff that's why I
really don't like algorithms and stuff
like this it's really hard to explain
I'm actually not going to keep this here
because I think it I think it looks neat
or without it and then I also want to go
back up here real quick and just change
this stuff to arrow functions where we
can so right here and see so yeah that's
that's good anywhere else all right
and then here let's also make this an
arrow function
and since we're just returning that we
can actually get rid of the parentheses
and the return and not the parentheses
of the curly braces so that that should
work and just to make sure all right
good
so those are the solutions for the
flattened array and I'm sure there's
there's just a ton of other one that you
guys could come up with so the next one
is an anagram
okay now an anagram is is a it's gonna
be two strings that we pass in and they
have to have the same exact characters
okay
stripping out punctuation or our special
characters or anything like that
for instance elbow should equal below
dormitory's should equal dirty room okay
they all have they have the same
characters the same word characters this
we're gonna strip out it doesn't matter
even if we pass this in this should
still return true okay what we want to
do is return true if it's an anagram and
false if it's not so similar to the
palindrome example that we did in the
first one so let's change the running
function to is anagram and we'll go
ahead and pass in two strings so let's
use the elbow example so elbow and below
just that should have quotes around it
so let's go up here into our is anagram
and what we need to do is basically
format both of these strings we need to
do quite a few things we need to strip
out any punctuation I want to change
everything to lowercase so it doesn't
matter that this is an uppercase D or
not and then we need to split it into an
array and then we're gonna sort it and
join it back so that we get the same
result
if if it is an anagram these two will
match okay exactly so what I'm gonna do
is actually create a helper function and
I'm gonna call that format string or
format St
all right and I'm just gonna put a
comment here saying this is a helper
function okay and it's going to take in
a string and we're going to return that
string and we're gonna do quite a few
things to it so let's go on the next
line we'll go right here and we want to
use replace and replace takes in a
regular expression so what we want to do
is strip out anything that's not a word
character so we're gonna use brackets
and we're gonna put the caret here and
we're gonna say anything that doesn't
match a word character so basically a
letter number and we want to make sure
we add the G for Global then we want to
replace that with just an empty string
okay once we do that we're going to
lowercase everything so we'll say two
lowercase then we want to we want to
sort everything but we can't sort just
the string we need to turn it into an
array first where each array value will
be a letter or character so to do that
we use dot split and we use that quite a
bit in session one and we just want to
put in an empty set of quotes here so
that'll put each value each character
into its own array value and then we'll
do the sword okay we'll just call dot
sword and then we want to do dot join
which will turn it back into a string
okay so that's gonna format our string
now let's go up here and let's um let's
do yeah we'll do a console dot log and
we'll say format string and we'll pass
in string one which if we look is elbow
so if we go ahead and run that we get
below because what's happening here is
it's putting it in order from the the
earliest letter to the latest so whether
we put in that or we put in string too
which is below which already is in that
order
we get below so all we have to do now is
match those together see if see if they
match okay so to do that we'll just say
return format string oops so format
string and we'll pass in string 1 and
we're gonna say if that is equal to
format string string 2 then that's going
to return true ok in this case because
it is true it is in it's an anagram so
we'll save that and let's run it and we
get true if I were to put Bulow's even
though all of these characters are
inside of this it has an extra s so when
we run it through format string it's not
going to match ok these two will not
match so we should get false for that
all right let's try this next example
dormitory and even though there's a
space here doesn't matter because we use
the replace ok and we're saying replace
anything that's not a word character and
a space is not a word character so it's
just being it's basically being just
sucked out of the of the string all
right so let's do dormitory
so dormitory and we'll say dirty room
let's run that and we get true now
we also again we used replace so
anything that's not a word character I'm
gonna put all this stuff in here that
should still get true okay but if we
were to again put another letter or even
a number in here that's gonna be false
okay so that's that's my solution for
the anagram so if you guys have other
solutions feel free to make a pull
request to the github repository alright
so this videos running kind of long
let's gets through this last one here so
this letter changes we want to change
every letter of the string that's passed
in to the one that follows it and also
capitalize the vowels so for instance if
we if we pass in hello there this is
what we should get back because I is the
the character after H F is after e M is
after L and so on it's just going to
basically shift the alphabet and if you
get a Z we want to turn that to an A so
we want to kind of loop over it okay so
if we get to Z go back to the beginning
and return an A so let's call the
function so the function is I want to go
right here and say letter changes and
I'm gonna pass in a single string of
hello there all right so let's get
started here first thing we're gonna do
is we're going to use replace which
allows us to pass in a regular
expression and basically filter it and
return an array I think we used it up
here oh no we used we used match but
we're going to use replace here so let's
say let
new string and by it allows us to loop
through the characters but we're going
to return a string from it that's why
I'm calling it new string so we're gonna
take the STR that's passed in call
replace and from here we're gonna add in
a regular expression and we're gonna say
A to Z and we're gonna use a global
caret we're gonna use global and I which
is case insensitive so it doesn't matter
if it's an uppercase or lowercase and
then it takes in a function as a second
parameter and we're gonna pass in char
so that we can access the current
character of the iteration and then
first thing we'll do is check to see if
it's a Z because remember if it's a Z it
should be it should be an A ok it should
return an A so let's do an if statement
here and we'll say if char is equal to Z
or char is equal to uppercase C then we
want to return a lowercase a alright
else okay so basically if it's any other
character than a Z then we want to
return and we're going to use the string
object here and it has a function or a
method called from char code now every
letter in the alphabet has a character
code all right so we want to take the
character and we want to call char code
at
so that will give us the actual
character code and we want to just add
one to it okay which will give us the
next character the next letter
so let's well it's actually a
console.log now or it will just return
let's return new string okay and if I go
ahead and run this there we go so we get
basically we're getting this hello there
with each letter added one and if it's a
Z let's do hello there's if it's a Z
you'll see that it turns to an A all
right now one thing that I forgot to do
was lowercase everything because since
we have an uppercase H here you'll see
the I is uppercase if I were to make
that a lowercase and run now we have a
lowercase I I wanted to at this point
just make everything lowercase so I'm
gonna say string dot to lowercase and
then replace so now if we run that
whoops whoops I don't have a dot here so
string dot to lowercase dot replace
there we go so now everything is
lowercase now we remember the second
part of this is to capitalize any vowels
so we're gonna go right here and I'm
just gonna take that new string this is
why I used let because I'm gonna set it
equal to whatever the new string is
currently and then use replace again and
then pass in here a regular expression
which will be any vowel so we'll say
we're going to use literals here and say
if it's an A or an E or an i or an O or
au and then we just want to add global
and case-insensitive
and then to takes in a function and for
hit for this will save owl because it's
going to be a vowel and all we want to
do is return vowel dot to uppercase okay
so now if I save that and we run it and
now you'll see I is uppercase because
it's a vowel you I again uppercase
alright so any any vowels will be
uppercase alright so that is my solution
one thing I want to do is just clean
this up by making this into an arrow so
I'm going to get rid of the function and
put an arrow here since this is just one
parameter we don't even need the
parentheses and yeah that should be good
we could clean this up we could make
this into a ternary but I think I'll
just leave it like that and then for
this one here let's get rid of function
and since it's just this one return we
can get rid of this stuff we don't need
the return keyword or the curly braces
I hate when it does that all right so
let me just try that one more time
alright so still works and I think
that's all that I need to clean up yeah
alright guys so hopefully you enjoyed
this I know some of the stuff is some of
the stuff is hard for me to explain and
I apologize if it's if it's not
completely clear but you know watch
other tutorials on this stuff if you
want to learn more about a method visit
the end the mdn documentation and read
all about it and get familiar with it
it's good to know a lot of this stuff
even stuff like character codes
different different regular expression
methods regular expressions themselves
my modern JavaScript from the beginning
course has I think four lectures on
regular expressions
if you want to check that out I'll put a
link in the description but yeah so if
you want to make a pull request that's
fine just just again make sure you use
the index extra dot J s file and you
just keep things neat and you can put
your name in the comment and yeah so
that's it thanks for watching guys and I
will see you in the next video coding
