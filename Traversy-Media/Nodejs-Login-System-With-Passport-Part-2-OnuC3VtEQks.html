of our registration and login system
using nodejs what I want to do now is
work on the registration form all right
so when we submit this it's going to
make a post request to user slash
register so let's go to our routes
folder and go to users J s and I'm going
to copy what we have here paste that in
and let's change this get to post okay
and then this is good we're going to
leave that and let's get rid of this and
what we want to do here first we want to
get all the stuff that's being submitted
and put it into a variable so I'm going
to paste this in all right so we're
getting the name email username password
and then the password to field all right
now just a test to make sure it's
working we'll do console dot log and
let's log the name alright so we need to
restart the server for this alright and
let's go ahead and just say test and
submit and down here you can see we're
getting test all right so we know the
form submitting correctly now what we
want to do is we want some validation
all right so it's a validation and the
way we do this is we want to say our req
dot check body and then in here we want
to pass in the field that we want to
check in this case let's say name and
then we want a message we'll say name is
required and then we need to add on the
function that we want for validation in
this case we're going to say not empty
all right so that just checks to make
sure that that's actually filled in so
there's other validations that we'll be
doing but I just want to show you how
exactly how it works
so what we want to do now is just save
our errors we're going to set that to
request dot validation errors which is a
function and then we're going to do an
if statement
all right and we're going to say if
errors that would then what do we want
to do for now is just console dot log
and we'll say yes there are errors if
not console.log no all right so let's
test this out I'm gonna have to restart
okay
so register and let's leave this blank
leave the name blank and submit and you
can see we get yes if we put something
in and we submit we get no there's no
errors all right so it's as simple as
that now what I'll do is I'm going to
paste in the rest of our validations all
right and let me just widen this a
little bit so this one here where we're
making sure that the email field is not
empty this one here is also on the email
field except we're checking to make sure
if it's a valid email address all right
user name we're checking to see if it's
not empty password same thing and then
we're taking the password to and we're
calling dot equals and then pass in what
it should equal with which is the first
password field all right so that's
what's going to check that now down here
we need to figure out what we're going
to do if there are errors and what we
want to do is re-render the form so res
dot render we want to render users slash
register except we want to pass along
the errors so the second parameter will
pass them along okay and just for now
I'm just going to change this to passed
if it works all right now let me just
show you what happens now whoops what's
this fail to look up users where I just
all I did that wrong this right here
should just be register
all right so if we go back and we try to
submit you can see it's not letting us
which is what it's supposed to do but
it's not telling us anything we get no
messages so we have to fix that so what
we'll do is we need to go to register
dot handlebars we'll go right under the
heading here and we're going to paste
this in all right now first thing we're
doing here is checking to see if we have
errors and if you look back here we
passed them in right here so we're
checking for that if there are then
we're going to loop through them using
each errors and then for each one oh you
know what this is the wrong HTML that's
for a different framework we want to use
bootstrap alerts so we're going to say
div class alert and let's do a lark
danger all right and then in here all we
want is double curly brace msg all right
so that should spit out the errors so
let's save that okay and then let's
submit and now you can see we get all of
our errors if I put something in the
name field that name is required
disappears all right and if we do
everything correctly let's see password
need to they need to match and submit
and over here you can see we get passed
all right so validation is good now we
want to discuss what we're going to do
if it actually passes so we're going to
want to create a new object when we save
our new user and I'm going to set it to
new user now we didn't we haven't
created the model yet so we should
probably do that first actually all
right let's do that first so let's go to
models and then user J s and we're going
to first include mongoose
and we're also going to need decrypt so
that we can hash our passwords and you
want to make sure you set that to be
crypt j/s all right then what we'll do
is call Mongoose dot connect and we're
going to pass in our database
so Y MongoDB localhost / log in app
alright and it should be in quotes ok
then we're going to create a variable
called DB and set that to Mongoose dot
connection now what we need to do is set
our schema okay so it's going to be
pretty simple I'm going to paste this in
we have a variable called user schema
we're setting it to Mongoose dot schema
we have a user name which is going to
have a type of string we're also going
to give it an index and then we have
password email and name which are all
strings as well so really simple now
what we need to do is create a variable
that's going to that we can access
outside of this file so we're going to
say user equals module dot exports
equals Mongoose dot model and we want to
pass in the model name which will be
user and also the user schema variable
alright then what we need to do is we're
going to have all of our user functions
down here alright so first one is going
to be to create the user so say module
dot exports dot create user okay that's
gonna look we're going to set that equal
to a function
okay and that's going to take in two
things it's going to take a new user and
also a callback function all right now
down here we need to use bcrypt to hash
our password alright and I'm getting
this code right from right from the
documentation sit bcrypt j/s okay so we
want this right here this gen salt and
then call this hash so let's copy that
okay we'll paste that in well this is
good that's that's what we want right
here we're seeing bcrypt hash and then
this is where we'll pass in the password
kay we'll say new user dot pass o
password okay then we're putting in the
salt and then the function and then in
here what we'll do is we'll set new user
dot password equal to the hash all right
and then we'll save it so new user dot
save and you want to pass in callback
all right just like that so let's save
it now we can go back to our users route
file and go back down to where we're
going to actually enter the user so we
want to say var new user equals new user
which is coming from the model which we
have to include up above I'll do that in
a second all right so in here we want to
put in curly braces we're going to say
name email
okay username and password
okay now let's create this variable up
here okay we're going to save our user
equals require okay we want to go up one
directory so dot dot slash models slash
user and this should be in quotes okay
back down to here now we can call that
create user function that's in the model
alright so this is going to take in new
user that we just created and then the
call back and what we're going to do
here we'll just check for the error and
then just throw if there is one and then
we'll just console dot log the user okay
and then after that we want to set a
success message okay so we're going to
say req dot slash and for this first
parameter will be success underscore msg
and then the actual message will say you
are registered and can now login alright
and then we just want to redirect so
we'll say res dot redirect and let's go
to
hmm
we'll go to the login page so slash
users slash login now in order for this
era this message to show we need to add
a placeholder in our template or our
layout so let's go to layouts and then
layout on handlebars we're going to go
right above the body here and I'm going
to paste in three separate things okay
let me just fix this alright so this
first one we're checking to see if
there's a global variable called success
msg and if you remember that's what we
set in App j/s right here alright so
what we're essentially what we're doing
is checking for these three alright if
they if they are there then we're going
to this is wrong again this isn't the
bootstrap alright let me just change
this real quick we want to say div class
equals alert and this is a success
message so we're going to say alert
success and then whoops in here we just
want that alright now I'm going to copy
that paste those here and this one is
going to be a lark danger and this
should be error message and then this
one will also be danger and this will be
just error
all right so hopefully that works let's
save it and I think everything should be
good so let's go and restart the server
okay we're getting an error try to open
unclose connection unhandled our event
all right let's take a look at the model
user j s oh you know what we don't need
this because we have it in our app J s I
believe yeah we have it right here
so it's just giving us that error
because we have it twice so let's go
ahead and just get rid of that okay so
now we'll go to localhost 3000 we'll go
to register put in a name put in a
username email password and submit user
is not defined okay users what did I do
oh this should be an uppercase okay
let's try it again
you are now registered and can login
okay now we can't login yet because we
haven't created that functionality but
the registration looks like it's working
you can see it echo it console logged
our user and just to triple-check let's
go to our Mongo shell and we'll say DB
dot users dot find and there it is so we
have a generated object ID our name
email username password which is hashed
and it looks good alright so what we're
going to do is we'll stop here now that
we have registration setup in the next
video we're going to work on the login
which is a little more complicated we
need to create a local strategy and we
need to do some other things so I will
see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
