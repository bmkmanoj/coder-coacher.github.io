and I wanted to do something that it was
it's kind of a small project but kind of
a cool project at the same time I didn't
want to do any frame work series or
anything like that so we're gonna build
this vanilla JavaScript interface which
is a kind of a ratings application or
part of an application I guess you'd
integrate it with a bigger app but
basically we have we're gonna have an
object of 4k TVs that's just what I
chose you could it could be anything
that you want it to rate and each TV
will have a number rating it'll be
between one and five and it can have
decimal points okay and then we're gonna
translate it to these stars and these
are from font awesome 5 which is the
newer version of font awesome and we
have full stars empty stars and half
stars and we're basically gonna take the
number and round it to give us the
appropriate amount of stars so for
instance a 4.7 will give us four and a
half stars if this were a 4.8 4.9 or a 5
it would fill up all 5 stars if it were
a 4.2 4.1 or 4 it would fill up just the
four stars all right so that's kind of
how the rounding is gonna go and that's
the first part the second part of the
project we're gonna add this form where
you can see we can select a product or
TV and the rating is blat is disabled by
default but if we choose a product let's
say the vizio you'll see that the rating
from the vizio will actually get beep
will get put into this input and then we
can change it let's say it's a little
better than we thought like a 2.4 and
then onblur which is the event where i
click outside of the box you'll see when
i when i call that event this will
change okay so i'll click outside and
that'll change the number as well as the
star ratings all right we can manually
enter stuff in here if I try to put
something that's higher than a 5 it's
just going to give us an alert and it's
not going to actually change okay so it
has to actually be
between one and five so that's what
we'll be building guys hopefully you
enjoy this I like doing these little
projects they're not too common in
tutorials so I think that they teach you
about the language and syntax and the
DOM and all that stuff so that's it
let's go ahead and get started
hey guys if you've been watching my
videos for a while and you really like
what I do when I've helped you out a lot
consider becoming a patron even for one
dollar per month it pushes me to keep
bringing you guys the best content I
possibly can there's reward tiers for
discounts for you to me courses personal
support and more so check out the
patreon link in the description below
for more info all right so we're gonna
get started here now if you're following
along it's very simple we're just having
one file called index.html and we're
gonna add all of our CSS HTML and
JavaScript to that file so I have a
folder called star ratings with the
index file open up in open and vs code
alright so since we're using vs code we
can use Emmet so I'm gonna do
exclamation tab that's going to give us
an HTML boilerplate for the title let's
just say 4k television ratings and we're
gonna add a couple things here so we
need font awesome so if you go to font
awesome comm and go to get started we're
not going to use SVG we're gonna use the
web fonts with CSS let's click on that
and we're gonna grab this link here okay
and paste that in and the reason we're
using the CSS and not SVG is because
we're not actually using font awesome
classes we're using the unicode
character from within the CSS to
generate the icon alright the next thing
we're gonna need is bootstrap so I'm
gonna go to bootstrap CDN comm and just
grab the link for bootstrap 4 and we'll
put it right in here and save alright
and I am using the prettier extension 4
vs code so if I save and you see it
clean up a little bit that's why I'm
also using live server so to run this I
can just do open with live server and
it'll open in the browser but of course
you don't need that you can just open up
the
HTML page all right so that takes care
of the head area now let's go into the
body and let's create our table I'm not
going to do the form stuff just yet so
we're gonna do the table first actually
to put a container I'll do a container
and we'll wrap our table it's gonna have
a class of table and a class of table
what I keep doing that table - striped
like that and we'll have a tea head
inside here we'll have a table row with
a couple table headings so the first one
will say 4k television okay so that's
the heading for that and then the next
heading will be rating and then we'll
move on to the tea body alright so in
the tea body we're gonna have table rows
and each table row is actually going to
have a class with the brand name so in
this case Sony okay we need this for
some of the Dom stuff that we're gonna
do so table row will have TD with the
actual title so we'll save Sony 4k TV
and then let's do another TD now this TD
is gonna have a few divs in it so it's
gonna have a div called stars - outer
and in here we'll have another div
nested called stars - inner now nothing
is actually going to go in here in the
HTML we're using it as a placeholder
Stars outer is basically the the empty
stars the gray ones and then stars inner
is gonna be the yellow filled stars and
then the way that we're going to
basically display the number of ratings
is by setting the width of stars inner
which is the yellow stars okay we're
going to do some calculations to do with
percentages and stuff like that and then
underneath Stars outer we're gonna have
one more div called number rating
because I want the actual number rating
and I said div this is actually going to
be a span
oops so span number rating all right so
that's what each table row is going to
look like we're gonna have five of them
so I'm just gonna copy this down that's
two three four and five and then what
we'll do is just change up the brands
here this will be class Samsung and
we'll change the title here as well to
Samsung 4k TV
this one will be Vizio and C this one
will be Panasonic I believe so we'll
change this and then the last one will
be Philips
all right so if we save that it should
look like that all right so we're gonna
go ahead and jump down to the JavaScript
now to get get these stars like I said
we're gonna wait we're gonna hold off on
the form for now so right above the body
tag let's put in our script tags and
let's see the first thing I'm gonna add
here is the initial object with the
ratings and the brand so let's say
initial ratings so have a variable
called ratings and we're gonna have Sony
let's say 4.7 Samsung three points for
vizio we'll say two point three
Panasonic three point six and Philips
will say four point one all right so
that's our ratings object we're also
gonna need our total stars so let's say
Const stars total equals five okay
because that's the max and then what we
want to do is basically loop through
this object and you can loop through an
object in JavaScript using a four in
loop okay which is a standard of es6 our
part of the es6 standard es2015
and i want to put this inside a function
so that we can call it whenever we want
so let's say get
ratings and we're going to create a
function called get ratings all right
and let's just do console.log ran now
it's not going to run right away because
we haven't called it so what I want to
do is right above it let's say run get
ratings when Dom loads so we're going to
create an event listener on the document
so add event listener and the event we
want to listen for is called Dom content
loaded and when that happens we want to
run get ratings so now if I save that
now you can see ran all right so back to
the get ratings we want to loop through
our object using a four in so to do that
we say four define a variable let's say
let rating in not of there is a four of
but that's for a raise you want in for
the object in ratings now just to show
you what we get if we were to log rating
it's going to give us each brand because
it gives us the key and the brand is the
key if you want the actual rating the
number then what you would do is take
the object name which is ratings and
then pass in as an index the rating like
that and now you can see we get the
numbers okay so just remember that's how
you can get the key and the value or the
value all right now let's see we want to
basically get a percentage value from
the rating so let's say get get
percentage so for that we're going to
create a variable called star percentage
and we're gonna set that to a formula
and we're gonna take the number rating
which remember we get from ratings and
then the index of rating all right so we
want to basically take that and we want
to divide that by the total so stars
total okay and then finally we just want
to multiply by 100 so that'll give us
the percentage and if you guys want to
see what that is for each one say star
percentage and there it is so it gives
us a percentage for each one now what we
want to do is basically round that to
the nearest 10 so we'll say round to
nearest 10 so let's create another
variable called star percentage rounded
and the way that we're going to do this
we're going to use the math object which
has a rounded method so we're going to
use backticks here to use a variable and
we use this syntax to use a variable or
an expression which is going to be math
dot round and we want to pass into here
the star percentage so star percentage
and then we want to just divide by 10
and then multiply by 10 and then just
add on the percentage symbol all right
so if you want to see what that gives us
for each one we can do star percentage
rounded and save and now we get 90
percent 70 percent and so on and this is
what we're going to use for the width of
the stars inner okay which is the yellow
part of the stars that's going to
determine how many stars get filled so
let's do that next let's say let's say
set with
of stars in ER to percentage and we can
do that by selecting it so document dot
query selector now this is going to be
dynamic I'm going to put in some
template strings because the the item we
want to select is by this Panasonic
Visio and so on which aligns with the
keys of our ratings now remember we can
get the keys by just simply using rating
inside of this loop so we want to use a
variable syntax here and say rating
alright and remember their classes so we
need a dot right before it so dot rating
and then we want to target the stars
inner inside of the rating which is this
so let's go rating and then class of
stars - inner and then we simply want to
set the width by saying style dot width
equal to the percentage rounded save
that let's see what am I missing here oh
what I'm missing is the CSS but we're
not getting any errors so that's good
all right so in order for these stars to
show up we need to add some CSS so let's
go up to the top here up to the head and
we'll go right under the title and put
in our style tags and we're gonna add
styles for the stars inner and outer and
also for the pseudo class before
okay so let's first do stars
- outer
this is just going to be positioned
relative because the stars inner is
going to be positioned absolute inside
of outer so we want this to be relative
and then I'm just going to display it as
an inline block okay and then let's do
stars - inner and let's do
position:absolute because it's basically
overlaying Stars outer all right so we
want the position to be from the top
zero position left zero and let's do
let's do white-space:nowrap and let's do
overflow:hidden and the width
okay the width is what is important here
it's gonna be set to zero
by default but the percentage is going
to determine how many stars are filled
all right so let's save that we're still
not gonna see anything because in order
to add the icons we need to use those
Unicode characters so let's do Stars
outer double colon before okay we're
gonna use the before pseudo selector and
we want to add a Content variable or
content style I should say and we want
to put the Unicode of the the icon we
want so if we go to icons and we search
for star you'll see that this star here
if I click on it the Unicode is F 0 0 5
so we can get this icon with this
Unicode code or character whatever and
we're going to use the same one for both
but one is going to be yellow the Stars
inner will be yellow this is outer so
this one we want to be gray but to use
this Unicode we just want to do a
forward slash
then I'm sorry backslash and then the
Unicode character which is f zero zero
five now that will give us one star but
we want five so what I'll do is I will
copy this oops
copy this and we'll do five of them now
just that if we take a look you'll see
it's not showing up the reason for that
is we need two additional things we need
a font family and this is new to font
awesome five you didn't used to need
this stuff for version four for font
family we want to use font awesome free
like that okay if I save that still
doesn't work because we need a font
weight so font weight we're gonna say
nine hundred and save that should work
why isn't that working
let's give it a color I don't think this
will fix it but we need a color anyways
which is actually gonna be CCC four
light gray all right so why is that not
showing oh it's because it's font
awesome five free there we go alright so
I know that that's that's a little weird
and that confused the crap out of me
when I was when I was putting this
together
I was I was using a reference an article
as a reference that was using font
awesome for and they they did it much
differently in fact if you look at the
stars here the empty one has the same
Unicode as the full one which is weird
if we wanted to use the empty star here
what we would do is change the font
weight so if I change it to something
lighter like two hundred now you'll see
they're empty stars which I initially
was going to use but when we fill it
with yellow it gets rid of the border
and it looks a little weird so we're
gonna stick to just using the full and
then the inner stars will be yellow okay
and I hope that makes sense it's just
it's a little weird to even explain
but let's copy this and let's change
this to inner all right now we're using
the same icon so these should all be the
same the only thing that we need to
change is the color which will be yellow
it's going to be a hexadecimal of ff8
see what is it Mike's in the way easy
Roby yellow and save and there we go so
this is actually working if we go down
here to our object you can see that
these ratings are now pertaining to
these stars okay let's say Phillips
let's say I wanted to change that to 1
and watch when I save Phillips changes
to 1 if I do a 1.2 it should stay at 1
but if I do a 1.3 then it fills up the
next half all right if I do up to a 1.7
it'll stay like that but if I do a 1.8
it should fill up the next star okay so
that's how it works it's based on the
width of stars inner alright so
hopefully you guys are still with me I
know that it's a little weird but let's
go let's continue so now that that's
done let's go let's add our form alright
now that we have the the stars
corresponding to our object so let's
grab our let's not grab let's type in
our form here so inside the container
I'm gonna put a form group we don't
actually need a form tag because we're
just dealing with the inputs so this is
going to be a select list so let's do
class form control which is just a
bootstrap class
actually yeah form control let's also do
custom - select all right I want to move
this down so for in the container div
I'm gonna add a class of mt5 margin top
5 just to push it down and then this
select doesn't need excuse me it doesn't
need a name it does need an ID it's ID
is gonna be product - select and then
inside here we're gonna have some
options so the first one is actually
going to be disabled and selected the
value I don't know the value will just
say zero and then for the text inside
will say select product there we go
alright so then we'll have a bunch of
other options here what do we have 5 so
let's do with Emmet we can say option
times 5 tab and it'll give us 5 options
so we have Sony and let's say Sony oops
4k TV samsung let's just add all the
values Vizio I hope that's how you spell
vizio I have 2 of 2 Vizio TVs and I I'm
pretty sure that's how you spell it
Panasonic and Philips
so here we'll say Samsung 4k TV and
let's actually just copy that here we'll
say vizio 4k TV panasonic there we go
okay
let me close this sidebar up so if we
save that you can see we have all of our
products good next field we're gonna
need is the rating control so I'm going
to go under the form group and let's add
another form group and this is gonna be
let's say inputs I'm gonna give it an ID
of rating - control and let's give it a
class of form control okay so the type
is actually going to be number now I
want the the step which is when we click
the little arrows I want that to go up
by just point one so we can actually add
in a attribute an attribute of step and
set that to zero point one like that and
then I want to set a maximum of five you
shouldn't be able to arrow it up more
than five and then a placeholder of rate
one one through five and let's disable
it by default so we'll say disabled and
save and there we go good so that's all
we have to do as far as the HTML now we
need to go to our JavaScript and let's
see where are we gonna put this stuff
let's go under the total actually let's
go under where we where we called the
event
the Dom loaded event so right above get
ratings and let's grab our form elements
alright so we have the product select so
we're gonna say documents I'm going to
use get element by D we gave an ID of
product select or - select and let's
also get rating control so get element
by D rating
- control so that gets our form elements
and then I also want to just initialize
a variable for the actual selected
product so I'm gonna use let here and
say product just let product actually
okay now we want to do is is create some
event listeners so first one is going to
be for when we select one of these we
need that event so let's say product
select change so remember we gave that a
variable of product select so we want to
say add event listener and when that
changes then we want to call a function
I'm just going to use an arrow function
here and we want to pass in an event
parameter because we want to get we want
to get the product and we actually want
to set it to this whatever you want to
set it to this value so we'll say
product equals event dot target dot
value
okay event target dot value is how we
can get the value of whatever is
selected if we want to test that out
we could say console.log product and
let's just select something and you'll
see the value will show down below all
right so now that we have that what do
we want to do we want to now we want to
be able to rate it so let's say enable
rating control so we'll take the rating
control variable say dot disable equal
to false okay so now when we select the
product okay so that didn't work
rating control dot disabled should be a
D there now we can actually rate it all
right so that well we can't rate it but
we can this is now enabled next thing we
want to do is set the value of this to
whatever the value of the selected
product so what we can do is say rating
control dot value is going to be set to
the ratings object which is this here
and we can grab this the value by
putting in the key which is the product
all right so we can say ratings product
so let's save that so we'll select Sony
and there we go 4.7 Vizio 2.3 so it's as
easy as that now that we can do that we
want to now take care of the actual
rating so let's say rating control
change
all right so let's say grading control
dot add eventlistener
now I'm not gonna use change here I'm
gonna use blur because I want it to
change once you kind of escape the input
so we'll say blur set that to function
it's passed in our event parameter all
right now we can get the rating by using
a dot target value okay now I want to
test to make sure that it's it's under
five or five or under so we're gonna say
check for or let's say make sure five or
under so if the rating is greater than
five then I'm gonna do an alert and I'm
gonna say please rate one through five
and then we just want to return okay we
don't want anything else to happen so if
I save that we try it out let's put in a
six blur and there we go please rate one
through five okay so after that we if
this you know obviously if this passes
or doesn't pass I should say we want to
change the rating so we can do that by
taking the ratings object taking that
product as the key and setting it equal
to the rating okay and then that by
itself isn't going to actually update
things to update it we need to rerun
this function get ratings okay so let's
try that let's select Visio and let's go
to let's say three point five and then
once I blur this should change blur and
there we go
oh one thing I didn't do is the actual
number rating I forgot about that which
is very easy we'll just go down to get
ratings and whereas we're gonna select
let's see if we go up here we're gonna
select this class that's where we want
it to display so what I'll do is just
copy this and let's say add number
rating and we just want to select that
rating or that product and change this
to number rating and we're not changing
the style what we're changing is the
content so we want to say inner HTML is
going to be equal to the actual number
now remember to get that number we use
the ratings object and we use rating as
an index so let's save and there we go
so we'll try this one more time Vizio
will go from two point three to three
point two and I'll blur it and there we
go the stars change and the actual
number changes alright so I think that
we're good to go guys I hope that that
most of that was clear and hopefully you
