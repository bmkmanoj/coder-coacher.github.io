to back
in the last video we've set up PHP
Apache and MySQL using xampp and now
we're going to jump in and we're going
to take a look at some code so these
first couple videos are going to be
really basic stuff and I'm sure that a
lot of you probably already know some of
this stuff but I would still suggest you
watch it and just use it as a refresher
all right I have to do it because I want
this to be for people that are that know
nothing about PHP as well and I want
them to be able to know what's going on
so in this video we're going to talk
about things like just basic syntax
comments variables constants and data
types to also look at concatenation and
combining variables as well alright so
I'm using sublime text my editor if you
guys want to use that you can if you
want to use something else atom is
another one that I use all the time no
pet notepad plus plus is alright you
could even use just Windows notepad but
I wouldn't suggest it as it doesn't have
you know sufficient highlighting or
anything like that
so what I've done here is in my htdocs
folder which is my web root I created a
folder called PHP sandbox and that's
where we're going to create our files
for this series so I'm going to create a
new file here and we'll call this
variable dot PHP okay we're going to be
looking at things other than variables
but that's the main focus so that's what
I'm going to call it alright I'm going
to open the project up and sublime just
a add folder to project and we're going
to go to see xampp htdocs' and then PHP
sandbox okay so let's open up the
variables file alright now if I know
matter what I write in here I can just
say hello and save it and then if we go
to HTTP localhost /
PHP sandbox / variables PHP and we get
hello okay
I'm going to make this bigger so it's a
PHP file but we can just as well put
whatever we want here you can put plain
text we can put HTML so if I wrap this
in h1 tags it's still parts I'll get rid
of that okay so you can see that it does
parse the HTML okay now if we want to
write PHP we have to surround it in PHP
text look okay now some developers will
leave out the ending PHP tag as long as
there's no HTML or anything down here
it's not going to cause a problem
sometimes it's even recommended to do
that so with your preference if you want
to keep it or not okay so we're going to
take a look at echo which basically just
prints stuff out on the screen so if we
say echo hello world and reload we're
going to get hello world okay we could
just as well wrap this in an h1 if we
want okay we can mix and match PHP with
HTML as long as the PHP is wrapped in
tags all right I'm just going to get rid
of that now another command that does
the same thing really is print okay if
we reload that now print the main
difference is that echo doesn't return a
value print will actually return one so
you can use it with an expressions but
echo is a little bit faster than print
and that's normally what you would use
that's what I see okay so we're going to
stick with echo so let's talk about
comments okay every programming language
has comments and tax so there's
basically three ways to do it in PHP if
we want to do a single line comment we
can do the double forward slash okay we
can also do the number sign
and you'll see if I go on another line
it's not a comment anymore now if you
want to do multi-line comments you can
use the same things active CSS uses
which is the slash and then the star and
then star slash so this would be a
multi-line with a multi-line comment
okay so let's see comment syntax so
let's take a look at variables so let's
create a variable called output and
we'll just set that to a little world
and let's echo it out here okay so a
variable is basically just a container
so if we save that and reload we get our
hello world okay very simple now I want
to go over the different the different
rules of variables in PHP alright I'm
just going to put a comment here okay so
first rule is you have to prefix with
the dollar sign in PHP okay you have to
do that or it's going to be looked at as
a constant and you're gonna it's not
it's not going to work out for you so
make sure that you use the dollar sign
and then the variable itself has to
start with a letter or an underscore
okay and underscore is the only
character aside from numbers and letters
that you can have and you can start a
variable with it
okay but you can't start it with a
number so like I said only letters
letters numbers and underscores okay and
they're also taste sensitive so if we
try to start this with a1 like that and
we reload we're going to get a parsing
error okay and there's different types
of errors in PHP and we'll get into that
later on okay if I try to start it with
an underscore let's see what happens
okay so that works okay because you can
start it with an underscore now there
case sensitive so if we if we say output
with an uppercase o here and we leave
that one lowercase we're going to get an
undefined variable error okay so make
sure that you have the right case in
your variables so there's different data
types in PHP as with most programming
languages so let's go over those data
types okay so we have strength which is
this here case Oh strings can be wrapped
or have to be wrapped in quotes and they
can be either single quotes or double
quotes all right and I'll go over the
difference in a minute we can also have
integers integers are numbers which can
be positive or negative so for instance
if we say create a variable called num 1
instead of 2 4 okay notice that I didn't
put quotes around it because integers do
not have quotes if you put quotes around
it it's going to be looked at as a
string okay we also have slopes which
are decimals so let's say float 1 I'll
set it to 4.4.4 okay simple float we
also have boolean boolean's is a true or
false so we could say 1 equals true we
also have a raise now I'm not going to
get into arrays or objects just yet we
will go over those later on and then we
also have no and then we also have a
resource which could be for instance a
return or a reference to a function or
something like that ok it's not an
actual data type so let's now talk about
combining variables concatenation and
using arithmetic so we have this number
on here let's say we want to say
number two and we'll set that to ten and
we can actually add these together if we
say num1 plus num2 and let's set that to
a variable called sum okay and then
let's tackle out some okay so if we
reload that we get 14 and you can use
obviously multiplication division
subtraction whenever you want now let's
say we want to take two strings and put
them together so if we say string 1
equals hello and string 2 equals world
and then say we want a variable called
greeting and we set that to string 1
plus string 2
okay let's see what that gives us if we
try and echo out greeting okay so that's
giving us an error telling us that it's
a non numeric value and we're trying to
add it now as a few things we could do
here to get the result we want which is
hello world one is to use concatenation
now when you concatenate two strings
together you want to use a dot okay in
JavaScript you would use a plus sign so
that would actually work but in PHP use
a dot so if we reload that we get hello
world now if we want to put a space in
between which you probably do you would
have to then concatenate and have string
with an empty character basically a
space so to do that in the middle here
it's going to be a string which needs
quotes and then we're just going to put
a space okay so we're concatenate these
strings so if we reload now we get that
space if we want to put an exclamation
mark on the on the back here
well again can cat me to a string and
we'll put in our exclamation reload and
that works now there's an easier way to
do this and that's by using double
quotes okay so let's do
greeting will say greeting to equals and
let me first show you what happens if we
do a single quote so if we just do Greek
not Gris string one state string two and
then we want to echo out greeting to
just need to save it it actually looks
at these as strings okay so single
quotes will give you exactly what you
put in it's not going to parse the
variables however if you put double
quotes and we reload we get hello world
okay so the double quotes will actually
parse the variable now even though
looking at this this is a much easier
thing to do than this but you need to
know how to do this as well how to
concatenate alright so the next thing
we're going to look at is escape
sequences so sometimes we want to take
away the special meaning that PHP gives
a certain character and to do that we
can escape it so let me give you an
example
so if we say string 3 equals and let's
say we want to say they're here so we
would do they and use a single quote
here and then our e ok now you can tell
right off the bat pictographic ending
quote you can tell that something is not
right here
and the reason for that is that PHP
doesn't understand that we want this
whole thing to be one string because it
sees this this quote here so it's
stopping the string there all right now
for this to actually work well first of
all let's try and run it okay if we try
and it looks like string three if we try
and run it we're going to get an error
okay now what we can do is we can escape
this character we can make it basically
lose its its meaning its power by
putting a backslash in front of it okay
so now it's just looking at this as just
another character in the string so let's
save that and reload and now we get
their hair now you only need to escape
it if this is going to match this
okay if we were to wrap this in double
quotes like that then we actually don't
need to do that okay if we reload we get
the same thing however if this was a
double quote then we do have to escape
it reload and now that works and I think
that's good for the basics of variables
if you guys have any other questions you
can leave it in the comment and I
realized that I can't get to everybody's
question so if there's other people that
know the answer please don't hesitate to
help them out as well
okay so now what I want to look at
before we go is consonant variables are
just that they're variable they can
change constants however you want to use
for values that you absolutely know
aren't going to change an example I
guess would be like your server name or
something like that that's most likely
not going to change so you could use a
constant so let's go ahead and create a
constant now to create it you need to
use the define function so we would say
define and constants are a popular
practice is to give them all uppercase
so if we say greeting and then the
second parameter will be what we want it
to be let's say hello everyone okay and
then down here if we want to output that
we can just say echo greeting let's save
it reload and we get hello everyone okay
so you should only use this if you know
that this string right here is never
going to change
now if we were to make this lowercase
and reload we're going to get an error
saying it's undefined because by default
constants are case-sensitive if you want
to make this case insensitive you can by
just adding a third parameter of true so
if we save that reload that's going to
work okay that's about all there is the
constants at least at this point just
remember only use them as we know that
that value isn't going to change all
right so I think that's it guys I don't
want to make this too long hopefully
that gives you a good
explanation of just you know basic
syntax comments variables data types in
the next video we're going to take a
look at arrays and we're also going to
look at loops okay so that's it and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
