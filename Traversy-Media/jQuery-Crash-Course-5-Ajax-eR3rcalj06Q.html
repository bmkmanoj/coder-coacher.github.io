work with Ajax and jQuery now before we
get started there's a couple things that
I need you to do if you're going to
follow along one is to install nodejs
which is a JavaScript runtime basically
you can run JavaScript on server
environment so you need to get that
installed and then also there's an NPM
module called live server NPM is node
packaged modules so basically when you
install node you also get NPM and you
can install different modules such as
this one and this is a server that is
very very simple it's just a dev server
you run a command in your command line
and it'll open your file as I open it
inside of a server alright or in a
server environment and the reason we're
doing this is because if we try to do
ajax from just a standard file on the
file system we're going to get some
issues with chrome so just get that
installed if you don't have it just go
to node.js org go and download it
install it it's just a standard Windows
installer if you're on Mac or Linux
follow the directions for those
platforms as well once you get that set
up I'm just going to open up a command
line real quick ok once you get that set
up you should be able to say node B and
that will give you your version and NPM
V and that'll also verify that you have
both of those alright so now to get live
server setup all you're going to have to
do is say NPM install live server and
you want to add - G that's going to make
it global so that you can access it from
anywhere you can run your server from
anywhere so just go ahead and do that
and if you have something like zamp or
xampp or one of those within where you
have an apache server you can also use
that as well you just have to have some
kind of server environment
alright so that's set up now what we
want to do is navigate to
our file here which I have in Ajax
folder called Ajax so I'm going to say
CD oops
dot dot and it's on my desktop so I want
to go to users Brad
slash desktop slash jQuery crash course
not specify let's see
CD users Brad up I spelled desktop wrong
okay and then I want to go into the Ajax
folder and then what we're going to do
is run live server now if if you if your
port 8080 isn't taken which it probably
isn't then you can just go ahead and run
live server mine is so I'm going to
specify a certain port I'm gonna say
port 8000 alright and that will just
load up that index.html file in the
server you can see we're at one two
seven zero zero one 8000 all right so
just want to get that out of the way
before we start so let's open up our
index file here which is just the UI
that we've been using and let's get
started alright so Ajax stands for
asynchronous JavaScript and XML and you
probably already know that what it does
is it allows you to do things like make
requests behind the scenes so that you
don't have to refresh the page you can
just update certain parts of your
application alright and you can use this
to get other HTML pages you can fetch
Jason so that you can work with api's
and you can get data and load it and do
all kinds of stuff make post requests so
what I'm going to do here is in the
container I'm going to put a div with an
ID of result and then I'm going to
create another file in this folder so
let's see we're going to create a new
file
and let's call it test dot HTML all
right and then we'll open that up and
I'm just going to put an h1 here and
we'll just say hello from test save that
and then what I want to do is bring in
the content from that file using a jack
now there's a bunch of different methods
we can use I think the easiest is load
ok it's the easiest but you also have
some limitations now let's go down here
and we're going to say I'm going to grab
that result div and we're going to call
dot load and then in here we're going to
pass in the file that we want to load so
this is going to be test dot HTML and
it's in the same directory so we don't
need any folder structure or anything
like that so let's go ahead and save it
and over here it should reload by itself
and there you go hello from tests so
we're bringing the the content from this
file into this one using Ajax ok none of
the other parts of the page are
reloading now there's some stuff we can
add to this load method if say we want
to check the response or we want to we
want it to do something if there's an
error so we can do that with a callback
function if we go like that and that can
take in a couple things will say
response text status text and then our
xhr object alright and then in here
we'll do an if ok we'll check to see if
everything went all right we'll say if
status text is equal to success
that means everything went ok so then
we'll do an alert
we'll say it went fine and then let's do
another if actually we'll do let's do an
else if we'll say else if status text
equals error then we'll say alert we'll
say error and then we can also put in
this the status so we'll concatenate
that xhr dot status and we can also get
the status actually we'll just do status
text like that alright so if we save
that and reload it went fine and then it
go it goes and adds that content now
what if we don't have a file called or
what if we search for a file called test
one that we know isn't there let's go
ahead and save that and reload and now
we get error not found all right so
that's how that works
just going to change that back and let's
go ahead and comment this out all right
so that's the load method we also have a
get that we can use so it's money sign
dot get and in here we can pass in test
dot HTML and then it's going to take a
function ok that function will pass back
data and then we can do what we want
with that data let's put it in result
will say result dot HTML and we'll pass
in data all right so let's save that and
it reloads and we get the data ok so it
works just like we did with
it's just a different way of doing it
now let's say we want to get Jason
content so what I'm going to do is
create in here a new file and I'm going
to call it users dot Jason all right and
we'll open that up I'm just going to
paste this in it's just an array of
objects Jason objects just some users
and we'll save that they each have a
first name last name and email so let's
go back to our script and now we want to
do is we want to use instead of get
we're going to use get Jason so I'm
going to comment that out all right and
let's say dot get Jason and here we'll
put in the name of the file which is
users Jason and then we have our
function ok passing the data and then
what we'll do is loop through we'll do
an each pass in the data we're getting
back and then a function pass in the
index and Val actually instead of valid
say user be a little bit more
descriptive and then we'll put up here a
ul with the ID of users okay and then
down here we'll take that
so UL ID users and we want to dot append
pass in here allies and in here we'll
put user dot first-name save that let it
reload and looks like unexpected
identifier
hmm oh I don't have a comma right here I
got to separate those there we go so now
the users are being pulled in and put in
as list items okay so that can be really
helpful now right now we're working with
a local file but we can also we can also
use third-party AP is now there's one I
forget exactly the URL right here
Jason placeholder dot type eco comm and
this basically gives us free api's to
work with for instance posts you can see
it gives us all these different posts
with a title and a body so let's let's
do that now we could use get Jason but
I'm now going to show you the Ajax
method okay and these all do the same
basic thing really all right I think the
Ajax is the most flexibility of the most
options and so on
alright so let's say money sign dot Ajax
and in here we're going to put an object
first thing is going to be the method so
this could be post or get if you don't
provide a method I believe the default
is get and then we need the URL and
we'll grab this right here
okay and then we're going to say the
data type which in this case is Jason
and then down here we're going to say
dot done and inside that done we'll have
a function that's going to pass back
data okay now in this done call back
function let's do console dot log data
okay we'll go back reload and now if you
look down here we have a whole bunch of
objects and they have title body ID and
use your ID so it's pulling all of this
into our application now if we want to
put this in our browser in our
application UI like we can use let's
let's use the map instead of each I
don't think I showed you that okay works
very similar I'm going to say dollar
sign dot map whoops and then we're going
to pass in here data the data that came
back and we'll say function ok we'll
pass in here post call it whatever you
want but I'm going to be descriptive and
then we'll take our result and we'll say
dot pen and let's append an h3 that'll
have the title so we'll just put that in
there post dot title and then after the
h3 let's put a paragraph and we're going
to concatenate in there post dot blog
all right so let's save that and there
we go we have all of our posts all the
title and the body
now the last thing I want to show you is
make is how we can make a post request
alright so what we're going to do is
let's first of all comment it so and
then we're going to create a form up
here
okay the form and then we're going to
have input type text and we'll give it
an ID of title and a placeholder of
title and then let's do a text area
placeholder body and let's give it an ID
of body all right and then we'll just
put h3 will say add post all right let's
give this form an idea as well I'll call
it post form all right and let's also
put an action in so usually if you're
using PHP or something and you're
directly submitting a form you want to
put an action with JavaScript we're
going to put our URL in here but we're
going to grab it from within our script
and then call the post request so the
the URL I want is this same one okay
we're going to make a post request to
this just like that and then let's go
down let's check it out first okay so we
have our well we need a submit button
and that's really ugly so I'm just going
to put a line break there and there and
then let's put our input so submit value
submit
and there we go okay so now what we're
going to do is grab that form so it had
an idea of post form and then we'll say
dot submit okay
put our function and we're going to pass
in that evaluative nth the default
behavior prevent default and let's see
we want to grab the the title and the
body values so let's save our title and
we're going to set it to ID title dot
Val okay same thing with the body body
dot Val okay and then the URL let's grab
that as well remember that's in the
action attribute so what we can do is we
can say this because we're talking about
the actual form and then we want the
attribute of action alright then what
we're going to do is we're going to use
the post function just like we have get
we have dot post all right and then here
we're going to pass in the URL and then
the values we want to send along which
will be titled okay send them as an
object like that and then we're going to
say dot done and that takes in a
function okay now it is going to give us
the data back as well and then what
we'll do is just console dot log I'll
say post saved
console dot log and we'll pass in the
data all right so let's go ahead and and
reload unexpected identify or what's
that variable I forgot the equal sign
all right so I'll just say hello this is
body submit and there we go so we're
submitting and we're posting and then
we're getting the object back along with
the ID that's being assigned to it in
the API all right so that's how you can
make a post request in jQuery and using
Ajax all right so I think we're going to
stop there now as of now this is the
last video in the course but I will be
looking at some other areas of jQuery
that we can possibly add on to this
alright so at least now you know all the
basics and hopefully you enjoyed this
mini course and I would definitely
suggest that you take a look at the the
course that's in the description it's an
edge wanax course it's extremely cheap
and it'll give you ten projects to build
with both JavaScript and jQuery so
thanks for watching and I will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
