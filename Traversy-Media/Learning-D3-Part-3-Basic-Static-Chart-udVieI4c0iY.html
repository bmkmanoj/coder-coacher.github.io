this is episode 3 and in this video I'm
going to show you how to build a very
very simple chart using d3 this is going
to be a chart that is static so it's not
something you can just keep adding data
to it's just it's just to show you the
very basics of how we can kind of build
something that resembles a chart alright
later on in the series will be building
real charge with scales where you can
just continuously add data and it'll
still show up correctly but for now
we're just going to build something very
small and static all right so what I
have here is just an unordered list just
like we had in the last two videos
except these are smart phones okay so
what we're gonna do is make a really
simple chart that's gonna show us bars
with the length depending on sales of
that smart phone all right so what I'll
do is I'm going to create an array of
JavaScript objects so I'm gonna call
this Styles and set that to an array and
for the first one we're going to give it
a background
and this one is gonna be red and we're
also gonna do the text color all right
because if for instance on on red we can
have a white color font but if we're
gonna do yellow we'll want to put want
black so we want to be able to change
those all right and then the width is
gonna represent the sales of that
smartphone all right so for this we'll
say 35 so that's gonna be percent 35
percent obviously we want all the widths
to equal a hundred ideally all right so
let's go ahead and just copy that five
times
okay and then we'll change this one to
yellow and we'll change the text to
black and then for this let's say 25 all
right so what's that 60 and then it'll
change this to green and you'll say 60
70 80 and then these two will be 10
and we'll change this color to black
doing your capital let's see this one
let's say orange
all right so we have our opt our array
here of objects of data now we're going
to use the d3 select okay we want to
select all and we're gonna pass in let's
see oh I
dots I'm sorry dot items Li alright and
we're gonna bind the data just like we
did in the last episode and we're gonna
pass in styles and we're gonna use the
dot style method and in here we're gonna
have our values okay so we'll say font
size that you could just put this stuff
in CSS the static values here but I'm
just going to put it all here just for
convenience alright so font size let's
get of padding okay we want this to look
like a chart so keep that in mind I will
do six pixels of padding we're going to
want the bars to have a little bit of
margin so we'll say four pixels
and let's set the list style to none
alright so those are the values static
values okay the next one's background
color width we're going to want that to
come from this data all right so let's
do with a background and we're going to
set this to a function and I'm gonna
pass in the data here and then we're
going to return we want to return d dot
background
all right and let's copy that okay this
one is gonna be the color same thing
we're just going to change that for
color and change this to color and then
this one is gonna be the width okay so
we want to return d dot width and this
needs to be in percent so we're going to
add on a percent sign all right so let's
go ahead and save that and reload
and there we go get a nice little chart
let's make the text for windows phone
just windows make it look a little
neater there we go
all right cool so if we were to change
let's say Samsung started to move ahead
of iPhone by the way these statistics
here are just false I just made them up
so they no attention to those so we'll
save that reload and now you can see
that the Galaxy has moved ahead of the
iPhone alright and like I said this is
just a very static simple example this
isn't something you would really do much
like the other examples I'm just trying
to show you how how D 3 works at its
cool alright so in the next video we'll
get a little more advanced we'll create
a chart and I'll show you how to add
scales so that we can keep adding data I
mean because right now if we want to add
another phone or another value here
let's just go like that and let's say we
want this gray
and reload we're not gonna see it all
right because we have just a certain
amount of list items here so it's not
gonna work all right same thing is if we
wanted to add another phone here and we
don't have the data we don't have that
in this array it's not going to work so
scales can take care of that and we're
just using CSS here typically you'd want
to use SVG or scalable vector graphics
which goes really well with d3
and you can do much more complex things
much more complex shapes so in the next
video we're gonna go ahead and take a
look at SVG if you don't if you've never
used it it's not that difficult we'll
first just do it in the browser with the
SVG tag and then I'll show you how to
draw shapes with d3 all right so I will
see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
