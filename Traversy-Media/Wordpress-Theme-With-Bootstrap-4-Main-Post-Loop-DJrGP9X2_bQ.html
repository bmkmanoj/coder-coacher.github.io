we went ahead and set up our menu so we
now have a working menu with dropdowns
which is really nice so we have all
static HTML right here right now so we
want this to reflect the blog posts from
within our WordPress installation so
first thing I want to do is actually
create some blog posts alright so let's
go here we'll say add new say blog post
1 and I'm going to just grab some dummy
content generate some LARM if some copy
that paste that in let's add a category
here we'll say business and publish
alright let's add another post paste
that in actually I'll I'll just switch
the paragraphs okay add category we'll
say technology and we'll add some tags
and publish ok so let's go back to the
front-end and now we need to open up our
index.php and we want to go under where
we have the header okay so this HTML is
from the example template that we got
from get bootstrap so we're going to try
to stick to that that HTML just make it
dynamic so it looks like we have a blog
main div that holds all the blog posts
all right then we have a div with the
class of blog post looks like that
contains one then we have another blog
post and then another so what we want to
do is we want to create a loop that is
going to spit out a blog post sorry
about that as long as there are blog
posts so we're going to keep this first
div class blog post and get rid of than
the other two
all right and then what we'll do is
we're going to wrap a loop around this
one all right so to do this let's first
check to see if there are blog posts we
can do that with PHP if have posts okay
that's a WordPress function to check to
see if there's post all right and then
we're going to end that right here okay
and I'm going to get rid of this nav for
now okay so we'll check and then let's
put an else here as well okay and if
there are none then we just want to say
that and actually when you spit out
texts like this you should wrap it in a
localization function so we should be
able to do double underscore no posts
found all right now if there are posts
then we want to loop through them so
what we can do here is we're going to
say PHP while okay want to say while
have posts all right and then in
WordPress we have to do this thing where
we put a colon and then we say the post
which is a little weird it took me a
little while to get used to but that's
the correct syntax all right and then we
want to end the while down here
all right so let's go ahead and save
that and see what happens okay so you
can see that it's just spitting out this
sample text but there's three of them
and that goes that matches the three
posts that we have here what we need to
do is just make these dynamics so it
spits out the correct content all right
so we'll start with the title okay so
the titles right here we're going to
replace this with PHP the underscore
title all right we'll save that go back
reload and now you can see that the
titles are now changed to the correct
titles okay now I'm going to skip the
date in the meta for a second and go
right to the content so I'm going to
replace all this okay not the div
everything inside and let's put in PHP
the content all right we'll save that
reload and now you can see that we're
getting the content from each post which
is what we want now you may not want the
entire thing entire post to show here
because this is kind of a main blog post
area you'd probably want a read more
button so to shorten this up what we can
do is instead of the content we can use
the excerpt okay so if I save that and
reload now you can see that it's much
shorter now you may want to control how
long you want this so to do that what we
can do is go into functions.php and
we're going to create a function
ok we're going to have a function and
let's call it set excerpt length all
right and all we're going to do here is
return a number so let's say return 20
all right now we need to use a filter
here not an action we're going to say
add filter all right and the idea of
this is add action is used to create
something add filter is used to edit
something all right so we do need a hook
here the hook we're going to use is
excerpt length and then we just want to
put the name of our function save that
go back and now we get 20 character 20
words okay I think that's a little too
short so I'm going to set this to let's
say 45 okay now right now we don't have
a way to get to the single post page
what we can do is add a link to the
heading and or add a read more button
okay so let's go to the heading or the
title and we're going to wrap this in a
link and that's going to go to PHP the
permalink okay wrap that save it and if
we reload whoops what happened
oh oh oh I didn't finish the paytag all
right so now we have a title that's
linkable click it it takes us to that
particular post now the single post
isn't showing all the content don't
worry about that yet we're going to get
to that in a little bit so back to the
main blog post page now we want to fix
this because right now this metadata is
just completely static so let's go to
where we have that okay and we want the
date and the author so let's start with
the date so what we can do here is we
can say PHP the date save it reload and
we get the date all right now there's a
lot of different ways to format it if
you are familiar with the date function
in PHP you can use any of those
formatting strings where are we and in
addition to the date you can also use
the time now if we just use the time by
itself it just gives us the time which
isn't very helpful we want to know the
date too so we can actually add some
formatting in here all right so let's do
that I'm not going to go over the
formatting if the peach the PHP
documentation has all this stuff but
basically what this is going to do is
give us the date and the time okay so we
get May 23rd and we get the time now for
the author okay what we can do here is
say PHP the author
reload and there we go now for the link
we want that to go to a page where it
shows all the posts by that author so
what we can do is place that with a
function called get author post URL all
right now that alone isn't going to do
what we have to pass in another function
as a parameter so this is going to be
get underscore the meta know get the
author meta alright and then we're just
going to pass in here ID okay save that
reload okay what do they do well did I
not hand the PHP no I didn't all right
and if we click on that it's going to
take us to a page with all the author's
posts which is every post actually that
doesn't look right the URL should be
different what do they do wrong oh we
got to echo it that's right okay so now
you can see the URL says author slash
admin all right so that's the main blog
post blog page now you'll notice that
when we're in a post okay when we're in
the edit or add post we don't have that
that image option down here that you may
have seen before for a featured image
that the reason for that is because we
didn't we didn't include support for
that and our theme so to do that is
really easy we just need to go to our
functions PHP and we can actually go to
our theme setup function okay and then
all we need to do is say add theme
support
and then we can pass in post thumbnails
okay save it go back and reload and now
we have a featured image option so let's
go ahead and set a featured image I have
some images on my desktop that I will
include in the github repository and
upload those okay let's go ahead and
choose one of these I'll say set
featured image update okay that was blog
post too let's go to one set featured
image update and let's see I forget
which one I use that one alright and
then hello world grab that okay so
update now if we go to the front end and
reload we're not going to see any change
because we didn't include that in our
index file so let's go to our index file
and we'll put this right below where the
meta is so this here
let's do first of all we'll check to see
if there is a thumbnail so we'll say PHP
if has post thumbnail
okay if it does then we're going to say
PHP the post thumbnail alright we'll
save it let's reload and now the image
shows up but it's not it's not fitting
from within that div so what we'll do is
let's wrap let's wrap this in a div a
call post thumb and then what we'll do
is go to our CSS file
we'll say post thumb let's set the width
to a hundred percent and let's set
height to auto okay now we'll go back
and reload and nothing oh I'm sorry we
got to do post thumb image okay so now
it fits all right good let's actually
put a little bit of margin below it as
well okay we'll say eight pixels all
right so now we have our blog posts with
images in the next video we'll take a
look at how to format our single page
because right now it just looks exactly
like the index because it's actually
using that index file okay so we'll do
that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
