hey what's going on guys welcome to the
yarn crash course this course is for
anyone that wants to get started with
the yarn package manager' and check out
the commands and maybe compare it a
little bit to NPM and I'll talk about
that in a second but first what is yarn
yarn is a JavaScript package manager so
it's used to install Java Script
packages or modules it was created by
Facebook and it's a fast and reliable
alternative to NPM or node package
manager which comes installed with
nodejs okay NPM is the most common used
package manager for JavaScript so I do
have an NPM crash course which is a
little more in-depth than this one so if
you're not familiar with NPM I would
suggest watching that as well
now yarn has a similar syntax to NPM
with almost identical functionality the
commands are different and that's really
the purpose of this course is to get you
familiar with those commands it installs
packages from the NPM registry so
anything that you can install with NPM
you can also install with the yarn now
if this video was made let's say a year
ago we would have a slide that shows you
all the reasons why yarn is so much
better than NPM and that's one of the
reasons I wanted to make this video is
because a lot of other yarn videos are
outdated because they're comparing it to
NPM version 4 and yes yarn was much
faster more efficient more secure and
some of those things may still apply but
not to the magnitude as they as it did
with NPM for NPM 5 really took some
notes from yarn or just blatantly copied
its advantages it's much faster than NPM
4 but with just about all the tests that
I've seen even with NPM version 5 yarn
is still a
little bit faster so it used to be well
worth it to switch to yarn for speed but
now the difference is much closer MP m5
also added a standardized lock file for
a cross pass package compatibility yarn
had the yarn lock file and now NP m5 has
the package dot lock file and this makes
things more reliable and we'll talk more
about the lock file later and PM 5 also
removed the need to add the - - save to
save your packages to your package dot
JSON file and this I never saw the the
use for that anyway why we had to do
that but that was a nice advantage that
yarn had is that we could just do yarn
add in the package name and we didn't
have to add any extra flags to save it
to the package dot JSON file but now
with NPM 5 we don't have to do that so
there are advantages to yarn but the the
big reasons why people said use yarn
over NPM they're just not as great as
they used to be since the release of NPM
5 I believe back in May of 2017 so if
you ask me my opinion I just think it
boils down to peer preference I
personally use NPM I always have but
recently I've been using yarn quite a
bit because I do like the syntax but I'm
not going to say that one is better than
the other I think it's just it's all
about preference NPM is obviously more
common that's a huge plus yarn is a
little bit faster that's a plus so it's
it's all up to you on what you want to
do this video is not a comparison video
I just wanted to mention this before we
actually get in and look at the commands
and the syntax all right so enough with
the slides let's go ahead and jump in
and get started with the yarn package
manager
alright so I already have yarn installed
on my computer but I just want to go
through the ways that you can install it
in fact you can install it with NPM yarn
actually doesn't recommend it they don't
even have it on their installation page
something about security and integrity
but they most likely just don't want you
using NPM so for Mac you can use
homebrew so you can use the homebrew
package manager
you can also install it through Mac
ports for Windows there's actually an
installer you can download that's what I
did or you could use the chocolaty
package manager for Windows which I've
actually never used and you can also use
the scoop command-line installer for
Windows and then for Linux obviously you
can use your standard package manager if
you're on Debian you can use apt-get or
whatever whatever package manager for
your distribution alright so that's how
you would install it now what I'm gonna
do is just create a new folder and I'm
gonna call it let's just call it yarn
test and I'm gonna open that up with vs
code and I'm gonna use that as my text
editor as well as the integrated
terminal which you can open with control
backtick okay so from here we're gonna
start to run our commands and I don't
know if I mention this but all the
commands will be in the gist file in the
description of this video okay so first
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna run
yarn - V and that's going to give us the
current version you can see I have
version 1.3 point 2 installed yours
maybe later depending on when you're
watching this okay we also have the yarn
help command which is going to give us
all the different commands that that are
available to us now we're going to be
going over just about every command
except for ones that have to do with
publishing your own packages on in the
NPM repository that's a little beyond
the scope of this of this video we're
not going to talk about those next thing
we're going to look at is yarn and knit
and you'll notice that a lot of these
are similar to NPM so this works just
like NPM and knit it's going to ask us
some questions so our package name yawn
test version that's good description
we'll just say test app and entry point
index J s by default repository you can
put your name if you want or the author
and the license and if it's private all
right and then you'll see that it
created a package dot JSON file which
looks very similar to what would
be created with NPM all right and then
you can also add what I'm gonna do is
just delete this file we can also add
the - why flag so if we say yarn and
knit - y that'll just accept all the
defaults and quickly create the
package.json file okay so what if we
want to set a default let's say we want
to change the license to is C so what we
could do is say yarn config set and we
could say in it - license and we want to
change it to ISC all right so now if I
were to get rid of the package.json file
and we were to run yarn and knit and go
through this you'll see that for the
license
the default is now is C okay and if we
want to check any config values we can
say yarn config get and let's say we
want to look at and knit license and it
shows us that it's ISC now let's say we
want to remove it and put it back to the
default which was I believe MIT then we
could do yarn config remove in it -
license oh I'm sorry it's delete not
remove
all right so now if we were to go and
check it again with get can configure
you see that it's back to MIT okay so
now let's look at installing packages
right now we don't have any packages
installed we just have our package JSON
file setup so with NPM we would do like
NPM install let's say lodash with yarn
we're gonna say yarn add lodash okay you
can see it's very very quick that
happened in point 71 seconds all right
let's install another one will install
the moment package which has to do with
formatting dates and times
so we'll say yarn add moment and that'll
install it and obviously it gets set to
dependencies but there's no need to do -
save or anything like that okay we can
also install stuff from our package
Jason so if I were to go in here and
let's go ahead and put in let's say we
want to install gulp and we want to
install the latest version we could just
put an asterisk like that so right now
if I save this gulp is not installed if
we want to install it or anything that
we put manually in here then we would
run Yarn install and that's gonna
install gulp and any dependencies that
it has ok now to remove a package we can
say yarn remove and let's remove lo -
okay so it'll remove it and it will
remove it from our dependencies and
let's say we want to install a certain
version of a package like lo - right now
is for point 17 point 4 let's say we
want to install for point seventeen
point three for some reason so we can
simply say yarn add lodash and we can
use the @ symbol and say for dot 17.3
all right so now if we install that
you can see that that version is
installed now in the NPM crash course I
go over this stuff a little more the
package.json file and the versioning how
that works for instance the carrot
symbol which means that it's not going
to go past the major version here it'll
just update the sub versions and we go
over all that so you may want to watch
that as well if you don't understand the
versioning and all that alright now if
we want to find outdated versions of
modules that we have installed we can
say yarn outdated and if we look down
here and it'll show us four lodash in
purple it's it's basically telling us
there's a later version than what we
have installed okay now we can also do
outdated and search for a certain
package so we could say outdated lodash
and that'll just check that package and
if we want to upgrade we could say yarn
yarn upgrade lodash
and that should upgrade let me reload
this well it didn't upgrade yarn let's
just do yarn upgrade that do it that's
weird
I'm not sure why that that's doing it
maybe if we do yar an upgrade lo - at
four point seventeen point four there we
go alright so now it's upgraded to four
point seventeen point four I thought it
would just bring it to the latest
version if anyone knows if that's
supposed to happen or if I miss
something then please let me know
alright so let's talk about global
modules so if you have any experience
with NPM which I'm guessing a lot of you
do you know that if you want to install
something globally you use the dash G so
you would do whoops
you would do n PM install dash G and
then let's say node Mon which is a
module to continuously watch your nodejs
applications so with yarn what we do is
we use global so yarn Global global add
node Mon now with NPM you can do the
dash G here or you can do it after with
yarn you have to do global right after
the yarn command okay so it has to be in
this order if you do yarn add global
what it's gonna do is it's gonna look
for a package called global and try to
install that okay so it's very important
that you do it this way so we'll go
ahead and run that and that will install
it globally so that we can access it
from anywhere all right now where it
installs is well actually there's a
command that we can use use to find out
where your global packages are installed
and that's yarn the global bin
okay so you can see I'm on Windows so
it's gonna be my users whatever my
username app data local yarn bin so
let's take a quick look at that it's
it's my new materialized course there we
want to go to the C Drive and users Brad
app data local yarn and bin and there it
is so you can see that node montes is
installed there alright so let's see
what about removing global packages so
basically the same as the local except
we include global so remember global
comes first and then we'll say remove
node Mon okay and now if we look back in
that folder you can see that the node
Mon CMD file is now gone now if you want
to list out your packages you could say
yarn list okay now it's going to give
you all your dependencies and the
dependencies of the dependencies for
instance you can see all the stuff that
we have here and then even if we look in
like gulp we're gonna have another node
modules folder with more dependencies
and you can limit the the depth so we
could say for instance yarn pattern yarn
list and we could say depth equals zero
right oh it's supposed to be - - depth
and that'll give us just basically the
top layer so what you see here won't
give us the the dependencies of
dependencies and that works just like
NPM okay if we want to check just the
dependencies for let's say gulp we could
say yarn list and we could say - -
pattern
and let's say gulp okay so that'll give
us just the dependencies for gulp now
what I want to do is install a package
as a dev dependency so I'm gonna I'm
gonna install Gulf but first I'm gonna
remove it so I'll say yarn remove gulp
okay so that'll take it away and then
let's install it as a dev dependency so
for that we can say yarn add gulp and we
can do - upper case D you can also do -
- dev okay but we're gonna do upper case
D and there we go so now gulp is added
as a development dependency now if we
want to remove that even though it's a
dev dependency all we have to do is say
yarn remove gulp and it'll still remove
it from the dev dependencies all right
so I mean those are the main things that
you're gonna be doing just you know
adding packages removing them adding
them to dev dependencies things like
that but let's talk about some of the
the less common things one thing you may
have noticed is when we ran yarn and
knit it created this yarn dot lock file
and basically this is used for to have
consistent installs across a machine so
it holds exactly which versions of the
dependencies that were installed along
with the repo link and you yourself
don't have to worry about this 99% of
the time it's completely managed by yarn
there is a command that verifies that
the versions of the dependencies in your
package.json file matched at the lock
file and that's yarn check so if we were
to say yarn check
and it just tells us success that the
folders are in sync so if you ever want
to check that then you could do that
another thing another command we have is
yarn import so for some reason this gets
deleted what we can do is we can
generate a new yarn lock file from the
existing node modules folder so we can
say yarn import and now you can see that
that created a new lock file okay so
what about scripts what about running
scripts let's go ahead and clear this
out and open up our package.json file
and what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna
install node Mon locally as a dev
dependency so I'm gonna say yarn add
node Mon as a dev whoops as a dev
dependency and then I'm gonna add a
script so I'm gonna go right here above
our dependencies and put in scripts okay
set that to an object so make sure you
put a comma there and let's say we want
a script called dev and we want that to
run node Mon and watch the index.js file
so we'll save that and then let's create
an index J s file and all I'm gonna do
here is console dot log hello world and
save alright so if we want to run this
what we can do is say yarn run dev all
right and what it'll do is just
constantly watch this file if I were to
change this to hello there and save it's
gonna watch it it's gonna reload and
it's gonna console log hello there
alright so yarn run just like NPM run
same thing alright you'll notice a lot
of similarities another command that is
less common that you probably won't use
is yarn licenses if you ever want to
check the licenses of your packages so
we can say licenses and you want to say
less
and that's just gonna spit out all the
different licenses so you can see this
rapi dependency as a is C this one has
an MIT license BSD 3 clause so if you
ever want to check those out you can
okay if you want to zip up all your all
your packages into a gzip file you can
do that with yarn pack
so if we say yarn pack and run that
notice that now it put this file here
called yarn test version 1 0 0 dot tgz
okay so created that tarball for us but
I'm just going to delete that okay and
if you want to check your cache okay you
could do yarn cache list and you can see
what packages are in the cache alright
so you can see we have quite a bit and
if you want to clear it out what did i
do cache list actually before we clear
it out you can check for specific
modules with by saying pattern and let's
say lodash and it'll just give us the
low - stuff you can see here low - keys
and template all that stuff and then to
clear it we can say yarn cache clean and
that will clear it out alright guys so
that's gonna be it for this tutorial I
will be gone for two days so I probably
won't make a video until probably Monday
or yeah around Monday or so I'm going to
Foxwoods in Connecticut which is a big
casino me and my wife usually go maybe
two to two or three times a year
