Express
Kassandra video series up to this point
we have everything installed nodejs is
installed on a Windows system as well as
Cassandra in this video we're going to
generate our application and just get it
you get it initially setup and ready for
us to work on it alright so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to create a folder
in my C Drive and it's just gonna be
called projects alright so what I want
you to do is the same thing just create
if you don't already have a projects
folder where you will you have all your
projects create that but do not create
the actual project folder because that's
going to be generated for us alright so
what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to
right click and go to git bash and
that's going to open that command line
that get offers right in this projects
folder so that's what we want
alright we need to do a few things here
first thing I'm going to say NPM install
and then we want this G flag
Express all right the G is for globally
we wanted to install globally
all right so that installed Express or
got it ready to be installed next thing
before Express four came out you could
just generate your application using
Express but now with Express four we
need to actually install the generator
so I'm going to say npm install g
express generator
all right so now we have the generator
and we can actually generate our
application and it's folder so we can do
that with Express and then the
application name okay so I'm just going
to call this application my subscribers
alright okay and you can see that it's
generated all these files and folders so
if we go to our projects folder you
should now have a folder called my
subscribers or whatever you named it and
in here you can see that we have all the
initial Express folders ok the binaries
folder
the public folder which holds all the
images global Java scripts and
stylesheets also gives us a style sheet
to work with routes this is where all
our routes go basically our index routes
going to take care of just displaying
the the list of subscribers and then
we'll have some other routes as well
such as the subscriber route where we
can actually just view one user and then
also we need routes to add and edit
subscribers as well
views basically we're using Jade it's a
template engine for node and it's not
it's not regular HTML if I actually open
this I can show you a little bit it
works on indentation
alright so normally we would surround
this content with an HTML tag up here
and then an ending HTML tag down here
when we're using Jade we're using
indents
so after HTML you can see that
everything is indented one space and
what that means is that it's wrapped in
this all right if I move this head back
then it's not going to be wrapped in
this anymore
it's gonna come after the closing HTML
tag so you don't have two versions you
don't have the beginning and end tag you
just have one and then it goes by the
indentation
and one thing I should mention if you're
using sublime text like I am then you
want to go down here where it says tab
size and you want to make sure that you
go to convert indentation to tabs
actually you can use spaces or tabs but
not both okay because you'll get an
error I might actually get an error with
this so so that's the layouts I mean I'm
sorry that is the Jade files the views
now this layout Jade this is the master
view you can see it has the doctype it
has the HTML of body tags basically all
our views will be inside of this view
and those will go here in the block
content all right so this is where you
may want to put your navigation your
footer header things like that all right
so let's close that and it gives us an
index view basically whenever you create
a view it has to have this and this and
then it has the content look so this
this page just has basically an h1 tag
and why this is sets equal to title
because title is actually a variable
this is gonna come from the route and
that's why we have it down here in this
format and I'll show you what I mean in
a few minutes so those are the views
I just want to close all the other I
think these are all old alright so back
in our file structure next we have app
KS and that's basically the gateway to
our application that's where we define
we just open that up that's where we do
all our requires for our modules to set
up the view engine you can see that
we're using Jade for the view engine
this is the main instantiation of the
express variable for the app variable
object and then here is just all the
middleware that Express uses actually
this is this here is where we can define
our routes basically we're going to
define the home or the index page which
is just a slash and then also the slash
users which is just a I guess a default
a sample route that they give you and
then down here you can you can specify
different in time development you can
you can your environment can be in
development it can be production testing
whatever you want alright so I'm just
going to leave all this for now
it'll ask folder I'm sorry the last file
I want to show you is this package.json
file and this is very important this is
where you want to define your
application info you can see we have the
name the version which I'm going to
change to 0 0 1 and then here is where
we define all the dependencies okay so
these are all here are all modules that
need to be installed they're not already
installed we just got to run a command
to do that but before we do that we want
to make sure that we install the
Cassandra driver alright so down at the
bottom here actually we want to put a
comma here oops
okay and then we're gonna do Sandra
Driver
okay and then what we want to do here is
the version number now if you don't know
the version number then you just want to
use an asterisk and that's gonna give
you the latest version okay so that's
the only epoch the only module that we
need to add here so I'm gonna go ahead
and save this and how we install those
dependencies is through this command
line we're going to do just NPM install
and that should install all of those let
me see what's this couldn't read
dependency I can't find a package dot
JSON Oh
we're not in the actual project folder
were in projects so we need to change
directory to my subscribers all right
now we should run NPM install
okay and now if we go to our folder you
should see now we have a node modules
folder it has all the modules we need
including Express Jade and also the
Cassandra driver all right so that's all
set now before I end the video one more
thing I just want to go to app J s and
we just want to include the Cassandra
module or driver so variable Cassandra
and we're just gonna say require
Cassandra driver okay so now we'll save
that and now we can try to run our
server okay so to run the server all we
have to do is do NPM start
all right so you can see that it is
running we have a blinking cursor here
so let's go ahead and open Chrome
and what we want to do is go to http
localhost and the default port is going
to be 3000
all right so we're getting a jade error
and this is coming from what I talked
about with the spaces and tabs you can
see that right here it says you can use
tabs or spaces but not both all right so
I'm gonna go back to views and I just
probably in the layout file okay and I'm
just gonna kind of bring all these back
all right and then after HTML we want to
do a tab tab tab
all right so basically it should look
like that I'm gonna save it and reload
and there it is so this is the default
welcome page so everything's up and
running one thing I want to mention is
that when you're editing JavaScript
files when you're editing routes things
like that you need to restart the server
if you're just editing Jade documents
that then you don't need to restart it
all right
so in the next video we will be creating
our route for the index page which will
just show all of our subscribers and
then we'll go from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
