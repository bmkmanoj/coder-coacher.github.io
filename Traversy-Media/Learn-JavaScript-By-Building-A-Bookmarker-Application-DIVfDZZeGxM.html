be building a website bookmarking
application using pure JavaScript okay
no angular react no frame works not even
jQuery you guys have been asking for
something like this using purely
JavaScript so I figured this would be a
good example alright so we're going to
be using html5 local storage to store
our bookmarks okay so that way even if
we close out the browser or we come back
they're still going to be there
all right so very simple we're also
using bootstrap using one of the default
templates and basically all we have to
do is put in a name and actually let me
just show you for us we have a little
bit of validation if we try to submit
this it's going to say please fill in
the form
all right now if we put in a name and
then we put something that's not a URL
and submit please use a valid URL all
right so let's do HTTP twitter.com and
submit and you'll see that gets added
alright and if I reload it's still there
even if I were to exit out of the
browser and come back it's still going
to be there all right we can actually
see if we go to our google chrome tools
and go to application local storage file
you can see we have a bookmarks key and
we're storing a string app our string of
adjacent object array that has all the
bookmarks all right so it's going to be
pretty simple if you are very fluent in
JavaScript then you this will be very
easy for you if not I'm going to try to
explain it as best as I can I'm going to
really put I'm going to put a lot of
comments in the code for you guys we're
going to be working with different parts
of JavaScript as far as functions and
events listening for events things like
that local storage of course and then we
can choose to visit one of these links
okay that will bring us to the site and
a new tab and we can also delete okay we
can delete them and if I reload they're
gone all right so that's what we'll be
building first thing we're going to do
is create the UI here which is very
simple
well we're going to go to get bootstrap
and let's go ahead and just download it
which I've already done quite a few
times and let's create our folder okay
so I'm just going to create a folder on
my desktop and we're going to call this
book marker okay let's create let's
create an index.html file okay that'll
be the only HTML file this is a single
page application and then let's open up
the bootstrap zip file okay we're going
to bring over all of these folders and
let's clean it up a little bit in the
CSS all we want is bootstrap let's use
bootstrap mndot CSS so that's the only
one we want we can delete the rest all
right and then in j/s we just want
bootstrap minjae s okay so that's that
now let's open up index.html I'm going
to use Adam for my text editor but you
of course you can use whatever you'd
like I'm going to open that folder as a
project let's see it's on my desktop
bookmarker alright so if we go to get
bootstrap and let's go to getting
started and then examples and we're
going to use this right here this narrow
Jumbotron template so if we click on
that it'll open it up and what we want
to do is just do a control you we're
going to grab all the source for that
copy it and paste it in our index file
alright so let's go up to the top here
and just kind of work our way down all
right so we want this stuff we can
delete this comment down to here if we
don't need that and let's change the
title will say site
bookmarker now for the link to the
bootstrap min CSS we just want to get
rid of this disc right here okay it
should just be CSS slash bootstrap dot
min and then we can delete the rest of
the stuff that's in the head okay just
make this really simple and let's see as
far as the markup this is a single page
application so we don't need the nav so
let's get rid of the UL right here get
rid of that project name we'll change
that to bookmarker okay um let's see
Jumbotron heading let's actually let's
actually make this an h2 and we'll say
bookmark your favorite sites okay I'm
just going to come kind of going through
the markup really quick because the the
main focus of this is the JavaScript you
guys probably know this if you don't
know HTML or bootstrap I would suggest
watching some of my recent videos on
both I have an HTML 5 web site video and
also a couple new bootstrap videos
alright so in here let's get rid of
those paragraphs and we're going to put
a form okay so we'll say form and we're
going to give it an ID let's just call
it my form and inside here let's put a
div with a class of form group okay and
inside here we'll put a label this will
be the site name
and then we'll put an input give it a
type of text and let's give it a class
of form control so that it goes across
the whole element we also want to give
it an ID I'm going to give it an ID of
site name and we'll give it a
placeholder and we'll just say enter
let's go just say website name okay so
that's our first input let's copy that
form group div paste it underneath and
this one is going to be the site URL
we'll change the ID to site URL and
change this to website URL okay then we
just need our button so let's do button
and we're going to give it a type of
submit okay and let's see what else
let's give it a class bootstrap class
BTN and BTN - primary that'll make it a
blue color just say submit alright so
there's our form now for the the row
down here you'll see that it's using the
grid system it's using two six column
divs what we want is just one twelve
column okay one that goes across the
whole thing so let's change this to
twelve and we can get rid of this six
column one all right and then down in
the footer let's just change this will
just say bookmarker and down at the
bottom we need to link our JavaScript so
we can get rid of this ie10 thing all
right so we need to link our bootstrap
javascript file so script source
and that's in the j/s folder slash
bootstrap dot Minjae s now we also need
jQuery if we're going to use the
bootstrap j/s so let's just grab the
jQuery CDN okay jQuery code jQuery comm
we'll just click on the version three
uncompressed and let's grab this script
tag okay we'll put that make sure you
have it above the bootstrap okay and
then we're also going to have a
JavaScript file that we work in which
will be called main j/s so let's link
that okay
and that should do it now in this row
here this is where our results are going
to be or you know the bookmarks that are
stored in local storage so all we need
here is a div with an ID that we can
latch on to later and output okay so
we're going to call this bookmarks
results alright and that should do it
for the mock-up all we need to include
our style sheet that we're going to
create so under the bootstrap style
sheet let's put in style dot CSS alright
so we'll save that now if we were to
open this up in chrome it should look
like this now notice that it's not
formatted exactly like this is that's
because this actually uses an extra
stylesheet so again let's do a control
you and you'll see there's a file called
jumbotron narrow dot CSS we're going to
click on that and then we're going to
just grab this CSS here okay copy it and
then in our CSS folder we're going to
create our style dot CSS file
okay and any extra styles that you have
you can put in this file let's open that
in Adam okay style.css I'm going to
paste that in alright so now let's go
back to our site and reload and now it
looks more like the demo so the
interface is complete okay
now we're going to move on to the java
script which is the important part so
the first thing I want to do is I want
to be able to submit our site to local
storage all right so we need to have an
event on this on this form on this
submit so what we'll do is let's go into
our main j/s actually we need to create
it first so main dot j/s and just to
make sure that this is working let's
just say alert one and if we reload we
get one all right so we want to create a
listener here so let's say listen for
form submit and what we want to do is we
want to target the form okay so if we
look at it it has an ID of my form
camelcase
so what we can do here is we can say
document dot get element by ID and then
we can pass in here my form okay because
we gave it an ID of my form and then
what we want to do is we want to add an
event listener so we can say dot add
event listener okay and then that's
going to take in some parameters that's
going to take in the actual event you
want to listen for which is going to be
a submit okay it's a form so it has a
submit and then we want to put in the
function that we want to call when that
happens which is going to be called save
bookmark alright so let's go ahead and
create that
so we'll say function save bookmark
and let's test it out by just doing a
console dot log and we'll just say it
works
okay so let's save that and now you're
going to hit f12 to open up chrome tools
or Firefox tools whenever you're using
and let's go ahead and click Submit now
notice that if you look here when I
click it it does say it works but it
flashes really quick and it goes away
the reason that's happening is because
the form is actually submitting to the
page and we don't want that we want to
kind of stop it so that we can work with
it now the way that we do that is when
we call this function we can actually
pass in an event parameter here and one
of the methods that we can use on that
is prevent default which prevents the
default behavior of the form so we can
say e dot prevent default like that all
right so now let's go back and reload
and submit and now you can see it says
it works and it doesn't flash it just
stays there if I keep clicking it it
just keeps happening okay it just adds
one to that so that's what we want now
the next thing we want to do is we want
to get the values that we pass in here
okay when we put something in here we
want to be able to grab these all right
so let's get rid of the console.log and
make sure you keep this prevent default
let's actually put a comment so they
prevent prevent form from submitting
okay let's put a comment here to say
save bookmark okay so we want to create
two variables for our form values so
let's just say get form values and we're
gonna say var now I'm just going to use
es 5 here I'm not going to use wet or
Const because I don't want to have to
set up any you know I don't have to set
up babble or anything like that so
and you should know es 5 syntax if
you're just learning JavaScript anyway
all right so we're going to save our and
we'll call this site name and we're
going to set that to document dot get
element by ID okay we want to get site
name because remember that input we
created right here has an ID of site
name all right now let's see what that
gives us if we were to console dot log
it
okay so we'll reload we'll just put
something in here and submit and you can
see it actually logs the entire element
ok the input tag and everything now we
want to get the value that's typed in
not the actual elements so what we can
do is just add on to this and say dot
value all right so let's go ahead and
reload that and type something in and
submit and now you can see we're getting
the actual value all right so we want to
do that for the site name and the site
URL so let's go ahead and put that in
there site URL all right now when we
submit to local storage when we save
this we're going to save it as an array
of objects all right so we want to
create an object that we want to get an
object ready to submit to local storage
so we're going to create another
variable here called bookmark and we'll
set it to it an object which is
formatted in curly braces all right and
then it's going to have a name which
we'll set to site name and then a URL
which will set to site URL okay so let's
go ahead and console.log that
okay so if we said Google and we put
HTTP Google com submit you'll see that
now we're see we're getting an object
with a name and a URL okay so that's
what we want to submit to local storage
so local storage what I'm going to do is
just give you a quick example here local
storage test and the way that this works
is it stores strings okay local storage
only store strings but I'm going to show
you how we can actually parse the JSON
into a string save it and then when we
need to get it back we can parse it back
to Jason okay it's only a matter of
running it through a single function
alright so to set something in local
storage we just want to say local
storage there's no external libraries or
anything it's part of the html5 standard
so we're going to say local storage dot
set item okay and then you can choose a
key to save as I'm just going to say
test that's the key and then the value
let's just say hello world
all right so that'll actually save the
text hello world as test in local
storage so let's go ahead and save that
and let's reload and we're just going to
does n't matter what we put in here
because we're saving it as test anyway
so submit now nothing happens because
we're not outputting local storage
anywhere but we can check it if we go to
our tools here and go to application and
then local storage click on this file
you'll see we now have test and hello
world okay and we can delete from here
as well just delete both of those and
now if I reload that local storage value
is gone now if we want to get an item
what I do if we want to get an item we
can say local storage dot get item and
we want to get test okay let's actually
console.log that
all right so now if we reload and
obviously to run this we have to submit
and we get hello world okay it's
fetching it from local storage now if we
want to delete from local storage you
can say local storage dot remove item
test so now when we submit this form
it's going to set the item it's going to
console.log it and then delete it and
then let's console.log it again just to
show you that it's gone okay we'll save
that reload submit okay so it logs it
and then it removes it and then it's
null alright so that's how local storage
works we're just gonna I'm going to keep
this here for you guys but I'm going to
comment out alright so moving on we what
we want to do is we want to save this
bookmark that we created in local
storage but before we do that we have to
actually see if there's if there's a
bookmark value there alright because if
it is there then we have to fetch it add
to it and then save it again so we're
going to put an if statement here and
we're going to say if local storage dot
you get item and we want to check for an
item called bookmarks all right and we
want to check to see if that's null so
we want to do a triple equals no all
right so if it's no then that means that
we need to initialize an array so we'll
create an array called bookmarks right
and let's just put a comment here
let's put a comment here test alright so
what we want to do is take this variable
and we want to call dot push that's
going to add to the array our bookmark
that's come that we created up here with
the form values all right so we'll go
like that and then finally we want to
set to local storage because right now
it's just a local array so to do that
we'll say local storage dot set item we
want to set it as bookmarks and we have
our bookmark that we want to add now our
bookmarks sorry
now we if we do this this is actually a
adjacent array we need to save it as a
string so we're just going to wrap it in
a function called jason dot stringify
all right and that'll actually take our
jason array and turn it into a string
before we save it in local storage so
let's go ahead and save this now this
should run because we don't have
anything in bookmarks yet it is null so
it should run and it should store it so
let's say google and we'll save our link
here and click Submit and now let's go
to application local storage file and
you'll see that it's stored here okay
it's a string formatted JSON array so
that's what we want now if we want to
add something else we have to do we have
to tweak this a little bit so we're
going to put an else here okay so this
this is if there is something in
bookmarks then what do we do first thing
we want to fetch it from local storage
all right so let's say get
bookmarks from local storage we can do
that with local storage dot get item
let's see get item bookmarks and we want
to put this into a variable alright now
remember it stores strings so this is
going to be a string and we don't want
that we want to parse it as Jason so we
want to run it through a function called
Jason dot parse alright so just remember
that json dot parse will turn a string
into jason or back into jason jason
stringify will turn it into a string
alright you just want to kind of you
know alternate those whether you're
setting are getting from local storage
unless of course you're actually storing
strings all right so now we have
whatever is in that local storage inside
this variable so what we want to do is
we want to add the bookmark that we're
submitting to that array alright so say
add bookmark to array and we do that
with bookmarks dot push and bookmark ok
and we're just talking about this up
here so we add it to the array and then
what we want to do is set it back to
local storage alright so we're going to
kind of reset it back to local storage
and we can do that with the same command
right here just like that alright so
let's go ahead and save that and reload
and now let's say we want to add
facebook ok submit and then let's take a
look down here
and we have another another value in our
array with the name of Facebook in the
URL facebook.com okay so that's working
fine our values are being stored how we
want alright so the next thing we want
to do is we want to be we want to show
those bookmarks down here okay
everything that's in local storage we
want to display so to do that we're
going to create another function so
let's go underneath save bookmark okay
we'll call this fetch bookmarks okay
that actually has to have a function
keyword all right so to do this let's
see what we want to do is create a
variable called bookmarks actually we
want to do the same thing right here
we're just fetching it from local
storage okay and then let's just console
dot log for now like that now we need a
way for this to run because right now
we're just defining it so what I'm going
to do is go to index dot HTML and on the
body tag I'm just going to put an onload
and set that to fetch bookmarks all
right so now when we reload that should
run automatically so let's open up the
console and reload and you can see it's
getting the the local storage bookmarks
all right so that's what we want now
remember we have this div called
bookmarks results that's where we want
to put them after we fetch them so let's
go back to our fetch bookmarks function
we'll get rid of that and let's say
kids Oh put ID so we'll create a
variable called bookmarks results set
it's a document dot get element by D
bookmarks results okay and then what we
want to do is build our output so we'll
take that bookmarks results variable and
we'll say dot inner HTML equals nothing
alright now I can put anything here
let's just say hello and then save that
and if we go back and reload you'll see
that hello is being put there okay so
we're getting the ID with
document.getelementbyid d and then this
inner HTML is just going to do just that
it's going to put whatever HTML that we
give it into that spot okay through
JavaScript so we actually want to set
this to just nothing for now alright and
then what we want to do is loop through
the bookmarks that are in local storage
and then output them one by one inside
of a div okay so we're going to use a
for loop and I should have mentioned
this at the beginning of the video but
if you're not comfortable with loops and
stuff like that I would definitely
suggest my JavaScript fundamentals for
beginners video where I go through the
very very basics of JavaScript loops and
functions and all that I should have
mentioned that at the beginning all
right so we're going to save our I
equals 0 all right and I'm going to say
as long as I is less than bookmarks dot
length okay so the amount of bookmarks
which in our case right now is two and
then we want to I plus plus we want to
increment it after each time all right
and then in here let's create a variable
called name and we can get that with
bookmarks we want the current iteration
so we're going to put
I hear and then dot name all right then
we want the URL bookmarks I dot URL okay
so now we have the name and URL for each
bookmark now we're going to build the
output so we're going to say bookmark
results dot inner HTML now this time
we're appending to it all right
if you wanted to put a div or something
here you could and you could append to
it by doing plus equals okay so we want
to append to it and let's say div
actually know what let's just test it
out first and we'll just put name okay
which is this right here so let's save
it and now you can see that it's looping
through when it's outputting each
bookmark name which we have Google and
Facebook all right so that's good we
know that's working so we basically want
to create a div block here so let's do
div and we're going to give it a class
of well which is a bootstrap class
that'll give us a gray background and a
border and some padding and then I want
to format this nicely so what we'll do
is go on to it we'll put a plus sign to
concatenate and then we'll go on to a
new line all right and then we're going
to have an h3 okay and then we're going
to concatenate the name plus sign will
go on to a new line okay and then let's
put let's see let's end the H actually
you know what yeah well end the h3
because we're going to be put in the
buttons or the links inside of the h3 as
well all right and then we want to end
that well div so we'll go on to the next
line and put if all right so let's try
that
and there we go good so for the buttons
we're going to use links and then just
format them as buttons with bootstrap
so we want to go under want to go right
here and put a space and then we'll say
a give it a class BTN BTN default I want
it to open in a new window so we're
going to say target equals underscore
blank and then we want our H ref all
right now the H ref is going to be the
URL that's coming from local storage so
we're going to put single quotes inside
the double quotes and then concatenate
the URL all right and then we just want
to end that opening a tag and then close
it and then here we'll just say visit
okay let's input a space right there so
let's save it and reload and now we have
a visit button if I click that it brings
us to the website all right we also want
a delete button so what I'll do is this
needs to have a put a plus sign here
copy this whole line and we're going to
give this one a class of button danger
to make it read and let's see this text
we're going to change that to delete and
then the H ref is just going to be a
number sign because it's not actually
going to go anywhere we're actually
going to call a function okay so we want
to put in an on click okay we want to
say on click and we're going to call a
function called delete bookmark okay now
we want to pass in the URL here and this
is this is a little weird we have to
escape the quotes and we escaped with
the backslash all right and then we also
want to concatenate the URL so we need
another quote and then a plus sign put
the URL in plus sign
and then we need another escape like
that all right so that should work
that's going to pass in the URL to this
delete bookmark all right so let's go
ahead and save that make sure it shows
up okay if I click delete
it's it's not going to do anything it
just reloads the page we need to create
the delete bookmark function all right
so let's put that right here so say
function delete bookmark ok remember
that's going to take in a URL and let's
just do console.log URL
alright look so let's go ahead and click
delete - UPS what's going on here oh I
have it set to target blank we don't
want that so the delete shouldn't have
the target attribute all right so now I
click delete and you'll see that it
shows the the URL so that's what we want
now to delete what we need to do is
first fetch the bookmarks from local
storage then we want to loop through
them and then check to see if the
current one we're looping through
matches this URL if it does we're going
to splice it out and then we're going to
reset local storage all right so let's
say yes okay so bar bookmarks actually I
can just copy this right here all right
so basically all of this consists of
just grabbing it from local storage
changing it the way we want and then
resetting it all right so now let's loop
through bookmarks so for bar I equals 0
as long as I is less than bookmarks dot
length and then I plus plus okay and
then what we want to do is do an if
statement and we want to say if the
current iteration so bookmarks high URL
is equal to the URL that's passed in up
here then we know that's the one we want
to delete so we'll say remove from array
and we do that with bookmarks dot splice
okay we want to splice at the the
current iteration and we want to splice
out one from that all right and then all
we have to do after that is reset the
local storage and we want to do that
under the loop okay so right here and we
can just grab this alright so that will
reset the local storage after we delete
it so let's save that alright so if we
go down here we click delete now it's
still there
but if I reload it goes away the reason
that's happening is it's deleting it
after it fetches the bookmarks so what
we want to do is just call fetch
bookmarks again alright so we'll just
say re fetch bookmarks and we just have
to say fetch bookmarks just like that
and we should also do this after we add
a bookmark so let's copy that and go to
our add bookmarks our save bookmark and
we'll put that right here alright so now
let's try to add let's say Twitter and
HTTP Twitter submit okay there it is
reload it's still there and then I click
delete and it goes away reload and it's
still gone all right so that's that now
the next thing I want to do is just take
care of the validation all right then I
think that's pretty much the last thing
we have all right because right now if I
submit you'll see it's gonna save an
empty bookmark and we don't want that
that's stupid
so let's um go up to our save bookmark
all right and we're going to go let's
see right after here and we'll say if
not site name or not site URL okay so if
neither one if either one of these are
not here then we want to alert will say
please fill in the form
all right now in order for it to stop
we're going to just return false okay
because we don't want it to keep going
so let's try that we'll reload and if we
submit we get please fill in the form
and it doesn't submit all right so
that's good now we also want to add an
another rule here that this has to be a
URL has to be formatted with HTTP all
right so to do that we can use a regular
expression all right now regular
expressions I'm not going to go over
them but basically it's some kind of
pattern matching you want to match some
kind of pattern and there's there's
predefined regular expressions for email
addresses and URLs we just need to find
one so let's say regex
URL and right here what is a good
regular expression to match a URL this
is actually the one I used so go down to
this answer here and right right here we
have a good code block of just that so
what I'm going to do is grab these two
lines and copy them okay I'm going to
paste that in so right here we're
setting the expression this is a regular
expression to format a URL okay which is
very long and very just a very annoying
looking and then what we want to do is
create a variable called regex or
whatever you want and set it to new reg
XP and pass in that expression
okay so that'll actually create the the
regular expression
and then what we want to do as you can
see here they said if whatever they want
to match dot match pass in regex if
that's successful they're alerting
success if not they're learning not so
we want to call this match all right so
let's go back and go if I will say if
site URL dot match and then pass in
regex all right we actually want to test
to see if it doesn't match so we're
going to say we're going to put an
exclamation there so that's saying if it
doesn't match then we want to alert
please use a valid URL okay and then we
just want to return false so let's give
it a shot
so if we say Twitter and we just try to
add Twitter and submit please use a
valid URL good all right but if we say
Twitter and then HTTP twitter.com submit
it works okay so that's good now
what I would do in this situation is
create a separate function for the
validation so let's copy that from this
if statement down to here and we're
going to cut that out and then let's go
down to the bottom and create a new
function called validate form and then
we're going to paste that in
okay and let's say we want to return
false if you know if that happens return
false if this happens if we get to the
end and it passes we just want to return
true all right and then that way we can
go back up to where we had it and we can
basically say if so if not validate form
and we need to pass in the site name its
site URL which I need to add down there
in a minute
then we want to return false okay and we
need to add that down here
okay so validate form constant a site
name and a site URL all right so let's
save it submit please fill in the form
good just put something and put
something that's not a URL and we get
please use a valid URL all right so
we're just about done on the last thing
I want to do is I want to clear the form
after we submit it so that's really
simple we're just going to go down or up
- we'll go right here and we'll say
clear form and we'll grab the document
dot get element by D we want to grab the
form which has an idea of my form and
then we can call dot reset that will
reset the form all right so one last try
here let's say Facebook HTTP Facebook
submit and the form clears it gets added
all right so that's our application
hopefully you guys learned a bit from
this we hit quite a few aspects of
JavaScript and like you guys asked no
angular or framework or
not even jQuery or any any external
library alright just straight JavaScript
and html5 so I will give you guys a link
to the code also if you like this then
check out my 10 projects in JavaScript
and jQuery course where we create simple
applications with just JavaScript as
well as jQuery also if you like this
