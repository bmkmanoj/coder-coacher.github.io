we're going to be talking about some of
the common string functions in PHP okay
so functions that we use to deal with
strings now I don't know if you already
know this or not but if you go to
php.net and then slash whatever function
you want to look up yeah you can do that
and for instance we're looking at print
R which just prints out a raise we
already reviewed this in the past and it
gives you just the description of
different parameters that can accept the
return values some examples and some
user user contributed notes so just to
let you know that you can do that all
right so I have a new file called string
on the score functions PHP and we're
just going to take a look at some of the
different functions that PHP offers so
the first we're going to look at is
substring or our sub STR and what this
does is it returns a portion sir above
that returns a portion of a string so
let me give you an example if we were to
create a variable called output and
we'll set it to sub STR and then it's
going to take in a parameter which will
be our string we'll just say hello and
then we want to say where we want the
substring to start so let's say one okay
and then we'll just echo out output now
if we do that we just get e ll oh the
reason for that is we said we wanted to
start it the one one index so it goes 0
1 2 3 4 so it's going to start at e
because that's the one position all
right if I were to change this to 0 then
it's going to start at the beginning if
I change it to let's say 3 reload we get
just ello all right now we can also
define what we want it to end so let's
say we want to start at 1 which is e and
then we want it to end at the 3 position
and we reload and we get e ll because 1
is e and then there are 1 2 3 ends right
here ok after this second out all right
and then if you want to start
the back you can do that as well by
using a negative number so if we say
let's see negative two
we'll just comment it so reload we get
ello okay because that's the negative
two position and it goes to the right
alright so that is substring pretty
simple next one we're going to look at
is let's see string length or STR le N
and that will return the length of a
string okay so this is pretty simple
let's go ahead and create a variable
called output and we'll set it equal to
STR le N and let's say hello world and
then we'll echo out output haloed and we
get 11 okay so it's just counting the
characters including the space all right
so it's a pretty simple function okay so
next we're going to look at its string
position or STR POS and that will find
the position of the first occurrence of
a specified substring so let's create an
output variable and set it to XT our POS
and we're going to put in the string
which is we'll say hello world and then
let's search for the oh okay now what
this is going to do is start at the
beginning here and once it find this
match it'll give us that position number
so let's say echo output and that gives
us 4 because it's 0 1 2 3 4 ok so pretty
simple now there's also a function
called STR rpoS so let me just copy that
and comment so so STR our POS and what
this does is it finds the last
occurrence
ok so we'll change this at an R there
and then let's save that and reload and
we get 7
because it's looking at the last
occurrence which is this so zero one two
three four five six seven okay so next
one we're going to look at is trim and
what this does is it trims white space
so as an example let's create a variable
called text and I'm going to set that to
a low world and then I'm just going to
put a bunch of spaces after it like that
and then what we'll do is we'll do var
dump which will give us some information
on this value
okay so we'll reload we can see it's a
string gives us the actual value and it
gives us the number the length of it
which in this case is 25 now the reason
is 25 is because it counts all of these
spaces as one so what we can do is we
can set a new variable called trimmed
and then set it to the trim function so
trim function and I will put in here
text and then we'll do our dump for our
trimmed and I'll comment this out and
save it and now you'll see that this now
changes to 11 because it trimmed all
that whitespace off okay so this is
usually want to use this for like form
input when someone submits a form in
case they did something like this all
right
so next one we're going to look at and
we just comment too so
okay so look next function we're going
to look at is string to upper or STR to
upper and this will make everything
uppercase so this is pretty simple what
we'll do is create an output variable
and let's set it to STR - upper handle
caps in here the little world and then
let's echo the output and that gives us
hello world in all caps okay we also
have string to lower as you may have
figured out just comment this out so
this is string to lower and this makes
everything lowercase okay I'll put that
and we get hello world and it's all
lowercase okay now if you want to just
do the first letter of each word then
you want to use you see words okay that
will capitalize every word so if we'd
say output is equal to you see words and
we'll stay in here well actually let's
do it all lowercase
and then we'll echo that out and I see
that the H and the W are both
capitalized all right now we're going to
take a look at a function called string
replaced or STR underscore replace and
this will replace all occurrences of a
search string within a replacement so if
we put in a variable called text and set
that to hello world
and let's create an output variable and
set it to STR or place and this takes in
three parameters the first is what we're
going to search for which is going to be
the word world
second is what we want to replace it
with and let's say every one third is
going to be the actual string or
searching which is text okay so let's go
ahead and echo output and now we reload
and we get hello everyone okay started
is hello world but we want to replace
world with the word everyone so the next
one we want to look at is is string and
that will test to see if something is a
string or not all right so let me just
grab that paste that in okay so let's um
let's create a Val or value variable and
we'll set it to hello and then we're
going to go say output equals is
underscore string and then pass in that
value and then let's echo output so what
that returns to us is a one because it
is a string now if we were to change
this to let's say a 22 with no quotes we
get nothing it actually returns false if
we were to put quotes around this and
save now we get one because now it's a
string alright so pretty simple and then
what I'm going to do here is create an
array will say values equals array I'm
going to put a bunch of different data
like totally true false no let's put a
string of ABC will put the number 33
without quotes we'll put it with quotes
we'll put a float so let's say twenty
two point four and then we'll also put
that in quotes twenty two point four and
see we'll do just nothing
we'll do a space will do zero and we'll
do zero within quotes alright so what I
want to do is loop through these we've
done this before for each loop and we'll
say for each values as value and then
we're going to test to see if that each
value is a string we still want to say
if is string value and then if it is you
want to echo out and let's do value is a
string and then we'll put in a line
break so let's save that and reload and
we get slide zero one
oh we got to comment this stuff out okay
so we get ABC as a string so you can see
it skipped these three because there are
the not strings and then 33 it looked at
this one because it's a string this one
these two are both considered strings
and then this arrow with the quotes is a
string alright so hopefully that just
gives you a better better idea of how
that works alright now the last one I
want to look at is GZ compressed and
that'll actually allow us to compress a
string let me just comment this out
okay so compress a string so what I'm
going to do here is just paste in a very
long string okay and I put it inside of
a variable called string and then what
we'll do is we'll stay compressed we'll
set a new variable and we're going to
use GZ compressed and pass in that
string okay and then we'll echo out
compress so you can see what that looks
like
okay so it's unreadable it's just it's
just our compressed text now you're not
going to output this anywhere you just
want to compress it maybe you want to I
don't know pass it through another
function or to an API or something I'm
not sure exactly but if you want to
uncompress it then let's do will set a
variable called original and we'll set
it to gz uncompressed and we'll pass in
the compressed strength and then let's
echo that out okay just going to comment
that out and then we get the text back
okay so you compress it do something
with it and then when you need to use it
again you can uncompress it all right so
that's going to do it for string
functions in the next video we're going
to take a look at some other functions
that have to do with the Rays turning
strings into arrays and arrays into
strings and so on all right so I will
see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
