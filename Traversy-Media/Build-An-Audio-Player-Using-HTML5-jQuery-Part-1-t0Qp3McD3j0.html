building an html5 audio player using the
audio API and I haven't seen very many
good tutorials on this we're not going
to simply stick audio tags into a
embedded in a web page we're going to
use JavaScript to be able to load album
images songs play functionality pause
skip track okay we have playlist
functionality volume all right so it's a
full functional audio player alright so
we can go ahead and press play and I'm
not sure if you can hear that or not but
it's playing you can see the duration
and this is also going to show you the
duration this progress behind
I go ahead and pause it and we can
switch through tracks
all right we can go back
we can also click on the song down here
alright so full functionality so what
we're going to do is go ahead and create
a new folder for our project and I'm
just going to call it html5 html5 audio
player and if you look in the
description of the video you should have
a link to the github page so you can get
the files for the images okay so for the
play the stop and the next and previous
images I created those in Photoshop I'm
not going to go through that and show
you how I did that you can just grab
them from the files or even use your own
if you want all right so let's create
our file structure and create a folder
called image and I'm just going to go
into the
the final project and get all the images
so basically we have the background the
knob for the volume next previous pause
play stop in the progress bar we have
the empty progress bar and the full
progress bar and then I have a folder
called covers which has cover one jpg
all right so I'm going to grab all of
these and bring them over and again you
feel free to make your own images
alright so next we want a CSS
we want to folder to store the media all
right and that I'm also going to bring
over feel free to use your own songs
your own mp3s or whatever I'm just going
to bring all these over okay and then we
want a JavaScript folder and then just
our index folder index file sorry
index.html and that's it so - let's also
create our CSS file
so so the style dot CSS alright and also
JavaScript let's create a file called
main main J s and we also need jQuery so
we're going to go ahead and download
jQuery
you can use a remote repository if you
want but I like to include the actual
file in my in my application and I'm
going to save this just as jQuery j/s
and I want to save it in my project file
in my javascript file alright so that
should do it for files so I'm going to
use notepad plus plus feel free to use
your own editor whatever you like get
rid of these all right now I just want
to navigate to that folder I just
so my desktop
all right so I have the folder structure
here so the first thing we want to do is
our HTML all right so let's just go
ahead and set up a html5 document
okay title will just say HTML html5
audio player alright we want to link our
style sheets
and I'm going to include our JavaScript
at the bottom of the body so first we
want a jQuery right and then we want our
main javascript file
all right so that's the basic structure
all right
so what I want to do let's see I want to
start with a container because this is
going to be in a container and we're
going to give it a fixed width all right
so give it an ID of container okay and
in that container the first thing we
have is the image so we'll go ahead and
say div id audio image and that's going
to be the cover so image class equals
cover and I'm not going to I'm not going
to insert I'm not going to put in an SRC
tap attribute because we're going to do
this dynamically through JavaScript okay
so all we need is the image tag along
with the class all right so after the
audio image we want the audio player so
div ID
audioplayer and inside the audio player
first we'll have the info alright so if
we look at the audio player is from here
down to I think here okay so this whole
area so audio info div ID info actually
I want this to be audio info
alright and we're going to have we want
the artist and the title alright we're
going to put those inside of spans so
say span class is going to be an article
artist
and remember these are going to get
generated from JavaScript we're not
going to include anything here all right
and then we want to - and then we're
going to have this D the title of the
song so span class is going to be title
all right so that's the ste artist in
the title that's audio info next we want
the volume which is going to be an input
it's going to have a class I'm sorry
it's going to have an ID of volume all
right and the type we're going to use is
the html5 range type okay so it's going
to give us that little slider all right
the minimum we're going to set to zero
and the max will be ten all right and
the initial value will be five okay when
it starts up it'll be at five
excuse me okay so that's good and let's
take a look at it's not going to look
like much okay so you we have not
basically just a slider the text is
going to be generated so we're not going
to see that yet all right so after the
volume let's just put in a line break
bring it down a little and then we're
going to have our buttons so div ID and
this is going to be will say audio
buttons and basically what we're going
to do here is just create empty buttons
with IDs so button ID you want our
previous button
play let me just copy this
okay so if previous we have play
we have pause the pause button we're
going to hide through we're going to use
CSS to hide that until a song is
actually playing all right and then
we'll say stop and next all right so
those are our buttons after the buttons
div I'm going to go ahead we're going to
have some floating here so I want to go
ahead and clear it so I'm going to
create a custom class called clearfix
all right and then after that we want
the tracker all right now the tracker is
basically this area here with the
progress bar all right so div and we're
going to give it an ID of tracker all
right and inside here we'll have another
div with the ID of progress bar
and then inside there we want another
div with the ID of progress all right
now this is because we're going to have
an image of an empty progress bar which
will be attached to this div and then
the progress will be the filled the
filled progress bar all right in here we
want to put a span so span ID I'm sorry
this should actually be a span this
progress
make sure you change that
okay span progress and that's it we're
not going to put anything in here
so basically we're not putting in any
content really through the HTML it's
going to be all through JavaScript and
through the API so right under the
progress by active we're going to have
the duration and that's going to be a
span tag so span ID is going to equal
duration and this is going to be the
numbers the time that the salon has been
playing okay and then that's it for I
think it's tracker yeah
so under tracker we're going to have
another whoops this should be a span
span another tracker will have another
clear fix
just declare any floats all right and
then finally we'll have the playlist
okay which will be quite a bit of code
or markup I should say so it's going to
be a ul and we're going to give it an ID
of playlist I apologize if I sound a
little stuffy I just getting over a cold
so playlist an idea of playlist it's
going to have a class of hidden
actually you know what I'm not sure if
we need this so I'm going to take it off
for now and then the playlist we're
going to have a bunch of Li tags
representing excuse me representing each
song all right so we're actually going
to have a song attribute all right and
in that we're going to put the title so
the first one will be Linkin Park -
because I'm going to put the artist in
as well and the song will be papercuts
dot mp3 all right so that's a song
attribute next we'll have cover and
that's going to be cover one dot jpg so
each song you can have a different cover
for but I'm just going to use the same
one for all of the songs alright and
then finally in this Li tag we want
artist
alright so artists set to Linkin Park
alright and then we'll close that off
and then the name of the song again
33 li alright so we want to do this for
each song now generally you would if you
were to have this as a production app
you would want a better way to add songs
instead of going in and adding an li tag
and all the salon names and stuff so you
you probably want to build some kind of
server-side application where you could
just upload the song or enter the song
info in a form alright so this is
basically just a front-end application
alright so what I'm going to do now is
there's quite a bit as long so I'm going
to pause the video and then just paste
in all the songs
alright so I've put I've pasted in all
the songs same format song cover artist
alright so that is all of the HTML if we
save it and take a look it looks
absolutely horrendous okay so the next
thing we want to do is style this with
CSS so let's go ahead and open our style
dot CSS file alright so we're going to
start with some of the core elements
what I want to do is I want to zero out
the margin in the padding and the border
of all elements so I'm going to use the
asterisk and it will say margin:0
padding:0
border:0 and outline:none okay so that's
kind of a reset next we'll do the body
okay so I'm going to set font family is
going to be Arial the font size I want
to be 13 pixels oops
okay the line height line height will be
1.5 am color will be white okay now we
want to do the background and you can
see that in my image folder we have this
BG dot PNG and it's basically a dark
carbon type design texture and we're
just going to have it repeat through the
whole background okay I'll give us that
cool carbon look alright so this is
going to be URL and it's going to be in
the image folder called BG dot PNG and
we're not going to do anything with
repeat because we want it to repeat
vertically and horizontally so if we go
ahead and reload okay now we have a
background next let's do that clear fix
class and so the only thing we need here
is clear:both I'll clear any floats okay
and now the container
container the width is only going to be
330 pixels all right now this this
application will also look good on
mobile devices all right we don't even
need to really do any kind of responsive
media queries because it's so thin
anyways it should look good on all
devices I'm going to set a minimum
height of 400 pixels
okay the background I want to be a
doctor a and overflow should be Auto
overflow not over low I'm going to give
it a margin at the top will do 60 pixels
top and bottom and then the left and
right auto because we want it to be in
the middle we want to give it a border
of a semi doc gray solid two pixels and
I want to have a 10 pixel border radius
okay so we need to do the vendor prefix
versions as well so border radius and
pixels will do WebKit
Chrome and Safari pixels and/or radius
10 pixels okay so that should do it for
the container let's go ahead and take a
look okay so that looks good so far so
let's do the image okay because the
image will be the first thing in the
container and this was called I believe
it was clÃ¡udio image or IMG and I'm
going to set the position to relative
and set the overflow to hidden it's
going to have a height of 200 pixels
margin bottom 15 pixels now the image is
going to be it's going to be generated
through JavaScript so we're not going to
see it yet okay so even if I save it you
can see that it's going to be 200 pixels
high which is it's going to show about
let's see the top half or the top 60
percent or so of the album we could make
it bigger but that would move all our
controls and everything down under the
fold and I don't want to do that so I
think just having the top of it is fine
so after the image the info
all we need to do for that is align to
the center so text-align:center
and the artist I actually want to be
bold all right so we can go and say
audio info dot artist punch write an
article artist
say font-weight:bold okay so the cover
is going to have a width of a hundred
percent and she actually should probably
be up with the image class so right
under audio image will have cover with
100% in Z and X 1 alright so next we
have the volume okay which is an input
so input ID volume alright so I want the
width to be 95 percent I'm going to have
a margin left of 2%
okay just to get it in the middle
ah background will be gray it's going to
have a height of just one pixel and then
a margin bottom of 20 pixels all right
now in order to get it to use an image
instead of this we have to do we have to
use WebKit appearance all right so I'm
gonna put that like right here so WebKit
appearance is going to be none and set
that to important and I believe there's
a few browsers that this will have to
look like this we can't get the the knob
image all right it took me a while to
figure this out because I've actually
never done that never tried to style one
of those before
alright so then under here we're going
to say input volume and then I guess a
pseudo selector called
WebKit slider thumb
okay I'm not exactly sure why we use
this but I just know we need to use it
if we want that knob and we need this as
well in here all right and then we can
put our image in so background will be
URL and let's see the image folder we
want knob P and G and you want to make
sure that you have a no-repeat all right
and then just do the height and width of
the image which is 12 pixels all right
so I think that should work let's check
it out
all right good
all right so volume is all set now we
can get to the buttons okay this is just
the button area in general is going to
have a width of 90% we want it to
display as a block margin will do 15 the
top and bottom and then auto on the left
and right we're going to give it a
little margin on the left just to push
it to the middle of 23 pixels and then
just set the overflow to auto ok so now
we can actually put the buttons in the
buttons are going to be background
images so button ID of play
have a width of 90% display:block margin
this is the wrong code we need a width
of 70 pixels okay which is the width of
the play button and also height will be
70 pixels and then the background image
what is it it's play dot PNG okay we
want to say no-repeat and we also want
to float it to the left
all right and now what I'm going to do
is just copy this
paste it okay so after play will have
the pause button so I just want to
change the name of the image get play
pause stop
and then previous
okay previous float lap we want to give
previous a margin top of 15 pixels all
right and then next
so next I will also have a margin-top
but it's going to float to the right
okay they all float to the left except
for next all right so let's take a look
at this and it's messed up because the
the pause and play button are both
displayed when we do our JavaScript that
won't happen it will show play if you
click play then pause will show and play
will hide all right so don't worry about
this right now okay so under the buttons
will have our playlists okay so remember
we have an ID called playlist right and
what we're just going to set list style
to none and then add padding of 10
pixels on all sides all right so now the
playlist list item we want to change the
cursor to a pointer when we hover over
it
all right and I'm going to have a margin
of five pixels all right now look the
active playlist let me just copy that
and playlists li dot active will have a
font-weight:bold and we'll give it a
padding of three pixels and a background
okay this is so we know which song is
playing
ah let's see I missed some code for the
progress but I believe yeah we didn't do
that the progress bar so let's see
progress bar in the duration okay so
next I will say progress by alright this
is going to have a width of 80% and a
margin left of 2%
and let's see a margin bottom of 20
pixels and then a margin top of 9 pixels
in the height 10 pixels and then we have
our background which will be the URL and
the image is called progress
VG PNG and we want to make sure that
it's no-repeat right and then finally
we're going to float:left
all right so we still can't see it
and I think that I named it wrong I
think yeah this should be progress by a
lowercase B alright so this is the
progress bar now we want to do the
progress which is going to be the blue
background in the progress bar okay so
we want to do our background we just
copy this
and it's called progress P&amp;amp;G
okay height also 10 pixels and then we
want to display an inline block
okay so if we reload you're not going to
see anything because we're only going to
see it when the song plays and it moves
up so next is the duration all right so
that'll be the numbers the time on the
side of the progress bar so duration is
going to have an absolute position
okay so top zero right ten pixels and
we'll give it some padding of four top
bottom eight left right and then set the
background to black and instead of water
radius let me just copy that from up
here
where is it
okay 10% n pixels is good well fix that
okay so that's the duration and actually
I want it to be five pixels
and one thing we did forget is the
actual tracker ID which holds all that
stuff right here holds the progress bar
and the duration oops how am I going
okay so tracker and for this all you
want to do is set the position to
relative because in order to use the
absolute positioning of the duration its
container needs to be positioned
relative and then I'm just going to set
the width to 100% and that should do it
right so let's save that back reload and
our duration has no numbers in it and
also this kind of messes it up a little
so don't worry about it
odd this is looking how it should at
this point I'm going to stop here and in
the next video we'll start to do the
JavaScript and make this thing come to
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
