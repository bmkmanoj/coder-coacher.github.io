you how to integrate bootstrap into your
Ruby on Rails for application basically
we're going to use the bootstrap sass
gem to recreate this template in Ruby on
Rails and if you don't have rails and
Ruby installed then you can view my our
VM installation video which will take
you through it on installing rails onto
an a boon to machine alright so first
thing we need to do is generate a new
app so we're going to say rails new my
bootstrap
all right so we need to add a few gems
to the gem file okay I'm going to use
sublime text for my editor and I just
want to add the app folder to my project
all right so we need to open gem file
and down here we want gem bootstraps ass
okay and we need to specify the version
which is three point two point zero
now we're also use SAS which allows us
to use a CSS precompile err and it's
really handy if you want to use
variables and mix-ins and things like
that in your style sheets now I'm also
going to include the autoprefixer gem so
that we can use s CSS flat files on the
fly whoops no what is it
autoprefixer alright autoprefixer rails
alright so save that and then we will
just want to run bundle install could
not locate gem file because we're not in
the directory
all right
and before we do anything else I'm just
going to generate a couple controllers
here so say rails rails generate
controller home and will conclude an
index method alright and will also
generate a controller called a boat
okay so now we should be able to let's
run our server
okay so let's specify our homepage so we
want to go to config route and down here
well uncomment this and just change this
welcome to home and then we'll save that
okay now we have our home page we should
also be able to go to about /index which
brings us to the about page
now let's just add a button to our
homepage so that we can tell if if
bootstrap is being read or not all right
so I'm going to go to my views app views
home index and just going to create a
button here so one do a class BTN and
then BTN primary
okay so we'll save that reload so we
have the link now we want to import the
bootstrap files okay we can do that
because we installed the gem so to do
that we want to go to our assets style
sheets and then application dot CSS but
we wanted to rename this to application
dot CSS CSS and we can get rid of this
about in home CSS file alright and then
in here we need to import okay so we
want to say imports bootstrap sprockets
okay and also import just bootstrap all
right and we're going to make another
CSS or s CSS file because I don't want
to have to put I don't want to put CSS
in this core file all right well why am
I in home we're in the wrong file here
let's just copy that and close this
alright this is this is the file we
should be in okay so I'm just going to
say import rights and also I'm going to
create one called main and then let's
create that new file save as main dot
CSS CSS
all right and we want to get rid of this
required tree okay and then we could
save that and that should be it for that
file so let's go back to the front end
and reload now you can see that
bootstrap is being included because our
our link our button alright
and just to make sure that this main
file is being read let's just say body
background black
all right so that's working and we can
now use variables all right so we can
say color flat actually we'll say color
red and then we can just say color
all right
so let's go a little further and I'm
going to grab the content from this page
here so it's view source and I'm going
to copy everything that's in the body
but not this JavaScript
okay we'll copy that and I'm going to go
to our main layout file which is an app
views layouts and then this application
file here I'm going to paste this in the
body alright and then we want to cut out
the jumbotron and let's see pretty much
everything else I think where's this
container start yeah so I'm going to
grab I'm going to leave the container
and grab everything within it
okay so I want
actually no that's not right
yeah all of this
okay so from this container which ends
right here no
was that one end right there okay so I'm
going to grab this
okay this row
okay I'm going to put that into my views
my home index view save that and then
back in the application
going to grab this yield variable okay
this this will output our main content
so I'm going to put that right here
all right so let's see what that looks
like
alright let's get rid of that red
all right so basically this here these
three blocks are coming from the home
view all right everything else is in the
layout now for the jumbotron thing here
I want to give that its own file so I'm
going to take all this and cut that out
and I'm going to create a new folder and
views and call it partials and then in
there I'll create a new file and save it
as underscore Jumbotron dot HTML dot RB
okay then we'll paste that and then back
in here we want our Ruby tags and we're
just going to render I'm going to render
partials slash
Jumbotron
you
okay so reload
okay good
I'm going to get rid of the login form
that's in the navbar
all right and we should probably put
footer inside of a partial as well
okay so grab this and inside partials
create a new file save it as underscore
footer dot HTML dot e RB okay paste that
in and close that and the Jumbotron
okay now let's do the navigation okay so
we have let's change the product name -
I don't know bootstrap rails and then
for the navigation oh I got rid of the
actually it didn't have a navbar I mean
a list so right here we're going to
create an unordered list and give it a
class of nav ah shoot was a navbar
actually let me look on that bootstrap
site
okay so let's see we want
this
all right so we'll have list item
and to be home I just want to see if
this is going to format right I'm not
even put the links in
because we're going to use the rails
link helper anyway but just want to make
sure that this is the right formatting
all right good so we have these two
links now like I said I want to use the
the rails link helper so we're going to
say link to and the text let's say home
and that's going to link to the route
path
okay so that should give us our home
let's just make sure
okay we got home why is it like that
all we need to put it inside of a list
item
there we go okay so that's going to the
home page next ah let's do the about and
copy this
okay this will go to a boat path
undefined local variable about path all
right so that's not working we need to
go in the routes file real quick
and I'm just going to change this a
little bit okay so let's say get about
and that's going to go to about index
okay so save that reload alright so now
that works and if we click about it
takes us to about now we don't want this
Jumbotron to show in about so we need to
make a conditional let's go back to that
partial Jumbotron and to do this okay
we're going to say if what is it params
controller is not equal to home
actually want to say if it is equal to
home
all right now it went behind the bar up
here because we have it it has fixed we
have the nav bars fixed let's change
that get rid of this nav bar fixed top
but now it has a margin
okay let's see
okay navbar
we have margin-bottom 20 pixels change
that so we want to go to our main CSS
file margin bottom zero
all right
so that's how you can integrate rails
and bootstrap three using the bootstrap
sass gem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
