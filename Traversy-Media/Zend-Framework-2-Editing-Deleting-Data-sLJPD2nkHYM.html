framework 2 series in the last video we
made it so that we could fetch data from
the database and also so we could insert
albums so now what we want to do is want
to be able to edit the albums and delete
them so first thing we're going to do is
we're going to go to the Edit action
okay so this is gonna be in our album
controller and edit action okay and
let's just copy what we have here and
paste that in okay so what we're doing
is we're setting the ID
alright the ID we're getting from the
from the URL using this from route and
if there isn't one sitting it's a zero
and then we're saying if there's no ID
we're just gonna return to the add form
okay and then right here we have a
try-catch block and we're gonna try and
get the album okay using get album
passed in the ID now this get album is
coming from the album table you can see
right here okay so it uses the table
gateway to try and select the data and
then return it alright let's see then
what we're doing is we want a form okay
new album form and then we want to bind
that data to the form using the bind
method okay so we're getting the data
here and then we're passing it in or
binding it to the form here alright and
then what we're doing here is we're
checking to see if the form is submitted
if it was then we want to validate with
set input filter we want to set the data
and if everything goes okay then we're
going to save the album alright and then
finally redirect back to album all right
so that's what this does let's see
but the difference this is just
explaining everything I just did and
yeah that should work now we also need
to create the view alright so I'm gonna
copy this that's gonna go save that
that's gonna go in the view and then
edit ok we'll paste that in now this is
pretty much identical to the add one ok
if we look at the add alright except we
have this here where we're setting the
ID and stuff so let's save that and
let's see if it works ok so let's see
well edit this one here
oh it says error occurred serializable
extracts expects the provided object to
implement all right so it's looking for
get array copy let me just see if oh ok
I missed this part we need to edit the
model and we just want to add get array
coffee
ok so we'll go to model and then album
and let's just put this like that
and save it okay so now we have our form
and you can see that the data is already
in there so my new album and let's say
even newer album will change this to
some artists okay edit and there we go
even newer albums some artists so we can
now edit albums so now what we want to
do is we want to be able to delete them
so let's go back here and go to deleting
an album and we're gonna have to edit
the delete action so we're gonna just
copy this okay then we're gonna go to
our controller and just paste that here
okay so this is very similar to edit
we're getting the ID here from the route
we're getting our request we're checking
to see if it was submitted and then
we're gonna call delete album all right
so let's save that and then we need to
create a simple form so this is gonna go
inside of the delete view okay so delete
face that in there whoops okay so
basically all this is is a button
it's a submit button and we're sending
in a hidden input which is the ID all
right so let's save that and let's see
let's go reload and delete okay it's
gonna ask us if we're sure yes and it's
gone alright so we now have full crud
functionality so next thing the way we
have it now is we have a home page which
displays this okay and then we have to
click albums to see our albums well we
don't want this this page is useless to
us we want the album's page to be the
home alright so what we can do
we can edit our route file so let's go
into the application module this time
and then we want to go config and then
module dot config alright and let's see
we have this home here which is right
here and we're setting it to control or
slash index alright well we want to
change that to this controller slash
album alright actually I can just go
like this ok and if we wanted to you
could also change the at default action
but we want it to be index alright so
let's try this now if we go home alright
so we're getting a 404 error cannot be
mapped to an existing class let's see
what do they do wrong here oh we need
this to be album ok the album module
because right now it's application ok
good so now the the index the home page
is this so now we can get rid of this
link right here this albums so let's go
to layout and go to our navbar and get
rid of albums ok so now we just have a
home and we have add album alright I'm
also going to get rid of this class
active and there we go so we have our
home page and we have the add page so
that's it we have our application go to
the documentation we just have a
conclusion page so what do we do from
here or what do you do from here I would
suggest maybe creating some kind of
authentication some kind of registration
and login and you want users to be able
to log in and create their own set of
albums and only have access to their
albums that's something you could do
you could also move on to maybe create
some Jean Jean resort Atta Gauri's that
would probably mean creating a new
module or maybe a sub module all right
so I'm not gonna promise anything but I
will try to go deeper into the Zend
framework in another video or another
video series but yeah if you guys liked
this please give it a like give us a
subscribe if you're not already and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
