you how to install Apache Cassandra onto
a Windows 7 machine Apache Cassandra is
a popular no SQL database it's basically
a column family slash key value store
and we want to do is go to let's see you
think it's Sandra dot Apache org alright
and if we click on download there's a
few um there's a few things that we can
do here first we have the core Cassandra
server which includes the node tool
administration command line as well as a
development shell called cql SH and
these come in both tarball binaries and
Debian installation we're using Windows
so if we're going to install the tarball
it's a little bit complicated what I
would suggest is going with this option
using the data stacks community
distribution which comes with all of
that comes with the CQL development
shell and also a GUI program called op
Center which is really cool and might be
a little easier to use for people that
don't really use the command line
alright and in addition to that the data
stacks package offers a Windows
installer alright which is extremely
easy to use so if we click on data
stacks community it's going to take us
to planet cassandra org slash Cassandra
down here we have different versions for
different platforms I'm going to grab
the Windows 7 32 bit installer
okay we can just X out of that and it's
going to ask you to download it I've
already downloaded it alright so I'm
going to go ahead and install that
and it's right here
and very simple just like any other
Windows installation just go through
click Next it's going to ask you where
you want to install it I'll leave in the
default here it's going to ask you if
you want to start at Cassandra and
obscene ER as a service and I would
suggest keeping them both checked in
doing that ok so now we'll install
okay so say yes
I'll also be making a video on
installing Cassandra onto Anna Bunton
machine as well okay and this this
installer just makes it really easy if
you were to install everything
separately it'd be just a little bit
more difficult you might run into some
issues so it says that the ops center
agent is starting okay
service is starting just to show you
let's go ahead and launch the ops center
ok so it's going to open up in a browser
and this is what it looks like it has a
really cool interface a lot of analytics
shows you your storage your clusters
health your write requests dis
utilization your operating system load
all kinds of things and you can see that
it sets us up with a test cluster
alright and then here you can view your
nodes ok obviously we only have one node
at the time at this time activities data
I'm not going to really go through and
create any key spaces or anything like
that I just wanted to show you how to
get it up and running alright so you can
see that we're at localhost and the
default port is eight eight eight eight
okay so that's the OP Center we also
have a click on start
you should have a data stacks Community
Edition folder and you can see that we
have the Cassandra CLI utility we also
have the Cassandra cql shell okay so
this is a shell where we can run CQL cql
if you don't know stands for Cassandra
query language and it's very similar to
SQL so if you know if you've dealt with
relational databases like MySQL then you
already have a basic understanding of
CQL now just to give you an example if
you don't know if you don't know
anything about Cassandra and how how its
data model is set up basically we're
going to have a key space which
represents I guess it could you could
compare to a schema in a relational
database alright so the first thing that
I'm going to do here is create a say key
space so we can do that with create key
space and let's just call it people and
then we need to do some other things
here we need to define a replication
strategy so we're going to say with
replication and then we're going to set
the replication class I'm going to set
two simple strategy okay so basically
there's two different classes we can
define here we can have simple strategy
or network topology strategy simple
strategy is used commonly for single
data center clusters if you want to
setup multiple data centers you would
use network topology okay and then the
next thing the last thing that we want
to set here is the replication factor
don't worry if you don't know if you're
not familiar with any of this don't
worry about it basically the video I
just wanted to show you how to install
Cassandra but I'm just going to go a
little further here and the replication
factor is basically how many nodes that
you want to set for ah for your replicas
okay and I'm just going to say three all
right and then we want to end the
semicolon all right and now we should
have our key space and to check that out
we can say describe key space people
okay and now you can see that we have
the the people key space gives us the
class and the replication factor all
right so now that we have our people key
space let's go ahead and create a table
okay so just like SQL we can say create
table let's create table employees all
right ah and we want to set our fields
okay so we'll have an ID field and we
can we can set this to a type for
instance we can say int but I'm going to
set it to a type called UUID which is a
universal identification so this is
basically it's going to be a long
hexadecimal value but it will be unique
so that can be used to to grab
individual rows alright so we'll have an
ID let's also have a name which will be
Bachar and notice we don't need to
define any special lengths like you
would with relational databases just
just something that's a little more
flexible so we'll have an ID a name and
let's just do an email
all right and then we want to set our
primary keys so it's a primary key and
when using Cassandra it's a little
different than if you're using a
relational database we want to define
our primary key as ID but anything that
you want to do things like sort and
order by then you want to you want to
define those as well so let's use just
say ID and let's do email all right so
that you do it we'll put a semicolon
here I'm sorry no key space has been
specified okay so we just need to say
use and then the name of the key space
with just people all right and then
we'll go ahead and run that again okay
so now let's go ahead and select all
from employees ah
oh I'm sorry we didn't we didn't insert
anything we just created a table let's
say describe table employees okay so
that just gives us a bunch of
information about the table so let's
insert something we'll say insert into
employees all right and we want to
insert an ID oops
an ID a name and an email okay and just
like SQL we're going to say values and
for the the ID which is au UID we can
use different functions for this what
I'm going to do is use a function called
now and that's going to get a UUID from
the current timestamp all right and then
for the name we'll say John Doe and for
email say jeido at gmail.com
all right so that should insert and now
we can say select all from employees all
right and then that gives us our record
okay so this is the UUID that was
created with that now function and then
we have the email and the name if we
want to insert one more I'll just go
back to the query and let's just change
the name say Sam Sam Smith and change
the email
okay and then we'll select and now we
have another entry and you can see that
the ID is completely different alright
so we can also use where statements so
let's say select all actually let's just
select name from employees where email
is equal to jeido at gmail.com involve
filtering
here's a la filter all right so let's
run the same thing and allow filtering
all right so that gives us John Doe all
right so I'm not going to get much more
in depth in this I just want to show you
how to just implement a really simple
Cassandra installation and just get you
going now you can see in the OP Center
if I reload this here you can see you
can see that we do have our write
requests right here and if we go to data
you can now see that we have our people
key space we have the employees column
family or table if I check that you can
see what we've done okay we created the
table we can view the metrics
actually I don't want to do that
but you can see that we can do things
with that key space we created okay we
can change the strategy class
replication factor which we set when we
created the key space we can delete the
whole key space if we want all right so
you can manage everything from this
dashboard if you're not comfortable with
the command line all right so I think
that's a fair intro to setting up
Cassandra on Windows I will be making
some more advanced videos on both
Cassandra and couchdb so please
subscribe and just be on the lookout for
those Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
