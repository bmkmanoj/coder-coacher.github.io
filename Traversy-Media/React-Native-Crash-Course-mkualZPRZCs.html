crash course and in this video we're
going to be looking at the awesome
technology of react native so before we
get into it let's just take a look at
what will be covered in this video so
first thing we're going to talk about is
what react native is I have multiple
videos on the react jeaious library but
what the hell is react native okay so
that's what we're going to take a look
at first we're also going to look at how
to install react native and set up a
react native app now even though I'll be
using Windows using the react native CLI
is the exact same on Windows or Mac or
Linux it's NPM base so it's
cross-platform what varies is the OS
development environment and testing and
I'll go over that in a minute
so I'll show you how to initialize and
run an app in the Android emulator how
to create components just as you would
in regular react we'll look at some of
the key react native UI features such as
input controls list views touchable
elements and more we'll also look at
some of the API features such as a sink
storage and the messaging API and if you
still want more there's a ton to learn
in the edge' wanax course which I'll be
linking in the description all right so
what is react native react native is a
framework for building mobile apps using
javascript and the react library so if
you don't have any idea what react is I
would suggest going back and watching my
crash crash course on react Jas alright
basically it's a library for building
interactive user interfaces and Java
with JavaScript so react native allows
us to build cross-platform applications
we can build one app that will run on
Android and iOS which is incredibly
valuable to businesses and individuals
instead of building an iOS app and Swift
and then a separate app in Java for
Android you can have a single app that
will run on both platforms all right
we'll talk about the advantages to that
in a minute
so react native uses almost all the
concepts that react Jas uses including
components application state props or
properties life cycles and so on so if
you know react then you should have no
problem at all understanding the
fundamentals of how this framework works
all right now we've seen frameworks in
the past that allow us to build mobile
apps with JavaScript okay we have
Cordova we're also known as PhoneGap
ionic sank a touch and some others
now unfortunately these are what are
called hybrid apps and these are
basically web apps that run inside of a
native container or a webview react
native apps are not hybrid apps okay
they don't run inside of a webview
they use the same fundamental building
blocks as real native apps that are
built with Swift or Objective C or Java
all right so this makes them faster
gives them gives the user a much better
experience much like you would with a
real native app all right now don't get
me wrong these are great technologies
ionic in Cordova and they do deserve
credit but I do think that react native
is going to be the go-to technology for
our mobile apps built with JavaScript so
let's take a look at some of the
advantages of building a react native
app over an actual native app so one of
the biggest is that it's cross-platform
so usually if a business makes the
decision to build a great mobile app
they'll start off with just one platform
iOS or Android now I know that there's
Windows and Blackberry and some others
but we're going to stay focused on the
two big guys now of course they could
choose to build one app for both okay so
one Android one iOS and try to have the
same experience but that gets incredibly
expensive you would need a Java
developer or multiple Java developers
for your Android app and then Swift or
objective-c developers for your iOS app
and both of those cost an arm and a leg
with react native you just need to know
JavaScript and react and your app will
run on both platforms so think about the
difference in cost but
those two those two options and this
isn't for some clunky web app inside of
a container this is a real native app
all right so you can see that the
potential of react native all right
obviously it's much easier to code
javascript is much easier than those
high-level compiled languages you say
you save massive amounts of time even in
development itself there's no compiling
you don't have to keep recompiling every
time you make a change it just updates
and you can constantly see your work
okay your updated work it's also open
source and of course react native is
free all right so these are all some
really nice advantages to using react
native over you know a real native app
all right so let's start to look at some
of the features that are available with
react native so we have different UI
components that we can include in our
app and these are just some of them some
of the key ones that will be going over
so we have input controls like the text
input a picker which is kind of like a
drop-down but nicer a switch a slider
which is a an element that you can drag
across the screen and kind of increase
values and so on we also have touchable
elements now one of the biggest
differences between a web app web mobile
app and a native app is that with a web
app when you tap a button you don't
really get any effect you get the
standard browser effect which isn't very
it doesn't feel very natural and with
react native we have these elements we
have touchable highlight touchable
opacity that makes it really feel like a
native app you get that highlight that
that effect when you touch an element it
doesn't have to be a button it can be
absolutely anything all right
list views which are just that if we
have a list of I don't know users or
locations contacts whatever it may be we
can put those in a nice list view we can
use flexbox
to style it make it look really nice we
also have scroll views for things that
we want to scroll whether it's
horizontal or vertical we have things
like alerts modal's progress bars we can
customize the status bar so with a
batterer
is the battery life and things like that
we can do that on both devices both
platforms now we also have components
that are exclusive to Android or to iOS
so for instance tab bar iOS gives you
the little tabs at the bottom of the
screen and that's only available for iOS
ok and then we have toolbar Android
which is the toolbar at the top of the
screen and that's only available for
Android and we can easily separate pages
so that one will load if it's on Android
one will load if it's on iOS all right
and that will make more sense later on
now we also have AP is for device
interaction so for instance we have the
camera roll where we can bring in images
from the device into our application
async storage which we can use for
storage on the device and it works
almost identical to local storage html5
local storage except it's asynchronous
we have geolocation image editor we can
have push notifications on both
platforms you can even work with the
vibration API and also the sharing or
message API where we can send things in
text messages now as far as our
development environment and operating
system in this video we're going to be
using Windows and with Windows you need
to setup the Android SDK all right now
specifically you need to have the SDK
version 6.0 or also called marshmallow
at this point to use react native and
it's it states this on the the main
getting started page alright so you want
to download Android studio you want to
get that SDK installed and you also want
to setup the Android virtual device okay
that's how we'll view our application
test our application now I do have a
video taking you through all the steps
to set this up I'll put that in the
description so if you don't have Android
studio and the SDK setup just go ahead
and watch that video I tried to lay it
out really simple so just get that done
before actually attempting this alright
and for mac all you really need to do is
set up Xcode which
with the simulator that will allow you
to view and test your app alright and I
will probably do a video on react
setting up react native on a Mac as well
which is truthfully it's a little easier
than on Windows in my opinion now the
last thing I want to do before we jump
into installing react native and looking
at some code I just want to check out a
really simple component in react native
okay now if you know react this probably
looks really familiar to you we'll start
at the top here we're basically just
importing the react library from react
and then on the next line we're
importing some stuff from react native
okay we have this app registry which we
use to register the component we also
have text in view which are two two
components that you'll be using a lot to
display view areas as well as text
alright then we have our class in this
case it's called my app and then extends
that component package and you'll see we
have a render which if you again if you
know react this looks very familiar this
is one of the lifecycle methods the only
one that's actually required and just
renders content all right so we're
returning a view and inside that view we
have a text block that just says hello
world all right now notice we're not
using divs or h1s or anything like that
it's a little different in that aspect
but it's really easy to get used to
basically you can style views and text
however you want using using JavaScript
but it's formatted like CSS alright so
if you have those skills if you if you
have CSS skills and basic HTML then
you'll you'll what you'll catch on to
this pretty quick all right and then
down at the bottom we're taking that app
registry and calling register component
and we're just passing in the name of
that component and then a second
parameter which is a callback or
actually an arrow function and we pass
in the name once again my app alright so
that's basically a boilerplate of a very
simple react native component
alright guys it's enough with the
slideshow let's go ahead and jump in
will install react native and we'll set
up our application alright guys so let's
jump into react native now you'll notice
them on Windows but as long as you have
your Mac Xcode environment set up almost
everything I do is going to be the same
on a Mac and I'll let you know when
something's going to be different so if
you're on Windows you do need to have
the Android SDK set up and the Android
virtual device if you don't then go back
to the last video I made called Android
SDK and AVD set up for react native and
that'll get you set up up to this point
that I'm at now
alright so notice that I have the
Android virtual device open and then I
have 2 command lines alright so first
thing we want to do is we want to
install the react native CLI the command
line interface and that's where we can
create our application run our
application and we're going to install
that using NPM so obviously you do have
to have no js' installed
alright so to do that we're going to say
npm install i'm going to add the g flag
for global ok we want to be able to run
this from anywhere and then we're going
to say react native - CLI now the
command we use is going to be react
native but make sure that you don't do
that install react native you want to
make sure you do the CLI alright I
already have it installed so probably go
quicker on my machine
alright so now let that set up you also
want to install yarn which is a new
package manager for a Java Script and
you can use it for a lot of things but
it pushes along the initialization of
the app so let's just get that installed
we'll say npm install g jaan
alright so the next thing we want to do
is initialize our app so I'm in my
project folder you can obviously do this
wherever you want it's going to create a
project folder so to do that we say not
NPM I stay to react - native in it and
then the name of your app we're just
gonna call this my app alright now
that's gonna go through and you can see
it says using yarn alright if you don't
have you on installed I believe it'll
give you some kind of message saying you
should install it now as far as the app
will be building we're not gonna be
building an actual functional app or
what this is is it's a crash course
where we're going to go through I'm
going to show you how to get everything
set up and going to show you some of the
UI components that are available
touchable buttons things like that list
view we'll also look at some of these
the stuff with the EPI async storage so
it's going to be kind of just a mesh of
different things you can do in react
native alright so we're not going to be
building some nicely planned out
functional application alright just to
let you guys know I will be doing a
video where we do create an actual
application but this is more for just to
get your foot in the door and just to
really see what's available with react
native and obviously I can't go over
everything the edge wanax course that I
created does go over pretty much
everything as far as the fundamentals so
you may want to check that out
but let's just open up the documentation
while that's going alright so if we go
to docs
you'll see on the left hand side here
this is some of the stuff that we're
going to be going over now I'm not going
to really get into the concepts of react
I'm expecting that you know those as far
as state components things like that I
will be going over it but I'm not going
to take a deep dive into it if you want
to learn react then check out the crash
course that I have for react Jas but
we'll be going over styling let's see
if we go down here all these components
we have the listview okay it gives us
some code samples it's actually really
good documentation in my opinion the
Navigator okay so we can navigate
between pages or scenes text input we
have different input controls so we'll
just be creating basically many
components with these functionalities
alright so let's go ahead and CD into my
app okay so now we're in the project
folder and what we want to do is we want
to start up what's called the react
packager alright and that's going to
allow us to run our app so we're going
to say react - native start alright and
that should start up the packager ok so
it says react package are ready now we
want to do is open it up on our device
open up our initialized app so I'm going
to go and I'm going to leave that
running and then go into another command
line and we're going to say react native
run - Android and if you're on a Mac you
want to do run - iOS alright so let's
look we got to go into the my app folder
okay so that's gonna go ahead and run
and it should open on our virtual device
alright remember if you don't have this
set up go back watch that Android SDK
setup video if my video for some reason
doesn't help you out there's plenty of
others out there to get it set up just
make sure that you also install SDK 6.0
because that's what react native needs
to run at least at this time
ken's this might take a minute okay so
you can see it's starting up it says
build successful over here so it should
start up no problem and there it is
so that's the boilerplate for our react
native app now what's awesome about this
is that when we edit our files we don't
have to recompile or anything like that
like you would with a standard Java
Android app we can just simply double
tap our on our keyboard and this will
reload all right now it says to get
started edit index android j s so let's
go ahead and open up I'm going to open
up my editor I'm using Visual Studio
code of course you can use whatever
you'd like and I'm just going to open up
that our folder my app which is in
projects okay now if we look over here
we have a couple different folders we
have Android okay this is where our
Android application lies and then we
have iOS okay this is where all the iOS
stuff is now for the most part we're not
going to have to touch either of those
all right what we deal with is this file
here index dot Android and index iOS
okay so it's the same app but when it's
opened on an iOS system it'll read this
file open on Android it'll read this
file all right so if you just did
everything we just did on a Mac this
right here would say edit index iOS okay
now the idea that will at least what I
do is create a folder called app and
then just import that into both of these
files and then of course anything that
is proprietary to iOS we can you know
fix that file anything on Android we can
do it in that file alright so let's go
ahead and create a folder called app
alright and it's remember it's react so
we're dealing with components so I'm
going to create a folder called
components okay and everything we do
everything we build is going to be
inside of a component
alright now let's take a look at index
Android now instead of going through all
this I think the best thing to do is
just to wipe it all out and then just
start from scratch actually you know
what before we do that let me just show
you that we can edit this so we'll say
welcome we'll change this to welcome to
my app and save it and then over here
let's click on the emulator and just
double click R or double tap R and now
you can see welcome to my apps so no no
recompiling or anything like that we can
just edit and we can reload now if you
do a ctrl M on the device here there's a
few different options you can choose to
reload you can debug jeaious remotely
you can enable live and hot reload now
if you do hot reload every time you save
your file it's going to go ahead and
reload and you may want that but I'm
just going to leave it off for now I may
enable it later and there's some other
stuff as well stuff that I really
haven't dealt with you could use the
inspector also look at the dev settings
alright and then to close that just
click somewhere else all right so let's
go back over here and just get rid of
everything in our index Android now this
is one of those times if you're on a Mac
you have to you know work in index iOS
j/s okay but it's the same idea you can
put everything that we're putting in
here you can do in the iOS file alright
there may be a couple components that
are specific to Android but I'll let you
know that all right so starting up here
let's go ahead and import we want to
import react and the component package
which we're going to wrap in curly
braces and that's going to be from react
okay now we also need to import stuff
from react native so we want app
registry and then remember what we want
to use text and view okay text is when
you know when we want to output text and
then view is based
technically just a view area where you
want to include different elements so
those are going to be from react native
all right and that's all we have to
import now we want to set up our
component and this is by the way this is
our main component okay every other
component we build will just import into
this and we'll just throw it in alright
so we want to create our class by saying
sport default class and we're going to
call this my app since it's our main
component I'm going to give it the same
name as our actual application and we'll
say extends component okay which we're
bringing in right here alright and let's
just skip down after the class and then
we're just going to say app registry dot
Register components okay this is going
to register our component obviously and
then we're just going to put it in my
app alright and then the second
parameter is going to be a callback or
an arrow function we're going to use I'm
gonna say my app just like that and now
it works very very similar to react j/s
is alright so we're going to have a
render okay and in our render we want to
return something okay so we're going to
return now just like with react you only
you can only return one element okay
obviously you can have multiple elements
but they have to be contained in that
one element so we're going to return a
view all right now in react jets you'd
probably use a div but we're not using
damage we're going to use view and then
we just want some text so we're going to
wrap that in text alright let's just say
hello world okay so let's go ahead and
save that and then we're going to go
over here and double tap our
okay now it says application my app has
not been registered this is either due
to a require error or initialization
alright so let's see well you know what
we want to use all lowercase here
sorry guys like that alright let's try
that so we can just click reload down
here and now we get hello world now up
to this point what I'm going to do is
just copy this and put this right in
index iOS save that and then if we were
to view this on iOS we'd get the same
exact thing all right so you basically
just got to manage these two files and
for the most part they can be the exact
same unless you have some proprietary
iOS stuff in there or Android ok so what
I want to do now is create a component
that we can include in here and then
work in that rather than just edit this
index file alright so in the components
folder let's create another folder and
I'm going to call this I'm just going to
call it component 1 okay and I like to
keep the the uppercase from the
component file name and the and the
folder name so inside there we want to
file component 1 dot J s alright and
then we can copy everything we put in
the Android because it's going to be
formatted the same way alright except
we're going to change this to component
1 and down here
all right and then we'll just change the
text here we'll say this is component 1
save that and then we're going to go
back to index Android and we just want
to import that ok so we can just say
imports component 1 and that's going to
be from and we want to go into our app
folder that we created components slash
component 1 slash component 1 alright
and then what we'll do is just replace
this text right here with component 1
just like that alright let's save that
and then we'll go and reload and we get
this is component 1 ok and then we can
simply take this put that right in the
iOS file and we have a cross-platform
application with a cross-platform
component all right I'm going to close
the index iOS for now because we're not
really working with that but what I want
to do now is just take it just spend a
little bit of time on react concepts all
right and just show you how those are
pretty much the same in react native so
let's work with properties so with
properties when we have a component we
can say for instance we can say message
equals let's say hello world ok so we
can pass props or properties into a
component we can do that in react native
as well so let's save that and then
we'll go into our component 1 and let's
just replace this here and we'll say
this dot props dot the message save that
reload and now we're getting hello world
kay we're passing a property into
component one and displaying it now we
can do the same thing we can use state
just as we would in react so add a
constructor here and we're going to say
actually we need to pass in our super
and then we'll say this dot state equals
and let's say named Brad and then we'll
go down here into the render and let's
put another text in and we can say this
dot state dot name okay we'll save that
let's reload and we get Brad okay so we
can store state up here in our
constructor that's where you want to
initialize it and if we want to put
another value up here we can say show
name and set that to true by default and
then what we'll do is go above the
return and create a variable we'll say
let's name this dot state dot name this
dot state dot name okay so basically
we're saying if this is true then that's
what we want to show this dot state dot
name else then we'll say no name all
right and then we'll just replace this
with that name variable
alright so save that now we should still
get Brad because it's true okay but if
we go and we set this to false and
reload
what Oh
let's see show oh I just needs to this
needs to be show name okay so now we get
no name all right set it back to true
and we get Brad okay now usually what we
want to do when we pass in properties is
is make that into a state okay well I
shouldn't say usually but sometimes you
want to turn that into state so what we
could do is in the constructor say props
you also want to pass it into super and
then we can say message and set that to
this dot props dot message and then we
should be able to change this to this
dot state dot message okay we should get
the same thing hello world okay and we
can also have default properties so if
we go right here and say static default
props it's a message and let's just say
hi there now ignore this red line this
is just the editor thinks that it's an
error thinks that this has to be in a TS
file but it doesn't so if you're using
Visual Studio code just ignore that all
right so let's save that and then we'll
go back to our index android and just
get rid of the message save it reload
and we get hi there okay it's looking at
a default props so you can see if you
know react Jes this is you know you
should this should come very easily now
if you want to debug and you want to be
able to use a console I know we're not
in a browser so what we could do is a
few ways to do it but what I like to do
is I'm going to open up another terminal
or another
command-line but I'm going to use the
integrated terminal within this editor
within Visual Studio code so if we go to
integrated terminal it'll open up a
command line in this folder and then
what we can do is say react native and
then say log Android obviously if you're
on iOS it's log iOS so now we can debug
we can for instance let's go in the
render and we'll say console.log say
hello and save that and then if we go
and run it you can see we get hello okay
so we can now log things to the console
alright so what about styling okay so
when it comes to styling we use
JavaScript but it's it's formatted as
the same key values as CSS okay and what
we're going to do is bring in from react
natives we're going to go up here and
we're going to say we want to bring in
stylesheet okay actually know what
before we do that we can leave that but
you can also do inline styles without
that style sheet so if we want to go to
let's say you know what let's some let's
create a new component and do this
alright so let's go into our components
folder and create a new folder called
component two and component 2 dot j/s
okay and then what we'll do is copy what
we have an index Android very very
simple okay get rid of this import
component one change the class name also
down here
okay and then what we'll do is um let's
put a text say hello Brad
save it and then index Android what
we'll do is just change this to
component two here and here and here
okay save it okay so now component two
is what's display so let's bring in
style sheet okay and and to show you we
can use inline Styles what we can do is
set from this text will say style style
equals and then we'll use double curly
braces alright and let's say color red
save that and now you can see the text
is red and we can add styles to views as
well let's say background color and
we'll set that to let's do black but we
can do hexadecimal
okay so that's how we can add in line
styles and you don't need the style
sheet to do that but if you want to have
if you wanted to look more like CSS file
what we can do is import stylesheet and
then say const or let or VAR styles
equals stylesheet dot create and then
we'll pass in an object and let's say
let's give this view will say style now
we're going to use the single curly
brace and we're going to say styles dot
my view alright and then we'll take this
one and say styles dot my text all right
and then down here we'll say my view
like that and let's say background
background color and let's make it blue
then we're going to put a comma here and
save my text and we'll say color white
okay let's save that and there we go
alright so it's formatted close to CSS
now notice that background color we
don't have background - color it's it's
set to camel case okay so that is a big
difference between CSS
alright instead of doing that okay we
can also use flexbox or a version of
flexbox so let's say we want to do three
boxes in a row right here alright so
what we'll do is create a view
and let's make that the Flex container
so we're going to say style equals
smiles taught and let's just call it
container okay and then inside that and
then we're going to put three views in
here and let's give it a style
so we'll say styles dot let's just say
we'll just say V V one I guess okay and
then I'll copy that actually let's put a
text in here as well okay we want three
of these and then I'm just going to
change this to two three to three okay
so let's save that and reload up to this
point now I really didn't want this
inside of the blue area so let's see
what I'll do is let's end this view here
like that and then the container let's
see
container is going to need or we'll just
get rid of this actually we can't do
that because it has to be wrapped what
we'll do is just add another view here I
guess because it has to be just it has
to return one single element and then
have all the other elements in between
all right so that should work
okay all right now what we want to do is
basically have three blocks you know
three boxes here so what we'll do is now
that we have styles we have a container
for a Flex container and then v1 v2 and
v3
so let's go down here and we'll add in
our container okay and for the container
we want to make sure we set the Flex
direction to row you can also do column
notice that with CSS we would do flex -
direction but react native we need to
use camel case so let's see we'll do
that and then let's also set a height to
the container so height will say 100 all
right and it's just a hundred it's not
100 pixels or anything like that okay
and then what we'll do is add our v1
okay and let's set it to flex one and
we'll set a background color say
background color red okay this isn't
going to look good at all
but I just want to show you how it works
yeah and then let's see we'll set a
padding of ten okay so now let's put a
comma there and then we'll just copy
this paste it in twice remove that last
comma this will be two and three and
then we can change this to let's say
green and let's say black all right so
let's save that and reload
and reload and there we go so now we
have three blocks all even with okay now
I'm not going to go into flex I have a
video called flexbox in 60 20 minutes
that you may want to watch if you want
to learn more about flex box but just
know that we can use flex and to lay out
our design or lay out our UI now if we
were to let's say for the black for v3
if we go color white and we save that
and reload you'll see that it's not
working okay the reason for that is that
view you'll see the little message down
interview does not have that color
property all right so what you would
need to do here is do it is add it to
the text so we could say style equals
style dot or Styles dot we'll just call
it V text all right then down here get
rid of that and it'll save V text color
white okay
and now we can see the text because
color is property that we can use on
text not on view all right hopefully
that makes sense so the next thing I
want to look at is touchable touchable
highlight okay so we're going to bring
this in
now this touchable highlight and there's
touchable opacity let me see if I open
up the documentation and you can put
this on anything a button of view text
whatever you'd like okay so let's see
right here touchable highlight touchable
opacity there's also touch little native
feedback touchable without feedback
which gives you no effect which you
probably don't want to use but if we
click on this you'll see that we can
include it we can add an event on press
in this case it's going to call the
function underscore on press button
alright so let's go ahead and wrap let's
see we'll wrap the first view here v1 so
say touchable highlights and end it here
okay
and let's add on press and we're going
to set that to this dot I guess we'll
just say on press okay you can call that
whatever you'd like and then what we'll
do is above render will say on press and
let's just do a console dot log and I'll
say area pressed okay let me just tab
this record excuse me tab this render
over alright so let's save that and
we'll go back and reload all right now
oh let's see why did that happen okay so
now when I click it notice that I get we
get that effect and we also were getting
area pressed as far as that the Flex
let's see I guess I guess we would want
to put this style or the Flex one on to
the touchable highlight instead of the
view let's see if that does it
there we go all right so now click that
you can see we get that effect all right
now there are some properties to
touchable highlight so if we go to the
documentation
let's see active opacity determines what
the opacity of the wrap view should be
when touch is active but what I want is
this underlay color this is the color of
the underlay that'll show through when
it's active all right so if we go and
let's just make this a little cleaner
all right and we'll set underlay and
let's set that to just test it out we'll
set it to blue
okay so now when I click that up that
didn't work Oh underlay color
okay alright so now when I click it you
can see that we get a blue underlay
so now let's try the touchable opacity
okay and for this we'll wrap it around
view - okay and let's set on press we'll
set it to this dot on press - okay
and we'll say area to area - pressed
alright and then let's move the style to
touchable opacity
okay so save that and reload
okay so now when I click that you can
see that effect okay it goes really slow
because of the device if it was on a
real device it would be quicker and you
can see we get area two pressed okay and
that has its own properties as well if
we go to the documentation and let's see
looks like we just have active opacity
okay alright so those are that's how we
can handle touch events and obviously
you can have anything you want happen
when you click these I do want to get
into the Navigator in a little bit but
before we do that let's look at some of
the other UI stuff this video is getting
it's going to be quite long I really
don't want it to be that long so we're
not going to get to too much like I said
if you want to you know pretty much
check out all this stuff then I would
suggest checking out the edge' wanax
course we look at pretty much all not
not all of it but most of the important
ones so now what I want to do is look at
some input controls so we have text
input which is where is it text input
right here all right so we can put a
text input and it has this unchanged
text so that we can we can reset the
state whenever we type something in or
whatever it is that we want to do so
let's create another component for this
so we'll say new component component 3
and pull it 3 j s and let's see what do
I want we'll just grab I'll actually
let's just copy what we have an index
Android put that in there
okay get rid of that and we'll change
this to component three okay we want
that down here as well save it and then
we'll go to index Android and just
change this these and this okay so now
that should show component three all
right and then what we're going to do is
bring in text input okay and we're going
to replace this text with text input all
right let's see we're going to end that
with a slash and then this is going to
take in a bunch of different properties
so we can put a placeholder say enter
text all right and let's just see what
that gives us so we'll save it and
reload actually know what I'm going to
do is enable hot loading so ctrl M and
then we'll say enable hot reloading so
now every time we save it should reload
but sometimes when you change the state
you'll have to reload it for that to
register so just know that all right so
now we have our text input if we click
inside of it you'll see the keyboard
pop-up and we can either click these
keys or we can just use the our keyboard
all right
now this text input usually what we'll
do is assign a state value to whatever
this is going to be all right so let's
put in
a constructor and I'll say this dot
state and let's set this and then we'll
say text value and let's just set it to
hello for now all right and then in the
text input we can say value equals this
dot state dot text value
okay so we'll save that now see the hot
loading didn't reload the state so we
have to just I'll just click reload down
here and that should do it
all right so now we get hello in our
text input now let's output the state
underneath it as well so we'll put in a
text like that and then let's put this
dot state dot text value okay and then
let's put in our event handler on change
text okay and we'll set that now I'm
going to pass along a property so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
use an arrow function so let's open up
some parentheses and we'll say value and
go like that and set it to this dot on
change text you can call this whatever
you want and then pass in that value all
right so then let's create that function
on change text okay that's going to take
in value and let's just do console dot
log value all right actually you know
what let's not do console log let's
change this state this dot set state
and we want to change text value and we
want to change that to the value that's
being passed in as we type and then we
should see that here we should see this
change so let's go ahead and save that
all right and I'm also going to just
reload this manually okay now if we
click in here and I go and I delete
you'll see that the state is changing
and you can see that the proof of that
right below it all right so if we just
say Brad you'll see that the state is
now changing as we type
all right now if you don't want to
change things if you don't want to fire
your your function as you're typing and
you want it to do it actually when you
submit it you can use the event handler
what is it on submit editing all right
so if we say on submit editing and let's
see we can say let's just do this dot on
submit and we'll just do a console.log
input submitted okay
so now
if I go and I click if I type you'll see
we're not going to get the the
console.log but if I go when I click
enter
you see input submitted ok you also have
on focus you have on blur there's a
bunch of different event handlers you
can use and that's all that should all
be here in the documentation or not ok
thought it was it's somewhere in here
I'm not going to search for it now all
right but you have those different event
handlers with the text input now we also
have other input controls I can't go
through all of them because it'll take
too long we have the picker the slider
and the switch alright so let's do the
switch because that's pretty easy it's
basically a true/false value so bring in
switch and I apologize if he can hear my
son yelling upstairs alright so we can
put this switch let's just put it right
under here it's not going to look very
pretty but who cares so switch and then
we'll end it and let's do actually we'll
put a value in the state for it so let's
just say switch value and we'll set that
to false all right and then in here
let's do value equals this dot state dot
switch value and we'll save that ok
and there's our switch ok now if I click
it you'll see it's not actually changing
ok the reason for that is we need to add
a non value change property and we're
going to set that to
this dot on switch change okay actually
know what we want to send the value so
we're going to go value this on switch
change value okay and then what we'll do
here is set the state so I'm just going
to grab this and we're going to set the
switch value make sure we pass it in
here as well okay now we'll save that
and now you see that it actually stays
okay
so now it's set to true we're actually
changing the state value right here to
true click it again we can set it back
to false alright and this the the other
inputs work pretty similar it's pretty
easy to figure out
see I originally wanted this video to be
an hour but it looks like I can either
stop now or I can keep going and make it
an hour and a half or so so I think I'm
going to keep going because I want I
want to give you guys an example of list
view and at least a sink storage and
maybe some of the other API so hopefully
that's not too long for you guys alright
so let's go ahead and we'll keep this as
component three and let's create a new
one alright and I realized I could break
these up into some separate videos but I
like to keep it all in one and I also
don't want to give too much away because
I'm obviously promoting a course here a
premium course alright and I'll get
fired
alright so let's create a new folder say
component four
own it for Jas and we'll grab this get
rid of that call this component for okay
all right so let's go back to index
Android and change this and this okay so
now we have our component for now I want
to give you a demonstration of the
ListView so what I'm going to do is
above the class I'm going to create a
variable called users and set that to an
array okay and we'll give these users a
name do one more say Janet Janet
Williams okay so we have these users now
usually you fetch this from an outside
API or a database and I'll try to show
you how to do that as well but for now
it's just local data now the ListView
works kind of weird and I really don't
like some of it so let's just let's see
let's go to ListView now what we have to
do is create a table a variable for a
data source you'll see here calling it D
s setting it to new list view data
source and then we have this weird row
has changed and then this this condition
right here okay we have this R 1 and R 2
parameter and then we have to say as
long as R 1 is not
- are - okay which is kind of strange
and I really don't like it but that's
what we have to do and then we need to
call that data source in our state we'll
set it to a state value and then call
clone with rose and then pass in our
data so that's what we need to do we
obviously we need to bring in list view
up here for it to work okay and then
we're going to go to we're going to
create a constructor okay so let's just
grab this okay so we have D s changing
setting it to the data source row has
changed blah blah blah and then we have
our state we're setting data source now
you probably want to be more specific
here let's say user data source and then
we're going to get rid of this array
here and just pass in users now we're
going to go down here to our render and
instead of rendering a view let's render
ListView okay now this needs to take in
a data source so data source and we'll
set it to this dot state dot user data
source okay and then it also has a
property called render row and then what
you want to do is that you want to have
a function that's gonna represent the
row and you can do whatever you want
with it so we'll say this start render
row okay
and then what we're going to do is just
we're going to bind the this value to
that so that we can use it so just say
dot bind this alright now we'll create
the render row
okay and the render row is actually
going to get passed
hey user okay or to do or whatever it is
that you have as your data alright
there's actually a few parameters that
it gives us there's user then it gives
us the section ID and then the row ID
and then something called highlight row
but many times you'll just need the
actual data the actual user all right
now inside render row let's do view okay
so view and then text and then inside
here we should be able to do user dot
name okay and that should render the
user name let's save that now is not an
object
let's try reloading manually
all right so a valid react element or
null must be returned you may have
returned undefined let's see what's
going on here
see we use our data source oh I know
what's wrong in render row we have to
actually return this not just put it in
there like that
try reloading manually and there we go
alright so now we're rendering a
ListView rendering our roads now I
probably want to style this so for the
view let's say style and we'll set it to
Styles dot row and then the text set
that to styles dot row text alright and
let's see we need to make sure we put in
stylesheet up here so Styles equals
stylesheet not create and we have our
row and let's do use flexbox so let's
say flex direction and we'll set that to
row we'll set justify content to Center
set padding to say ten background we'll
do a light gray and let's just set a
margin bottom two three all right and
then for the text row text I'm simply
going to set flex one alright so if we
save that and let that reload um oh I
put background it should be background
color okay see it's not exactly the same
as CSS alright so now we have our
ListView now if you wanted to fetch the
data from somewhere else we can use
fetch and I think what I'm going to do
here is create another component so I
can show you how to do that and then
and what we'll do is we'll add a
touchable highlight to each one and
we'll implement the navigator
and that way we can click on it it'll
open up another component of details
components we can see more details of
the user all right and I think that's
what we're going to have to end it
because there's just not enough time and
you know I can't I can't just include
the entire course oh I'm on YouTube
alright so let's go ahead and do that
we'll create a new component so we'll
say new folder component five and let's
say new file component five dot J s okay
let's just copy what we have an index
Android again change that they'll have
all this code available for you guys
okay then we'll go to index Android and
just change this
all right so what I want to do now is
let's see I'm going to actually probably
should just use component four because
we're going to use a bunch of this stuff
yeah let's grab constructor put that in
component five all right and this is
going to work a little different because
we're not populating the that the data
here what we need to do is we need to
hook into component did mount just like
you would with react and that's where
we're going to do our call to fetch the
data from our API and what we're going
to use is Jason placeholder which I use
in a lot of my videos when we're working
with AP is basically a fake REST API and
we're going to get a list of users okay
from this URL right here gives us a list
of I think a hundred users so what we're
going to do is this DES we're going to
keep this okay that's going to stay the
same and in the state instead of doing
the clone with ROS here we're not going
to do that we're going to just set it to
that data source that Dee's variable all
right and then what we'll do is create a
fetch user's function okay and we're
going to say fetch and let's grab that
URL okay hmm
this is asynchronous so we're going to
say dot then and let's pass in another
set of parentheses response we'll use an
arrow function and I just want to say
response dot jason okay make sure it's
jason content and then we'll do another
then pass in that response
set that to a code block and then we're
going to set the state okay and what we
want to do here is take that user data
source and set it to this dot state dot
user data source and then here is what
we want to do the clone with rose and
then we'll pass in that response okay so
that should do it that should populate
the ListView and then as far as
rendering the ListView we can actually
grab that from component four see I
should have just copied this whole thing
but that's alright
so we want to put that here okay and
then render row let's grab that and I
believe user does have a name okay so
that's still that'll still work and then
we need to bring in list view and also
stylesheet okay and will at will grab
the style from component four as well
hopefully this isn't confusing and let's
see let's save that see if that works
okay let's try reloading
oh you know what we didn't we didn't
call fetch users it's just sitting there
it's not being called so when we do is
hook into a life cycle method called
component did mount and that's just
standard react so we'll say this dot
fetch users okay so hopefully that works
let's try reloading manually sometimes
that doesn't hot loading doesn't
undefined oh okay so we need to bind
this to oh no we did that this dot
render role buying this undefined is not
a function this dog fetch users Oh needs
to be a capital you
oh come on there we go all right good
so these users are coming from here and
I thought it was a hundred but I guess
it's ten okay you can seal and Graham
and Lee and Graham and we can get any of
this data we want for instance if we
wanted to go to where I rendering the
row and just put we can put a colon and
then say user dot email and save that
and now you'll see that it's getting the
email address all right good
all right so the last thing I want to
look at is navigation all right now I
know I said I was going to look at the
API and stuff like that and I'm probably
going to include some of that in my next
not the next video I do with the next
react native video that I do when we
build an application all right but I
think we hit on a lot of good points as
far as how to get it set up and also the
formatting the styling some of the input
controls things like that all right so
hopefully guys I don't get too
disappointed all right and obviously the
Navigator is a huge part of it as well
so what we're going to do here is we're
going to create another component so
let's call this component six and let's
see point six Jas okay we'll copy index
Android
this name point six and this is
basically going to be the details
component and I know these aren't and
these components aren't named very well
but you know we're just we're just
putting a bunch of stuff in here and
there's really no good names for for
these and I just want to be consistent
so I don't want to call this something
else and let's see for now we'll just
say details all right
save that and what we're going to do now
is go back to index Android and this is
where we're going to implement the
navigator so we're going to bring it in
and we want component five but we also
want to bring in component six okay so
we're going to import that as well which
is going to be the details all right and
instead of in our render instead of
returning this view we're going to
return the navigator
okay and this is going to take in a
couple properties one is going to be the
initial route so the initial route I'm
going to set that to double curly brace
and we're going to give it an ID and
let's give it an ID of component was a
component five all right now ID this
could be anything you want I think ID
makes sense but you could do route or
page or something like that as well all
right and then we need to have a
property called render scene okay so a
scene is basically a view or page or a
component whatever you want to call it
all right so we're going to set that to
this dot render scene which will create
in a minute and then we're going to have
configure screen which is where you can
kind of set some options
we're going to set this we need to pass
in some parentheses with a route and
then a route stack alright and we can
use this route to attach parameters to
our routes alright I'll show you how
that works so we want to set this to be
an arrow function to navigate our dot
scene configs and then we can choose the
way that we want the pages to enter I'm
going to use float from bottom and
there's there's all type this float from
right left if you look at the
documentation if we go to let's see
where's navigator how's it sit okay so
this basically is telling us all the
stuff we're doing now let's see okay I
guess there's somewhere in the
documentation that gives you a list of
the different options as far as where
this you know float from bottom and all
that but we're just going to use that
all right now we want to create the
render scene function okay so render
scene and that's going to take in the
route parameter as well as the Navigator
itself not not upper case all right now
here is where we need to basically have
a condition for this ID to see what
scene it is or what page so we're going
to use a switch and you can use an if
statement if you want but I think a
switch makes more sense so what we want
to test is route dot ID now it's only ID
because that's what we called it here
you could call this whatever you want
all right so let's put a case for
component 5 not I'm really not happy
with what I'm calling this but I would
kind of too deep into it now
but you could call this whatever you
want really and it doesn't even I don't
know this is this is fine I guess
alright so that's what you get when you
don't plan out from top to bottom what
you're gonna do so we're going to just
return and we can return whatever we
want here you could return a view or
whatever but we want to return is the
component 5 which is the user list
alright so what we're going to do is
just say component 5 and then we want to
put title and we're going to set that to
component 5 okay and then we're going to
go right under this and let's copy that
and then this will be component 6 change
this and this ok now we want to be able
to use the navigator from within these
components so we're going to pass that
in as a property so we'll say navigate
our equals
navigator okay I'm going to copy that
okay so let's go ahead and save that and
let's see what we get ok we should see
the same thing we should see component 5
which is the list of users all right so
now we're going to do is go into
component 5 and what we want to happen
is now that our navigator set up we want
to be able to click on one of these and
open up the details page which is
component 6 alright so we're going to
bring in touchable highlight
okay bring that in and then we're going
to wrap the view the row view with
touchable highlight okay now we're going
to add an on press to the touchable
highlight and we're going to put a
parenthesis and then set that use an
arrow function and then say this dots
and I guess we'll just call it on press
alright and then we want to pass along
the user which is coming from here once
when we render the row all right so
let's create on press and that's going
to take in the user and then for now
just to test it out let's do a
console.log user save that and now if we
click let's say Curtis can see we get
the highlight and let's see do that
click on Curtis yup right here
okay so we know that's working and what
we want to do is we want to use the
navigator and since we passed it in to
component 5 as a property we can use it
in here alright and we just want to call
this dot navigator I'm sorry this
docprops/core.xml d tails or some are
user details or something like that all
right but its component six because
that's what we called it here or right
here actually alright so let's go ahead
and just reload this manually and now
let's click one of these
and now you can see it slides over to
the details alright and we can actually
just drag this down or drag it over or
maybe not I thought we could do that
that's weird
all right I guess we could put a back
button or something but let's just
reload it all right now the details I
want to pass along that users info so to
do that all we have to do is in a
component 5 where we do the push now
since we're passing in user right here
we'll just put another parameter and
we'll say user and set that to user all
right now in order for that to work we
need to go back to where we have our
render scene and we want to just specify
that component 6 is going to take in a
user property and then we want to set
that to route dot user alright and
that'll allow us to pass a user in so
let's save that and then back in
component 6 we should now have access to
that user so let's go ahead and say
actually you know what a better thing to
do would be to add it to the state all
right because we know what's coming in
as a property but we want to add to the
state of the component so we'll say
constructor bouncing props props and
then we'll say this dot state and let's
set name equal to this dot props dot
user dot name all right we could do the
same thing with email and any other
properties that it has
all right and then down here let's put
in this dot state dot name all right
we'll put another one with the email as
well okay so hopefully that works let's
save it okay um
transform error let's try reloading
sometimes that works unexpected token
let's see um oh I'm an idiot I have I
put the constructor in the render I
don't feel like going back and editing
that so you guys are just gonna have to
think of an idiot let's reload okay so
now let's click on lay in and there we
go brings us to the details page and we
passed in the user which we set a name
and an email as state coming from the
properties of that user all right and
I'm not gonna worry about you know
making this look good I will be doing a
video where we build an actual app and
make it look good but for now just
trying to get the fundamentals out there
for you guys now we probably want a
button to go back so what I'll do is we
could use touchable highlight or opacity
but there's actually a button component
too so if we just take that and let's
put that here and we'll put in just like
touchable highlight we can do on press
and let's set that to this dot on press
will give it a title okay so what we can
do is we can use the Navigator again
we'll say this dot navigator or props
dot navigator dot push and let's give it
an ID of component five okay which is
the list of users save that there's our
button click go back and define is on
object I so it's it's giving us that
error because we need to bind this to
the on press ok because we're using this
here alright so that brings us back to
the user list so we can now just vit we
can go to any user page we want and we
can go back all right so that's going to
have to be the end of the video guys I
really hope that you at least understand
the core basic concepts of react native
there's a ton more here that you can go
through scroll views status bar toolbars
all that and like I said the edge' wanax
course we actually create dozens of many
components like this using different
components here and also down here the
youth the api's ok we look at a sink
storage camera roll to look at photos on
the phone there's a lot of content so I
would definitely suggest it if if you're
interested in react native alright so
thanks for watching guys if you're still
with me thanks this was a long video and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
