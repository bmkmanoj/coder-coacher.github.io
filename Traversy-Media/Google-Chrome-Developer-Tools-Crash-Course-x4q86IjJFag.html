course on one of if not the most
important web development tool available
and that's google chrome dev tools now
all browsers as far as I know have their
own set of developer tools and a lot of
the stuff we'll be doing here you can do
in other browsers but not all of it and
if you're a web developer I'd highly
suggest using Google Chrome at least for
development what you use to browse web
pages and so on doesn't really matter
but for development I'd suggest chrome
second to that I would say Firefox now
chrome tools is very powerful there's a
lot of real advanced stuff that you can
do especially when it comes to debugging
and in JavaScript I'm not going to get
into the real advanced tasks in
debugging because I don't want to focus
too much on pieces of code rather than
dev tools themselves also I want this to
be a beginner to intermediate friendly
tutorial or crash course all right so
with that said let's go ahead and get
started I want to give a huge shout out
to today's sponsor male tag male tag is
a Chrome extension that allows you to
track your emails in real time for free
it also lets you track other cool things
like link clicks email reopens and even
the device that was used to open your
emails be sure to check out male tag by
clicking the link in the description
below alright guys so the website that
we're going to be working with for the
first part of this crash course is from
the bootstrap for you to me course it's
the Mizzou steam it's just a one page
theme that uses bootstrap you can see
the the menu items just take you to that
part of the theme alright so I think
it's just a good example to work with so
to open our dev tools or chrome tools
whatever you want to call them there's a
few different ways we can go to the menu
here we can go to more tools and then
developer tools and that will open them
up we can also toggle with f12 and we
can also use ctrl shift I all right so
those are some ways that we can open up
the dev tools now there's a lot of
different tabs here we're not going to
go over all of them in fact if you click
over here and you go to more tools
there's even more stuff but what
we're gonna really look at is elements
console the JavaScript console sources
Network and application we're not going
to really work with memory management
and stuff like that that's beyond this
but beyond this tutorial all right so
we're basically going to be working with
the the most common types of tasks that
people use so what we're gonna do before
we look at the elements tab is I'm going
to show you how we can move this around
so by default it's gonna be at the
bottom but if you want it on the side
you can go ahead and do that
if you want it on the left side you can
do that and if you want it undocked
completely you can do that so it's it's
another window I think what I'm gonna do
is try it on the side just to kind of
you know so you guys can see what's
going on a little better usually I have
it at the bottom but we're gonna give
this a shot so before we look at the
elements and inspection let's click on
this little icon right here this is the
device this will this will allow us to
look at our site on different devices in
different sizes first I'm just going to
choose responsive and basically this is
1024 by 1745 so this is like a like a
laptop view but if we want to go mobile
we can click right here and this will
give us like a mobile view if we want to
click right here this will give us a
larger mobile this will give us a tablet
view and then we can choose actual
devices as well so if I want to see what
this looks like on an iPhone 6 we can do
that okay we can use a little menu here
if we wanted to look at on let's say a
Galaxy s5
it's a little different but not much and
it shouldn't be much different but you
can do that you can change it from
landscape to to portrait so it's it's a
nice little tester to see what your site
looks like on mobile devices and tablets
all right so let's go ahead and close
that out and we'll just click that icon
again and now we're going to look at the
element inspector ok are the elements
tab now that all of this right
here is the source code this is the HTML
and then down here we have the CSS for
whatever is selected here notice that
when I hover over an element it kind of
highlights in the browser and you'll see
that it has some sometimes it'll have a
green bar around it sometimes it'll have
an orange bar around it what this is is
padding and margin so this nav bar right
here if I just click and select it
you'll see that it has it has green
border around it this is the padding if
I go over the let's go and showcase and
let's hover over container you'll see
that there's actually orange on the side
as well that's the margin a container
has margin auto meaning that it puts the
same the same amount of margin on both
sides and that's what you're seeing it
also has a little bit of padding so it
has the orange and green okay now let's
say we want to select an item in the
browser and then have it highlight over
here so basically the opposite what we
can do is click on this this little icon
here this arrow in the box and then we
can go and we can select what we want so
if we want to select this h1 right here
we can go ahead and click it and it'll
bring it to us over here in the elements
tab alright and while this is selected
down here or it'll show us any CSS that
pertains to that element so notice that
this h1 has a class of display too as a
class of mt5 and PT 5 which are all
bootstrap classes by the way a lot of
the stuff we're gonna see our bootstrap
classes so if we go down here it'll
actually give us the styles for PT 5 mt
5 display - h1 itself anything that
pertains to this selector right here ok
not only that but it shows us the file
that it comes from and then the line
number where the style is and if I click
on this it'll open that up it'll show us
bootstrap CSS with that style and then
we can just close that up and go back to
elements and we have a checkbox next to
these Styles here so this padding top if
I uncheck that it's gonna go ahead and
remove that class from that or it's
gonna toggle it that style from that
element
okay oh no not only from that element
but anything that has the PT v class
you'll see that underneath the
newsletter this actually has it as well
so that's changing too so we can toggle
our classes now let's say we only wanted
to toggle it from the h1 so what I'll do
is inspect the h1 so it's selected right
here and then we'll go down here and
we'll say element classes and then we'll
toggle the PT 5 now you can see that
it's only removing it from that element
it's not just taking away all the PT
fives so let's go ahead and let's focus
on up here for a little bit for those
and we'll focus on the mark up now we
can change things so let's say we wanted
to change the text of this h1 right here
what we could do is double click the
text and I'm just going to replace it
with hello world and enter and you'll
see it'll actually change the text now
this isn't going to stick this is
temporary if I reload the page that's
going to go away
obviously otherwise we'd be able to just
you know mess with anyone's website and
we'd have we have quite a crisis now
later on I am going to show you how you
can add your local workspace to Chrome
so that you can edit things and they
will stick and the changes will stick so
you can use you can use the dev tools as
an actual text editor but of course it
has to be added as a local workspace all
right now texts the the you know the
inner text isn't the only thing we can
change if we wanted to let's say change
something in here we could double click
we could add a class let's just add a
class of let's say special doesn't do
anything but I'm just showing you we can
add it in addition to doing it that way
we can right click and we can say add
attribute and let's say we wanted to add
an ID here so we'll add an ID of heading
ok so we can do it that way as well
and then we can change this if we want
we can change the value we can change
the actual attribute so if I wanted to
change this to it's a title we could do
that
as well all right we can remove stuff
from the Dom so let's say let's see I'm
gonna click inspect and I'll go to the
the little mizuki right here that the h3
and the logo and we can go ahead and we
can either choose hide now hide is going
to make it so we can't see it but it
still takes up the space in fact this
probably isn't a good element to show
you this on let's actually go to the
paragraph right here and we're gonna
choose hide and notice that the space is
still there as if as if the paragraph
was still there we just can't see the
content and notice that when it's hidden
you'll have this little dot right here
so we can unhide it and then if we want
we can also delete it so if we say
delete element it'll completely remove
it from the Dom and now that space is
gone okay we can also move things around
so let's say let's choose this little
logo right here this M logo it's an
image tag and then what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say copy and we can say copy
element and then we'll go down to let's
say the footer and we'll go into the
container and we will do copy and then
paste element and then let's right-click
and say scroll into view it'll bring us
down and now you can see we have the
little logo down here in the footer
alright now we can also click and drag
so if we wanted to bring it like up here
we can just drag it all around wherever
we want there it is right there
alright so another thing we can do is we
can see different states of elements so
see this button here if I hover over it
it gets a grey background if we want we
can select this let's click inspect and
click the button and then we'll go over
here and we'll right-click and let's
let's check off hover and then it'll
display that as the hover State okay and
you can see it adds a little dot here to
tell you that it's in the hover State
and it's not just hover we can also do
active and focused and what else visited
so you can change the states like that
alright and then as far as this menu see
we covered pretty much everything
and all if we want to expand everything
that's in the tree here and we can
collapse all all right
so now let's move on to messing with
styles so I'm going to just pull this up
so we can see the CSS now let's go to
the navbar so this right here and as I
showed you we can we can change things
like in the class here bootstrap 4 has a
class of navbar light what that does is
it makes the text dark I know that
sounds a little weird but it's basically
saying the navbar has a light background
so the text should be dark so what I'm
gonna do is change this to navbar dark
enter and now you'll see that the text
is now gone it's not gone but it's white
because it thinks the navbar has a dark
background so that's one way we can
change and add classes another way is we
can go down here make sure you have the
element selected and we can go to this
dot CLS and we can add a new class here
we can also as I showed you before we
can toggle so for example we can toggle
that navbar dark class but let's go
ahead and add a different background
color to this so bootstrap has a class
called BG info which will give it a blue
background so go ahead and type and
notice as I start typing it'll pull up
all the classes that are in the
bootstrap CSS file so any CSS file you
have connected it'll automatically kind
of search the classes so let's use BG -
info it enter and it'll add that as a
class ok so notice that the background
of the navbar is now blue now another
thing if we go down to the CSS here we
can change things like let's BG info
right here so that we have this color it
shows us the color and if we click on it
we have a nice little color picker and
we can change the color that way as well
as well so if we wanted to change it to
like I don't know - like a reddish color
like that we could go ahead and do that
if we wanted to change up here the
navbar class has a box shadow
we could go ahead and change that color
so if we wanted to make that like a red
and we also have an eyedropper tool
which if we click that we can just pick
colors in here okay we'll choose that
black color I guess and then to change
numeric values we can actually let's see
go like that and I can just go ahead and
click the up arrow up or down arrow and
that'll change that value okay it'll
increment or deep or deep decrement it
alright so we can do stuff like that
which is really cool we could do it with
the opacity as well see for the colors I
never tried that but does that do
anything no I didn't know if it would
increment the hexadecimal in some way
but I guess not all right so let's see
what else we can also add new styles
okay with this this plus button right
here so let's say we want to choose the
body the body has an idea of home so
it'll create a style for exactly what
this is okay so if I click this new
style rule it'll create a style for body
home and we could say like background
let's say background black and that'll
automatically change to black alright I
know this looks horrendous but I'm just
trying to give you some examples of how
this stuff works all right now let's
choose the showcase let's see so
showcase right here section showcase and
then I'm gonna click on computed and
this shows us the box model so it gives
us the width and the height of the
element gives us the padding the border
the margin and any positioning that it
has all right in addition to that if we
go down here it gives us all the
specific styles for this element okay so
for instance background image if I go
ahead and I expand that it'll show us
the actual image and we can open this if
we want if we want to open in a new tab
users Brad sandbox image alright so I
guess that's not working it's it's not
getting the right path because it's not
we're loading this from our file system
not an actual web server so it's not
showing the actual image but it would if
we were on a real web server alright so
let's see what else I think that's
pretty much it
oh this right here this hover so let's
let's select this button right here and
notice that down here it's gonna give us
the default for just the regular button
style but if we want to look at the
hover style we can go ahead and click on
that and then click hover or active or
whatever and it'll show us that style
okay because if we don't do that we're
not gonna be able to see that hover
style okay so we can choose active
that'll show us active and so on alright
let's see we can also filter so if we
want to look at color it'll show us
anything to do with color we can also
search classes like BG dot PG or maybe
it doesn't search classes I don't know I
don't really use this but I guess you
can search for just yeah padding's any
styles for that particular element all
right so that's gonna do it for the
elements tab now we're gonna move on to
the console alright guys so for this
part of the course what I've done is
I've created a single index.html file
inside a folder called DT sandbox dev
tool sandbox and I've just added just
some basic HTML we just have you know
our head tag and then we have an h1 in
the body so over here on the console
make sure you have the console tab
highlighted you can actually run
JavaScript here so if we were to say
alerts one and enter you'll see that
it'll execute that JavaScript JavaScript
now when it gives us undefined back that
just means that there's no return value
now we can type expressions in here for
instance even if I just put like a 1 and
enter it'll give us a 1 back
if we do let's say one plus three it'll
give us four back now there's also
little symbols that I'm going to show
you throughout the course as well
throughout this section one is going to
be money sign underscore what that'll do
if I click enter it'll give us the last
returned value from the last expression
all right now this button here will
clear the console and now if I do the
money sign underscore it's gonna give us
undefined because it cleared everything
out
okay another symbol we have is money
sign 0 1 2 and so on and what that does
is it'll show us the last element
selected with the inspector all right so
right now if I save money sign 0 gives
us undefined let's go ahead and click
inspect and let's inspect this h1 right
here all right I'm just gonna click and
just click on it and then we'll go back
to the console and let's say money sign
0 and you'll see that it'll give us the
h1 all right if we select something else
like the HTML you can see right here
it's telling us we're just selecting the
HTML element we'll go back to console
what's to money sign 0 we get HTML all
right now if we do money sign 1 we get
the dev tools because that was the one
we selected before that if we do when he
signed to will get undefined because we
did not select anything before that the
h1 was the first thing that we selected
all right now you can also use the money
sign as an alias for document dot query
selector so it works just like jQuery
although it's not jQuery so what I'm
gonna do is just cancel this out or
clear this and let's say document dot
not get we want document dot query
selector whoops didn't mean to do that
query selector and we want to grab the
h1 and let's say dot style dot color
equals red and then enter and that'll
actually change it to red now document
dot query selector is just vanilla
JavaScript now we can use the money sign
as an alias for a query selector so we
can essentially use jQuery it's not
jQuery but it's the same format so we
can say h1 we can say dot style dot
color equals blue and that'll change it
to blue okay now if I reload this it's
gonna of course go back to normal
another thing I want to show you is that
you can open the console from any tab if
we're in elements and you want the
console open you can do a control what
is a control shift J no I'm sorry
control shift J we'll just open the
console up from from nothing to open up
the console drawer then you want to do
what the hell is it it's so just escape
if I click escape you'll see that this
opens we get this what's new I'm gonna
close that out and then we have the
console down here okay in addition to
the elements tab but I'm just gonna go
right back to the console alright and
we'll get this rid of that all right so
now let's move over to the file and
let's see some things we can do over
here so what I'm gonna do is add some
script tags and if you guys have watched
any of my videos at all I do a lot of
JavaScript and you'll see me lots of
times use console.log that's how we can
do testing that's how we just if we want
any output from our application we use
console.log now in my case this is gonna
be cuz I'm using a plug-in here called
live server for visual studio code so if
you're not using that you will have ten
you're following along you will have to
reload so that's just logging something
to the console all right now the console
also gives us errors okay any errors so
if we for instance a console dot log and
we try to pass in a variable called my
var that is not declared and we go ahead
and run it we're gonna get this uncaught
reference error my var is not defined
okay in addition to that it's going to
give us the file name it's going to give
us the line number that through the
errors so if I go ahead and click that
it'll open up you know that part of
file and it'll show us what caused that
error alright so let's go back to
console and I'm just gonna comment this
out now we can also throw our own errors
in our scripts so if we say console dot
error and we can say this is an error
and save and you'll see it'll run and it
looks just like an error it'll also show
us the line that caused it all right
in addition to errors we can do warnings
so console dot warned will say this is a
warning and save and it basically does
the same thing except it's yellow has a
little exclamation mark instead of an X
all right so let's take a look at some
other console commands we have the
console dot dir command and that's
basically gonna show us a Java Script
representation of any Dom element so
let's put in the actual document here
and save and then we'll get this this
hash document but if we click on this
arrow it'll show us everything about the
document okay and we can access any of
this for instance if we wanted the URL
we could say console.log and we could
say document dot URL let's actually
comment this out and save and reload we
don't have to reload but it'll show us
the URL so we can get any any value from
that from that document object and if
you're interested in more if you're
interested in more of this kind of stuff
looking at the document looking at the
Dom check out my Dom crash course it's a
4 4 video course on YouTube absolutely
free and you might want to check that
out
alright so another thing we can do is we
can create tables in the console of with
arrays so for instance let's say console
table and we're gonna put in some
brackets and let's add an object we'll
put a name of John email
let's say test test comm and we'll put
an age of 33 all right so let's save
that and you can see it actually creates
a table okay so we can add more objects
to this array and it would add it to the
table all right another thing I wanted
to show you is that we can filter some
of the stuff out if we want so you'll
see we have info warnings and errors
checked off now the table is considered
info so if I go ahead and I click that
it'll hide it if we want to not show
warnings it'll hide the warning if and
you'll see now it says errors only if I
uncheck errors it won't show that at all
it says hide all so we can filter the
type of logs that are gonna show down
here and the types of errors and
warnings and stuff all right so another
command we have is console dot clear and
I'm sure you can guess what that does it
just clears the console for us all right
so let's go ahead and comment this stuff
out by the way to do that and I do
control forward slash and then I want to
show you that we can actually log stuff
in groups so if we stay console dot
group and we give this a name let's just
call this say hello and then down at the
bottom here we want to say console dot
group end and here we'll say say hello
same thing it's kind of an identifier
and then here let's just do console log
I will say hello John copy that paste in
two more will say hello Sally and hello
I don't know Chris let's save it and run
it and you'll see that now all of these
logs are put into a group this say hello
group which we can actually collapse and
uncollapse alright so we can do that
another thing we can do is we can do a
console time so let's go ahead and say
console dot
I'm give this identifier we'll just
we'll call it for loop and then down
here we'll say console dot time end and
also pass in for loop and this can be
anything the for loop that's just what
I'm calling it because that's what I'm
gonna do and then I'm just gonna do a
simple for loop here so we'll save our I
equals 0 as long as I is less than let's
say 2000 and then we'll do I plus plus
and then let's just go ahead and console
dot log I and let's save and now it'll
actually run the loop it'll count
through 0 to 2000 or 1999 and then it'll
tell us the the identifier and then how
long it took to do that so it took it a
hundred and eight point this
milliseconds alright so that is console
dot time we can also run assertions
which are basically kind of like tests
so let's create a function here we'll
call it greater than and it's gonna take
in two values let's say x and y and
we're gonna say in here console dot
assert so console assert and then the
condition which is going to be is X
greater than Y and then it'll take a
second parameter of an object and we're
gonna put a message in here actually
this needs to be Jason so we're gonna
wrap this in double quotes and say
message and we'll say C X is not greater
than Y alright and then we can pass in
the third parameter here and we're gonna
say that X is whatever is in the X
variable whatever's passed in and we'll
put a comma and we'll say Y is
whatever's in the Y and that will
display in the actual message alright so
then we just want to
this will say greater than and let's
let's make sure that the first one is
not greater than the second one so we'll
do four or five oops and that'll make it
fail and we'll save and you'll say we
get assertion failed message X is not
greater than Y and then it shows us the
actual values of x and y so we can run
little assertions and tests with our
console all right and if I were to put
something that was greater than like put
six then nothing's gonna happen okay
it's not gonna say passed or anything
like that it's just nothing will happen
all right so I think that that's good
enough I don't want to go too deep into
this console stuff here now you do have
some settings here you can choose to
show timestamps with your logs you can
choose to log any any Ajax requests
preserve the log select collected
context only you can hide Network's
messages user messages only which will
only show messages from console API
methods so you do have some settings
there but I think that's going to be it
for the console so let's move on to the
sources tab so in sources first thing
I'll show you is that you can actually
create snippets so if I go to snippets
here let me just remove this one but we
can go ahead and click new snippet and
you can name it let's call it log text
and what I'm gonna do is just have this
console log and we'll just say hello
world alright and then we can do ctrl s
to save we can also right-click and save
okay and then to run it we can just go
ahead and click run and now down here
you'll see the console draw pop-up and
it'll run hello world alright so you can
put whatever you want in these in these
little snippets it's just like a little
snippet manager the cool thing about
this sources tab is that we can actually
make it so that we can edit our code and
we can we can use it kind of as a text
editor so what I'm gonna do is make this
a little bigger
and we need to go to sources and we're
gonna just right click here now I mean
if we go over here and we click
index.html we can see the source code
here but we can't change it and save it
and stuff like that so what we'll do is
we're gonna add a workspace so we see
add folder to workspace and then what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select the
folder that this this HTML file is in
which is going to be in my sandbox
I believe sandbox and then DT sandbox
alright and then it's gonna come up with
a pop-up that says dev tools requests
full access to DT sandbox we're going to
go ahead and allow it and now we have it
in here and we can actually edit stuff
so if we go ahead and change let's
change the h1 we'll say dev tools
playground and we'll do a control s and
you'll see that it'll say it'll change
here and then if I reload it stays
changed and if we go over to our file
and V s code and that's actually just I
guess having it open let me see can I
reload this let's just close it and say
don't save and then we'll reopen it and
it's dev tools playground alright so we
can now use this as our text editor now
we can add files so let's say a new file
and let's call this let's see I haven't
done this too much but let's see how I
named this rename we'll call it style
dot CSS and we'll just put in here body
let's say background
we'll do a light-gray and save will
close that up we'll go over here and
we'll add it okay save it and there we
go now we get a dark background and you
can see it actually updated over here we
now have our link to our stylesheet it
also created it over here alright so now
let's move on to the network tab all
right now the network tab if I go ahead
and reload this is going to basically
show us all the files that are loading
in this URL so we have our index.html
file we have our style dot CSS and it's
basically telling us that the index.html
gives us the size it gives us the time
that it takes to load and then it gives
us this little graph here as well and
then we can filter the types the types
of resources so let's say we only want
to look at CSS it'll show us the style
dot CSS if we want to look at Doc's
which is you know HTML files it'll show
us that we can also see any xhr requests
or Ajax requests which I'm going to show
you in a second
now this ws right here this is the
WebSocket and what this pertains to is
the live server that I'm using okay so
that's why we see this ws here the live
server is what enables us to have this
auto load and stuff all right and if we
click call of course we can see
everything and if we select each one we
can see the headers gives us the request
method so get requests the status the
address all that stuff the headers if we
click on preview we can see the actual
content same with response cookies I do
actually have a cookie in there but
that's from something else and timing so
shows us the timing that's the time it
took to load and stuff like that all
right now what I want to do is I want to
an ajax request to our script over here
so i'm gonna put in a button right here
and we're gonna say get users and i'm
gonna just grab well first of all i'm
gonna add an event listener so i'm gonna
go down here and i'm just gonna say
document dot get it will just say query
selector we want to select the button
and let's say we want some query
selector button and we want to add an
event listener we want to listen for a
click and then we want to call a
function called get users make sure we
don't need that alright so then we'll
create a function call to get users and
then what this is gonna do is it's gonna
fetch data it's gonna fetch the github
users and this is from my ajax crash
course so i'm gonna paste this in and
it's basically just a regular vanilla
JavaScript xhr request to api dot
github.com slash users and we're just
checking to see if the status is equal
to 200 everything's okay now i don't
care about the output so i'm actually
going to get rid of i'm gonna get rid of
all this actually i didn't even need to
paste that and but we'll just say
console dot log users returned all right
so let's go over here and let's first of
all go on the console and click and we
get users returned now if we go back to
network and reload you'll see we still
would just have our index and style and
our WebSocket and then if I click the
button all of a sudden we see users this
is the the Ajax request if we look at
type it says xhr and if we filter by xhr
we'll see the users file here or the
users request and it gave back a status
of 200 and if we click on this and bring
this up you can see that it was a get
request and we can look down here gives
us the request headers and now if we
look at the response it'll actually show
us what it gives us so making a request
to that URL right there gives us the
first 100 users of github and you can
see it gives us the username the ID the
avatar URL gives us a bunch of other
URLs like the followers the gist's the
repos that the user has so that shows us
the response alright same thing with
preview just shows us in a different way
ok and we can do whatever we want with
this data that's brought in but the
point of me doing this is to just show
you that any Ajax requests that are made
are going to get added to this network
tab and we can we can view those
requests ok this xhr here this stands
for XML HTTP request which is part of
the browser that allows us to make
asynchronous Ajax calls or I should say
asynchronous JavaScript calls or Ajax
calls same thing now notice the load
time here 16 milliseconds if I reload it
it'll change you know a little bit from
time to time but let's go ahead and
let's um let's uncomment our little loop
here this console time loop thing just
because I want to run that loop and
let's save and now when we reload you'll
see that it's 123 milliseconds because
this loop took up some time
because we're taking our log
to the console let's change this to
let's say 20,000 and save and now let's
look at the network time and now we get
one point oh eight seconds all right and
you can see up here that the graph is
much different it's now up you know in
between 1000 and 1200 if I bring this
back down to 2000 and save now we're
down to you know just above 150
milliseconds okay and the more code you
have the more files you have the longer
it's gonna add to your load time so
let's take a look at the bootstrap theme
that we used in the first part all right
so if we go ahead and we open up close
that up and we reload the the network
you'll see that this took not bad it
took 189 milliseconds to load on content
loaded took 51 milliseconds so a lot of
this stuff was added from like images so
when you have large images that that
really slows your site down it loaded
all the CSS files all the JavaScript so
we have the bootstrap JavaScript popper
and jQuery which are dependencies of
JavaScript so it has to load a test to
take all this stuff into account when
loading your site alright so when your
you if you have an image heavy site it's
good to compress your images or resize
them and optimize them before you know
before uploading them to your website
but I think that's it that's all I want
to do for the network tab now we're
going to move on to the application tab
alright so the application tab is what's
gonna show us we can we can look at
what's in our browser storage and
there's multiple ways to store data
inside of a browser okay so we have
local storage
now I've cleared everything out you can
actually completely clear everything
from this tab here you can clear your
site data but we can look at local
storage session storage index TV and web
SQL are basically like client-side in
browser databases
and then we have our cookies we also
have cash storage application cash so
what I'm gonna do is we're gonna go over
to our file here into our script tags
and gonna add a local storage value okay
through JavaScript and html5 so to do
that we can say local storage and to set
an item we can say set item and let's go
ahead and set let's say name and we're
gonna set that to John and save and now
if we reload our application and we look
under local storage and we click on our
local host you'll see that now we have a
key of name and a value of John alright
and we can get this from our JavaScript
really easily too by just saying local
storage dot get item and we want to get
name so what we'll do is we'll just
console.log that and save and if we open
up our console over here down at the
bottom you'll see we get John alright
now the difference between local storage
and session storage is that local
storage will stay on in your browser
it'll stay on your machine until it's
cleared okay and I can clear it from the
JavaScript or you can clear it from here
so to clear it from JavaScript we can
say whoops we could say local storage
dot and then we can say clear and we'll
pass in here name alright so now if I
save that reload you'll see that it
disappeared it was set but then it was
cleared so we can do it that way if I go
ahead and I comment this out and run it
then it gets set again but we can go
over here and we can refresh if we want
and we can also get rid of it all right
so local storage will stay until that
happens now session Storage has the same
API the same syntax really except that
it goes away when your browsers closed
or when your session ends so what I'll
do here is I'll say session
storage and it has the same method so
set item and let's set I don't know
we'll set car and we'll set that to
let's say BMW and we'll save and John
got added again because we still have
this line here but if we look at session
corage session storage we now have this
car BMW alright and you can clear it out
and you can you know fetch the session
storage the same way it's basically the
exact same API it's just that it'll go
away when the browser is closed and when
the session ends alright now we can also
track cookies so if we go down here well
let's go ahead and create a cookie to do
that we can say document dot cookie and
we'll set that equal to let's say
username username equals John Doe and
save and now you can see that a cookies
been added if I just make this a little
bigger so cookies been added for this
domain that's the value of it this is
the name it doesn't have a max it
doesn't expire so it expires when the
session ends you can expand ago through
that I don't want this to be a tutorial
on cookies I'm just trying to show you
that you can track and you can see your
cookies from this from this domain here
alright and of course you can go ahead
and you can clear these out what you can
go one by one like that or you can just
go to clear storage and select what you
want cleared and then just go ahead and
clear everything and you'll see that
everything is gone alright so that's how
you can manage your your browser storage
I'm not gonna go over like indexeddb and
web SQL those are different technologies
that I don't want to get into but just
know that you can see that stuff from
here as well alright now I want to take
a look at the audits tab so this will
allow us to perform an audit that will
basically give us some
readings on our website about the
performance it'll give us some
suggestions to make it perform better
things like that
now you also need to take into account
the server that you're on so what I've
done is I've uploaded this mizuki
template to a domain called code skelet
comm which is being hosted at I think
it's Hostgator I thinks it's a it's a
shared hosting account so that may have
an effect on it but let's go ahead and
just perform an audit so we're gonna
open up two chrome tools and go to
audits and click perform audit and I'm
gonna choose all of these except for the
progressive web app and click run on it
all right and this may take a few
minutes so I'm gonna go ahead and pause
the video until this is done alright so
we get the results back for this this
website uploaded at code skillet com so
we got 88 per performance performance
which isn't bad accessibility was 86
best practices 77 and I can tell you
that a lot of this performance and best
practices is going to come from the
images because the images were not
optimized or compressed or anything like
that
so let's go down here this will tell us
about PageSpeed the first meaningful
paint was 2.2 seconds or 2000 to 40
milliseconds and what this means is
first meaningful paint measures when the
primary content of a page is visible
alright the first interactive was 4.1
seconds this is the first point at which
necessary scripts of the page have
loaded and the CPU is idle enough to
handle most user input so this is like
when the site is completely ready this
is when it's basically loaded enough for
the the you know the user to view the
whole page which isn't too bad now
opportunities you'll see serve images as
web P so basically this is telling us to
compress our images with lossy or
lossless prop properly sized images you
have optimized images so you can see
that this all has to do with these
images because these are really high
quality images and we have a potential
savings over here of 68 percent 73
% so that's what most of this this
lacking performance is and it's still
not bad 3 past audits which reduce
rendering block scripts we avoid
excessive Dom sighs okay so our Dom size
isn't too big user timing marks and
measures zero its accessibility now I
didn't use a lot of area attributes in
the course that we built this theme
because I didn't want to add more time
een it was a nine-hour course and I
wanted to focus on classes and stuff so
we didn't really focus on adding
accessibility options let's color set
color contrast is satisfactory six past
audits elements used attributes
correctly the area attributes that we
did use do follow best practices
elements describe contents well elements
are well-structured page specifies valid
language meta tags are used properly ok
so best practices we had three failed
audits does not use HTTPS obviously
that's that's fine does not use HTTP two
for all of its resources manifest short
name will be truncated when displayed on
home screen
let's see past audits so we avoid
application cache avoids web SQL DB web
SQL is is deprecated so that's not a
good thing you don't want to be using
that passive listeners avoids mutation
events in its own scripts avoids
document dot right you should never use
document dot write opens external
anchors using the rel no opener avoids
requesting geolocation permission avoids
deprecated API s allows users to paste
into password fields all right so all of
those are checked off so all in all I
think this is a pretty good audit except
for the images the images should be
compressed and optimized all right so
that's what I get from this but again
this is a pretty cool tool if you want
to go
you know your websites or your
applications and run audits and stuff I
would encourage you to do that all right
but I think that's going to be about it
if we go to security it's going to tell
us this page is not secure just because
we don't use it I don't have an SSL
certificate on this domain if we did
then it would say it's secure all right
so I think that's it guys I'm gonna go
ahead and stop the video here hopefully
you liked it if you did leave a like
