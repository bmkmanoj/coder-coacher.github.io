to be a new series of videos on building
a mean stack application now many of you
have probably seen my mean app from
scratch video and that's all well and
good but I created that a while ago and
there's some things that I don't like
one is that I never showed you guys how
to actually bundle a client and server
together we had the client on one port
and the server on another also we used a
remote database from M lab I want to
show you how to use a local database we
also used Mongo js4 our mapper to
MongoDB and I want to use Mongoose
because it I think it's more powerful
and customizable and more popular so
those are just a few of the things that
I want to change in a series also I want
this to be an application that we can
continue to use for other tutorials in
almost all applications you want some
kind of authentication so that's what
we're going to start with okay so we're
going to build a back-end Express server
and an API to let users register log in
and get a JSON web token when they
authenticate and once they're
authenticated they'll be able to log in
and see the dashboard the profile area
and then any other routes that we want
to protect with authentication all right
I'm going to go over the different
technologies that we'll be using and
also the steps so like I said I want
this to be something you guys can use in
future projects I want you guys to be
able to fork it and then have it be kind
of a baseline for what you want to do
whether it's a blog or e-commerce um any
kind of application that you need to
have an initial authentication for all
right so we'll be taking a lot of the
functionality from my nodejs passport
login series to get three videos and I
get mostly great feedback for that but
some people have said that I don't
explain things good enough in that
series so I'm going to really try and
break down pretty much every bit of code
that we write now in order to do that
it's going to take a little longer so
that's why I wanted to break this up
into a series I don't like to make
really
that are longer than an hour alright so
I don't know how many videos this will
be I'm just kind of you know playing it
by ear
alright so before we begin I just want
to say that I really enjoy being able to
make these videos for you guys for free
and there are a few ways that you can
help me to continue to do that so one is
donate you can donate through YouTube
through PayPal and obviously anything is
appreciated even the dollar is greatly
appreciated
another is to purchase one of my courses
from edge wanax we have courses with ten
and twelve projects all on all types of
technologies and a lot of the times
they're under 30 bucks so they're very
affordable you know and if you can't
afford anything right now that's
absolutely fine just if you can
subscribe and and leave some likes and
follow me on social media every little
bit helps for me to be able to continue
to do this all right so enough with the
begging let's move on to what's included
in this series nothing no I'm just
kidding so we're going to be building a
REST API using nodejs and Express and
Mongo send Passport so we're going to
create some end points for registration
and adding users to the database
authentication getting users profile
data and so on all right now I have a
few videos on how to build a restful api
but we're also going to be adding
authentication using passport and JWT
which stands for of JSON web tokens so
we'll be able to specify which routes
and endpoints the user will need a token
for if they don't provide the token then
they won't be authorized to use that
endpoint we're going to use passport -
Passport as well as a module called JSON
web tokens to generate the token
okay we'll also be enabling cores which
is cross-origin resource sharing and we
need to do this because during our
development our back-end server and our
front-end angular app will be on
different ports so in order to make
requests from the front-end we need to
enable this
there'll be a module we can use for this
all we have to do is include it and then
add a line of middleware and we should
be all set to make requests will also be
using Mongoose for our object document
mapper I believe that's what that stands
for and Mongoose we can make our models
we're going to have a user model which
will have a simple schema with a name a
user name email and password and we can
always add more fields later on so that
will be our back-end on the front-end
we're going to use angular 2 and we're
also going to be using the angular
command-line interface now I used to
build angular 2 apps with the quick
start package in fact my angular and
60-minutes video we used a quick start
package but the CLI is fully stable and
if I now don't use any other two without
it it's powerful enough to generate your
components and generate services and
stuff like that but not so much where
you don't even know what's going on
under the hood like many generators
another reason we're using is because
you can just type ng build and it will
compile everything in your front-end
application from source into a dist
folder and what we're going to do is
we're going to have it compile right
into our Express public folder so this
will allow us to run the client and the
server
both on one port alright we'll be doing
that at the very end though our
development will be in the source folder
alright so what else we have the we're
going to be using the angular router or
the HTTP module all that stuff that the
you know that you use in an angular 2
app we're also going to be using a
module called angular 2 JWT and this is
what we're going to use to to handle the
tokens the authentication tokens so what
we're going to do is we're going to
fetch it fetch the token from the server
and then we'll store it in local storage
and then this jw2 module can be used to
check that token make sure it's valid
make sure it hasn't expired yet alright
now for for authentication as far as
routes we're going to create and off
a shin guard and we'll be able to for
instance the dashboard we'll be able to
say that this what the user needs to be
logged in to see this page all right
we're also going to use an angular flash
message module so that for instance when
we log out we want a message to pop up
saying we're now logged out and we can
actually set that to go away after a set
amount of seconds set amount of time and
then we're also going to deploy this
application at the very end I'm not
exactly sure where yet probably digital
ocean or Heroku I'm not exactly sure yet
but this is what's included in this
series all right so now what we're going
to do is we're going to jump into the
demo and take a look at what we'll be
building all right so this is the
application that we're going to be
building now on the surface it's really
simple as far as functionality goes we
could get the same functionality pretty
easily using other technology but the
way that we're going to build this is
going to teach you so much about how the
mean stack works and it's basically from
scratch what is from scratch we're not
using any mean dot IO or mean dot jsj
narator x' or anything like that it's
going to be completely custom so let's
take a look we have the home page which
is basically just some information you
see we're using Twitter bootstrap we're
actually using boots watch which is a
customized version of boot bootstrap so
up here we have register and login links
if we go to register if we try to
register without filling in all the
fields we're going to get an error did
some basic validation you see how the
message disappeared we're using angular
to flash messages for that so if we go
ahead and let's try to create you'll say
Barry Johnson and use your name will
stay Barry if we try to put an email
that's not formatted correctly we should
also get an error
okay so let's change that to say Barry
at Gmail and submit and now you're
registered you may log in okay that then
disappears and we can go and login
so that brings us to the dashboard which
I'm not sure what we're going to do here
yet you know like I said this is kind of
a a base application I will move on
after we finish everything here and
maybe we'll do a blog or maybe even like
a social network or something I'm not
exactly sure but we'll have something
here and then up here you can see we
have this welcome and then your name we
click that that's just the profile with
the different fields we have and we can
still go to the home page and that's
pretty much it now if we go ahead and
log out it'll take us back to login and
then if we try to go to dashboard you'll
see it just brings us right back to the
login also the profile page is also
protected all right now let's take a
look at the file structure so initially
I called it social mean I'm not sure
what I'm going to call it yet probably
just mean off out and then everything
here except for the angular - source is
our back-end okay so our Express server
we have our app.js file our routes our
mongoose models we just have a user
model our config where we set up
passport and then just basic config and
then here the angular - source this is
our entire angular app ok so this is
created with angular CLI and then in the
source folder we have our app folder
which has components you can see the
different components we have dashboard
home login navbar profile and register
and then we have guards we have our off
guard which is going to basically allow
us to disable the dashboard and profile
pages for people that aren't logged in
and then we can attach that to whatever
routes we want and then services we have
our authentication service which makes
all the requests to our back-end API and
then we also have a validate service for
you know simple form validation ok so
right now we have our angular app
running on port 4200 using ng serve with
the CLI tool you can see I have it
in here and then our back end is on port
3000 our Express server which is also
running now I want to show you how easy
it's going to be to compile so I'm going
to stop the angular app and then what
we'll do is we're going to say ng build
and that's going to build out our
angular app to our public folder if we
open this up now you can see we have a
public folder with just our Java Script
map files in an index.html so now if we
go to our server port 3000 there it is
okay so we have the same functionality
we can go ahead and log in with Barry we
can visit profile page and we can log
out okay so this is a much better way to
build and have our work flow then with
my other
mene mene from scratch video this is
more of a realistic way of doing things
to actually compile it into the public
folder and then like I said we will also
go ahead and deploy it at some point
probably on digitalocean
or maybe Heroku alright so that's it for
the introduction as far as uploading I'm
going to try to get it get each video
out as fast as possible there will be
one I'm going to do the next one right
after this I'm not sure if I'll have it
on the same day or not it's not probably
the day after this one is uploaded I'm
going to try and get this out pretty
quick probably will probably have all
this done within the next week or so
yeah you know I don't like to wait a
week between each video I hate when
other youtubers do that on any videos
that I watch so hopefully you guys will
enjoy this this little project it's
probably going to be one of the bigger
projects that I've done on my channel
especially we're going to be adding to
this as well so that's it thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
