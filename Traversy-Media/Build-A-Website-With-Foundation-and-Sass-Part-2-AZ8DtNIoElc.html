building a website with Foundation and
SAS so in the first video we went ahead
and set up our environment we've set up
foundation CLI and we created the top
half of the home page well I guess it's
kind of half week but it's the top nav
the top bar and the showcase so now
we're going to move along and the next
part is going to be the domain search
bar so let's go to our HTML and go under
the showcase section and we're going to
put here a new section and let's give it
a class of domain search well I keep
doing that I keep ending a section with
a div okay so in here we're going to
again use the grid system I'm going to
create a row okay and this time it's
going to be a twelve column div so it's
going to be all the way across so we'll
stay large 12 medium 12 columns okay and
then here we're going to put a form and
let's give it a class of domain form
okay and then inside the form we're
going to put an input group actually let
me just show you the documentation for
foundation so see if we go to forms
basically what we want is an inline form
so this right here and you can see it's
an input group so I'll actually just
copy this okay so we have our input
group the input label right here we'll
say find a domain and then the input is
not going to be a number it's going to
be text ok and then let's put a
placeholder and we're going to let the
user know what TLD they can use double
space search for dot-com dotnet dot org
and then we have our submit button
that's fine so let's save that and let's
go and see what it looks like ok so
that's what it's going to look like by
default so let's go add to CSS so in
custom go down to the bottom make sure
you're outside of everything else and
I'm going to paste this in so we have a
domain search class background is going
to be light gray we're going to add a
bunch of padding we're going to add a
border bottom margin bottom and then the
domain form the input group label and
the input itself
I want the border to be a light gray we
can actually change that to light gray
okay so let's save that and reload or
maybe this should be medium gray that
doesn't look right yeah we'll just keep
it like that that's fine or medium light
gray actually I think that's actually
why I added that class yeah there we go
alright so that's the domain search area
next we need the package boxes so let's
go back to
here and this is going to use the tabs
from foundation okay so go back to
index.html under the domain search and
we're going to add a section give it a
class of home packages I'm also going to
give it a class of role because I want
everything constrained inside ok so
inside here let's do a div class columns
and say large 12 medium 12 which will go
across the whole element and inside
there we're going to put in h2 give it a
class of text center because I want it
to be Center that's a foundation class
and that's going to say hosting packages
for everyone all right now let's go
ahead and just paste some of this in so
we'll have a power graph with the class
of lead which is also a foundation class
and text center and we'll put that in
there then a line break and then we're
going to put the first part of the tabs
which is the UL so EUL with the class of
tabs you also want this data tabs
attribute and then an ID I set to
package tabs and then each tab will have
an Li now the shared hosting is going to
be the default so that's why we have the
is active class okay so you only want
that on the one you want has default so
we have shared hosting cloud VPS and
dedicated servers and they should all
have their own ID okay or that href
should go to that ID so now under the UL
we're going to put our tabs content
okay and then we're going to do our
panels so div class and this is going to
be tab
dash panel and let's say this is going
to be the active so is active and we're
going to give this the ID of shared okay
now we gave it shared because that's
what we want this one to go to this tab
should go to this area so in here for
now I'm just going to say shared okay
and then let's copy this paste in two
more this one's going to be VPS and we
don't want the exact --iv and then this
one's going to be dedicated okay we
don't want active let's save that and
let's see what we get
all right so that's what we get and you
can see our tabs which are not working
for some reason now let's take a look at
documentation so let's see tabs so we
have the UL we have the href going to
the ID which down here tabs panel ID
equals panel 1 what am I missing
ABB's content oh that's right he had
data tabs content should be here and we
want to set that to package tabs okay
let's try that
there we go so now our tabs are working
so now in each one we want to put three
we want to put three four column dibs
because if we look at this we have these
are each four columns okay it's going to
be quite a bit of markup because you
have to do it from each tab so let's go
to the first one which is shared and
this is way too much to type so I'm
going to paste this in okay and it's
quite a bit but basically what we're
doing is we create a row we're going to
have disc last columns Lodge for medium
for we're going to have three of these
so this one ends here and then we have
another one which ends here and then we
have another one okay and each one is
going to have a div with the class of
color which is a foundation class which
gives it a border and some padding and
then each one will have this class pea
box and then whatever it is this once P
box 2/3 the first one is one ok so you
want to include that and then in h3 with
the title a paragraph the icon which is
going to be the database icon the UL
which will have the different features
the UL has a class of features menu and
vertical ok vertical and menu our
foundation classes which get rid of the
bullets things like that and then we
just have the list items ok under that
we have a div with the class of pricing
has a span around the money this is
actually the same as format as we had up
above and then we have the button now
the only difference between each package
box is the button class is it is it yeah
see how this button here it has the
class of button large and expanded the
second package has button Lodge expanded
and secondary because it's a green
button and then the third one has button
Lodge expanded extra now we haven't
added the extra yet so let's go to
settings and what we're going to do
is we're going to add another variable
here called extra and let me just grab
the value of it okay so it's going to be
this color here which is an orange color
and we're also going to add it in here
you can go ahead and add to the pallet
set that to extra all right so let's
save that and then the rest of the
changes the rest of the stuff for
instance the color of the icon the color
of the price is going to come from the
CSS we have to do that okay but as far
as the markup and foundation the only
difference is in the button I believe
okay so let's see I think if we should
do the rest of EPS and dedicated or the
CSS
let's just let's let's add the rest of
the markup so in the VPS dedicated it's
going to be pretty much the same we're
just going to change titles and stuff so
we want to grab the whole row so right
in under the tabs panel the div with the
class of row with ends down here so
we're going to grab that and copy and
then we're going to paste that in here
so for this we'll just change up
see we're get change
okay so we'll change simple shade to PPS
I mean simple VPS okay we'll change the
pricing see what did I have that has
2949 79 okay so we get that and this
will be standard VPS my college eyes if
you can hear my son crying upstairs
so this is what 49 enter VPS is 49 and
then super VPS is 79 all right and then
we're going to paste the same thing I'm
going to paste all that those three
packages and the dedicated as well and
then we'll change this to simple
dedicated and the price for that is 99
so and then we'll have standard
dedicated which is what 129 and then
super dedicated which will be 199 all
right so let's save that and we'll go
back to our site and reload and it
should look like this okay so the
layouts there it's just a styling that's
not so now we'll go to our custom CSS
and go down to the bottom now this first
part of the paste in has to do with all
the package boxes so you can see we have
P blocks one two and three and
everything in here is nested so we want
to align everything to the center the
font I'm sorry about the font the icon
from font awesome we're going to set the
size to 80 pixels all right and then in
the features which is the list in the
list here we're going to set some margin
and the list item we're going to set
padding on the top and bottom and a
border on the bottom so let's save that
and reload it should look like that now
we want the corners rounded and we also
want a background so if we go to
settings there's actually some stuff we
can do with call-outs and remember I
have the call up class so it's the
this is all an alphabetical one or so
right here you can see we have all of
our call-out stuff so background we're
going to set that to light gray instead
of white and then the call-out
background fade we're going to set to
zero and so let's see the call-out
radius I'm going to change from global
radius to 10 pixels save that and reload
and there we go so let's continue with
the custom CSS now we're going to do
each individual one so right under this
let's go ahead and paste in the P box 1
CSS so T locks one the icon is going to
be a different color it's going to be
blue the primary color and then pricing
span we're going to say font size 35
font-weight:bold and the color will be
primary so let's save that ok there we
go now the icon still it's not showing
because we don't have fun awesome we'll
do that right after we finish these so
let's paste in the other
PBOT styles so let me just grab them
okay so we have P box one basically the
same as this except we're using
secondary for our colors and then this
one we're using extra so let's save that
and load and there we go
okay and you can see it works for all of
our packages so now we'll do the font
awesome now we're going to use NPM
I'm sorry not NPM Bower to install it so
we're going to go to our command line
okay right now we're running foundation
watch let's go ahead and stop that and
we're going to install Bower so Bower is
a front end package manager if you don't
have it then you want to install it with
NPM so I'm going to say NPM install -
g-power
that will install it globally so that
you can run the Bower command from
anywhere okay once that's done we're
going to go ahead and use Bower and
we're going to say install Bower install
and we want font awesome status okay and
now if we look in our Bower components
folder you see we have fun awesome sass
now we need to import the main staff
into our app dot F CSS file so let's
open that up we're going to go to the
bottom right above the custom and we're
going to say import and then we need to
pass so the path is going to be dot dot
slash because we want to go outside of
the S CSS and then into the Bower
components so Bower underscore
components slash font awesome staff
slash assets slash style sheets /
ok and that's that's where it's located
if we look in font awesome sass assets
style sheets and this is the one we're
importing right here which imports all
the
the partials all right so let's go ahead
and let's put a semicolon and let's save
and then it's still not going to work if
we reload I hope we need to compile so
we need to run Foundation watch okay so
if we reload you can see that there are
these boxes here for our icons but the
icons aren't showing that's because we
need to move the fonts folder which is
in bower components font awesome assets
fonts we want to just copy this whole
folder and we want to put it right
inside of our template
okay so we'll paste it right here fonts
and now if we reload there they are and
you can see we have our fonts up here
now and right here okay so now we can
use font awesome wherever we want to so
now we have the packages done let's move
along so if we open up the finished one
what text on it you can see now we're
going to do these areas which are pretty
easy okay so we'll do this one how are
we different with the picture of the
server so let's go to index.html and go
down here and I'm just going to paste
this in so it's a section I gave it the
class of section a okay then we have a
row with two six column divs in this
column we have the server dot PNG file
in this column we have an H to power
graph with some dummy text and then a
link a read more linked with the class
of button large and Hollow
okay Hollow gives it that empty empty
background with the border so let's save
that and reload okay so that's what it
looks like with no CSS now let's go to
our custom CSS file
and I'm going to put that in here so
very simple
basically we just do a margin top we're
adding padding of 50 pixels to the top
and bottom and the background is going
to be light gray so let's save that and
there we go okay pretty easy now under
that we're going to have our section B
which is very very short so let's paste
that in we just have a class of section
B with an h1 and a paragraph save and
then we'll go to our custom at CSS and
let's go ahead and paste that in okay so
we have a background of dark gray color
of white which I'll change that to the
variable and padding same as section a
and then text lines align Center
okay let's reload and there we go okay
next we have section C so let me grab
that this one's a little longer so
section with the class of section C
we're using the grid system we're using
four three column divs okay and then
each one we have an icon you can see
we're using the shield icon ham and h4
and a power graph okay so let's save
that and we'll look at it without the
CSS okay you can see the icon is very
very small so we're going to go into
custom CSS SC sss-sorry and paste this
in so section C background is going to
be primary blue color is going to be
white padding 50 we're going to line
everything to the center and then the
icons we want those to be 90 pixels so
let's save that okay so that's what it
looks like now and then the last thing
on this page we have is the footer so
let's go under Section C and let me just
grab the footer
and we'll copy that paste it in
okay so footer we're using the grid
system again and we're using four three
column dibs
okay the first one we have a little
paragraph with the copyright then we
just have some dummy text and then the
second the second and the third are just
menus you can see we have the h5 and
then the UL with the class of menu and
vertical those are foundation classes
and then the fourth one we have that
image of the trustee Steil okay let's
save that
reload okay so we're going to add a
little bit of CSS so in our custom CSS
file actually all we're doing here is
adding some padding so let's see we'll
just a flutter and let's say padding 40
pixels top and bottom zero on the side
save that and there we go okay there's
our footer so our homepage is now
complete so now we're going to add the
three easy pages here this is hosting
VPS dedicated shared so let's create
those pages so we'll say new file shared
HTML and new file VPS dot HTML new file
dedicated dot HTML and basically what
we're going to do here is copy the
entire index page let's go to shared and
paste that in and we'll change I'll
start at the top let's just add to the
title type character and then shared
hosting alright and we're going to keep
all this stuff now on the top bar here
you can see we have current on the home
link we're going to just cut that off
and put that on the shared link looks
okay now we're not going to need to
showcase so we're going to completely
get rid of that whole section the domain
search we are going to keep so we'll
leave that this home packages we're
going to get rid of this whole thing
so this is a big one so I'm going to
highlight the top section and actually
it's the only section so we'll just go
down till we see the ending tag just
right here get rid of that and then
we're going to get rid of section a
we're not going to use that on the inner
pages but we are going to use B and C
and the footer so we're going to leave
all those so let's save that then we'll
go to shared okay so it should look like
this now we just need our main part in
the middle here which is going to be
right below domain search so I'm going
to paste this in so basically we have a
section I'm giving it a class of row and
a class of a boat and then it's going to
be 12 columns wide so it's going to take
up the whole space then we have an h2
shared hosting paragraph with lead and
text center shared packages then we have
a line break a horizontal rule and
another line break so let's save that
okay now what we want to do is just grab
the shared packages from the index file
so let's go up to city one want the
shared packages which right here okay
we're going to grab this whole row which
ends right here so we'll copy that and
we're going to paste that in right here
save it
preload and good so that's our shared
hosting page now let's copy the shared
hosting or shared HTML and we'll paste
it in VPS to HTML okay and then we're
just going to change some stuff up here
so the title will say VPS and the
current we're going to remove from the
shared and we're going to put it on the
VPS
all right and then down here let's
change this to VPS and this okay and
then we're going to change simple VPS
change the price I think it was 29
same thing here standard and say 49 I
think and then this one was what 79 and
this will be super VPS
okay so let's save that and now click on
VPS and there we go okay last thing is
the device it's a dedicated servers page
so I'm going to copy everything in VPS
or shared it doesn't really matter
and then we'll paste that in and we're
going to do the same stuff sorry about
that
crying dedicated I'm going to change the
current class we're going to put that on
dedicated okay and then we'll just
change this stuff mimosa's my mouse is
running out of batteries alright so 99
and then this will be standard dedicated
okay change that to with 129 I think and
then super dedicated will be 199 okay
we'll save that reload and go to
dedicated and now we have our three
service pages alright so in the next
video we're going to get to the about
page the support or contact page and
we're also going to create the client
login modal alright so I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
