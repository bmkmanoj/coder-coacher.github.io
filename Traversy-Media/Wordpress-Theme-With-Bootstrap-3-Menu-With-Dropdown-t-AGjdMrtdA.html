you how to implement a menu in our
bootstrap WordPress theme
alright so it's going to work a little
different than what you would do for
just a regular bootstrap theme I'm sorry
a regular WordPress theme because we
want to be able to use the drop-down the
bootstrap drop down with our WordPress
themes so we're going to use something
called the WP bootstrap nav Walker ok
this is a class that we need to download
and just include in our theme so what
we'll do is you want to go to this page
and I'm going to just download the zip
ok we'll open that up and you should
have a folder like this and we just want
this file we want to bring it to our
theme folder so let's open that up ok
this is the theme folder and we're just
going to bring this over all right and
then what we're going to do is go into
our theme folder and create a new file
we're going to call this function G PHP
this is a very important file for any
wordpress theme because this is where
you can put all your dynamic
functionality ok so what we're going to
do is we first want to require that file
that we just put in ok so we're going to
say actually put a comment
ok so we'll say require once and we'll
pass in WP bootstrap
NAV Walker dot php' okay so that'll
bring it in now we're going to create a
function to add the add stuff for our
theme to support all right so let's say
theme support so oops
and want that okay so this will be a
function and I'm just going to call this
theme setup alright and let's go ahead
and add support for our nav menus Wow
what does it keep doing that okay so
we're going to say register underscore
nav underscore menus alright and that's
going to take in an array and we're just
going to have one menu and it's going to
be in the primary position all right and
then for the text it'll just say primary
menu alright and this double underscore
function this is just a localization
function for WordPress you want to wrap
that around any static text that you use
all right so that'll that's that now in
order for this theme setup function to
run we need to create an add action
function alright and what this does is
we can choose a hook to hook into and
run this alright and if you look at the
documentation there's a ton of different
hooks you can use that get fired off at
different times the one that we want is
called after setup theme alright and
then the second parameter is just going
to be the name of the function we want
to run which is theme setup and we
should actually prefix this we'll say WP
WPB underscore we'll use that as a
prefix
okay so we can save that now if we look
at the github page for the nav Walker
you'll see this right here this WP nav
menu function alright so we want to
include some extra stuff here okay
normally you wouldn't have stuff like
the Walker you would basically just have
the theme location classes things like
that but we're going to go ahead and
copy this and we want to go to our
header file where we have our menu now
the way this is set up is different than
a regular WordPress nav bar so it's
probably going to look a little
different in this particular theme I
didn't really realize that before I
started you can see we don't even have a
ul here and the code that we pasted in
is going to generate a ul so it might be
a little different but let's just go
ahead and replace everything inside of
this nav tag with what we just copied
okay and then we're going to save that
and go back and reload and now you can
see we have this add a menu because
there's no menu assigned to primary so
if we click that it's just going to take
us to the back end here so we want to go
to if we reload appearance and then
menus alright and then what we'll do is
we'll say main menu create menu and now
you should have an option for the
primary menu location so you want to
check that and let's go ahead and save
we'll go back and reload and now you can
see we have what looks like the only
thing that's really wrong is that the
color is blue so let's go ahead and
change that I'll go to our style sheet
and go down to the bottom here let me
see what do we have for a class okay so
blog nav
all right so we'll say blog nav a color
white okay oh good that worked out now
hopefully the let's do the hover as well
all right so I just want to check out if
the drop downs are going to work now in
our footer dot PHP we need to need to
correct this because right now it's
looking in the word strap root for a j/s
folder so we need to just make sure that
it looks in the template so we're going
to stay blog info template URL slash and
then j/s all right so let's save that
and what we're going to do is create a
couple pages so let's create a boat okay
and then let's create another one we'll
call this our team and what I want to do
is over here I want to choose about as a
parent all right now this isn't really
going to matter with the menu because we
can set parent and child items from
within the menu section but I'm just
going to do it anyways and then we'll
create another one called services and
then let's go to menus and we're going
to bring over about services and our
team and then what I want to do is put
services under about like this same
thing with our team and then we'll save
it and then let's go back to the
front-end and now we have a drop-down
perfect
that worked out good now if we go to one
of these pages it's not going to be any
different because we this is still all
static HTML all right but we know our
menu is now working alright so in the
next video we're going to go ahead and
start to work in this area and get our
get our post showing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
