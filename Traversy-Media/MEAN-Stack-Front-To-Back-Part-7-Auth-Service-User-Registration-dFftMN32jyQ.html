ahead and we created our home page
markup and the register form and we have
our validation as well okay you can see
that the validation works when we set up
flash messaging so now we want to do is
we want to hook up this register form to
the backend API so for that we're going
to need a service so we're going to go
to down to our terminal here and make
sure you're in the angular - source
folder and we're going to CB into source
slash app slash services and you should
already have your validate service there
we did that in the last video so we want
to do ng G service and off okay and that
will create inside services it will
create off dot service dot TS so let's
open that up okay and we'll just run our
serve again ng serve okay and then in
the off service we're going to go ahead
and bring in a couple things we want to
bring in the HTTP module so we'll say
import HTTP we're also going to bring in
the headers package and that's going to
be from angular slash HTTP okay we also
want to bring in the map operator
because we're working with observables
so let's say import rxjs slash add slash
operator splash map and then what we
want to do is need to import not import
but inject the HTTP module into the
constructor so we're going to say
private HTTP and set that to capital
HTTP
okay now we're going to have a couple
properties in this service so one is
going to be for the token so I'm going
to say auth token and just click set
that to the type of any and then the
user which I'll also set to the type of
any okay and then we're going to need a
function to register the user that's
going to take in the user object and
this is where we actually reach into our
back-end API and make that post request
to register okay so what we're going to
do is we need to lead to set a header
value so we're going to say let headers
and I'm going to put that two new
headers and we can do that because we
brought that in up here and what we
wanted to do is we want to add the
content type of Jason so we'll say
headers dot append this is how we can
add a value to the header and we want to
add the content type and we want to set
that to application slash Jason okay
because it's going to be chasing format
then we want to return an observable
with the response so let's say return
this dot HTTP and it's going to be a
post request so we want to do dot post
and then here we want the URL which is
going to be our back-end so HTTP
localhost 3000 slash users slash
register okay that's the endpoint and
then we want to pass along the user test
along the data and then for options we
want to send the header
okay so headers set that to headers now
this is an observable so let's get rid
of that semicolon then we need to do a
dot map and we want to map it to Jason
so we just need to do response and we'll
set that to res dot Jason
okay and that should do it so we should
now be able to subscribe to this
observable that is going to register the
user on the back end and then send back
the data which will be either success or
either success true or success false
along with a message okay and we can
actually look at let's take a look at
that on the back end so if we go to our
users row this is what we're doing
making the post requests to this
register okay it's going to take all of
our form fields put them into new user
and then it's going to run it through
our add user function which is in the
model if everything goes okay we'll get
oh I mean if we get an error we'll get
this if everything's okay we'll get that
so let's go ahead and make sure you save
your service and then we're going to go
back to the register component okay we
want to go under our validations here
and let's say register register user
okay so we need to bring in the auth
service so up here actually did we bring
it in app dot module yet I don't think
we did no we didn't so let's bring it
into here just like we did with the
validate service okay so we'll see auth
service set that to services pop dot
service and then we just need to put it
in the providers off sort of list
and we'll save that and then back to the
register component we'll bring it in
just like we did with validate so
that'll be off and then we need to
inject it into our constructor I'm
actually going to put these on multiple
lines so it doesn't look as messy all
right so it's a private auth service and
let's set that to off service okay we
need a comma right here so now we can
use that and we're going to go down to
here yeah make sure you're in the on
register submit still and then we want
to use the off service so we'll save
this dot off service and we want to call
registered user which is what we just
created in the service okay and that's
going to get passed in the user object
and since it's an observable we need to
subscribe to it and then inside here
we're going to get the data back set
that to a code block and then let's do C
so we want to test for the success
you'll say if theta dot success because
reberty's are going to be true or false
and then we'll have an alt here so if
the user gets registered this will run
if not this will run so let's send a
message I'm just going to copy this
okay because we want a message so we'll
just paste that in and let's change this
handle say you are now registered
registered how do I spell that and can
login and we want to change the alert
danger to alert success which will make
it green okay so let's put the message
and then we just want to redirect now to
redirect you to also bring in the router
so up top here let's bring in router
regular splash router okay and then
whoops with that okay so then we also
have to inject that as well so right
here let's say private router and set
that to router okay so now we should be
able to do this dot wrote navigate or
this what is this dot router dot
navigate okay we want to navigate to so
you're going to pass in brackets and
slash see
so they registered and we want to bring
them to the login and then I'm going to
copy this and else so if this runs that
means that something went wrong so
that's just what I'm going to say
something went wrong and change this
back to danger okay and then we're going
to navigate back to register all right
so let's save that and then hopefully we
can register user which will be pretty
cool so make sure see what's this
register user does not exist on type
office service why not I just your user
okay
oh so I must be not saved in or
something all right so let's go ahead
and reload and let's try this out so I'm
going to register myself use your own
Brad pass email for the fake email in
and password and submit awesome you are
now registered and can log-in okay now
we're not gonna be able to log in yet
because we haven't even created the form
but let's check and see if we're
actually registered so in my Mongo shell
I'm going to stay in the show DDS and
you can see we have a mean off so let's
say use mean off and we should have some
test users in that from when we were
testing it but I don't think I did Brad
so let's say DB dot users dot find dot
pretty
and there's the user right there Brad
and you can see the password is also
encrypted okay so our registration is
working now I know this was kind of a
short video but I am going to cut it
here because I want just that
registration functionality in this video
and the next one we're going to start to
create our login form and we will try to
authenticate up against the server and
get back an access token all right so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
