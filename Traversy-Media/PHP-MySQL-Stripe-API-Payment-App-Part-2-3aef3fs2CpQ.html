created a payment page for buying a
react course which of course you could
put any any product here and it goes
through and gets submitted to our charge
dot PHP which uses a stripe API it
creates a customer and then it charges
the customer and sends them to a success
page so now what I want to do is
implement a database and just more I
want to add more to our back-end I want
to add some models so that we can submit
the data we want to our own database and
then after that we'll move on to create
a couple pages where we can view the
transactions and so on in our own
application so first thing we're gonna
do here is create our database so I'm
using PHP myadmin so I'm gonna go to
local host PHP myadmin and this comes
with xampp if that's what you're using
if you want to use a different database
client or if you want to use your SQL
shell that's fine as well okay but I'm
doing it the easy way which is through a
GUI program so let's create a database
called pay page and we're gonna have two
tables first is going to be customers
and let's see as far as fields we want
five fields I believe okay so we're
gonna have an ID the ID is actually
going to be a varchar' this is going to
be the transact I'm sorry the customer
ID from stripe I'm gonna say 255 max and
let me make this a little bigger this is
going to be the primary key so I'm going
to choose primary but it's not going to
be auto increment so don't check the AI
and then the second field here is going
to be the first name first underscore
name which will be varchar' last name
email and let's also do a created at and
that's gonna be a date/time which is
right here a date/time and I'm gonna
choose a default of the current
timestamp so that'll get automatically
inserted so let's save that that's our
first table let's go back to our
database and create a new table called
transactions and this is gonna have
let's see it's gonna have quite a few
more fields it's gonna have seven and
it's gonna have an ID which will be a
varchar' 255 and this is also going to
be the primary key but not auto
increment because it's going to be the
actual transaction ID from stripe then
we're going to have the customer
underscore ID we're gonna have the
product which will be the product name
or the description we're gonna have the
amount that it costs I'm just doing
everything as varchar'
it's we're gonna have the currency we're
gonna have the status
and then we're gonna do a created at
which will be date/time and cut in
current timestamp as the default and
there's a lot of other stuff you saw the
response that we get back from stripe
there's a lot of other stuff you could
store but I don't want to go too crazy
here I think this is good enough so now
that we have our tables we want to start
to implement our models but before we do
that we need a way to access our
database okay so we're going to use PDO
and let's see let me just go to my gist
real quick I'm not gonna type out the
entire or is it so right here I'll have
the link in the description by the way
for this this is a class that implements
PDO which is PHP data objects it's a way
to it's the best way to connect to a
database through PHP in my opinion it's
better than using MySQL I or MySQL
improved basically we have a bunch of
properties here that's going to be your
host your user and database user pass or
a database name this stuff will all come
from a config file that we'll create and
then it has a database handler an error
property and a statement property
because PDO uses prepared statements and
if you know nothing about PDO I would
suggest watching my PDO crash course
that takes you from knowing nothing
about it to knowing all about prepared
statements and all that stuff okay so in
our constructor we're creating our DSN
which is just basically a connection
string some options that have to do with
persisting the error mode and all that
and then here we're creating a new new
PDO instance passing in our DSN the user
the pass or at all that so this is
what's connecting to our database using
PDO then we just have a simple query
function that will prepare a statement
we have our bind function that will bind
our values
and execute which will execute results
set that's if you want to fetch data and
you want to return an array or I'm sorry
yeah an array of objects single which
will return a single object row count
will count your rows and then if you
want the last inserted ID you can get
that as well but we're not even going to
be using these we're actually not going
to be using any of these functions here
all right just these ones but what what
I'll do is just grab all this okay and
if you took my my PHP MVC course on
udemy this is the exact same class so
you're probably familiar with it already
so what I'll do is create a folder
called Lib because it's basically what
this is is a library and I'm gonna
create a file called PDO underscore DB
dot PHP and then we're gonna paste that
in alright so we'll save that and then
this is what we're going to use in our
models to interact with our database now
we're gonna need a config file with all
of our database parameters so I'm going
to create another folder called config
and then in there I'll create a file
called DB dot PHP okay and inside here
let's see we're gonna actually going to
define some constants so these will be
our DB params so let's define a constant
of DB underscore host and our host of
course is gonna be localhost and then
let's we're gonna have four of these so
this one is going to be our DB user so
this is your database username I'm using
my root user then we have our DB Pass
so your password which mine is just one
through six and then you want your DB
name which I called pay page okay and
that's it so we'll save that so now our
database library's all set our
parameters are in a config file now we
just need to include those inside of our
charge dot PHP file alright so let's go
right under here and we'll say require
once and we want the config first so
config DB dot PHP and then we want our
Lib slash PDO underscore DB dot PHP okay
make sure you have the config first
because the database library needs to
read the parameters from the config file
alright so now that we did that we're
gonna create start to create our models
so let's say new folder call it models
and I'm gonna create a file called
customer dot PHP okay models should be
singular let's also create a file called
transaction dot PHP and I like to have
my models capitalized as well alright so
we'll start with the customer so we'll
have a class called customer
and we're gonna be using our PDO library
so I'm going to create a property a
private property called dB okay and then
we're gonna create our constructor so in
PHP to create a constructor you do
double underscore construct and a
constructor is just a function or method
that runs when you're calling your
objects your object is instantiated and
all we need all we want to do here is
instantiate our database so we're going
to take that DB property we can access
properties with this
so this DB we want to set it to new
database okay because database is the
name of the class our database class so
if we look at our PDL file you'll see we
have class database so all we're doing
is instantiated this class or this
object alright so let's go back to
customer and that's all we want to do in
our construct function so next thing we
want is a function to add add a customer
so we'll say public function add
customer and then this is gonna take in
some data okay and we're gonna do all
this in the charge dot PHP we're gonna
instantiate this class and then call
this add customer and pass what we need
in alright and what's going to be passed
in this data array this is gonna be an
array it's gonna have the ID the first
name the last name and the email so what
we want to do is then say this actually
let's put a comment here we'll say
prepare query so we're gonna save this
DB remember when we use this DB we can
access anything that's in this database
class so we want to call the query
method which is right here ok we want to
prepare our statement so let's say this
DB query and then all we have to do is
pass in our query which is going to be
insert
into customers the table customers and
then our fields we're going to insert
our ID first name last name and email
alright and then we want to say values
now the values we're going to bind we're
going to use named parameters here so we
want to do : ID : first name : last name
and : email all right so this is we're
binding our data here this is this is a
secure way to to work with your database
now up to this point it doesn't know
what we want to bind this there should
be no space here it doesn't know what we
want to bind so this is where we call
our database bind method which if we
look in our PDO file we have right here
so we want to call this and bind our
data so we're gonna go back and we're
gonna say bind values so we'll save this
DB bind and we want to bind to the ID :
ID which is our named parameter and we
want to bind from the data array the ID
field that's being passed in right here
okay we want to do the same for the
others so let's do four of these so in
addition to ID we're gonna have
first-name
oops and we're gonna have last name and
we're gonna have email alright so once
we bind it we want to execute it so
we're going to say if we're going to put
this in an if statement and say if this
DB okay remember we can access anything
in that DB and we want to access execute
so if this is executed then let's just
return true whoops
else let's return false and that's it
that should add it to our database now
of course we need to call this add
customer we need to call this from our
charge so after we do our striped charge
let's go down right here and this is
where we're gonna do it now since we're
using object-oriented program we were
using classes we need to instantiate the
customer object from that class so let's
say instantiate customer and before I do
that I actually need to bring in the
customer file the model so let's say
require once so we want models slash
customer
all right and let's go back down and
then we can simply do it's a customer
equals new customer like that and then
what we want to do is call the add
customer method so we can take that
customer object and we can call add
customer now we want to put in here
our customer data which we haven't
created yet so let's do that I'm
actually going to do that up here so
we'll say customer data so to be a
variable call customer data we'll set it
to an array and we're gonna have an ID
and we're gonna get that from the member
we get that charge object back and we
want to get the customer from that so
that's what we're going to use as the ID
and then the rest of the stuff like the
first name this is stuff that's coming
from our form it's not actually coming
back from the charged object so we can
just put in first-name like that and you
can put you can have any fields if you
wanted to have the address come in or
any other fields inside of our form here
you could put anything you want okay and
store it in your database you're not
limited to what comes back from your
charge object so it's a last name
and email okay so that's our customer
data we're instantiating the customer
object and then we're calling add
customer so that should do it as far as
just adding it adding the customer it's
not going to add the transaction yet we
haven't done that but let's test that
part out
okay so let's reload here we just double
check make sure you have your config
your database library and your model so
we'll go ahead and say I don't know
Sally Williams let's try it out okay so
that worked out now let's go to our
database let's go to our customers table
and there it is so for the ID we have
the ID that came back from the stripe
API and we have the rest of the fields
and of course like I said you could have
more if you wanted and if we look in our
dashboard and stripe and reload there it
is right here Sally's purchase okay so
it's going to both places
so now let's do our transactions now the
transaction is going to work pretty much
the same way it just has different
fields so what I'll do is copy our
customer model so everything we have
here inside customer PHP I'm going to go
into transaction PHP and paste it in and
then we're just going to change the
class name and then we want this stuff
because we want to access the database
library we're going to change this to
add
transaction we're gonna get some data
passed in and then let's change the
field so we will have an ID we can leave
that and then we're gonna have the
customer ID we're gonna have the product
the amount so this is just all the stuff
we added in the database currency and
status and then for the values we want
the same stuff but we want to use the
named parameters which just have the
colon in front so like that
and all we want status as well for some
reason when vs code the word status is
blue I think it's a reserved word or
something but it's not going to affect
anything okay now we just want to do the
binding so we want the ID then we want
the customer ID which will be passed in
lips okay next we want the products
and we want the amount whoops and we
also want two more which is going to be
the currency and we want the status like
that okay and then just run the execute
so let's save it let's go back to our
charge dot PHP and pretty much do the
same thing we did for the customer we
want to create the data so I'm going to
copy this this and this paste it in and
we're just going to change up this to
transaction data transaction data so
let's see for for the transaction ID
we don't want customer we want ID all
right and then this is going to be the
customer ID which comes from charge
customer
and then we have the the product which
comes from charge description okay but
in our database we're calling it product
and then we have our amount which will
come from charge amount we also have
status and what else oh I've got
currency which I'm going to put here
all right so that's our transaction data
now we want to instantiate the
transaction so instead of new customer
we want new transaction we'll change
that to transaction and we're gonna call
transaction add transaction and pass in
the transaction data so same thing it's
just different data okay and I don't
think we brought in the model did we
know we didn't so let's just add that
yep so we'll bring in that model and
then we should have access to all that
good so now when we make a payment it
should add it to both tables unless I
hopefully I didn't misspell anything I
went kind of fast but we'll check it out
but first thing I'm going to do is
delete the customer Sally and then I'm
also going to go to my dashboard and
just clear everything out so go to
business settings data and let's delete
all test data
okay and then we'll go to payments it
should be empty good so let's try this
again so we'll go to our home page or
pay page let's put in John Doe submit oh
ok so we're getting an error unknown
column customer ID in field list all
right let's check out now it did go into
customers but we had the error during
the transaction so let me look at the
structure here we have customer ID as a
field let's look at this let's see let's
go to our model our transaction model
let's see
so I D cus customer ID and we look at
that error again column not found
unknown column customer ID in the field
list stack trace charge 61
hmm ah right here we're trying to insert
into the customers database we want it
to go into transactions okay so what
I'll do is just delete from our
customers database the one we just added
John Doe I'll just leave it in stripe
but let's try this again and hopefully
it works so we'll use a different name
we'll say Tom Smith submit alright so
that went through so let's check our
database we'll look at our customers so
there's Tom Smith let's go to our
transactions and there it is so we have
our transaction ID our customer ID our
product our amount currency status is
succeeded and our created at and if we
go to our dashboard here we'll see the
John Doe that we did at first and then
we'll see the Tom the Tom at Gmail all
right guys so I'm gonna stop the video
here and in the next one we're gonna
create the pages so that we can see our
transactions and our customers in our
application so we don't actually have to
go to the you know PHP myadmin or or
search the our SQL shell or anything
like that to see what we have alright so
thanks guys and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
