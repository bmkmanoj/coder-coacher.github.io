video than usual it's something I've had
a lot of requests from people that are
just getting into web development or web
design and that's how to deploy a basic
website on the Internet so this in this
video we're going to talk a little bit
about the different types of hosting
we're going to explore a brand new
shared hosting account and the cPanel
interface we're gonna create an FTP
account upload a web site create email
accounts we'll create a sub domain we'll
look at some of the auto installers for
scripts like WordPress basically
everything you need to know to deploy a
basic web site to the Internet in the
easiest way possible
now I know that a lot of you guys are
professional developers and you build
web applications and you deploy to cert
cloud services like AWS and Heroku which
are very very fast and scalable but
we're not talking about large web
applications here we're talking about
basic web sites and this guide is for
the beginner and for the beginner I
would suggest managed hosting okay
whether shared hosting or VPS or maybe
even a dedicated server but that may be
overkill you're not going to get the
scalability and speed of a cloud service
but the simplicity of managed hosting is
well worth it for a basic website and
we're talking about like an HTML CSS
JavaScript site maybe a WordPress
website or maybe even a custom PHP
website so what we'll be doing like I
said is going through and navigating
cPanel I'll show you how to do all the
basic tasks that have to do with
deploying your site and managing it now
we're gonna be using a service called in
motion hosting and I chose this company
because I've worked with them personally
for years I have a VPS account with them
and their supports great they have great
services never had any problems with
them so that's my personal
recommendation I'm not being paid for
this video although I do have an
affiliate link in the description so if
you do you know decide to get a package
with them I'd appreciate that I get a
little kickback
from that I actually purchased a shared
hosting account just to do this video so
what we're gonna do first is just talk
about the different types of hosting and
you can see these different options here
and no matter what company you go to
you're gonna see these options now
business hosting that's just what they
call their shared hosting shared hosting
is where you basically have a server and
there's a bunch of shared accounts on
that server and you're purchasing one of
those accounts now these accounts have
cPanel included which is the most
popular control panel for for hosting
accounts this is where you'll do
everything from create your email
accounts your databases all that stuff
so basically you share a server with
other people and now this is definitely
the cheapest you can see this is $5.99
it starts at $5.99 per month usually
it's going to be between 5 and somewhere
around $12 per month but usually you
have to pay by the year or by two years
or three years and you'll get a deal
depending on the length of time you're
paying for upfront so that's what we'll
be dealing with VPS hosting is is the
step up it's basically a virtual server
it's not quite a dedicated server where
you have your own machine but it is your
own virtual machine if you've ever used
like VMware or VirtualBox or something
on your computer where you basically
have a computer within a computer that's
kind of like what a VPS is you do have
complete route access to your virtual
server and you can do what you want with
it ok so you have much more freedom than
a shared hosting account then you have
dedicated servers which are where you
actually rent out a physical machine
from the company so they'll have a data
center with you know hundreds or
thousands of servers and you'll get one
of those and you can see those are the
most expensive a hundred dollars per
month is actually very very cheap for a
dedicated server but again this is the
introductory price so reseller hosting
is a bit different it's it's basically
like a VPS except you're you're selling
shared hosting to other people so
usually it'll come with like a billing
system I used to resell hosting from
Hostgator about six or seven years ago
when I had my tech guy company it's it's
not something I'd recommend for like a
side business because there's a lot that
goes into it you really have to know
what you're doing so I would suggest if
you're gonna do reseller hosting jump in
and be a hosting company and really
inform yourself and know what you're
doing because having control of other
people's hosting accounts is very
overwhelming and you need to know what
the hell you're doing and then WordPress
hosting is basically just shared hosting
optimized for WordPress all right so I
already have the account now if you were
to order from in motion you would just
go through you could see there's
different packages for each type of
hosting I actually have the power
package which is $7.99 per month but if
you go to order you have to go by two
years if you want that price I actually
did the one year so it's $8.99 per month
and it comes out to like hundred and
hundred and seventeen or something one
hundred and thirty one dollars for the
year okay I'm sorry one hundred and
seven dollars for the year now in motion
like a lot of hosting companies will
include a domain name so over here I'm
not going to go through the entire
process but just to show you that you
can pick your data center you can choose
if you want WordPress installed
automatically I'm going to say no thanks
and you continue and now you can pick a
domain with this account and you'll get
that for free at least for the first
year I think after that you'll have to
pay like twelve bucks a year or if you
have a domain registered elsewhere you
just choose this and you go ahead and
add that domain and then you'll go back
to that domain registrar and just enter
the the custom in-motion name servers
and that'll link your domain to your new
hosting account now my goal for this
video is not to focus on the in motion
service it's going to be very similar
regardless of what company you're using
okay so I don't want this to be a video
about a certain company but of course
had to pick a company to use so I'm
picking the one that I recommend all
right so once you go ahead and sign up
you'll get an email it'll look something
like this and you'll just have to set
your Pat you'll have a login ID which
would be your email address and then
you'll set a password and then you'll be
able to log into your account management
panel
now this is not cPanel yet this is just
their basically their their billing
system this is where you can update your
contact info work you can view your
domains you can pay your bill things
like that
and no matter what company you use
they'll have something like this okay so
it's like the billing gateway now right
here you'll see an icon for cPanel this
is where you actually manage your
website or your your web hosting account
so we'll go ahead and click on that
actually already have it open so that's
why that didn't work so this is cPanel
and this is offered with I don't know I
would estimate somewhere between 80 and
90 percent of managed hosting companies
and it's very powerful you can do a lot
from here it may be a little
overwhelming if you're not into this
stuff if you're a new web developer or
if you're not even a web developer but
you know you're deploying your own site
so I'm just gonna go through some of the
options here and some of the features
and properties of cPanel now it may look
different you may have a different theme
in fact you can see this uses the paper
lantern theme your company may have it
may look different but you'll have most
of the same options now this over here
on the side is your server information
or your account information the domain
that I have set up for this account is
Traverse II staging com okay so that's
my domain and then you also have a user
name which in my case is traver 20 that
was actually created from my domain and
then the home directory is where you our
account is located on the server which
is in the home folder and then whatever
your user name okay this is the last
login this is the IP address of the last
login this is actually is not my IP
address this is in motion support so
I don't care about you guys seeing it
down here we have some statistics the
add-on domains now an add-on domain is
if you want to do just that add a domain
on to this account now if we go back to
the I want to go back to the packages
that they offer for shared hosting right
here and you can see this package has it
could allow six websites so basically
this means that you can have if we go
back to cPanel you have your main domain
which in my case is this travesty
staging and then you can have five more
add-on domains so that makes six
websites you can actually have with this
hosting account now if you're gonna have
six websites on us on a small shared
server like this or a shared account
then they should be very small websites
all right you don't want even though it
technically is supposed to be unlimited
disk space and bandwidth it's never
truly unlimited and you should
definitely read the fine print on that
but I would suggest having one or two
sites on a shared account
so yeah add-on domains we have zero out
of five aliases autoresponders I'll get
into that bandwidth this is the
bandwidth that I've used so far so 11
megabytes very very small I just did a
little bit of testing but everything is
pretty much default I don't have
anything like uploaded as a website or
anything yet we'll do that in this video
it also shows you your MySQL and
Postgres databases Postgres is fairly
new as far as I know back when I was
doing reselling and dealing with a lot
of different companies they didn't
actually have postgrads as an option it
was just my SQL here you'll see your
disk usage your email accounts your
forwarders the number of FTP accounts
looks like they allow up to two thousand
on this package your CPU usage if we go
down here number of processes that are
running on your account your databases
subdomains a sub domain is is like let's
say blog dot
travesty state travesty staging calm and
will actually create a sub-domain and
I'm gonna show you how to easily install
WordPress on that sub domain as well so
let's take a look at some of these areas
on the left now the preferences this is
gonna be stuff that is related to the
company that you're working with so for
instance in motion offers AdWords
credits so you'll see that here you'll
see your user manager your contact
information your password and security a
link back to the account management
panel or amp so stuff that's dedicated
to in motion so you might not have this
area or it might be different options
now you will have email that says all
your email stuff your route your routing
your forwarders your accounts domains
this is where you can add your add-on
domains your subdomains aliases
you can add redirects things like that
this is all applications that you can
easily install on your account you can
either install them on your main root
domain or a sub domain or an add-on
domain or just a subfolder so things
like WordPress Joomla which is another
content management system there's a
whole bunch of stuff and I'll actually
show you some of some of the other stuff
that's that's available down here we
have like PHP configuration if you want
to change the version by default at 7.0
but you could update it to 7.1 or you
could roll back to one of the version
fives if you wanted to alright and then
you can also configure like Perl or pair
packages the softest softest softest
cellulose I don't know how to pronounce
that soft delicious this is basically
where you can install all of these
different scripts down here files so you
have a file manager if I click that this
is what is on your server on your
account now public HTML that is the
front end of your website so anything
that you want to display on your domain
which in my case is Traverse II staging
com will be in this public HTML full
okay which for me is empty but you may
have like a welcome page that comes with
with the hosting account or something
like that okay
and then you don't really have to worry
about any of this other stuff you can
also create subfolders in your public
HTML and you'll be able to access like
let's say traverse east aging coms slash
blog or whatever whatever folder that I
want to create and you can actually put
a separate website in that subfolder
alright so you don't usually want to use
the file manager it's it's pretty crappy
you do want to use an FTP account as
what I would suggest for people just
getting started if I FTP stands for File
Transfer Protocol and that's how we're
actually going to upload our website
alright so let's go back to cPanel like
I said FTP so this is where you can see
your FTP accounts now you can create new
accounts here you can create the login
and the password and all that but you
also have you are your home FTP account
which is the user that that you created
with your cPanel so in my case Traver 20
and I would use my password for my my
initial cPanel account I should be able
to access into FTP with that account so
I don't technically have to create
another one but you can if you want
alright so if we keep going down here
databases this is where we can create
MySQL databases or postgrads
I'll get into that in a little bit
metrics so you can see your visitors
from here kind of like Google Analytics
just not as in-depth awstats will also
show your analytics you can see your
bandwidth usage your CPA CPU usage stuff
like that security so here you can set
up for SSH access if you want to access
your server from a terminal you can set
up SSH keys that's a little more
advanced than I want to get into IP
blocker so if you have issues with
someone that has a certain IP address
that you know of or a certain range you
can actually block them from accessing
your account or your website
all right and then advance down here we
have like mime types I'm not really
going to get into this cron jobs for
automation so that's about it for the
options here so let's go ahead and let's
um let's create an email account that's
usually one of the first things I do so
I'm gonna go ahead and just say I want
Brad at Travis II staging comm and if
you have multiple domains in your
account you'll be able to select the
domain so password I'll just put in
whatever and I apologize I'm using my
mechanical keyboard usually I don't use
this in videos but there shouldn't be
too much typing so you can choose
unlimited if you want but 250 megabytes
for this inbox is fine so I'll go ahead
and click create account and that's it
we had I'll have an email account which
is Brad at traversÃ©e staging comm if I
go over to more and I go to access
webmail we're gonna get three options so
these are just different inboxes you can
use they're all pretty much the same and
they're all pretty crappy what I usually
do is set up a forwarder to Gmail
because I prefer the Gmail interface but
if you want you can click on one of
these like squirrel mail mail mail and
this is you're at your inbox and you can
see we have just what kind of a welcome
email with configuration settings but
let's go ahead and test this out and
let's um
let's send an email so we'll go to
compose and I'm gonna send this to one
of my gmail accounts so tech eye info
Gmail and we'll just say hello and test
and let's send alright so now what I'll
do is go over to Gmail I'm just gonna
pause the video and and locate that
email and I'll be back alright so I'm in
my inbox nothing really that I need to
hide here but you can see right here we
have an email from Brad Travis II I
actually forgot to put a subject in but
I could have
and you can see it says hello and test
it's from Brad at traversÃ©e staging
calm and if I wanted to reply uh say
hello we'll just say hello there and
send and now let's go back over to
webmail and let's reload our inbox and
there it is so if we click on that I'll
click on the subject hello and test I'm
sorry hello there so you can see that I
this isn't really a very nice interface
to work with at least in my opinion so
what I would suggest doing is setting up
a forward or so we'd go back to our
email block here and go to forwarders
and you could set up let's choose the
domain and we'll say add Florida so the
address the forward I want Brad at and
then traverse to staging column again if
you had multiple domains you could
choose a different one and we want to
send this to tech I info look at
gmail.com
okay so we'll say add Florida so now all
email sent to the staging email will go
to my gmail account alright and we can
actually test that out so what I'll do
is I'm going to pause I'm gonna send an
email to this this account from my
traversÃ©e media at gmail account and
we'll see if that goes through alright
guys so I went to my other gmail account
and I sent a message to the new email
address and you can see that it was
forwarded to Gmail okay so if we look at
this it's sent to or sent from
traversing media at gmail and if we look
here it's to Brad at Travis C staging
comm which is our new hoe our new email
alright so now you can work with Gmail
instead of working with that the other
interface and you can choose to send
emails from your cPanel email from
Gmail if you go into the settings and
change some stuff up but I don't want to
get into that I don't want to spend too
much time on this so let's go ahead and
deploy our website now like I said we
have a default FTP account because we
can just use our cPanel login with this
username now as far as your what you're
going to use for FTP I would definitely
suggest FileZilla ok so if you go to
FileZilla project org you want to
download the client ok not the server
you want the client because you want to
connect to your server through the
clients so download that I already have
it installed so I'm not going to go
through that but I'll go ahead and open
it so let me just search for it real
quick and let me just open that up ok so
it's gonna look like this and what you
want to do is put in your host which is
your domain name so I'm gonna put in
traversÃ©e staging dot-com your username
which mine is traver 20 and then
whatever you are password for your
cPanel and then connect okay so now
we're logged into our account and again
you can see pretty much everything you
saw in the file manager public HTML this
is your actual website and you can see
mine's completely blank you might have
some Welcome pages in here just just so
they have something to display because
right now if I go to my domain so Travis
C's staging com I just get index of and
just a blank file listing so it's as
easy as this to upload a file we'll go
ahead and create let's say index.html ok
if your home page should always be
called index that's what's gonna load
automatically when you go to your root
domain so I'm just going to open this
with a text editor I'm going to open it
with sublime text and I'll just put an
h1 in here and just say hello world and
save and then we'll
drag this into the public HTML folder
okay and now if I go to my traverse see
staging comm and reload we now get hello
world
alright so it's as easy as that and you
can also upload PHP files if I were to
let's say delete this and let's change
this extension from in from HTML to PHP
and we'll go ahead and open that with
sublime text and this will still work
because HTML can be used inside of a PHP
file but just to show you I can use PHP
we're gonna open up some tags here and
we'll just say echo this will say hello
from PHP and save will go ahead and
upload that and let's go back to the
domain and reload and we get hello from
PHP alright and we could put tags in
there as well so if we wanted to either
just wrap this in an h1 like that so
it's so we could do that it's gonna ask
you if you want to overwrite you will
say yes and then reload and you can see
it's an h1 so you can build custom PHP
applications using an account like this
so what I want to do is I want to
actually upload my Travis e-media
website to this domain so I already have
it all look I just want to delete this I
already have it all compiled and all
built out so I'm gonna just grab it real
quick give me a second alright so
production website and I'm just going to
grab the files and upload it so down
here you'll see queued files this is the
files that are uploading you'll see if
it's counting
you can also see the progress right here
for each file that's uploading all right
so once that gets down to zero that
means it's completely uploaded all right
so now what we'll do is we'll go back to
Travis restaging comm and reload and
there's the website okay so it's as easy
as that to deploy a site so now what I
want to do let's go back to where are we
let's go back to cPanel and I in
addition to our regular site which is at
the root domain
I want a sub domain that has a WordPress
website so I'm gonna go to domains
subdomains and I'm gonna create one
called WordPress dot
Travis East aging calm and if I add
multiple add-on domains I would be able
to choose it from here as well so this
will be our document root ok so the sub
domain will actually be the folder we
upload to we'll click create and now we
have a sub domain so let's go back to
the cPanel and go down to WordPress I'm
going to click on WordPress and from
here we can go to install now actually
before we do that I just want to show
you that this over here on the side you
have all these different categories of
scripts that you can install with
basically just one or two clicks we have
all types of blogs we have content
management systems like Joomla and
Drupal we have forums like PHP BB and
simple machines forum we have image
galleries we even have ecommerce
platforms full shopping carts like
Magento and OS commerce so it's it's
very easy to get any of these scripts up
and running on your hosts but we're
going to install WordPress so we're
gonna click that install button and
let's see we're gonna choose a domain
which I'm going to choose my sub domain
they just created
otherwise we'll overwrite the root
domain I don't want to do that we'll go
down here to admin username and let's
say
then put a password in and let's see if
we click Advanced Options you'll see
that it's going to create a new database
you can change the name if you want you
could also manually create a database
outside of here in your cPanel and then
use that but we're just gonna let it
create a new one and then we'll just
click install ok and it's just gonna
take a couple seconds and it should set
up WordPress on that sub domain so now
you can see it says WordPress has been
successfully installed we have the front
end domain here which is our sub domain
and then the admin domain which is just
the sub domain slash wp-admin so let's
first look at the front end I'll go
ahead and open that up and we have a
brand new WordPress website with the
default theme if we go to our subdomains
slash WP dash admin it'll take us to our
wordpress login which will be admin and
abc123 exclamation and there we go
so we have our backend if we want to
create a post and go ahead and say add
new posts say my blog my blog posts and
let's go ahead and publish and now if we
go to the front-end which we can get to
if we go to my blog and then visit site
and then scroll down there's our new
post ok there it is so you have a
complete WordPress website now on a
subdomain and at the same time we have
our regular site which is still at
traversÃ©e staging com ok so very very
easy to do this stuff we haven't done
any kind of programming or anything like
that you don't have to be a programmer
to set up your own website like this you
might have to have a developer create
your site if you unless you know basic
HTML CSS JavaScript
but then it's easy to upload so that's I
mean those are the big things some other
things we have our backups so if we go
to backup we can go ahead and actually
let's go to the backup wizard that's a
little easier which is right here backup
wizard so if we click this button it'll
backup the entire home directory so all
of our files all of our MySQL databases
all of our email forward our
configurations and all of our email
filter configurations and we can easily
restore it back as well all right so
another perk of cPanel let's see what
else so let's see databases so if you
want to create a MySQL database there's
a wizard you can use so if we go ahead
and click that now your database is
going to be prefixed with your username
and underscore so let's just call this
test and we'll say next step so username
will say Brad which will also be
prefixed with your username here
password we'll just to abc123
and say create user and we want all
privileges for this user meaning we want
them to be able to create tables and
delete records and stuff like that all
right so now if we go we could either
add another database let's return to
MySQL databases and if we go down here
now you'll see both our WordPress
database which was automatically created
and then our brand new test database
that we just created okay you can see
the WordPress database has 0.67
megabytes our new one is completely
empty now if you want to manage the
tables and stuff in your database you
can go down to PHP myadmin
just right here and you can see both
databases
over on the side if we look at the
WordPress it has all the default
WordPress tables if we look at ours the
test it has nothing we could go ahead
and create a table like users click go
and we could put like let's say ID we
could make it a Auto increment primary
key and name and let's say email and
we'll choose varchar' for these I'm not
going to go over SQL but just to show
you real quick that we can do this we'll
say max length to 55 and save so now we
have a users table with a couple
different fields in our database and we
can actually insert if we go to insert
we'll put in the name here and email and
click go and now if we go to browse
you'll see that we actually have a user
in our database okay so we could build a
custom PHP application to access this
database are not just PHP but PHP is the
easiest to use with these types of
managed hosting accounts alright so I
think that's it guys I don't really want
to get into any stuff that's too
advanced like SSH keys or anything like
that you do have your error logs so any
error logs will show up here you have
your bandwidth usage so you can see the
usage of our bandwidth and disk space
usage and all that stuff awstats you can
choose actually you can choose your
subdomain if you want to or your main
domain and this will show you your user
activity so number of visits things like
that kind of like Google Analytics just
just not as good I would definitely
suggest using Google Analytics over
something like this
alright guys so that's gonna be it I
hope you enjoyed this little guide I I
know that a lot of you guys are like I
said developers that already know all of
this stuff but this is for the beginners
this is I want to help people out that
are trying to get into
this line of work and giving them the
easiest way possible to deploy a website
