and the first script that I want to
write or that I want to show you is just
a very simple web server and if you've
watched any other node.js videos you may
have came across this example here which
is on the node the node.js org home page
and it's just a couple lines of code and
basically it's an h2 it's a it's a
server it's going to create HTTP headers
and a request and a response and it's
doing this using the HTTP module node
has modules that you can use it has
what's called NPM or the node package
manager where you can download different
modules to do different things in this
case we're using the HTTP module and
this is how you will we would include it
okay create a variable and set it to
require and then whatever the module all
right so here we're getting the HTTP
HTTP module then we're using the create
server method okay and that takes a
callback function which takes two
parameters request and response then we
are writing the header
all right so response dot write head 200
means it's good it's okay we're setting
the content type to just text and then
we are ending it but we're also adding
in something that we want to print out
on the screen which would be hello world
and then finally we want to use listen
to assign the port to the to the IP
address okay so this is obviously this
is the loopback IP same as localhost and
port 1 3 3 7 and then we're just simply
logging I'm just printing out that the
server is running
then the IP address and the port so
that's the entire script I'm going to do
something very similar to this except I
want to use the connect module with this
the way it is now it's just going to
print out hello world I want to actually
be able to serve static web pages all
right so let's close that up and let's
see I'm just going to on my C Drive I'm
going to create a new folder and just
call it note apps
and what I'm going to do is create a
javascript file called server Jas and I
just want to make sure that extensions
are showing let's see alright so by
default this is saying hide empty I mean
sorry hide extensions for known file
types
I want to uncheck that I want to be able
to see the extensions or you can see
this is server dot JSP xed we don't want
that and I would advise you to do the
same if you're using Windows all you
need to do is go to organize folder and
search options and then view and then
you'll find it here I also want to show
hidden files alright and I want to
change the default program for
JavaScript files I want to change it to
notepad plus plus which is in the
Program Files folder
obviously you can use any editor you
want for just simple stuff I like to use
notepad plus plus all right so here's
our this is going to be our app this is
going to be deal well actually I should
this is going to be the only JavaScript
file I want to be able to serve HTML
pages all right so the first thing we
want to do is say variable connect and
that's going to go to the connect module
all right and we want to assign a port
so I'm going to create a variable called
port and we're going to set that to
3,000 all right now I'm going to use the
create server method so connect dog
create server and inside create server
um
I'm going to say connect what connect
that static so what we're doing here is
assigning a directory for our static
HTML pages and we want to use the
directory we're in so we can use two
underscores and then dar name alright
and then we want to just remove that and
we want to put a dot listen all right so
we want to listen on three thousand
which we put in a variable so we can
just say listen port and then finally we
just want to say console dot log will
say connected the court and then we can
just concatenate on port all right so
that's our entire server so let's save
that in one thing we need to do before
we run this we need to install the
connect app the connect module so we
want to go to I'm going to go to my C
Drive and
know what
no taps and then to run a script to run
a JavaScript file all we need to do is
say node server Jas all right because
the the server Jas is in the same
directory so we don't need to have any
folder names but we could also just say
node server
all right so having an issue here
unexpected token I'm sorry that needs to
come off that semicolon all right so
let's try that again
can't find module connect that's because
we didn't install it which that's what I
was just coming to do so to install a
module we want to use NPM all right so
all we need to do is say npm install
connect
and it goes through this mumbo-jumbo
now I think I'll do a video on NPM
itself just so we can just so you can
understand more about it and how it
works now since we install the module if
we go back to no taps you'll see this
node modules directory and it
automatically creates that when you
install a module from NPM all right and
we have our connect and then this is
just basically all the files for the
connect all right
and you can even see the modules that it
uses but we're not going to get into
that we don't need to so now let's try
to run it again say node server we want
to allow access email and it says
connected via port 3000 all right so our
web server is running I just want to
mention that you don't have to use
server as your file name we could just
as well name this app das and then said
no tap alright so just so you know that
all right so now if we go to localhost
3000
all right and we get this cannot get
message that's because we have nothing
in there all right so let's go ahead and
put in an index dot HTML document
and we'll open that up I'm I'm not going
to put I'm not going to create a whole
HTML document we'll just say this is the
index file okay we'll save that and come
over here and reload and our index file
loads okay so we have a web server
running which we can add static pages to
so let's say we want to add in a boat
page
well I want to do that
so now we should be able to go to
localhost 3000 slash about I'm sorry
about HTML all right so you can
basically just serve static web pages um
and it's a very very simple very fast
server now if you're building a large
app then you probably want to use
something like Express which you can
have rep different kinds of routing
systems and things like that but we'll
eventually get into that so that's it
for this video in the next video I think
I just want to go over NPM a little more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
