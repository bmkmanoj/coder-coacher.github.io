video I just want to let you guys know
that I've created my first udemy course
under traversée media called angular 4
front to back
it was literally made live 10 minutes
ago now a lot of you know that I've made
dozens of courses for another company
and I will continue doing that but this
is the first one under my own name and
I'm extremely proud of it and I would
strongly suggest that anyone that has
any interest at all in angular 4 pick
this up now many of you know me I make
free content I release it you know
almost every other day I don't ask for
much
I'm not one to push sales on sales
videos on you guys I think this is the
first one ever but this is really
important to me and if I've helped you
in any way through this channel if I've
helped you you know learn a lot and you
watch a lot of my videos and you want to
know the best way to support me this is
definitely it and not because I'm
looking for your 25 dollars but because
I'm looking for in existence on udemy
which is very hard to get if you know
when you're just starting out and you
guys can't have the opportunity to
really help me with that so that I can
continue to make more courses and
succeed on this platform all right so
it's originally $50 but I did include a
code traversée and also a link in the
description which links the code that'll
give it to you for 25 bucks so you know
obviously if you're really struggling
and you really can't afford $25 then
don't buy it but if you can spare it and
you know you like what I do and I've
helped you in any way then this is a
fantastic way to support me all right so
I'm brand new to you to me as myself not
just the guy from Ed joannec so any
reviews that you guys could post would
mean the world to me obviously make them
honest don't just lie if you didn't like
the course and be honest but I don't
think you'll be disappointed at all it's
eight and a half hours long of angular
for training and we have a basic project
at the end and then we have a really
advanced project that uses
authentication and firebase and all that
so let's take a look at the
1:10 so if we go down here we have the
introduction where we just talked about
you know what the course is about we
talk about what angular is about some of
the version some of the confusion of the
versions explain like why there's no
angular free we also talk about file
structure setting it up we look at all
the files in an angular application and
talk about what they do the CLI the
QuickStart an introduction an
introduction to typescript then we move
on to components we look at ng module we
look at data binding and string
interpolation all that stuff template
syntax so ng for ng if property binding
although although the main fundamentals
of angular events and forms two-way data
binding services in HTTP we have the
angular router section and then after
that after we go over all the core
fundamentals and you've mastered that
stuff we're going to start a project
which is an FAQ app project and this is
pretty basic but it does get into things
like nesting components we get into
emitting output from components and that
kind of stuff and then after that we
have our advanced project and if you
already know quite a bit about angular 4
you might want to just get this course
for this one project and you can see
both of these parts here are over an
hour and a half and they have quite a
bit of lectures here so let's take a
quick look at that project so I have it
running here on my local machine and you
see we have a login page I'm using
bootstrap 4 for the UI I've even created
this simple little logo for the client
panel and we have a login and a register
now I made it so that there's actually a
settings area where we can disable the
registration because a lot of times when
you build you know an admin panel you're
not going to want just anybody to come
and register but I did want to include
that that you know that functionality to
teach you guys how to do that how to
register with firebase so I made it an
option to enable and disable ok so let's
go ahead and just log in here I already
have an account which i think is tech
guy info a gmail and on our password
alright so it's going to log us in and
you see we get this flash message which
should disappear after
couple seconds and it lists all of our
clients okay it has the client ID the
name the email it also has the balance
that the client owes us and then up at
the top here it's going to take all
those balances add them together and
tell us the total okay and if we go and
we click on the details for a client
whoops it'll give us you know the name
the ID the contact email the contact
phone adding fields is extremely easy if
you guys want to add more fields they
also have the balance here and we can
easily change it if we click that it
opens up a form and let's say that the
client paid us $20 and we wanted to
bring it down to 100 and then we update
it it says balance updated we can also
edit okay we can edit all the client
info we can obviously delete the client
and if we want to add a new client we
can do that and then up here you'll see
we have this settings menu where we can
disable or we can allow and disallow
registration we can also disable the
balance on add so for instance when we
go to add a client you'll see we can
change the balance okay if you want to
disable that we could go ahead and click
that and then same for the edit form and
submit setting saved and then we go back
and we try to add a client we can't edit
the balance okay the only way now we can
edit the balance is going to the details
page and updating it here so a nice
little setting and then for the
registration if we want to uncheck that
and submit and then we'll log out you'll
see that there's no registration link
not only is there no link but the page
isn't going to work we go to register
which normally would work if it was
enabled it doesn't it just boots us back
and then if we look at our firebase
back-end you'll see in the database we
have a collection called client and
that's where all of our clients are
stored if I go to authentication it'll
show you the different users that we
have and if we go to sign and method
you'll see we have the email password
enabled and if you wanted to keep going
and add you know Google and Facebook
authentication you can do that pretty
easily as well using angularfire - which
is what we're going to be using all
right so the last thing we'll do is just
take a quick look at the project code
just so you guys know what we're
let me close the stuff up now I mean I
know it looks kind of simple on the
surface if you're looking at the
application but if you look at our
components folder we have quite a few
components here the add client client
details dashboard now far log in
register settings sidebar so there's
quite a few components we have our
guards so the off guard takes care of
you know not letting us go to certain
routes if we're not logged in the
register God takes care of not letting
us go to the register page if the
registration is disabled and then we
have our models for the client and for
the settings we have our services for
authentication for the client service
with firebase setting service so you can
see there's a lot that went into this
application so I think it's really worth
I think it's more than worth $25 so if
you guys are interested in this you know
if you're not interested in angular 4 at
all and you know you don't even know
what it is and you subscribe to me for
like basic HTML videos and stuff then
don't buy it you know unless you just
really want to support me but I do think
that you'd benefit highly from it if
you're looking to learn or learn more
about angular 4 all right so I will be
releasing an angular for crash course
within the next I'd say next week or so
to further promote this course but if
you do buy this course the crash course
won't be much use to you because we go
over much more in the you know in the
udemy course but that's it guys I just
wanted to make this video to let you
guys know and let you guys know that I'd
appreciate any support and that's it
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
