Hill from scratch in the last video we
made it so that we could create a post
from our front end here and we also
implemented an editor so now what I want
to do is make it so we can edit and
delete posts so we want to from the show
page which is the individual post we
want to have an edit and delete button
now later on we add authentication we're
going to have that as well as a
dashboard where we can we can create
posts art I'm sorry edit and delete
posts so let's go to our show view show
Glade PHP and I'm going to go under see
where I want to put this let's go under
the small here and we'll put another HR
and then we'll put a link okay and this
is just going to go this is going to go
to the edit view so let's say href
equals slash posts slash and then the ID
so we can just go like that post ID and
then slash edit we'll give this a
class-b TN and BTN default okay and
that's going to say edit so we'll save
now if we reload we have an edit button
and that goes to post slash the ID and
then edit so let's go to our controller
and go to the edit function and we want
to bring in that that post which we can
do we using fine just like we did in the
show view and then we just want to load
up the edit view so it'll be post dot
edit okay we're going to pass along the
post as well so let's go to our views
and then posts and we'll create a new
file called edit blade dot PHP okay and
we're going to copy what's in the create
template because it's basically the same
thing we just need that form and we'll
change the heading to edit post and the
action is now going to go to
controller update okay now we also want
to include the ID so to do that we're
going to make this an array so we're
going to put brackets there in there and
then we're going to put a comma and say
post ID okay so it knows which which one
it's updating now if we submit this as
is it's going to make a post request to
update and if we look at our routes
let's clear this out and then we'll do
PHP artisan route list and if we look at
the update which is right here we're
making if we well it's going to post
slash and then the ID so if we mean if
if we do a post request to that it's
going to actually is that where yeah
it's going to go update our post slash
ID so right here is what we want and
that has to be either a put or a patch
request alright there actually isn't a
route to make a post request to this
right here so what we need to do is
close this up we can't change this to
put we can't do something like that you
can either do get or post but what
laravel allows us to do is spoof up put
request and we can do that by simply
adding a hidden input write up break
down here we'll say form hidden and all
we have to do is pass in underscore
method and then for the second parameter
we're going to put the type of requests
we want to make which will be a put
request okay that way it'll it'll do
what we needed to do so let's save
actually one more thing we need to add
the values so right here for the title
instead of being blank we want it to be
post title and then right here should be
post
body so now if we go back and click Edit
takes us to the forum and it's prefilled
with our values now if we submit it's
going to go to the update function which
is blank so if we go to our post
controller we want to go to this update
so I'm going to copy what we have in the
store which is this here we want the
validation and all this stuff and then
we'll place that an update and all we
really need to change is this right here
because we're not creating a new post
what we're doing is we're going to find
a post so we're going to say find and
then just pass in ID all right and then
the rest can be the same let's just
change the message to post updated all
right so let's go back and let's reload
this and let's just remove the bold here
and then save that so post updated now
if we go to post for the bold is gone
alright so we can now update posts now
for delete we can't just simply add a
link to delete it's going to be we need
to make a post request and then also
spoof it with a delete like we did with
the put so that has to go on a forum so
let's go to our show method our show
pops our show view and go right under
where we put the edit and we want to put
a forum here alright so let's do forum
actually that needs to be like that
so forum open
and in here we're going to pass in an
array we're going to say action and
we're going to set that to let's see
we're going to set that to an array
actually and then in here whoops here
we're going to say post controller at
destroy sorry about that ding and you
guys and then we also want to pass the
ID so it knows which one to delete so
post ID alright and then we also want
the method so after the array after the
bracket here we'll put a comma and we're
going to say method disguise it as a
post even though it's going to be a
delete and then let's also have a class
okay so class and let's give it a class
of BTN and then BTN oh no we don't want
to do that here we want to do pull right
the BTN will go on the submit button
yeah because we want to pull it to the
right we want to float it to the right
of the edit alright and then we just
want to end it so form close
and then inside the forum we're going to
have two things we're going to have the
hidden spoofing method and we're going
to have the submit all right so let's do
form hidden okay and then that's going
to take in underscore method and we want
this to actually be a delete request
okay and then we'll do the submit so
submit is going to be going to say
delete and then we'll pass in an array
of parameters so we just want to put a
class class will be BTN BTN - danger all
right let's just let's see what that
looks like
what's this washing our expecting
closing bracket okay what did I do
Oh
all right here should be another bracket
there we go so now we have our delete
button and that's getting submitted to
the destroy function so let's go down to
destroy and what we want to do here is
find the post by its ID that's being
passed in and then we can simply do post
delete and then we'll just redirect back
to posts let's say post removed okay
let's try that reload and delete and now
post removed so we have full crud
functionality now the next thing we're
going to do in the next video is we're
going to add authentication so that we
can register and login we can create our
own posts and then we'll move on to
access controls so we can only we can
only manage our own posts all right so
we'll get into that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
