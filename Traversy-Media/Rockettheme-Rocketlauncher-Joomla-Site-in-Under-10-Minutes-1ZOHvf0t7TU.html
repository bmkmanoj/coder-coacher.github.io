creating a complete Joomla site using
rocket themes rocket launcher and let me
try to explain that a little bit when
you go to a rocket theme you can
purchase a subscription
I believe it's $60 for three months or
something like that and with each
template they have really really nice
templates and which they release a new
one each month so you can see these are
the archives of all the templates they
have and if you have a membership then
you can download any of these all of
them any of them whatever you want but
with each one comes a standard template
package which you would just install on
your site like you would any other
template but you also have a rocket
launch or package and what that is is
it's an entire Joomla installation
wrapped up into a zip file and it
includes the template which for
whichever rocket launch you you you
purchased so I'm gonna actually just go
through that just so you know that when
you buy one of these templates you don't
have to install Joomla and then install
the template and then try to tweak
everything you know tweaking the module
positions you can actually get it to
just look like the demo and for this
tutorial we're going to be using the
fresco theme alright so if you had a
membership you would click download I do
not have my membership actually expired
but if you were if you had a membership
and you logged in you'd see options for
the standard template package and for
the rocket launcher package so you would
download the rocket launcher which I
already have now we can see an actual
demo of this template we click on demo
and it's a really nice template really
colorful if you use rocket launcher you
install Joomla and when you're done with
the installation your site would look
exactly like this all that all the the
sample data except for the images what
they'll have is just blank images
because these are copy written I guess
you're not supposed to use these on your
site so it would look it's the same
exact thing except you'd have blank
images which is easy to just just add
your own so let's say you download the
rocket launcher now we need to start to
install Joomla and for this particular
tutorial I'm going to be installing
Joomla on my xampp installation xampp is
a it's an Apache server that you can run
on your local Windows or Mac and that's
available at Apache friends org now I'm
not going to go through the installation
for xampp I already have it installed
but you would just download for your
particular Windows or Mac and install it
alright so what we do want to do is
create a new database and if you have a
cPanel account that you're doing this on
or some other hosting control panel you
need to find in that control panel where
you can create a MySQL database and user
if it's cPanel then usually you have the
MySQL database wizard icon you could use
that if you are using xampp or ramp or
MAMP or any of those local servers then
you would go to localhost / PHP myadmin
and what we want to do is create a new
database and I'm gonna call this I'm
actually gonna call this fresco
all right so now we have a database
called fresco now we need to find the
rocket launcher I have my my package of
rocket theme templates here and they
have this is what you would find this is
what you would download from rocket
theme it would be RT underscore then the
template name and then rocket launcher
so if we open up that zip file you can
see we have we have files for the entire
Joomla CMS from administrator components
modules you want to take all of that
and I'm actually going to create a
folder in my htdocs actually I already
have it it's called Joomla and that's
where I want to put my installation
essentially this this whole this whole
process is basically the same as if you
were to just install Joomla we're just
using the the rocket launcher files
and I'm using exam xampp' so it's in my
htdocs folder in my xampp installation
but you will if you're using a live site
then obviously you'd be using FTP or or
however you want to get the files onto
your site and onto your domain
all right so that looks good we have all
the entire rocket launcher package is
unzipped into my htdocs Joomla directory
now I need to visit that that location
by going to localhost / Joomla which
brings us to the installation the
installer just like as if you were to
install it on your own click next next
next now we need that database info I'm
using xampp by default the username is
root if you're using a hosting account
chances are you have the hosting account
username and then an underscore and then
the name of database so I'm sorry
the database name was fresco the prefix
you can just leave that's fine
click Next I do not enable the FTP layer
whenever I've done that I run into
issues so I'm just gonna skip that I'm
gonna click Next so site name I'm just
gonna say Joomla site
we need an email now I'm gonna keep the
username and admin password in and this
is very important if you want to use the
rocket launcher and you want your site
to look like the demo you need to click
install sample data that's where it all
comes from
all right so now we can click Next
now it's asking us to remove the
installation folder and this is for
security reasons it's not a good thing
to leave it you could just go into your
file structure you can see here we have
the installation folder you could just
delete that but they make it easy and
you can just click this button and now
if we go back you can see the
installation folder is gone so let's
visit the administrator part of our site
just to make sure everything's working
try logging in
all right so the control panel looks
good now if we click view site up here
it will take us to the front-end
and there we go everything's here all
the content like I said this blank
sample images but those are easy to to
change check out some of the inner pages
so we have the we have nice two column
layouts
we have a sidebar in a main area layout
there's different variations different
stuff to play with if we go to the
template manager in the backend and we
click on the fresco default
now here we should have all kinds of
options for style fonts font sizes you
get features we can turn off branding
copyrights tons of menu options layouts
you can define how how wide certain
modules are or how many of them there
are so it's very very customizable
not all sites with this template gonna
look the same because there's so many
different tweaks and options alright so
that's it we have it installed in under
10 minutes so you have a brand new
Joomla site you can just go into article
manager and change things and add things
so that's it thanks for watching and
please subscribe to our videos thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
