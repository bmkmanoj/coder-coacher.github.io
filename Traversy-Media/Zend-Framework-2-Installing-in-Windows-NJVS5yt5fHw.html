mini-series on the Zend framework -
alright so we're going to build an
application with it and in this video
I'm going to show you how to install it
on Windows using composer
alright so Zen is an MVC Model View
controller PHP framework and it's used a
lot on the in on the enterprise level
it's a little tough to learn compared to
something like CakePHP or codeigniter
but it is very powerful alright so it is
worth learning now if we click on this
learn link in the menu and then we go
down to reference guide and then Zend
framework - that's going to bring us to
a manual that will take us through to
create an application of course you
could just go ahead and read the
documentation but I figured if I made a
video or a mini series it would make it
a little easier so you could actually
see it in action and I could also
explain things as we go along alright so
if we click on this first one getting
started it's going to tell us about the
application which is an album manager
okay so music albums you'll be able to
list them add new albums edit albums and
delete albums okay so a basic crud
application and then the fields we just
have an ID an artist and a title okay so
really easy schema if we go ahead and
click the next link down here and this
is going to show us how to install Zend
alright so we're going to use something
called composer which is a PHP
dependency manager and it's used to
install a lot of different frameworks
actually laravel I think Symphony and a
couple others alright so we're going to
get that installed so I'm going to go
over to get composer org and if we click
on getting started I'm on a Windows
machine so I'm going to click this
installation windows link and there's a
nice installer that we can download and
run and that will install it so that we
can always access composer on in our
command line from any folder at all all
right so let's click
that and save it alright so we'll go
ahead and run it okay so next and you
can also choose to install shell menus
I'm not going to do that I'm just going
to leave it at default and then you need
to assign your PHP folder all right I'm
using zamp or xampp and it's going to be
in C Drive
zamp PHP and then PHP dot exe okay if
it's not showing up here go ahead and
browse to it
alright so we'll click Next and then
install
alright so it's telling us that we need
to close all of our windows and we need
to actually log out and then log back
into windows alright so I'm going to go
ahead and do that and I'll be back
alright guys so I've logged out and
locked back into Windows and now I'm
going to do is open up a command prompt
and I'm going to go ahead and just type
in composure alright so we know that
it's installed and working because it
gives us all the different commands okay
now what we want to do is we need to run
this command here to actually set up our
Zend application so you want to go to
your server folder or wherever you want
to install this I'm going to my C Drive
and then zamp slash htdocs alright and
then what I'm going to do is just grab
this and paste that in and then we're
just going to change this path to
install to whatever we want to call it
I'm going to call it my albums I don't
think that the tutorial actually calls
with that but I'm going to call it that
alright and then at the beginning of
this command we don't want the PHP and
we don't want the dot fire it should
just be composer all right so let's go
ahead and run that all right and make
sure that your Apache server is running
mine isn't so I'm going to open
my exam can't roll panel and click start
for Apache and also MySQL alright so
let's see project out oh it's not empty
I already had it
alright so you guys shouldn't get this
issue but let me try let me fix this
real quick all right so let me run that
again ok so it should create it alright
and this might take a minute or two
alright so it's going to ask if we want
to remove the existing VCS so let's just
say yes for that okay now what we want
to do is go to localhost / my albums /
public alright so here is our
boilerplate application that comes by
default okay it's basically just a page
it doesn't have any special
functionality or anything like that but
we now have Xen installed okay so the
last thing I want to do is I don't want
to have to go to localhost my albums
public so what I'm going to do is add in
a virtual host so if we go back to the
documentation and go down it actually
shows us how to do that okay we need to
edit the httpd.conf file alright so
let's do that that's going to be in zamp
and then Pachi then conf and extra and
we want to open vhosts
alright so I'm just going to copy that
and let's see so if you haven't touched
this file at all this line right here is
probably commented with a with a hashtag
symbol you just want to delete that okay
and it should look like this and then
what we're going to do is paste that in
and we're going to change a couple
things the server name I'm going to
change to my albums and then the
document root
I'm going to get rid of that and I'm
going to say see slash zamp slash htdocs
slash my albums slash public all right
and then what we're going to do is copy
that and we're going to put it here
alright so yeah that should be good so
let's save that now we also need to edit
our hosts file now you need to be an
admin to be able to save it so what I'm
going to do is we're going to open up
notepad and you need to run it as
administrator all right or you won't be
able to save it and then I'm going to
say open and you want to go to your C
Drive and then windows and then drivers
or is it no not not drivers yet when
it's system 32 right here and then
drivers alright and then et Cie and then
down here we're going to select all
files and I'm going to open hosts and
all we want to do is say 127.0.0.1 and
then we're going to say my albums just
like that ok so ctrl s we'll go ahead
and save that so now what we need to do
is just restart apache alright and then
let's try to go to HTTP slash slash my
albums
and there we go all right so we have our
application up and running we have it at
my albums so now we're ready to move on
all right so that's going to be it for
this video in the next video we'll jump
into the code and we'll take a look
around and start to build our app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
