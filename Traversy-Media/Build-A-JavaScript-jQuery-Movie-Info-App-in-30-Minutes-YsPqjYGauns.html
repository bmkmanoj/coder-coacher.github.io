creating a movie listings application
using JavaScript jQuery and an HTTP
client called Axios alright so before we
look at the actual app let's take a look
at the API we'll be using this is the OM
DB API and I believe they get all their
data from the IMDB web site but
basically we can just make a simple
request to this URL right here we don't
need any authentication or anything and
it'll give us back a bunch of movies so
basically we can search by ID or title
or we can search by string in the search
box okay and we're going to be actually
be using both and then the client we're
going to use is called Axios I've used
this in a few tutorials before now you
can install this using NPM or Bower if
you want but we're just going to include
the script tag because everything is
going to be on the client side here
alright and then to make a request so
you can just do Axios get put the URL in
and get the response and I'll put it how
we want okay so that's what we'll be
building let's go ahead and take a look
at the app so basically we just search
for something let's say the word home
and click enter it's going to send a
request out to the API and bring back
all those movies that match that query
ok so on this page we have just the
cover of the poster and then the title
and then if we click movie details what
it does is it sets the ID in session
storage and then we make another request
to the API searching for the movie by ID
and we get all this data back and we
format it using bootstrap alright now we
just have a button down here if we want
to look at the movie on IMDB or we can
go back to the search so very simple but
for the amount of code that we're going
to write which is very minimal it
actually gives us quite a bit of
functionality alright so let's go ahead
and get started I'm going to open up my
text editor I'm using atom and for a
server I'm using live server which you
can grab from NPM that will run a PI
server will run your application on port
8080 by default I'm just going to stop
that now
all right and then we're going to create
a project folder so I have
folder called projects and then a folder
called je s and that's where I'm going
to create this project so let's call it
movie info and we're only going to need
a couple files here so let's create the
index.html
okay we're also going to need a movie
dot HTML that's going to be the single
movie page and then we'll create a
folder called CSS and let's create a
folder called jas all right and then in
CSS we're going to have a style sheet so
we'll create a file called style dot CSS
and in the JavaScript let's create a new
file called main jas all right so let's
open this up in atom or whatever your
text editor is see projects j/s movie
info all right so now we have our file
structure and what we're going to do is
I'm going to show you how to install a
live server if you want to use that but
you can use any server you want you can
even run it from your file system so I
would say to make this a little bigger
and I'm going to go into projects j/s
and movie info and you're going to want
to install live server globally so that
you can run it from anywhere so to do
that you need to have no js' installed
and I'm on Linux so I'm using sudo npm
install - g live server okay and that
will get it installed for you and then
it's as simple as running the command
live server from whatever directory you
want okay so let's go ahead and run that
okay live - server and that's going to
open it up on port 8080 okay so let's
open up index.html and then let's put
some standard HTML tags in here I'll
make this bigger okay for a title we'll
just say movie info
and we're going to use bootstrap for
this I'm going to use a customized
version at Booth's watch okay so let's
just grab this cyborg I'm going to click
download and just grab this link okay
we'll put that in here and this will be
stylesheet and we'll paste that in
alright so now we have our bootstrap
link we're also going to link our custom
style sheet so that's a style sheet each
rep is going to be the assess slash
style dot CSS okay so there's our head
data now for the HTML I'm just going to
paste this in I'm going to paste the
navbar in just because it's kind of a
waste of time to type it out most you
guys probably know what's going on here
we just have a nav tag with the navbar
class now by default and we have a
container to contain it into the middle
and then we have the navbar header and
then the brand which is I guess the logo
and it's linked to index.html alright
then we're going to have a Jumbotron
area or a showcase area with the search
form so I'm going to paste that in we
just have a container then a class of
Jumbotron and h3 with the class of text
center and then we have our form which
has the ID of search form okay that's
what we'll use to grab onto it and then
we have one input type text we have the
ID of search text make sure you put that
ID in there and then just a placeholder
alright and then under that we're going
to have a div with the class of
container and this is where we're going
to have our output so basically we just
need a placeholder here because
everything is going to get generated
through JavaScript so let's give it an
ID of movies and also going to give it a
class of row because we're going to be
using the grid system and close that up
okay so now we need to include our
script tags at the bottom we need to
grab jQuery
so let's grab the minified version so
I'll just copy the script tag books and
let's put that right in there
all right we're also going to need the
Axios client so let's just search for X
use NPM click on that and then we're
going to grab this script tag right here
and like I said you can't install it
using Bower and Pam if you want but
we're just doing this the easy way and
then we just need to include our script
so source and that's going to be Maine
dot Jas alright so that should be it for
the markup let's go ahead and save that
and go back to our site here and now we
have our layout for the home page okay
so now we're going to go to our main J's
file and first thing we want to do is we
want to catch a submission of this form
and then we want to take the value and
then call a function called get movies
which will reach out to the API alright
so let's go to our main gif and let's
put in here document dot ready we're
using jQuery and I'm going to use arrow
functions just to keep it es6
so we're going to put a empty set of
parenthesis there and then an arrow and
then our brackets okay so you could just
as well do function okay you could just
as well do that but we're going to stick
to the arrow arrow functions all right
so just to make sure that this is
loading let's do an alert one save that
and this should live reload I'm not sure
why it's not what's going on here let's
open up the console and field to load
resource what do they do
script source name Jas
huh
the hell's going on
oh I didn't put the gif in front of main
j/s there we go alright so now it's
going to live reload good and I'm just
going to put the console at the bottom
whoops
at the bottom okay sorry about that
so what we want to do is create an event
here for when the form is submitted so
let's say ID search form and we want to
say dot on okay so we want to looking
for an event and we want to listen for a
submit and then we're going to have our
callback in the form of an arrow
function and pass along the event so
that we can do II got prevent default
because that's going to stop the form
from actually submitting to a file
alright and then let's do console dot
log just to test this out and we're
going to get search text I believe we
used for the ID that should have a
hashtag right there so search text and
then we want the value so where you're
going to use dot Val
so that should blog whatever we put in
here then you can see it's getting
logged down here alright so what I want
to do is put that value into a variable
so let's say let's search text equals
get rid of this last parenthesis here
alright so putting that in a value and
then we want to call function called get
movies all right and that's going to be
passed in the stretch text okay so we'll
create that function down here let's
test that out I'm going to pass in our
search text parameter and then we'll do
console dot log
searchtext all right so let's say test
and enter so we know that that function
is being called all right so this is
where we want to make our request to the
API so we're going to use Axios here and
we're going to say Axios dot get and put
the URL which is HTTP and 3w wom db-api
comm and then we want to add a parameter
so we put the question mark and then s
equals and then whatever we want to
search for so we want to search for this
text whatever is passed in so right here
we're just going to concatenate search
text all right and then this is going to
return a promise I believe so we're
going to use dot then yeah we'll say dot
then and then in here we want to put a
function so I'll use an arrow and that's
going to give us a response and then
here we can say dot caption case with
any errors and here we'll put an arrow
as well and that's going to give us an
error if there is one and we'll just
console.log that okay so if we get the
data everything goes okay this will run
if there's an error this will run so
let's go ahead and we'll console.log the
response just to see what happens what
we get and let's save that all right so
let's search for the word home and you
can see down here it gave us an object
and we want to look inside of data and
then inside of search and that's going
to have all the different objects okay
all the different results
now since we did the X parameter it's
only giving us some information but then
when we go into the individual page for
the movie we're going to make another
request using the ID which will give us
more stuff but all we need from here
really is the title and the poster okay
so since this is inside data and then
arch what I'm going to do is set a
variable here we'll leave that and we'll
say let let movies equals the response
and then we want to go into data and
then into search all right and that's
going to put that array into this
variable so now that we have that we
want to get our output ready so let's
say let's output we're going to set that
to nothing for now because what we need
to do is loop through this array and
then append each movie onto this
variable and then after we do that we'll
output it all onto the screen so let's
use a jQuery each loop here to iterate
through each movie so in here we're
going to say movies passing in that
array and then we're going to do an
arrow function and this is going to take
index and then the data which I'll call
movie all right so now and here we
should be able to access each movie and
what we're going to do is add it to this
output variable so if we say output plus
equals because we want to append this
and then I'm going to use back ticks
right here not quotes that way we can
use multiple lines so this is actually a
template string and we can include
variables as well alright so in here
let's put a div give it a class call MD
three because we're going to have three
column divs
all right and then inside here let's
create another div with a class of well
and also text Center because I want
every single line to the middle all
right and then we'll put an H five and
that's going to have the movie title now
when we want to use a variable we use
the money sign and then these curly
braces so in here we want to put the
title so we're going to use Ruby dot
title and I want to put the image above
it so it's an image source equal
and then here will do will be dot poster
okay and I'm getting these from here
you'll see if we look here we have the
title and the poster and they they're
uppercase as well alright and then we
just want a link under that so we're
going to put an a tag here and let's
give it an on click event okay we're
going to say on click and it's going to
call a function called a movie selected
alright and then we're going to pass in
the IMD I am DB ID Jesus put the
multiple so we want to put movie dot
IMDB ID I'm getting that from right here
okay and that actually has to be in
quotes or it'll actually look at that as
a variable okay to look at the ID itself
as a variable alright and we want to
give this a class of BTN and BTN primary
and let's just give it an href and put a
number sign Mac and then the text will
say movie details okay so now that we
have our output created we need to
actually output it onto the screen so if
you remember in the index file we have a
div with the ID of movies so we're going
to use that alright so make sure you go
outside of the each loop and then we're
going to say jQuery and movies dot HTML
and then pass in the output all right so
let's save that and now if we make a
search here say home and we get all of
our movies now by default this doesn't
look very good so what we want to do is
make these images within 100% of their
element and I'm also going to set a
height for these alright so what some
going to our style.css alright and let's
see from here with say ID
movies and we're also going to have an
idea of movie for the single pages so
actually we just want the image from
both of these okay so the image we're
going to set a width of a hundred
percent of the container and you'll see
that it will shrink them down
alright let's also set a height for
these feel some are bigger than others
we can make that look a little better by
seeing movies and then we want the call
and III and then the well class okay and
we're going to set a height of three
hundred and ninety pixels I also want to
set a height for the images themselves
so let's say movies dot call MD three
image and let's set a height of 240
pixels okay so now these are all the
same size I mean this title has three
lines so it kind of moves it down a
little more but that's fine alright now
if I go when I stretch this down I want
to make this responsive and that's not
very responsive as far as the images so
I want to remove the height restriction
if it's at a certain point if it's below
960 pixels so I'm going to wrap these in
a media query so we can say media and
just wrap both of these alright and then
here we're going to set a min width of
960 pixels so this will only show this
will only be in effect if it's lower
than 960 pixels all right so now when
you view it on a mobile device it looks
fine okay and we go back up and we have
the height restriction alright so that's
it for this page now we want to work on
the movie dot HTML file so let's go into
that and I'm going to copy everything we
have an index
and then put that into movie alright and
we're going to keep the navbar but we're
going to get rid of this whole Jumbotron
section and then in this container right
here we're just going to change this to
movie and we're going to give it a class
of well alright and that's going to be
our placeholder for the individual movie
alright now when this page opens we want
it to run a function called get movie so
down here we're just going to add a
script tag and let's run get movie and
that's all we have to do for this file
so let's save that and then let's go
back to main jf oops all right now
remember when we click a single movie
it's going to call a function called
movie selected and we haven't created
that yet so let's do that now
so we'll be selective and that's going
to take in an ID alright and the way
that we're going to pass data from one
page to another is through local session
storage which is very similar to local
storage except it clears out when your
browser is closed so to save the ID
let's say session storage dot sets item
and we're going to set an item called
movie ID and set it to that ID value all
right then we want to change the page
because we want to go to the win the
movie dot HTML file so let's say window
dot location equals movie dot HTML all
right and then we're going to return
false so let's save that and we'll type
in home and click details and it sets
the storage it says get movie isn't
declined because we haven't created that
yet but if we look in our application
tab here and go to session storage
you'll see we have the movie ID stored
all right so we can
access that in the get movie function
all right which will create now so let's
go around here and say function get
movie alright and we want to get the
movie ID from local storage so let's
create a variable and set that to
session storage dot get item and we want
to get the item that is called movie ID
all right then we want to make another
request using Axios so I'm going to grab
this whole request that we did up here
right down to here and copy and let's
paste that in here and we just want to
change this s to a not of T and I
because we're searching by ID now okay
so this is going to be movie ID and then
let's get rid of all of this for now all
of that and with just console.log our
response just to make sure that we're
actually getting it all right so let's
save that and then it reloaded and you
can see what we get as a response if we
look in data that's our object that has
all that stuff in it all right so we
want to put that as our variable here so
let's let's who actually will leave the
response and then we'll say let movie
equals response dot data data lower case
B all right so now we want to do is
create our output for this page just
like we did above now we don't have to
do a loop because it's just one object
it's not an array like we had with all
the movies alright so let's go ahead and
create out so you want to create an
output variable and set that to some
back ticks so that we can use a template
string and let's create a div give it a
class actually I think we already have
the row class yeah right here
that's where it's going to be look
that's not right movie dot html' oh no
we don't have the row class so we have
to do that here all right and then we're
going to have a four call and if so call
em g4 and econ did all right and we're
going to have our image in the four
chrome dev so image source and let's set
that to movie dot poster all right I'm
also going to give this a class of
thumbnail okay save that and hope we
didn't output it yet I just we have more
markup to put here but I just want to
test it so down here let's say I want to
grab the ID of the movie and then say
dot HTML and we want to pass in the
output all right so now we have the
image okay so on this side on the eighth
column we want to put so you want to put
the title first of all in h2 so movie
dot title and then we're going to put a
list group which is a bootstrap element
and then we're going to have allies to
the class of list group item and here
let's put genre and then we'll set movie
dot Chandra let's actually put the
labels and strong tags alright so we're
going to copy this take that in a bunch
of times so we'll house will have
released set that to released and well
rated rated we can put the IMDB rating
that's going to be in IMDB rating right
and let's see the director the writer
and the actors alright
and then we're going to have another row
under this div alright and then here
let's put this with the class of well
and let's put the 8 we're going to put
an H 3 into a plot and then we want to
put movie dot plot and then let's put
out an HR under that and then we want
the two links or the two buttons so href
and look and this is going to go to http
imdb.com / title / and then the ID okay
let's make that open in a new window and
give it a class of BTN and BTN primary
alright and this is going to say view
IMDB
alright then we're going to have another
link it's just going to go indexed on
HTML
we'll give it a class of BTN and BTN
default and I'll say go back to search
alright save that and there we go make
sure that works yep
and we can go back to search all right
let's say we want to search for a blade
get all these movies and we can look at
the details awesome so that's going to
be a guide hopefully you enjoyed this I
might actually turn this into a hybrid
mobile app by using something like
PhoneGap or cordova because it's
something that is contained and we could
we could do that we could put it in a
web view for a mobile app so it's
something that I may do because I'm
working on a mobile course now for edge
wanax but I'm not sure yet so hopefully
you guys enjoyed this please subscribe
