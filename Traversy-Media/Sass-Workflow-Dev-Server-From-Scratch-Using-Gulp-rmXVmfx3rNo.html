on a SAS crash course ass is a CSS
preprocessor a pre compiler this was
requested by a couple of my patrons and
I wanted to use the sass starter pack
that I created which is a really nice
dev workflow for creating sass projects
but I wanted to first make a video
showing you how to actually create this
okay so what we're gonna do is I have it
already on github here feel free to
clone it download it but we're gonna
recreate it and I'm gonna show you how
to use gulp
how to use the gulp sass plug-in and how
to use browser sync those are the three
dependencies that we're going to use in
this project and basically it's going to
give us a dev server that's going to
compile sass on-the-fly
and before we start building and I'm
going to show you how to use it which is
very simple all we have to do is
download it run NPM install NPM start
and it's gonna start up our dev server
and it has auto load it's just a really
nice way to create sass projects so what
I'm gonna do here is just download the
zip file and we'll go ahead and open
that and let's see I'm gonna create a
folder I'll just call it I'll just call
it test for now and we're gonna bring
over the files from the starter package
our starter pack and let's go ahead and
open up git bash or open up whatever
terminal or command line that you're
using and all we have to do is simply
run npm install and if we take a look at
the files here let me just open this in
visual studio code and if we look at
package jason the only three
dependencies we're using are these dev
dependencies so we have gulp which is
the java script task runner gulps asks
to compile the sass and browser sync to
actually stream to the browser okay so
that's that npm install is is what
that's what it's installing and then if
we go and we run npm start because you
can see right here I've put I've created
a start script or an
p.m. script called start that's gonna
call gulp that way we don't even have to
install gulp globally to run this
alright so we'll go ahead and run that
and PM start it's gonna compile
everything and it's gonna open up your
dev server ok so let's look at the
source folder now the style dot s CSS
file is is the sass file and you can see
we set a variable of background color to
dark gray we set it as the body
background and that's what you're seeing
let me just make this let's split this
that's what you're seeing right here ok
so when we ran npm start it took our
sass file and it compiled it into this
CSS folder into a regular style CSS and
that's what this is right here
alright now if we go and we change for
instance the background color variable
like to blue and we just save it's gonna
auto load ok if we change the color here
color if we change the color to black
and save you'll see that that's gonna
auto load as well ok if we clear this
out and save and if we go when we edit
the HTML file like let's change the h1
to hello and save and you'll see that
gets auto updated so this is going to
compile your sass on-the-fly and also
give you this nice dev server that auto
loads really quickly so this is what
we're gonna build so we'll put it
together and then we'll go ahead and
we'll just add some markup and some sass
just - I don't know build like kind of a
simple little project using the starter
pack so that's it let's go ahead and get
into it
alright guys so what we're gonna do here
is start from absolute scratch I'm going
to create a folder and whatnot a
shortcut we're gonna create a new folder
called sass underscore starter
underscore pack and I'm gonna open that
up with Visual Studio code which is the
text editor I'm using now you're also
going to want to open a command line in
this folder whether you're using a
Windows command line or a Linux or Mac
terminal I'm using git bash if you want
that for Windows you can go to get - SCM
as
see em calm and go ahead and download it
I also have it integrated with Visual
Studio code so if I go to integrated
terminal you'll see that's what's being
used down here now I have an empty
obviously guys know we just created the
empty folder SAS starter pack and what
we're gonna do first is we're going to
create a package.json file so to do this
we're gonna run a command npm in it now
you have to have no js' installed for
this to use npm which is node package
manager if you don't have no js' just go
to node.js org download it and install
it
alright so let's run that and we're just
gonna go through this so name that's
fine version that's good description
will just say boilerplate for SAS
projects entry point that's fine
author I'm just gonna leave it blank
license I'll just say MIT all right so
now if we look at our package JSON file
that's what we should have now we're
gonna have to install our dependencies
so we're gonna have a couple I'm just
going to clear this out real quick I'm
gonna have what we're gonna have a
couple dev dependencies so we're gonna
have gulp gulp SAS and browser sync so
let's say npm install we're gonna add
the flag - - save - dev and then gulp
gulp - sass and then browser - sync okay
so let's go ahead and run that and since
we did save dev it should add those up
as dev dependencies to our package dot
JSON file
alright and then while that's going on
let's create our source folder so it's a
new folder SRC and the only folder we're
going to need to create in here manually
is our SAS folder which is gonna be s
CSS okay and then we're gonna have one
file in there called style dot s CSS
alright and then just to put something
in here I'm going to add a variable
called body BG alright and we're gonna
set that to
let's say blue all right and then we'll
put our body tag and we'll say we want
the background set to BG color or if I'm
sorry body BG and save all right so now
we know we have our source folder with a
SAS file in there so now what we want to
do is create our gulp file because we
need to create the tasks to actually
compile the SAS and then also run our
dev server run browser sync so let's go
ahead and create a new folder called
gulp file now you don't want to put this
in your source folder this should be in
the root
okay so let's create gulp file dot Jas
all right now as far as the gulp file
goes this is gonna be pretty simple
we're just gonna bring in our three
dependencies so gulp itself so we want
to require lips require gulp we also
want to require browser sync so we're
gonna set that to require and here we
want browser - sync and then we also
need to add on to this dot create okay
which is a function and then we just
want to bring in gulps ass I'm gonna
call it sass so gulp - sass all right
now that we brought those in let's
create our first task so this is going
to compile sass now to create a gulp
task we just do gulp task and I do
actually have a gulp crash course if you
want to check that out made it a cup a
few months ago I think and we're gonna
call this sass and then we're gonna run
a function okay so for this function
we're gonna say return gulp dot source
and in here we want to put in whatever
files whatever sass files we want to get
compiled into regular CSS so we're gonna
put in here our source folder /s CSS
slash and then NES CSS file so asterisk
dot s CSS okay anything that's in there
oops should be a slash right here so s
CSS slash asterisk s CSS and then we're
going to go on to the next line and do a
pipe because we need to tell it where to
compile to so we're gonna say golf desks
which is just gulp destination and that
is actually going to be source slash CSS
all right so hopefully you guys
understand what's going on it's gonna
look in this location for SAS files and
then compile it into this location and
it'll actually create the CSS folder for
us we don't have to manually create it
alright and then we need to just need to
do actually I skipped a step there
should be another pipe right here and we
just need to throw in the SAS function
like that alright and then one last pipe
at the end I can't type and this is
going to be browser sync we're gonna say
browser sync dot stream okay because we
need to stream it to the browser that's
our first task our second and last task
is going to be to watch and serve okay
so we'll say gulp dot task and we'll
call this serve and then we just need to
add a second parameter which will have
the staffs task in it like that and then
a function alright and then in this
function we're gonna say browser sync
dot and knit we're gonna initialize
browser sync pass in a configuration
object with a server value that server
value is going to be the folder that we
want to serve in a browser which is
going to be our source folder okay
that's where our we're gonna put an
index.html file in there did we do that
no we didn't do that yet but we will all
right and then under that we just want
to run a couple gulp dot watch functions
here which is just going to constantly
watch files we want it to watch our
sass files so we're gonna put in an
array here with the file names which is
gonna be source slash SCSS slash
asterisk dot s CSS just like we did
above alright and then we need to put
another parameter here and put some
brackets in and just say sass
alright and then we're gonna do another
gulp dot watch and then this one is
gonna be for our HTML files because we
want to be able to edit an HTML file and
have it auto load into our browser our
sink into our browser so let's put in
here source slash and then any HTML file
so asterisk dot HTML and then we can
simply do dot on so we're gonna do our
dot on change meaning whenever an HTML
file changes then what do we want to do
we want to call browser sync dot reload
okay because we want it to reload
automatically and that's it now we just
need our default task so we do that with
gulp dot task and we call it default and
all we want to happen is to run an array
of tasks which will just be the serve
okay now if you want this is this is um
what the hell's the word I'm looking for
scalable because if we wanted to let's
say atom in of ice and task we could do
gulp task minify and so on and then we
could just add that to the array down
here and it will it will run minify as
the default alright so let's go ahead
and save this now in order to run this
with the gulp command you're going to
need the gulp CLI tool installed
globally so you can do NPM install - G
gulp - CLI alright now I'm gonna be
creating us an NPM script so that we can
just do NPM start if you wait and you
and you you do that and you don't care
about running gulp right now you don't
have
to do this but just to show you can now
we can run gulp okay and what it did is
it compiled all of our sass if we look
in this in the source folder now we have
a CSS file with a style dot CSS file I'm
sorry a CSS folder with a style.css file
with body background blue so this was
actually compiled from our sass file
right here alright and then what it did
is it opened up our dev server now it
says cannot get slash because there's no
HTML file in our source folder for it to
load so let's go ahead and add that so
in the source we'll say new file index
dot HTML and let's add some HTML now I'm
using Emmet so I can just - exclamation
tab and it'll give me a basic structure
for the title let's just say sass
starter pack and save now since we
created the HTML file after we ran the
server we'll have to stop it with ctrl C
and then we'll run gulp it should reopen
and now you'll see the HTML file is
actually loaded alright now I don't want
to have to run gulp so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna stop the server I'm gonna
go into my package dot JSON file and I'm
gonna create a script here okay I'm
gonna replace the test because we don't
need that and I'm gonna put start and
then I'm gonna say gulp alright we'll
save that and now we can run NPM start
to start the server but before we do
that let's add some stuff to the
index.html so we're gonna want to link
the CSS file that was compiled the style
dot CSS so let's go ahead and put a link
tag in here it's gonna go to CSS slash
style dot CSS and then down here we'll
just put just put an h1 and we'll say a
sass starter pack ok and then we'll save
that and let's run the server with NPM
start
okay so it's gonna compile it and it's
going to run the dev server and notice
that we have a blue background that's
because if we look in our sass file we
have our variable body BG set to blue
and we have the body background set to
that variable if I were to change this
to red and save it'll automatically
update okay and we're all set we're all
set to start writing sad so that's the
gist of what I wanted to show you just
how to create the starter pack this is
what we have uploaded on github now what
I'm gonna do is just go a little bit
further and just create a very very
simple project not a stylish website or
anything like that but just some
examples using sass I guess kind of an
intro to sass and some of the features
that it offers so let's go in our index
file and we're gonna create a header
with an ID of main header okay and then
in here we're gonna have a class of
container and then we're gonna have an
h1 and we'll just say sass website okay
so under the header let's create a
simple navigation I will say nav we'll
give it an idea of main nav book should
be hash main nav and this navigation the
links aren't gonna go anywhere it's just
for show really we're gonna put a
container in here as well and then let's
put our UL and in here we're gonna put
an li let's put a link inside this li
we'll give it an href to go nowhere and
content we'll say home alright and
that's just Emmet right there so now
what I'll do is just copy this we'll put
in a couple more let's do home about
services and contact
alright so that'll be our navigation and
we're gonna style that using sass and I
just want to sections so it's a section
idea of section - a
and in here we're gonna have a container
and then we're gonna have an h1 o h1 I'm
doing I'm using control tab for Emmet
which is really kind of screwing me up
lately so when the h1 let's have let's
will say lorem 10 which will give us 10
words I'm just gonna turn on rap for you
guys so you can see everything
toggle word rap and under the h1 I'm
gonna put a link and let's give it a
class of button - I'll do button - eh
alright and that'll just say read more
and then I'm gonna copy this section a
paste another one underneath change it
to Section B and change the button to
button B okay then that's going to be it
for our markup so now let's go to our
sass file style s CSS and we'll just get
rid of this and let's go ahead and add
our variables up at the top so we will
do a body variable let's call it body
- BG just so we can easily change the
background I'm gonna just set it to
white though for now alright we'll also
have a main font and we'll set that to
Arial alright and you can set whatever
whatever variables you want you know
whatever you want to put in the variable
you can do that usually what I do is
I'll have a primary color a secondary
color and then some greyish colors I'll
keep those in the variables so that I
can quickly change those and they'll
read a litter 8 throughout the site so
let's create a primary color and this is
actually going to be like a like a TLS
color just paste that in and with v/s
code you can actually see the color
which is nice let's set a secondary
color and all this is just for fun I'm
not creating anything special here just
kind of give you an overview of of what
you can do with sass so we'll also do a
light color which will be like a light
gray so let's do
for three times and then we'll do a dark
color which will set to triple three all
right so there's our colors now let's
start to add our CSS rules so we're
gonna add four actually before we do the
body I'm just gonna add a reset so we'll
take we'll say asterisk which basically
means everything all elements we want to
just take away the margin and padding
all right because by default you can see
that like the h1 the UL these have
default margin and padding I want to
remove all of that so I'm gonna save and
you'll see that every all that all the
spacing is removed so for the body we're
gonna say background and let's set it to
our BG color is it what does it know
it's body BG set it to that and let's
see we'll set the font let's set the
font family to our main font variable
and we're also going to align everything
to the center okay there we go let's add
some styling for links so links I just
want to take away the underline so
text-decoration:none let's make the
color dark grey all right so now we're
gonna move on to the container
okay container I'm gonna set a max width
and then I usually like to put the
container inside a variable too so up
here we'll create a variable called
container and let's set that to I will
say 960 pixels so that's going to be the
max width so down here we can put
container look container and then let's
set margin Auto so that it's set to the
middle and then we'll set padding:0 on
the top and bottom and 20 pixels on the
left and right save that and now if I
were to stretch this out you'll see that
it'll get constrained into 960 max
all right so next thing we're gonna do
is the header okay so the header area
with the h1 so remember we gave it an ID
of main header okay so in here let's set
the padding to will say 1m we'll set the
background color or I'll just say
background for short and we'll set that
to the primary color variable look why
is that not working primary color
setting the background did the server
stop I must have had an error
let's see very yeah since I messed up
the variable variable name the server
stops so we'll just have to do NPM start
again and there we go so now we have the
background color now I'm gonna show you
a really cool function that will
actually look at the background color of
an element and then decide if the text
should be dark or light so let's go up
to the top here and under the variables
let's create put a comment will say
functions and we can define a function
by doing at function and we're gonna
call this set text color
okay so set text color and it's gonna
take in a parameter of a background
color so we'll just say BG color and
then what I wanted to do is I wanted to
look at that color and see if it's if
it's a if it's at a certain lightness
then the text should be dark if it's at
a certain darkness it should be light so
we can actually use if statements will
say at if and SAS has a function called
lightness
so if lightness is or we have to pass in
the BG color it needs to know what to
look at so if the lightness of the BG
color is greater than 50 then
and we want to return we want to return
black as the text color alright then
we'll do an else and we'll say return
white as the color is that right no we
need to do a tells like that alright so
now we have our set text color now let's
go back down to the header and for the
color we're gonna say set - text color
and then it needs to know what the
background color is so that it can you
can give us the right text color now you
can see we're using primary color as the
background so that's what we want to
pass into that alright and we'll save
and now you can see it's white now if I
were to go up and change the primary
color to some kind of light color like
let's say white and save now the text is
black okay so that's just a really handy
function really handy function that I
learned a while ago that I use all the
time when I use sass so let's continue
on with the nav actually one more thing
the h1 in the header I just want to I
want to make it a little bigger now you
can nest in sass as well so instead of
you know saying instead of doing this
main header h1 and so on we can actually
just put the h1 right inside here like
this so we can structure it kind of like
the HTML so I'm just gonna set the font
size to let's say 40 pixels alright and
that's it so let's move on to the
navigation so it's a nav with the ID of
main nav and we're gonna set the
background background for the nav is
gonna be the secondary color variable so
secondary color and let's set the height
of the nav to 40 pixels
and then we can nest inside here the UL
we can nest in the Li and we can nest in
the a tag all right now the Li I want to
display actually first of all let's
remove the bullets so we'll go to the UL
and we'll say list-style:none okay and
we want the allies to display inline
oops
display inline save let's also add a
little bit of padding to the UL to the
top I'll sleep padding top 10 pixels and
for the links let's change the color to
white and let's also say padding right
I'm not saying this is the best navbar
I'm just doing this really quickly so 20
pixels separate them a little bit and
then we can do a hover inside the a tag
here we can say ampere Sam :
hover and we can set that to let's say
light grey so I'll do triple C and now
you can see we have a hover event or not
a hover event but a hover effect so
that's the navigation now let's take
care of the two sections so remember we
have an idea of section - a now what I
want to show you now is the extend
function or the extend feature of SAS so
let's say we want to do class section ok
and then in this section class we want a
padding now the padding I'm actually
gonna put in a variable so let's go up
to the top here and let's create a
variable called section - padding
alright we're gonna set that to 20
pixels still spelt that wrong okay 20
pixels and then down here we'll set the
padding to that very
section padding and I also want to set
the h1 inside the section class to have
a margin bottom of 30 pixels just to
push the button down or I'm sorry the
link down so if we save that nothing's
going to happen because we don't have
the section class on these section tags
we just have our IDs now what extending
allows us to do is we don't even have to
add a class here of section we can
simply go down here we can say at extend
dot section like that and we'll save and
now you can see it's added the padding
and the h1 margin to section a okay we
want to apply it to Section B as well so
we'll go ahead and whoops go ahead and
paste that in and we'll say section B
save and it'll apply it to that as well
all right now the background for section
a I want to be the light color so we're
gonna say background set it to the
variable we created of light color save
that you can see now it's like grey
we're also going to use our little car
set text color function that we created
so we can grab this right here paste it
in now we don't want to leave primary
color here because section a actually
has a background color of light color I
want to make sure that we pass that in
instead and save we're not going to see
any difference because the text was
already dark alright now we want to do
the same thing for section B so what
I'll do is just copy these two lines
except I want to use the dark color as
the background and that also means we
have to pass it in dark color right here
as well and save and now you can see we
have our dark color the text is
automatically white because we used our
set text function all right I hope I'm
not losing you guys here now the next
thing I want to do is the buttons okay
these two buttons member button a and
button B and we're gonna do the same
thing with the extend we're gonna create
a button class and this button class is
going to have the
of 10 pixels 15 pixels we're also going
to actually know that's it
now we don't have a button class on our
buttons that we just have an idea of
section of I'm sorry a class of button a
and button B so what we'll do is we'll
add in those classes here button - a and
we're going to extend dot button and
then add our extra classes which is
going to be the background background
will be the primary color okay we'll
save that you can see it as the primary
color notice how the text is doc though
so we want to apply our set text color
function and then just change this to
primary color that we pass in and save
and now it has the correct text color so
we'll do the same with button B let's
copy that paste it in now button B I
want to have the secondary color as the
background so we have to change this as
well save that and there we go alright
so let's see I don't think I really want
to go any further than that that's most
of the SAS features we could also darken
and lighten things so let's say for the
background for button a we wanted to
lighten this primary color up a bit
actually let's darken this one and
lighten this one so we could surround it
in a function called darken and just
pass in a second parameter of a
percentage we'll say 10% and we'll save
and you can see it's now darker and down
here for the secondary for button B
let's say lighten I'll surround that and
we'll do also 10% save and now that's
lighter all right now let's take a look
at separating these into files okay so
let's say we want the very
and the functions in partials okay a
partial is just that it's a partial file
so in s CSS we're gonna create a new
file called underscore variables dot s
CSS now the underscore is very important
because it signifies that this is a
partial meaning that when we compile our
sass it shouldn't create a variables dot
CSS file in the CSS folder it should
just simply include the code into the
main file so let's copy all of our
variables we'll cut them out paste them
in there and save and then we can simply
do at import variables and save and
you'll see there's no change so let's do
the same thing with the functions will
create a new when I do a new file called
func underscore functions dot s CSS and
we'll just grab our one function here
paste it in there save it and then we're
gonna just import functions and notice
we don't have to put the dot CSS we
don't have to put the underscore either
save it and it still works all right now
just to show you how powerful sass is
let's say that this was a big
application or a big website with you
know a bunch of different sass files and
you wanted to take a look at you know
different color combinations so let's
change up the primary color let's change
up all of these colors really quickly
I'm just gonna comment them out actually
you know what I'll do is copy them and
let's say we wanted to change this color
to let's say black now let's say red
I'll change this one to black we'll
change the light color to
oh let's see we'll do just do five five
five I guess and we'll do let's let's
pick a color hair so we'll do like a
dark red whoops we'll do like that okay
and save and we have an error
oh I'm missing the semicolon here there
we go so we'll just have to run NPM
start again and there we go so it opens
up it's a completely different color
scheme and it's as easy as that now this
is a very small website so I mean it's
not really needed to use sass here but
just imagine that there's something
bigger where you know you would have to
go through and you would have to change
every instance of that color where with
sass you can just simply change the
variables file same thing with like
section padding if we wanted to make
that bigger and we'll change it to 40
and save if we wanted to change the font
like let's say we want to change it to
two Homa Save Changes the font so sass
is really powerful and I guess with this
little example I can't really show you
that but you can just imagine for a
bigger application and then as far as
deploying all you have to worry about is
your HTML and your CSS folder okay so in
this case we just have two files index
HTML and CSS and let me just give you an
example of that I'm just gonna open up
FileZilla and let's say you went through
you use the sass starter pack to create
a really nice website and now you want
to upload it so you would connect to
your website I'm gonna create a folder
on my remote host called test and let's
open up our project folder and what I
would do is just grab in the source
folder the HTML and the CSS file folder
and we'll upload that
and then we'll open up a new tab and
we'll say traversÃ©e media.com slash
test and there it is
okay that's all you need is those files
right there everything else the gulp
file the package dot Jason this is just
your dev environment okay this is your
workflow so I think that's gonna be it
guys this video went a little longer
than expected
my main focus was to create the starter
pack so you guys can create your own
projects but I took it a little further
and just created a little something here
nothing special but just to give you
some examples of some ass at some of the
features of sass alright so thanks for
