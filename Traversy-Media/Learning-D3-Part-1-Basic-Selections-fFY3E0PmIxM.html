miniseries I'll be covering the d3
JavaScript library our data-driven
documents and this is another JavaScript
library but it's unique because it
focuses on visualization all right so
it's used to take pieces of data and
turn them into charts or graphs or maps
or pretty much anything that is visual
so it is Dom manipulation library so we
can use it like we use jQuery if you in
fact if we know jQuery then you already
have a pretty good head start on how
this works on selecting Dom elements and
all that all right so I'm gonna start
with I'm gonna assume that you don't
even know what d3 is all right so this
is for the beginners that are just
trying to learn how the how the library
works all right so in this video we're
gonna focus on just basic selections how
to grab data from the Dom and do
something to it alright just like you
would with jQuery so I'm gonna start off
I'm just gonna have one index.html file
probably through the whole series
through the whole course so what I'm
gonna do is just set up some basic
structure and let's just call this
learning d3 all right now to actually
use it there's no complicated
installation there's no CLI or anything
like that all you have to do is include
this script tag alright and you have you
access to the entire library so I'm
gonna copy that throw that in and I'm
just going to add HTTP
all right and what I'm gonna do now is
I'm gonna create just an unordered list
so I'll give this a class of items and
we'll have some list item this this will
be item you know what we'll just say
this is an item okay and I'm just gonna
copy this and we're going to just have a
bunch of these okay so simple unordered
list now if we look at the documentation
or actually this is the home page and we
go down to it says selections it's going
to show you how you could in standard
JavaScript how you could color all your
paragraphs
alright so every paragraph on the page
you want to make white so in standard
JavaScript we would have to use this get
elements by tag name method select all
the paragraphs then we'd have to loop
through them we'd have to call a for
loop and on each iteration we're gonna
grab that paragraph and then we're gonna
add the style and we're gonna set the
color to white alright using d3 you can
do the same thing with this this one
line of code
so we're saying d3 dot select all and
then we're choosing the element that we
want to select and if you know jQuery
then you should fully understand what
this is doing we're calling the style
function or method and we're just
turning all of the paragraphs white
alright so let's do that here except I'm
using list items okay so we're gonna
have our script tags at the bottom
and let's do d3 dot select all and we
want to select all the list items and
then we'll say dot style and let's say
we want the color to be red
all right so we'll save that and let's
open that up
okay so there's our list and you can see
that every list item is now red okay
with just this one line of code now if
we want to just select one then we can
use just d3 dot select okay so if I save
that and we reload now we only get the
first li that it finds is going to be
red so what if you want to target one of
these other ones not just the first one
well if you know css3 and you know about
the different selectors that you can use
then you probably know ant child so we
can use that here and then let's say we
want the second one we'll just throw in
two n all right so if we save that and
reload and now you can see that the
second one is now red all right and we
can choose whichever one we want we'll
say for n and that's gonna do the fourth
so not only can you do that but you can
also choose the odd allies okay so if we
reload now since we're using select it's
only going to get the first odd if we
want all of them then we're gonna have
to say select all all right so if we
reload that it's gonna go ahead and
select all odds and of course we can do
the same thing with even reload that
it's gonna get all the evens all right
so you can see how simple this is to
select elements now changing the style
isn't the only thing we can do let's say
we want to change the content so we
could actually just add on to this just
like is if we were using jQuery we can
use this dot syntax and let's change the
actual HTML we'll change the content and
we'll just say
this is this is an even number all right
because we're getting all the evens if
we reload it's going to change that text
for us all right let's say we want to
add a class we can use the classed
method and let's give it a class called
big and then we get it just adding true
and then up here I'll create some style
tags and we'll create a class called big
and we'll set the font size to 24 pixels
all right so if we reload now you can
see that the even numbers now are have
24 of 24 pixel font size all right so
this is how we can do just very basic
selections so in the next video I'm
going to show you how we can actually
bind data to the DOM and do different
things with it
all right so I will see you in the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
