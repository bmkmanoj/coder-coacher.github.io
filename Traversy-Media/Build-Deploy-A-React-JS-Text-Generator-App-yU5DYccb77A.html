pretty small project but it is actually
pretty useful so we're going to be
building a sample text generator using
react Jas along with a specific API
that's used for returning lip 'some or
alarm if some dummy text or sample text
and this is going to be completely
dynamic so you see we have this bunch of
paragraphs here these are being sent
from the API and then we have two input
boxes here paragraphs which is the
number box we can go ahead and change
this and you'll see if I change it to
three we'll get three paragraphs change
it to two change it to one and it's it's
direct response we don't have to submit
a form or anything and then notice that
they have these these paragraph tags if
you want to not include HTML you can
just go ahead and say no and that will
just take the HTML tags away okay so
pretty easy to use it's similar to let's
say lips um comm where you can go and
you can specify a number of power graphs
and generate those okay so it's kind of
like that now this is this is included
in not this exact project are these
exact videos but something just like it
is included in one of my courses which
is if you go to travesty Mediacom slash
edge' wanax courses it's actually right
here projects in react GIS so there's
ten projects and this is one of them or
this is like one of them and if you do
buy courses from if you buy my edge
wanax courses please get them through
either travesty media edge ilanics
courses because it's a special affiliate
link or through the description in my
youtube videos okay all right now the
api that we're going to be using is that
hipster jesus calm and it's very very
simple
it hasn't this has an end point we just
need to make a get request to it and we
can add a long parameter
such as parens which will be the number
of paragraphs you want returned the type
which we're not going to mess with and
then HTML which is a true or false
letting it know if you actually want the
paragraph tags included or not okay so
we're going to go ahead and get started
now we're going to use the create react
app tool so if we go to say don't know
the exact URL but the main react website
and go to get started and then click on
this installation link you'll see what
we need to do is install that create
react app globally and then we can just
generate a boilerplate application so
let's do that I'm going to open up a new
terminal make that a little bigger and
you can go ahead and stop this one and
close that and we're going to do NPM
actually I mean a bun too so I need to
do sudo NPM install - JEE create react
app okay and you can use this from
anywhere if you install it globally that
went really fast because I actually
already have it installed now you want
to go to your projects folder or
wherever you want to create your new
application I'm going to go to projects
and then I'm going to say create react
app and we're going to call this sample
text Jen okay and that will go ahead and
create the package now if you're very
new to react GIS I would suggest
watching my crash course on react once
you do that you should have all
everything you need to know in order to
build this application it's really not
hard at all basically we're just going
to make a request with a component
called Axios and then we're going to
take that result put it into our web
page and then we're also going to create
the controls which will be the text and
the soul
act and then we'll be able to change
those options okay whether we want to
change the number of paragraphs or
change HTML displayed or not okay so
that's all set now we're going to CD
into sample text gen and let's run NPM
start okay that'll start up the dev
server on port 3000 and you should see
this okay it's just the standard
boilerplate so now we want to do is open
up our text editor I'm using atom but
you can use whatever you like and just
going to add this folder of the project
okay so we don't have too many files
here basically in the source folder
that's where all of our components will
go there's an app CSS file here which
gives it this this look I'm going to
actually get rid of everything in this
file and save it okay and then in app
gif this is our main app component where
we bring in everything else we're going
to get rid of this logo import and then
we're also going to get rid of
everything within this div right here
and we'll just put in hello for now save
that okay index CSS we can get rid of
that and save it and then index J s we
can leave this is basically kind of like
the bootstrap it brings in react and
react on and then the app component CSS
and then it calls react on render and
it's going to render that main app
component and it puts it inside of an
element that has the ID of root and then
if we go to our public index HTML file
you'll see right here is a div with the
idea of root so that's where it's
getting put okay we can delete the logo
SVG file we don't need that
our and then in the index.html let's get
rid of these comments clean this up a
little ok we'll change the title here to
sample text generator and then I want to
use bootstrap but I'm going to use a
customized boot swap boots watch version
okay I'm just going to grab let's say
this readable right here click download
and then I'm just going to grab this
link here and then we're going to use
that if you want if you want to actually
download it and include it in your file
structure that's fine too all right so
let's paste that in and then we should
be good for the index file so we'll save
that close it up all right let's see now
what we want to do is make our request
to the hipster API and then grab grab
that data so we're going to install a an
extra module here I'm going to just do a
ctrl C to stop the dev server and then
we're going to do NPM install
Axios - - save and if you want to look
at that documentation for Axios so you
want to go to the github
and see you can install it with NPM or
Bower or a script tag and then you can
perform get requests like this Axios get
and then it's a promise so you want to
use dot then and then your callback will
include your response so it's pretty
easy to use all right so that's done
let's go ahead and run NPM start again
and then we're going to import
Axios Axios from Axios and let's create
a constructor right here and our
constructor let's pass in props in case
any props properties were passed in and
then we need to call super props okay
now this is where we're going to set our
state now in react your components can
have state which can just basically hold
any kind of values it's basically an
adjacent object that holds values that
you can use throughout the component so
let's say this start state set it to an
object and we want to set Paris as an
option and I'll say for by default HTML
will stay true and then text will will
hold the actual return text but for now
it will be just nothing okay once we
make the request to hipster and we get
the sample text back will populate this
field all right now when we make
requests to API it's good to put it
inside of a lifecycle function called
component will mount okay that's
typically the place in in the rendering
where you want to do that now I could
put the code directly in here but I'm
actually just going to call another
function called get text or get sample
text
all right and then we'll create that
right below it all right so in this
function is where we want to use Axios
get okay you could pass in the URL which
is this right here okay and we can add
parameters to it as well so let's go
ahead and do that we're going to put a
question mark and we'll say Paris equals
and then we just want to concatenate the
powers we have in the state okay which
right now is 4 and then after that let's
say and HTML equals and then again we'll
concatenate this dog state HTML okay now
this is actually returning a promise so
we need to use dot then okay so make
sure you didn't put a semicolon right
here that should just go to dot Bend and
then inside then say response and we use
an arrow here and then we want to set
the state we want to take the text that
that it responds with and put it into
this value here so this dot set state
and we want to set text to response dot
data dot text
that should be like that all right and
then right after that we're going to
have a callback function and we don't
really have to do anything here but I
guess we'll just console dot log
well console dot log in the stock state
all right now if this get request has
some kind of error we want to be able to
catch that so let's get rid of that
semicolon and we'll say dot catch and
then this catch will take error and then
we'll just go ahead and console dot log
that error okay so that's our request so
just to reiterate it makes a request to
this API we're specifying the paragraphs
and also if we want HTML returned and
then it go it returns this response and
then we're setting the state of text to
that response text okay so we should be
able to run this let's save it and let's
go to our application and I'm going to
open up the console
let's see console is not define where
did I do that wrong right here
okay so if you look down here we got an
object HTML true powers 4 and then we
have our text field which got populated
with 4 paragraphs okay so we know that
the request is working or getting that
data we're setting it to the state now
we want to output it onto the screen so
I want to create a special output
component for this so in the source
folder I'm going to create a folder
called component and let's create a file
called output dot gif all right this is
going to be our output component so
let's say port react component from
react create our class which will be
called output and that's going to extend
component and let's create a constructor
now this output is going to take in a
property which will be the actual text
so let's say props and when we do that
we have to do super props as well and
then we want to set up state this got
state equals an object and we're going
to set up value instead of two props dot
value so whatever is passed in as a
property as the value is going to go
into the state value as well and then
after the constructor we're going to
have the render so we want to return it
give
gives us a class name of output because
when you use JSX which is what this is
basically HTML inside JavaScript you
can't use class that's one of the
differences you have to use class name
all right and then we just want to
output whatever that value is going to
be so this dot props dot value and
that'll be the actual text the dummy
text and then down here you just want to
exploit the default output and that
should be it so let's save it go back to
our app J s and then let's report output
import component slash output and then
down here where it says hello let's go
ahead and put in output and then we're
going to pass in value and value is
going to be equal to the text that's in
the state that we got from the request
so this dot state dot text
all right so let's see if that works
save it
output is not defined that I not import
it right oh I did that oh this should be
import I'll put it from that and there
it is okay so that's our four paragraphs
that's get coming from coming from the
API now right now there's no interface
to change how many paragraphs we want or
if we want to show HTML I mean if we
change it right here that's fine but we
want to create a select list to change
it from HTML true or false and also a
number field or text field to put how
many paragraphs we want returned
so let's actually create those
components and what I'm going to do is
create a folder inside the component
folder called controls and we'll create
one file called select j/s and then
another called
text dot j/s okay and then I'm going to
copy the output component just to have
something to start with and then we'll
change this to select C still going to
have a state with a value and then in
the render this is going to be different
so let's get rid of that and then this
will just be a div now when you return
something it has to be within a single
element we couldn't do this and then put
another div here we could do multiple
elements but they have to be within one
single element so we're going to put a
select
give it a class name of form control
okay and then we'll just say on change
I'm going to set that to this dot on
change which will create and then we
just want to bind the this value to that
as well all right and then as far as
options
so we'll say option value equals true
and that's going to just say yes and
then we'll also do one from no our false
that's the value the text will see is no
all right now let's create the on change
I'm going to pass in E and then we're
going to just set the state so we want
to set the value right here to whatever
is chosen here either true or false so
we can say set the value set value to e
dot target dot value and that's going to
allow us to get whatever it is true or
false and we're setting it to this state
option and then let's do another
parameter which will be a callback and
then we want to set a property so this
dot props dot on change okay because we
want to be able to access whatever this
is whether it's true or false we want to
be able to access it from here from the
the main app component okay you want to
pass everything up
so let's pass in whatever the value in
the state is now okay so that will be
the true or false
all right let's save that and then we'll
go back to app KS and we're going to
bring that in so that's what select from
components slash controls slash select
okay and then we'll go down here and
we're going to need a form I'm going to
add a container class right here to push
everything to the middle and then let's
put in h1 and we'll call this to react J
s sample text generator put an H R there
and then we want our form okay so let's
do form I'm going to give it a class of
form in line
okay look that should actually be a
closing form tag not div and then we
want to give here with the claps of form
group so we'll have a label and this is
going to be let's see what do we do we
did the select first so that's going to
be include HTML okay and then that's
going to be to select that needs to be
capitalized because this is the actual
component and remember it has a value
property which we're going to pass in
whatever this is right here this HTML
either true or false
so now that knows what to do so value
equals this dot state dot what is it
just HTML and then on change we want to
set that to this dot show HTML so this
is going to be a function
okay so that's the select component now
the reason we did this is because
remember the unchanged property now
contains zero is it right here now
contains whatever the value is coming
out of that component which will be true
or false so we need to handle that so
we're going to handle it in a function
called show HTML ok so right up here
let's do show HTML and that will have
either a true or false so we're going to
use X for that and then we're going to
set the state let's this start set state
and we want to set HTML to whatever that
X is either true or false and then the
second parameter is a function we can
run after that so what I want to do is
then just call sample text again so that
we can again make this request with the
updated value of HTML that's what makes
it dynamic and to be able to just return
it back right away so this dot get
sample text all right so let's save that
and let's see what's going on here
select is defined but never used output
is not defined
oh you know what that's because the
Select component down here or exporting
output which doesn't exist so we need to
change that to select okay so now we
have our little select here and remember
the default is show to show HTML if we
now select no there it goes it goes away
cool
now I'm getting a warning down here
saying Dom property class did you mean
class name so I think somewhere I put
class where I should have put class name
let me just check was it in a PJs yeah
quite yeah these should all be class
name save that
okay good so now we want to implement
the number of paragraphs just like we
did with that so let's go to text
actually I'm going to copy everything we
haven't select because it's pretty
similar we'll just change this to text
and before I forget let's change this
down here as well to text all right now
the constructor I believe is going to be
the same because we hit were again going
to have a value property and then we
want to set that to the state so state
value is going to equal props dot value
and then in the render we can get rid of
the select this is actually going to be
an input give it a class name of form
control and give it a type we could use
text but I'm going to use number and
then value is going to be this dot
except any curly braces around that so
this dot state top value all right and
then again we're going to do on change
just like we did with select and let's
see what do we want to put in here we
want to do this dot on change and then
we're going to bind this okay and then
we'll end
so that's our input so it's going to
call on change just like we did here and
again we're setting the value to
whatever the target value is and then
we're going to call this dot props dot
on change and send along that value so
let's save that we'll go back to our app
j/s let's make sure we include it just
like we did select so change that to
text text okay and then let's see we're
going to work that into our form I'm
going to copy this form group and then
we'll put that right under it change
this to paragraph
and then instead of the select component
it's going to be the text component and
value is going to be this dot state dot
Paris which is this right here okay by
default it's four but we're going to be
able to change it with this and then on
change we're going to call not show HTML
but we're going to call change Paris
okay so let's go up here let's copy show
HTML change it to show Paris are not
show Paris change Paris and then that's
going to take in a number and then this
dot set state we're going to set powers
to whatever that number is and then
again we'll call get sample text to
update the request
okay so let's save that and actually
just want to switch these around I want
this on this side and this on this side
so let's just grab this form group cut
it and put it under this form group
all right and I just want to add a
little bit of spacing right here so
inside the index CSS I'm going to say
input margin and right 20 pixels okay
that moves that over a little bit so
let's go ahead and try it
so paragraphs let's change it to 5 you
can see that got added let's go down 3
to 1 and then let's say we don't want
the HTML tags we'll say no and we can
still add more paragraphs and say yes
all right good
so this is completely dynamic and very
fast let's put a little bit of spacing
right here so back in here let's do
let's see above the output we'll do a
line break and we'll do two of them and
then I want to put an HR below the
heading and JSX you have to have this
ending slash let's
I already had that what does I want to
do all I want to Center the heading so
it's also given a class name the h1
class name of Tech Center ok
I just want to rap a class of well
around this to give it a kind of a
background and some padding so the whole
point let's go to the output component
and along with the output collapse we'll
just give it a class of well ok so that
just gives it a gray background now we
can easily build out this application to
compile it so that we don't have to
actually run this server so let's go
ahead and stop this and then to compile
everything we'll do NP n run build ok
that's going to put everything inside of
a build folder and then once we do that
we can actually upload it to a server so
let's go to our files you'll see the
build folder see it's loading
ok so these are the files that it
creates basically static has our J s and
this file right here all bundled
together we have our index.html so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to upload
it to my server ok so I'm going to open
up FileZilla and go to my traversée
media hosting and go to public HTML and
I have a folder called test which is an
empty folder now the one thing I want to
do is just edit index.html oh man it's
all minified but basically at the end
where we have the source going to the
static J's file since we're in test and
the test subfolder I'm just going to put
- slash test right there and then also
is that the only one
yeah I think that's it so let's save
that to make sure if this is what you're
doing if you're uploading to a server
and you're putting it in the test
directory you just want to make sure
that you put that so that the HTML file
can find that script okay so let's go
ahead and close these up and then I'm
just going to grab everything here and
bring it up to my server and this is
just an in motion hosting I hope that
I'm VPS okay so now let's go to the
browser close this stuff up and let's go
to traversée Mediacom splash test and
there's our application okay up live on
the web and test it out so let's say we
want five okay you can see it works
perfectly we choose no for include HTML
we get nothing no HTML all right so you
can see that this is pretty easy to put
together it's also really easy to deploy
