front-to-back we're going to do
something a little interesting that you
probably won't find on beginner PHP
courses and we're going to work with
JavaScript and Ajax and what we want to
do is build a form like this the search
users form and then as we type you'll
see that it'll update here with some
suggestions it'll it'll look at the
array of names that we're going to
create and then it'll match whatever we
type in here so if I put a B we get Brad
T we get Tom if I put an S there happens
to be two names with s so that's going
to show those and then if there's
nothing that it matches it'll say no
suggestion okay so if that's all
happening through Ajax there's no page
refresh or anything like that so we are
going to do be doing a little JavaScript
if you don't know JavaScript don't worry
about it it's not really not that hard
it's a standard get request and you know
you can find plenty of resources on that
we're actually going to look at one of
the w3schools pages that kind of kind of
shows us how to make a get request
alright so what we're going to do is
create a new folder and I'm going to
call this let's call this website what
is it six all right and then we're going
to have two files in here this is going
to be index dot PHP and why that it
takes a couple seconds to actually
create there we go alright and then
we're going to create another file
called we're going to call this let's do
suggest dot PHP and this is where we're
going to store the user's array that
this search box will make the request to
it's going to search for that and then
it'll send along a response that will
have our matches alright so we're going
to start with the index.php page we're
going to put some standard HTML tags in
here and then i'm also going to use
bootstrap so let's put in link rel
stylesheet
and then HOF I'm just going to grab a
custom bootstrap theme from boots watch
so I'm going to grab this right here the
first one will click download and then
just grab this this link here and put it
right in there alright so we'll save
that ok so now in the body I'm going to
paste in some simple HTML ok so here we
have and just tab this over here we have
a container with an h1 and a form the
form has one input which is a text input
and then suggestions width and then the
span tag with an ID of output this is
where the suggestions will output
alright so in order for this to work we
need to add an event handler to this
input so we're going to say on key up
because we want it basically to make the
request every time we type and we're
going to set that to a function called
show suggestion and this is a JavaScript
function we also need to pass it the
value of this input and we can get that
with this dot value all right so now
we're going to go up here and put in our
script tags and then create function
called show suggestion okay and that's
going to take in a string so just to
test it out I'm going to say console dot
log string and then we're going to go to
our site which is which HTTP localhost /
PHP sandbox slash web site 6 okay so
there it is now if I open up the console
with f12 we start to type you'll see
it'll log what we type so we know that
that function is getting called alright
so what I'm going to do first is I'm
going to check to see if what what's
typed in here is at least one character
okay so we're going to say if string dot
Inc is equal to zero then we're going to
take this output right here and just set
it to nothing so to do that we can say
document dot get element by ID we want
the element that has the ID of output
and then we want to say dot innerhtml
equal to nothing so we're setting what's
in here - nothing okay and then we're
going to do an else and then this is
where we're going to make our Ajax
request oops okay
now I'm just going to pull down this
w3schools com if you guys know how to
make an AJAX call from JavaScript then
you're not going to have any issues but
what we need to do is create what's
called an X HTTP object so that we can
call dot open where we can make a get
request to a certain page in our case
it's going to be suggest PHP now before
we can do that we need to let me just go
down here we need to create that X X
HTTP object and then we need to
basically check the state okay so we
want to call this onreadystatechange and
before we actually put the response into
that element we're going to check to
make sure the ready state is four and
the status is 200 okay so you probably
know an HTTP 200 status means
everything's okay so it's just going to
check for that and then the ready state
if we go down to the response here the
ready state basically has a status of 0
through 4 we want to check to make sure
that the requests finished and the
response is ready because we don't want
to try to fill that before with the
response before we actually get it
alright so I apologize if that's a
little tough to understand making
requests from something like jQuery is
much simpler than using default
JavaScript all right so what we'll do is
create a variable here called XML HTTP
we want to set that to new XML HTTP
request okay we're setting it to a new
object here and then we want
call that onreadystatechange so xmlhttp
dot on ready state change okay and then
we're going to set that equal to
function and then this is where we want
to test for the ready state and also for
the status before we make our request
and get the response so say if this dot
ready state is equal to four so
basically if we've already got the
response and the status is equal to 200
then we're ready to go we're ready to
put the response into this output right
here okay so in here we're going to say
again document dot get element by D we
want the ID of output and then dot
innerhtml and we're going to set that to
this oops this dot response text all
right now we still have to call the open
and the get method so if we go back here
we want to do this right here
all right and actually I called it XML
HTTP so we're going to make sure we
change that you can call this whatever
you'd like
okay so making a get request and then
we're going to just get rid of this and
we want to make the request to what do
we call it suggest PHP and then we also
want to send along a query string with
this value okay so for that we're going
to put a question mark and say Q equals
and then I'm just going to concatenate
on our strings all right because every
time we type this is going to run it's
going to make the request and it's going
to send the request to this suggest PHP
along with whatever we type in okay so
that's it for the JavaScript okay so we
can save that and then let's open up
suggest PHP and I'm just going to paste
this in because it's quite a bit okay
you can put less names if you want but
it's just the people around an array
that's in a variable called people and
just a bunch of names now up here I put
it to do to get from the database
because that's something we'll do later
on when we get into MySQL alright so
what we need to do here now is catch
that query string okay because you can
see we're passing in Q equals string
which is whatever we type so down here
we're going to put a comment will say
get query string so take a variable Q
and put Q and set that to request now
I'm using the request superglobal here
instead of get just so that if it
happens to be a post request we can get
it as well all right then we're going to
just basically initialize a variable
called suggestion we're going to set it
to a blank string all right and then
down here we're going to get suggestions
so we're going to do an if statement and
we're going to say as long as Q is
not equal to nothing then let's say Q
equals and then I just want to make sure
it's all lowercase so we're going to say
string to lower we've learnt we learned
about that function a couple episodes
back and then we're going to pass in the
Q all right and then we're going to get
the length will sail N equals STR le n
which is another function we learned
about earlier and we'll pass in the Q
here all right so we're going to get the
the actual text that's passed in along
with the length so now we want to do is
we want to loop through our people array
so for that we're going to use a for
each loop again all stuff that we've
already learned and then in here we'll
say for each people add and then I'll
call this person okay and then in here
we're going to do an if statement and
here we're going to use a function
called
STR is tr so STR STR is that right yeah
that's right and what this does is it'll
find the first occurrence of whatever
this Q is inside of the person now I'm
also going to in here put I'm going to
put our query string and then we're also
going to use substring here and what
substring does is it returns part of a
string so we want to pass in here person
and then zero and then the length all
right and then in here we'll do oops I'm
going to say if suggestion is equal to
nothing okay so we're testing it up here
if it's equal to nothing then we're
going to say suggestion is then going to
be equal to person else
then suggestion we're going to append a
person okay because if they if they
already found someone and then there's
another name that matches it we want to
add that on to it so this just means
we're appending so we're going to append
a comma and then that person alright and
then the last thing we want to do is
output no suggestion if there isn't any
so let's go down at the bottom here and
we'll say echo suggestion equal to
nothing
we're going to use the turn ternary
operator here and say no suggestion else
then suggestion and that should do it
let's save it let's go back to our
application and reload and if I type in
a B there we go
and it's looking at this list right here
so let's see Julie we have Jillian Jose
which are both Jays and Joana and you'll
see those all pop up so it's working as
it should all right now I like I said I
probably will get back to this later on
and we can make these all these come
from a database instead of just a static
array like this okay so hopefully you
guys like this this was a little tough
to try to explain and put into words but
hopefully got the gist of it and that's
it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
