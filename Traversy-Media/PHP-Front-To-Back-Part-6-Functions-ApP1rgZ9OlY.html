front-to-back in this video we're going
to be talking about functions okay so
it's most likely going to be a really
quick video and don't worry we're almost
on we're almost in the clear as far as
this basic stuff variables arrays loops
things like that and then we'll be
looking at some cooler stuff you know
look at making post requests and working
with the database things like that okay
but we do have to do this this all this
basic stuff for people that are brand
new to see not only PHP but to
programming in general okay so I'm going
to create a new file in my PHP sandbox
and we're going to save this as
functions dot PHP the F didn't come out
okay and basically let's put in our tags
here and basically a function is pretty
much just a block of code block of code
that can be repeatedly called okay so we
can define a function put in whatever
code we want and then we can call that
throughout our script okay now there's
something that I wanted to talk about
earlier on Twilight for God and that is
how to format or at the different ways
that we can format not just functions
but also variables classes and so on so
basically we have three main types that
programmers use okay first of all we
have camel case so chemical so camel
case would look like this okay so it
starts off with a lowercase letter and
then every word will have a key we'll
start with a capital okay that's camel
case then we also have lowercase with
underscores so that would be something
like my underscore function okay so it
start with the lowercase and then every
word would have an underscore in between
it and then they also have something
called tasks okay
and that's basically camelcase what it
starts with a capital as well now in PHP
when it comes to variables and functions
usually it's one of these two I would
say that it's camelcase oh the most of
the time but you'll also see this this
pascal case is usually used for classes
when you use object-oriented programming
and you create classes for your objects
that's when you'll use this pascal case
alright but usually you'll see one of
these two and we're going to use camel
case that's what we've been using now
when you get into frameworks different
frameworks use different different
styles for instance code ignitor uses
this more uses the underscore but if you
get into let's say symphony or something
like that
they'll you use the camel case more okay
and for classes pascal case so those are
the basic types okay so I just wanted to
throw that in there so a function is a
block of code that can be repeatedly
called so to define it we use the
keyword function and then we can name it
so let's just call this simple function
okay so we name it and then we put our
parentheses and then we have this open
curly brace close curly brace and all of
our code goes in there I'm sure that I'm
preaching to the choir or some of you
guys I know that you know this but there
are people that don't that are just
learning okay so let's say for this
function all we want to do is just echo
out a string we'll just echo hello world
okay so that gives us a function now if
I save this and we go to this the local
host / PHP I was a PHP sandbox slash
functions dot PHP now we see it's not
putting out hello world on the screen
because all we've done to this point is
define the function we haven't called it
we haven't used it so if we want to call
it then we have to just use it so simple
function
okay just like that and then if we go
and we reload we get hello world okay
that runs whatever code we have in here
okay so this is create simple function
and then this run simple function so
that's as basic as it gets really now
you can also have you can also include
parameters or sometimes called arguments
and that's basically values that you can
plug in to the function so let's say we
want to create a function called say
hello okay and then we want this to take
in a parameter of a name now notice that
I use the dollar sign here because this
is actually a variable so you have to
include that money sign just as if you
were using a variable outside of the
parameters okay let me just put a
comment here so my goal is to is to for
you guys to be able to have this code to
look back on when you need it that's why
I'm formatting it like this now when we
call say hello
just like we call it simple function we
can input data we can input a name so we
can use that down here so let's say we
want to echo things it's easier and use
double quotes so we'll say echo hello
and then whatever is plugged in okay and
then we'll just do a take a line break
so down here let's call it will say
hello and we'll plug in a name here
let's say Joe and I'm just going to
comment this function out so if we
reload we get hello Joe okay now we can
call this as many times as we want we
can say hello
- Bob reload and that's going to do
hello Bob so we can call it as many
times as we want in the script now let's
see what happens if we run say hello but
we don't put a parameter in even though
it takes a parameter so let's go ahead
and run that and it gives us an error an
uncaught argument count error - few
arguments okay because it takes one but
we're doing it to zero so what we can do
here is we can actually set a default
for this if the user doesn't put in a
name and we can do that by simply
setting this equal to let's say world
alright so we'll save that and now if we
reload we get hello world because it
sees that the user didn't plug in a
parameter but it sees the default of
world so that's what it's going to use
but then again if we go and we put
something in here say Tim that's going
to overwrite world okay because world is
the default this is actually what we
want to use
alright so pretty simple stuff and I
should also mention that these are user
defined functions PHP has a whole mess
of of core functions that you can use
that are part of the the language okay
these are all we're defining these and
we've already used some for instance
when we looked at arrays we used print R
and Bar dump those are those are
functions that are built into PHP all
right so let's comment that out now we
can also we can also return values from
functions and that's usually what you do
when you're when you're using when
you're programming for real we're just
echoing things out just to show you that
it does whatever we put in here but
usually you want to get some kind of
value back from the function alright so
do that let me give you an example I'm
just going to say function and we're
going to call this add numbers and just
to show you as well that we can put more
than one parameter so we'll say num1
call
up num2 and then we want to first of all
show you if we echo num1 plus num2 and
then down here say add numbers and can
pass in anything here let's just say two
and three so if we reload we get five so
this is by echoing it out now if you
want to return you can just use the
keyword return and then whatever you
want to return now if I save this and I
run it you can see it's not giving us
five anymore that's because we're just
returning it here
there's nothing about echoing out onto
the screen which is this function is
going to give us a value back so then we
have to do something with that value
such as echo it okay so we echo it down
here and then we get our five okay so in
most cases you're going to return
something from a function when we just
put a comment up here okay so the last
thing I want to talk about is passing
arguments by reference okay so normally
if we have a variable which say my num
and we'll set that to 10 so if we pass
this in as an argument normally that's
by value and it's not going to
manipulate this value outside of the
function but we can pass it in by
reference if we want to if we want it to
do that so let me just give you an
example because it's a little hard to
explain so let's create a function
called add five and that's going to do
exactly that it's gonna take in a number
and then it's going to just take that
number and plus equals five now if you
don't know what this is is plus equals
it's the same as saying num equals num
plus five it's just a shorter way of
writing it so we're taking the number
and adding five so let's create another
one and we're going to call it add
and then same thing it's going to take a
number and we're going to just say num
plus equals 10
now this add 10 I'm going to pass it in
by reference by putting an ampersand
loop and amber Sam in front of this okay
normally it's passed in by value which
is the default so what I want to do is I
want to run this number through both of
these and see what we get so let's say
add five and we'll pass in my num and
then we'll echo my num actually let's
put quotes around it and I'll just say
value and then I'll do a line break and
then let's run it through add ten okay
and then we'll echo that out so value
sorry it's very hard to talk and type
two then we'll say my num and a line
break okay so it's so this value is
going through both of these functions
this one is passed by reference so I'm
also going to comment this out alright
so let's go ahead and reload and then we
get value ten value 20 so when it goes
through add five you can see that this
doesn't change when we echo it out down
here it's still ten but when we go
through add ten it actually takes this
adds ten to it and changes this to 20
because it's passed in by reference so
that's the difference okay one will
manipulate this number one won't now I
honestly don't use this very much this
this sum by reference maybe some other
programmers do I don't know I just know
that the stuff that I've created with
PHP I very rarely have to use that
there's other ways to do things
all right so but I did want to just put
it in there just to mention it all right
so that's pretty much all there is to
know about functions at the
point at this stage so we're going to go
ahead and stop here and in the next
video will most likely be talking about
conditionals so if statements FL
switches and also operators alright so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
