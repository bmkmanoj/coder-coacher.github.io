maybe the next couple videos we're gonna
be looking at the flux application
architecture
alright so flux is an architecture it's
not a lot of JavaScript library or
framework it's used most commonly with
react j/s and if you're not familiar
with react Jas it's a UI library alright
it's considered the V in MVC it takes
care of what the user sees the the user
experience it doesn't have anything to
do with models or databases or
controllers or anything like that so
that's where flux comes in and I decided
to make these videos because there's not
a lot of information on how to set up a
flux application alright there's a lot
of methodology a lot of talk about the
concept and how it works but there's no
solid code that you can get that will
really help you understand how it works
and that's gonna be the goal of these
videos alright what we're gonna do first
is we're going to create a boilerplate
flux boilerplate it flux and react that
you can use to start your projects with
alright and then after that we'll look
into actually creating an application
with that frame with that boilerplate
alright so let me just talk a little bit
about methodology and the concept of
flux it's pretty new like I said there's
not too much information on the web
about it
this is the documentation site it was
built and maintained by Facebook alright
and you can see that there's a few key
aspects of flux there's actions
there's dispatch the dispatcher stores
and views so the dispatcher is basically
the central hub of the application and
it's very simple it's just a registry of
callbacks alright and when new data
comes in the dispatcher uses these
callbacks to propagate data to the
stores stores are just that their data
stores that where they're the part of
the application that handles your data
not necessarily dealing with a
third-party database or anything like
that
but data that's local to your
application all right now if you if you
want to use a database to persist data
you have a ton of different options and
you can basically plug it into your
application but flux itself isn't going
to take care of persistent data I mean
you could use local storage you could
use something like firebase or some kind
of no SQL database pretty much anything
that's available and they'll be talking
about the different options a little
later all right then you have actions
actions are fired off from you can have
it have them fired off on a page load or
a user interaction if a user clicks a
button or submits a form you can set off
in action all right and actions are
provided to the dispatcher and something
called an action creator method which
like I said most often originated from
user interactions with the views all
right I think if you are a application
developer then you know what a view is
it's basically just the part of the
application that the user sees alright
and this is where I react and react
components come in so you can break each
part of your application up into a
component and if you've never worked
with react j/s I would suggest that you
look into that first and you you kind of
at least understand the basics of it
because if you don't know anything about
react JSU you're gonna get lost all
right you don't have to be a pro at it
but you should at least know the basics
and what a react component is react
works with something called state and
something called properties
all right so state is where you're going
to store the local data for your
application and depending on certain
states you'll render different things in
your application all right so you might
have a form or you might have a list and
there's an edit button you click the
edit button and a form opens and it's in
the edit state ok once you save it you
go back to whatever the list state and
I'll explain this as we go along because
it's a little tough to explain without
actually showing you all right so the
boilerplate
we have available on github so you can
go to Brad Traverse e slash flux boiler
and there's basically only two things
you need to do to get started you need
to do NPM install that's going to go
ahead and install all the dependencies
and then you want to run gulp alright so
we're gonna be using gulp as our task
runner what that's gonna do is it's
going to compile all of the the flux
JavaScript files into one main J's file
and stick that in a folder called dist
alright and then you can run the
index.html file from the dist folder
alright but I'll show you all that as we
go alright so basically the source
folder is where you we're gonna be doing
all the work in the Jas folder you can
see we have actions components constants
the dispatcher stores utils this is
where all the if you're gonna work with
an API or some kind of database you can
do that from here you can make Ajax
calls and all that then there's and then
a main J's file which is basically the
entry to all the rest of the files
alright so one more thing if you if you
don't know react J s at all I would
suggest looking at well even if you do
when you want to learn more about flux I
have a course called faces getting
started with face book flux on edge
wanax and if you're interested in that
there's the link it's gonna talk about
everything that I'm gonna be talking
about now and more so I would suggest
that so let's go ahead and get started
what I'm gonna do is just create a new
folder called flux boiler and we're
gonna create that recreate it together
just so you can understand what's going
on I mean you could just get the the
actual boiler plate here but you might
not know what to do after that alright
so we'll do that and then we'll take a
look at building an application with it
so what we'll do is create all the files
and folders first and then we'll start
to add the code and look at how flux
works all right so first thing we're
gonna do is create a store
folder all right and then inside there
we're gonna create an index.html file
okay and then we're gonna create a CSS
folder that's gonna hold all the CSS and
we - we'll create a style dot CSS now in
the actual flux boiler there's also a
bootstrap CSS file you don't have to use
bootstrap but I included it just because
it's just something to get you going as
far as you know user interface so we
also want our Jas folder that's where
the majority of our work is going to be
we want to create all the different
parts of the architecture so we need a
actions folder alright and then then
we're gonna create a file called app
action gjs alright and most of these
folders will only have one file in them
for instance the dispatcher will create
that alright and that's gonna have a
file called app dispatcher oops on the
PowerPoint
all right next thing we're gonna need is
a constants folder and this is all
constants is gonna be is just an object
that holds the different action create
our constants alright so this is gonna
be called app constants J s and you're
not you don't have to use the this
naming convention but I find that it's
it's it's very simple and easy to
remember and that's this is mostly what
you'll find if you're gonna look around
on the web for other flux applications
all right so let's create a components
folder this is basically the view this
is going to be where all the react
components go and for now we're just
gonna create the cork and punk core app
component app dot J s okay so basically
all the other components we create are
going to be nested into this one we also
want our stores folder now you're not
ellipses I just wanna make that
lowercase you're not limited to just
having one store for instance if you
have a blog you might have a post store
and you might have a category store but
what we're gonna do is just create one
called
app store and then everything will go in
there just to simplify it alright so
this will be called app store dot J s
alright then we're gonna have our utils
folder and that's where we can do our
Ajax requests and stuff like that let's
see we also want vendors and that's
where you can include jQuery the
bootstrap javascript file things like
that and let's create our main j/s
okay that's that's gonna be the gateway
to all of the other ones this is where
we're going to include the main app
component and then we'll have access to
all the other components through that
app component all right so those are the
jas files now we're gonna create our
package dot JSON file which is going to
include all the dependencies and
everything like that we're not gonna run
npm install yet to install them but we
just want to get it set up alright so we
can actually use the command line to set
that up so what I'm gonna do is open up
I'm usually a utility called git bash
that you can get for Windows but feel
free to use this just a standard Windows
command line alright so we're gonna do
NPM and NIT I wouldn't obviously make
sure you have no js' installed if you
don't just go to node.js org and click
the big download button it's really
simple to get setup alright and once you
have node installed you'll have access
to the NPM command so flux boiler that's
good versions good description I'll say
flux architecture starter I guess
starter boiler whatever it doesn't
really matter
entry point that's fine for now author
feel free to put your own name and that
should set up a package Jason file ok
I'm actually going to add a project to
sublime text
where is it
where is it dev flux spoiler here we go
alright so if we look at the package
Jason it has everything we just went
over what we want to do now is add our
dependencies alright so we're gonna go
right here put comma and we're gonna set
up our dev dependencies
okay these are dependencies that are
only needed in development so there's a
few we need to set so we're gonna need
to be to use NPM so we need to use
browserify alright so we're gonna get
that set up alright and we're gonna just
use the latest version so we're going to
just have a asterisk
okay we're also gonna need the actual
flux module and what that does is it
provides us the dispatcher and a couple
other things that we need okay we'll get
the latest version of that we're gonna
want gulp as our task runner we're gonna
use something called reactive Phi and
what that does is it transforms the JSX
code into JavaScript
now JSX is it's the syntax we use in
react components and it's basically xml
inside javascript
alright and that's what we use to create
the user interfaces and the components
so this takes care of actually
converting that to javascript when we
actually compile the application all
right so it's gonna be the latest
version and then we have one called
vinyl source stream
I'm not exactly positive on what this
one does I just know it has to do with
transforming strings into data streams
all right and then one last thing here
is we need object to sign all right and
that's used in the at in the store so we
also need dependencies and all we really
need here for now is react itself all
right so we're gonna say react and we're
gonna be using zero point fourteen point
seven and then we also want to include
react Dom all right if you're using the
latest latest version which at this time
is this version you'll need to include
react on as well so that's it for the
package.json file so we can go ahead and
save that and we're not going to run it
just yet and I guess the last thing that
we'll create is the gulp file all right
so you want to create a file called gulp
file dot J s all right so that is the
file structure obviously we have an add
and added any code yet so we'll do that
in part two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
