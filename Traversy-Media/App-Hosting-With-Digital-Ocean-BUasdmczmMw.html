following this channel for a while then
you know that I've used technologies
like nodejs
Ruby on Rails Python etc quite a bit and
a lot of people ask me how to host these
applications they're not as easy to
deploy and host as let's say a wordpress
site or some other PHP application where
you can simply run it on a $3.00 per
month shared hosting account but one
service that I would recommend for this
is digitalocean
and I'm not being paid by them or
anything like that I generally suggest
them for hosting most types of
applications you can create what are
called droplets which are virtualized
servers that run the OS distribution of
your choice
you have complete freedom to do and
install whatever you want on your
droplet so if you want a mean stack
application or django app or lamp stack
absolutely anything you want you can run
you can do that okay so in this video
I'm going to show you how to set up a
droplet that I will most likely use in
future videos to deploy different types
of applications okay I do have a video
showing you how to deploy nodejs
on digitalocean but I want this to be a
more general overview of how to create
your own droplet and so on it's not
going to be as in-depth as that you know
for people that are that are beginners
with this type of stuff now I do have a
referral link in the description that
will save you ten bucks so if you do
sign up please be sure to use that it'll
just give me a ten dollar credit or
something like that all right so what
we're going to do is create a droplet
and create an SSH key pair so that we
can authenticate from our client machine
and then I will go in and I'll show you
how to install nodejs we'll set up a
very simple sample application and run
that on the remote server so you want to
go to digital ocean comm and just sign
up now the way the payment works is it
has a credit system so you can choose to
add however many credits or however much
money you want and then you can purchase
services based on that all right so
let's go ahead and I'm going to
again I'm already signed up but you
obviously want to sign up all right and
we're going to just log in here okay so
this is the interface and I don't have
any droplets created so this is what
yours will look like when you first log
in and then we're going to just click
create droplet and then we need to add
some or make some choices here so you
want to choose the OS that you want your
server to run we're going to run Linux
Ubuntu and you can you can see you can
choose different versions you can also
run FreeBSD Fedora Debian core OS and
Sint OS and they also have this
one-click apps where if you want to set
up for instance Django or nodejs or the
mean stack the lamp stack you can do
that here in one click but I'm not going
to do that I'm just going to get up you
know a bare-bones bun to server then you
need to choose a size so if this is for
production I would definitely choose you
know some of these higher packages but
if this is for development or staging or
learning purposes I choose the $5 per
month and the description the link in
the description will give you $10 so
that gives you two free months all right
so then you can choose a location and so
on I'm just going to leave the default
and then you can also choose to add an
SSH key okay now what this will do is it
will allow you to oh it looks like I
already have one I'm just going to
ignore that pretend that's not there but
this will allow you to connect using
your client machine without having to
add a password basically you have a key
on your client machine and then there's
a public key on the server and it'll
authenticate using that and that's
really easy to do especially if you're
on a UNIX based system like Linux or Mac
if you're on Windows you can use
something like puttygen which is
actually what I do in that other video
that I told you about so check that
video out of here if you're wanting
running Windows you can also install
OpenSSH on Windows
all right so what we're going to do here
is we're going to run a command called
SSH - key gen and that's going to
generate a key by default it's going to
be in your home folder inside SSH and
then ID underscore RSA so I'm going to
just click enter you can also choose to
use a passphrase if you want but I'm not
going to so I'm just going to click
enter and then it generates the public
and private key all right and if we look
in let's say LS a dot that's what's H
you'll see that those files are in the
dot SSH folder so what we need to do is
grab the key that's in this file here
which is the public key so to do that
I'm going to use them so I'm going to
say sudo VI and then we want to say dot
SSH because we want to go in that folder
and then ID underscore our si.com all
right and we want this right here so
what we'll do is just copy it ok make
sure you get the whole thing we can just
copy and then to get out of it to escape
ving we can just do a scape and then we
want to do : q ok so now that we have
that copy that's a new SSH key and paste
that in so you get a little check mark
here and we'll give it a name let's just
call it my key all right and that's that
and then moving along you can choose
your hostname okay this is what it'll be
by default I guess I'll just keep that
you can call it whatever you want though
and then we'll click create all right
now just take a couple seconds to create
your droplet
and that's it you now have your own
virtual server or droplet and this is
the IP address to it and if we click on
it we get a whole bunch of options over
here this is the graph for the CPU usage
and stuff this will take a little bit to
update okay if we click access we can
actually launch a console from the
browser and log in here but we're not
going to do that we can reset the root
password now essentially we used SSH I
don't believe that they send us an email
but if you don't use SSH you'll get an
email with your username and password
all right power we can power down the
droplet at any time volumes we don't
have any volumes here resize so if you
wanted to upgrade you can easily do that
without affecting anything on your
server you can update the our upgrade
the CPU and RAM only or the CPU Ram and
disk ok networking shows you your IP
address gateway netmask stuff like that
backups you can enable a dollar backups
for a dollar per month but you can take
snapshots at any time so if we click
take live snapshot it's going to get the
exact state of the server right now and
it will put that into a file an image
file and we can restore that at any time
so you have some really good backup and
protection alright and that will still
run even if we change the page here
kernel we're not going to get into that
history you can see we created this two
minutes ago and in every snapshot every
backup that's going to get put in the
history and then destroy if you want to
basically wipe everything out and start
from new you can just destroy and then
you know create the droplet again so
pretty easy if we go to images that will
give us all the backups and snapshots
that we've taken ok we can restore those
really easily networking this is where
you want to add your own domain name
and I might get to that in this video I
might not all right API support we're
not going to get into that so now what I
want to do is connect to this droplet so
over here in the command line we should
be able to just do SSH as the root user
at and then the IP address which is one
three eight is it one 38.9 7.9 3.18 zero
alright so when you first try to log in
it's going to give you this message
we're just going to say yes and there we
go you can see the prompt that's changed
to root at and then our droplet name
okay so we're now accessing our remote
droplet and we can do absolutely
anything we want on it so I'm going to
just clear this out and then let's
install nodejs
on our remote server so I'm just going
to say nodejs bun to install because we
need to grab a curl command because it's
not in the default repository so we just
want to run this right here okay and
we're using node version 6 you could use
7 if you want but let's just do that and
then once that's added we should be able
to just use apt-get install to install
it alright so now we can say sudo
apt-get install and let's add - why no
js' and the - why just makes it so that
if when we're at we're asked about this
space and all that we can it just say
yes all right so now we have no js'
installed if we say node version you see
we have version 6.10 point 1 and we also
have NPM
three-point 10.10 all right let's clear
this out and now what I want to do is
just generate a node application so we
can actually install Express globally
and Express generator so let's say sudo
npm install - JEE Express and Express
generator I think you have to do use the
generator I haven't done that in a long
time
I usually create from scratch but we'll
see okay so now we should be able to run
the Express command globally and it will
generate our application so let's create
a new directory on our server called
projects and then we're going to CD into
projects and let's say Express and then
we'll just call this my app alright so
now if we look in our directory we now
have a my app folder let's CD into my
app and run LS and from here we're going
to have to run npm install all the
dependencies will be in this package
JSON file actually let's take a look at
that we'll just do sudo VI package dot
Jason so you can see it created this for
us and it has our body parser cookie
parser debug Express Jade which is a
template engine alright let's see what
else morgan which is a logger serve
favicon so those are the dependencies so
let's escape this with escape and then
go and queue and let's go ahead and run
npm install and that will get all of
those setup
okay so now that's setup let's go ahead
and run NPM start and that should be now
running on I believe port 3000 so let's
go and copy our IP address paste that in
and go to port 3000 and there it is we
now have an Express a node and Express
application live on the Internet
now if you are actually planning on this
being production then you probably want
to add some additional provisions you
want to add a domain name you want to
make sure you want to you don't want to
run it on port 3000 you don't want to
have them have to have to do that and I
show you how to do all that in my
deployment video which I'll put the link
in the description but I'm not going to
go through all that right now the main
goal of this video is to just get you
familiar with digital ocean and how to
create a droplet how to install stuff
and so on so I'm going to go ahead and
stop this and now what I want to do is
install the lamp stack which is Linux
Apache MySQL and PHP so let's clear this
out and I'm going to say sudo I'm sure
you should do update first so let's say
so apt-get update alright and then we're
going to do sudo apt-get install and
let's install apache2
PHP 7.0 and then the apache mod for PHP
which is lib live Apache 2 - MA - PHP
7.0 all right so let's run that say yes
all right so now Apache and PHP should
be installed if we go to our IP address
you can see we get the Apache to default
page and we could also install MySQL by
simply saying over here we'll do sudo
apt-get install and that's going to be
MySQL - server alright and this is going
to ask us for our password whoops okay
there we go alright so new password
let's just put whatever repeat it and
that will get that set up ok so now we
have the lamp stack installed clear this
out and we could easily log into MySQL
in MySQL and let's do - you and then
sign in as root and then - P it's going
to ask for our password which is what I
just set and now we're in MySQL okay we
say create database test book about the
semicolon and now we can say show
databases and there's our test database
okay so let's get out of this switch ah
come on
alright quit
all right so now let's let's create a
PHP file on our web root so let's go
ahead and CD two slash var slash and in
here let's see we want to go into this
HTML folder
and let's go ahead and create a file let
say touch index dot PHP and then let's
do sudo VI index dot PHP and then in
here
let's hit I and then we'll put in our
PHP tag and let's just echo hello world
okay then we'll hit escape and then
let's do : W and then Co and Q all right
so if we go to our IP address now and
reload all you know what there's an
index.html file in there so let's just
get rid of that RM index.html and let's
reload and we get our PHP hello world
alright and I guess I'll just show you
real quick how to add a domain name so
we're going to go to Anam central com
that's where I have a couple domain
names you obviously want to go to
whatever you're using let's see sign in
here and log in and I actually think I
already have a domain name set to the
correct DNS for digitalocean but you
want what you want to do in your domain
registrar is you'll want to go and find
the domain name you want I'm going to
use this code learner dotnet and then
you want to edit the DNS server settings
you're depending on who you use it your
interface will be different but you want
to look for something like name servers
or DNS something like that and then you
want to add in these
rename service ons one digitalocean comm
and as to digitalocean comm and s3 and
then save that okay once you do that we
can go into our droplets and see
actually now you want to go up to
networking and enter your domain name so
let's say code learner the learner
dotnet and add domain okay
and in this host name okay make sure you
have a record selected up here and then
in here we're just going to put at and
then we want that to go to this droplet
here and we'll create record okay then
we want to create a cname so if we click
up here and cname and we want to put in
here
ww because we want that version of the
domain to go here as well and then here
we'll just put an @ symbol and then
create record okay so now if we go to
another tab and say coal burner dotnet
and there it is
so we now have a domain connected to our
droplet alright guys so hopefully you
enjoyed this video and you learned a
little something from it again the link
in the description will give you $10 off
or give you two free months of the
lowest tier package for digitalocean but
I plan on doing to put some more
deployment videos in the future because
some of the stuff can get really
complicated and what we did today isn't
all you would need to do if this was a
production website okay you want to add
more security measures set up a firewall
and all that if it's you know a real
production website for development and
stuff like that this is absolutely fine
alright so thanks for watching guys if
you're not subscribed and you like this
video please do so please leave a like
comment I'll even leave a dislike if we
didn't like it alright so thanks for
watching guys and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
