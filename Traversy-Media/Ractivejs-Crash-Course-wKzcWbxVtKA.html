taking a look at our active J s and this
is a JavaScript template driven UI
library and I know that there's many
different J's frameworks out there I've
done videos on a lot of them and this
one I chose this one today because this
is really easy to learn and also we just
did a course on it at edge wanax calm so
I figured I'd make a quick video on it
now in terms of other technologies like
it I think that react j/s is probably
the closest to how reactive works it's
strictly in the view it has no backend
capabilities and it's used to build
interactive UI's alright the main
difference from react I think is how it
utilizes templates and it kind of
reminds me of meteor j/s in that aspect
alright so let's go ahead and jump in
this is the the official web site and
there's pretty good documentation
there's a 60 second set up here which
kind of just gets you set up with a very
very basic idea of how it works
there's tutorials which are really nice
examples ok different--you is different
applications that use are active and
documents and then there's a set an area
for all the plugins alright so there's
there's quite a bit to it but it's
pretty easy to understand alright so
what we're gonna do is we're just going
to create an index.html file and we're
gonna work from that so I'm gonna create
a folder we'll just call this I will
call it reactive sandbox ok and then in
there we're going to create just a
index.html file
now reactive is available through NPM if
you want to use something like web pack
and you want a kind of a better
application environment and I get into
that in the course but for now I just
want to focus on the syntax and how it
works so I think that this is a little
bit easier all right so we'll go ahead
and open this in Chrome all right so
let's just get some standard HTML in
here add a title and all we have to do
to get it set up and be able to use it
is just include this script tag right
here okay so we're gonna put that
actually I'm gonna put that down in the
body just like that and it's basically
three different areas that we need to
set up first is going to be where we
want this to be output so we're going to
create a div and I'm going to give it an
ID of app okay similar to how angular
works and then we're gonna go down
actually we're gonna go above the script
tag and that's where our templates gonna
be so templates are gonna have a script
tag and an ID which I'm just going to
call template and then we need to add
the type which is gonna be text slash R
active okay and then down here is where
our instance will go so script and what
we'll do is create a variable for active
and set that to new or active and then
we're going to pass in some curly braces
and we need to specify a couple things
first is going to be the element that we
want it to be output which is a div with
the ID of app so we're going to say L
our AL and then pass in the ID of app
okay it doesn't have to be an ID it
could be a class or it could be a just
an element itself and then we need to
tell it where the template is
template and that has an ID of template
alright and then we can also pass along
any data we want which I'll just leave
blank for now but let's go up here in
the template and we'll say this is my
app all right so let's go ahead and save
that and if we go over to index.html and
reload we get this is my app all right
I'm just gonna open the console up with
f12 and you can see that our active is
in debug mode okay so that's essentially
the foundation for our active we have
our instance here we have our template
and we have whatever element we're going
to output it in alright now if we want
to add some dynamic data we can go down
here and let's say greeting we'll set
that to hello world okay so now up here
let's go ahead and put in an h1 and
we're gonna use mustache that's what
that's the template engine that our
active uses and we'll stay breathing
save it reload and we get hello world
now we'll add another piece of data here
we'll say name set that to Brad and
we'll say greeting my name is and then
throw in name okay so we get hello world
my name is Brad so we can also use these
dynamic variables inside of a style tag
if we want to change the way it looks so
for instance in our h1 put a style and
we'll set color
to color and down here we'll define a
variable called color and I'll set it to
red reload and you can see that it's now
red now or active has an extensive API
that we can use if we go to Docs you'll
see down here to the left there's all
different types of methods that we can
use so one of them is set if we check
that out so the way that we use this is
by saying our active dot set and then
the key path and then the value a key
path is basically a location of a piece
of data all right so if we go down here
and we'll take this variable for active
that we created and say dot set and
let's say we want to set the color we'll
set the color to green okay save that
reload and now you can see it's changed
to green we can also have get so if we
say let's do console.log and say active
you don't get and we'll pass in here
name and then if we go and reload you'll
see down here it's going to output the
name value now we can also nest
properties so let's say in the data we
want to add an address and we're going
to set that to be an object and we'll
say Street say 49 the Main Street and
then we'll do city Boston and then state
all right so now up in our template
let's go ahead and put in a ul
and in here we'll say what is the
address dot Street copy that
and we'll do city and state so if we go
ahead and reload we get our address now
notice that we have to do this address
start street address city there's
something we can do too short to kind of
make this a little easier especially if
you have multiple levels here I mean we
only have one here but you may have
objects with objects with objects so
what we can do is wrap this in a with
statement so we're going to say with
address and then we need to end that
with and then we can get rid of this
address save reload and you see it's
still there now if I was to remove the
width we're gonna get an error okay or
not an error but it's just not gonna
work so we can do that and we can also
shorten this up and get rid of the width
and just do the number sign address and
then down here address and that works
now another thing we can do is store a
raise down here so after address we'll
put a comma and let's say friends okay
so friends will set to an array and we
could make it just a normal array but
what I'm gonna do is put some objects in
here okay so each friend will be an
object with a name will do name and
let's do age okay so there's one friend
it'll do one more say mmm all right so
we have an array of objects here and if
we go up and go under the UL I'm just
going to create a heading here say
friends and if we try to just put in
friends like that and reload and see
that we just get this object and then
obviously we don't want that so what we
need to do is make it into a section so
we'll add a number sign here and then a
closing tag and then we can access any
of the fields we have in here so name
and age so let's actually wrap this in a
ul and then in here we'll put an li and
we'll say name - and then the age okay
so if we save that reload now we get a
list with each name and the age now we
also have conditionals and even if I set
this friends right here to false and we
reload it's not going to show up okay
and says it's as easy as that instead of
doing some kind of if statement up here
which we can do which we'll show you in
a second we can just set this to false
and the section won't show even if we
put something in here that's not one of
those fields it's still not going to
show nothing inside of that section will
work or will to be displayed all right
so I'm going to go back and just put
those in now we can also do if
statements we can do different
conditionals so let's go down here and
put a comma and then we'll say show to
show address okay we're going to set
that to false by default
so now if we go up here and where we
have our address or have the UL I'm
gonna surround that I'm gonna say if
show address and then down here we'll
close off that if okay so now if I save
that and reload you'll see the address
isn't showing okay if I change it to
true reload it will show now we can also
add in an else
so we'll say if show address and then
down here we'll say else we'll say
address hidden so if we save that
actually it's go change this to false
reload and we get address hidden now in
addition to using sections like we did
with friends we can also iterate using
each so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to paste in a property called jobs which
is an array of different jobs that the
users had all right so we have company
title and the years that they worked
there this should actually be years okay
so what we'll do is go up here and let's
add an h3 and we'll say work history and
let's do put a UL actually you know what
let's do a table we'll make it look a
little better
okay so table will have a table row and
these will be headings so this one will
say ID
this one will be let's see
company this will be job title and years
okay so that's our heading and let's go
ahead and copy that and then what we're
going to do is we're going to wrap it in
in each we'll say each jobs I get it
close it and then we'll paste that in
okay now these are going to be changed
to T DS okay so the ID one I'm going to
leave that for now
and then this we're going to change to
company this one will be changed to
title and this one will be years all
right so let's go ahead and save that
and reload and now you can see that we
have our table with our company job
title in years now for the ID we're
going to use the index in the way that
we can get that is if we go right here
and we put a colon and then a variable
let's say I and then we'll replace this
with I reload and you can see we get the
index of each of each item and let's
just grab bootstrap to make this look a
little better we'll just grab the CDN
just throw that up here and say hrf
paste that link in okay and let's just
add a class to our where is it a table
all right so that looks a little better
now if we wanted to add on to this
actually let's wrap it in the container
okay that should push everything to the
middle so if we want to add on to this
what we can do is go down to the bottom
here and we'll say dot push we want to
push on two jobs and we're gonna paste
in a new object to add so let's say
company just say test company and so
what else title we'll say lead developer
and years we'll say two so let's save
that and reload and you can see that
test company has been added on to the
end here if we want to get rid of one of
these we can use splice so I'll say
Proactiv dot splice and that's going to
take in jobs and then we want the index
of the one we want to delete let's say
we wanted to leak tech guy which has the
index of two and then this parameter is
how many we want to delete from there so
we just want one so reload and you'll
see that tech guy is gone if I wish to
change this to three it's going to get
tech guy and then the
after it as well all right I'm just
gonna comment that out all right so now
we're gonna move on to events
okay so events are pretty easy we they
have what's called an event directive
and if you've worked with angular you
probably know what a directive is it's
basically just a custom HTML tag or
element okay so we're gonna go let's go
right under where the address is and
let's see what we have address hidden
actually let's go under the whole thing
under the if and we're gonna create a
button okay now for the event directive
we're going to use on - click okay let's
say show address okay now we can make
this go to a function that we can create
so let's call this show address and then
we'll go down here and the way that we
do this is to use the on method so we're
going to say our active dot on and then
the name of the function which is show
address and then the second parameter
here will be self calling function and
then let's say let's see we'll do we're
active dot set and we want to set show
address to true all right so let's go
ahead and save that and reload click
that and you see we get our address now
if we click it again it's not going to
hide it because we just set it up to
show it now a better way to do this
would be to use our active toggle okay
so if we toggle and then we get rid of
the second parameter and we reload shows
it hit it again hides it okay so it just
toggles it from true to false
and if we want to change the text in the
button we can do that so we'll go up
here and let's do so what did that show
up so we'll say if show address if show
address and then we'll do else actually
if it's show address then we want the
text to say hi to address else show
address okay so we reload says show
address click it says hide address now
in addition to these proxy events we can
also have method calls where we can kind
of encapsulate it a little more so let's
say under our work history we're gonna
put under the table let's put a button
and we're gonna set on click say add job
and here we're gonna say add job and I'm
gonna add parentheses on the end this
time and then down here we don't want to
be in the data we want to let's go out
right above it
and we're gonna say add job actually you
can go like that and say function I'm
sure you put a comma there and then what
we'll do is grab this or active dot push
and cut it and up here we'll go ahead
and paste that in
and let's save that preload you see we
have an add job button I click that and
the job gets added okay so this is a way
to kind of keep everything encapsulated
in the instance now let's take it a step
further and encapsulate this in a
component okay so this whole work
history thing let's make this a
component so we'll go right above where
our main instance is and we're gonna
create a variable and we'll call it will
just call it jobs and we're gonna set
that to reactive dot extend all right
and then in here we'll pass in some
curly braces and same thing I'm gonna do
a template just like we did with the
main instance and let's give it an ID of
jobs all right and then we're gonna use
what's called a lifecycle method and
basically these are different methods or
events that get fired off at certain
times during a life cycle during the
rendering of a component or an
application so the one that we're going
to be using here is on an it so we're
going to say on init function alright
and then pretty much everything we do is
going to go in here all right now we
need to create another script tag under
the main template here so let's go right
here and we'll say script give it an ID
of jobs and a type of text slash for
active and for now let's just say this
is the jobs component and then we need
to specify it as a component down here
in the instance so let's go right under
template and we'll say component which
is I believe it's
I believe it's an array no it's an
object all right and then we're gonna
say jobs and assign that to that job's
variable right here okay so now it knows
that job's is a component now to display
it we're gonna go into our our main
template here and a component syntax is
just basically an HTML tag so jobs
alright now if we save that let's see an
expected identifier on a oh we didn't
put a comma here okay so you can see
right here this is the jobs component
now what I want to do is move this into
the jobs component so let's go to our
main template here and we'll grab from
here down to here and cut it and then
we're gonna just paste that right in
here in the jobs template okay so if I
save and reload now it's coming from the
template now I want this to be isolated
basically I want it to have its own data
right now the data is in this main
instance so up here we're gonna say
isolated and we're gonna set that to
true alright and now if I reload you can
see that the data is no longer there so
what we have to do is create in here
data and then we're gonna grab this okay
we'll cut that and then we'll just paste
that up here okay because the idea is we
want everything encapsulated the data
and he functions everything events so if
I reload now you can see that the date
is back now we do have this warning down
here saying we shouldn't store an object
an array of objects directly in here but
this would come from some kind of
database or API but we're not doing that
we're just sticking with the view
because that's what our active is and I
don't want to introduce any other
technologies so we're just going to keep
it and just ignore this warning all
right and if I click Add job you can see
that it's no longer working because our
component is isolated so what we'd have
to do is take this add job and cut it
and put it up here now that we're
working in the component we don't want
to use this reactive variable here we
want to use this
okay so save that reload and now the add
job works alright so now we're going to
get into data binding and our active
uses to a data binding much like angular
ok so if you have experience with
angular data binding works very similar
so what we're going to do is we're going
to go into our component template and
right above that button we're gonna put
in a form tag okay and then let's take
this and copy it or cut it paste it in
the form and instead of this on click
we're going to get rid of that and we're
gonna put inside the form tag on submit
and we'll set that to add job
and let's put an input with the type of
text okay and let's add class as well
we'll add a bootstrap class of form
control and this here I'm going to
change that to a submit we'll say input
type is gonna be submit and then value
will be submit alright so let's go ahead
and reload that let's make this look a
little better we'll put the button let's
put a class here for the submit button
will say BTN BTN default which is a
bootstrap class alright and what we'll
do let's also put in a placeholder and
we'll just say add job okay so when we
submit this you can see that it does add
it but then it flashes away that's
because the form is actually getting
submitted and we don't want that so what
we can do is go down to add job and we
just want to go to the very end and say
return false ok so now if I save that
night up that didn't work either
let's see return false that should do it
all right you know what we're gonna do
this a little bit different I don't want
to I'm not gonna have it like this I'm
gonna put this inside of on in it
because I think that's what the issue is
so up where we have the add job I'm
going to remove the parentheses and then
in here we're going to say this dot on
add job function
and then we'll grab the push and also
the return faults and we'll paste that
in there we just have this over okay and
then we can get rid of this ad job okay
so if we now reload and we submit now
you can see it's getting added now test
company's being at it because we haven't
specified anything different so what I
want to do is to show you how this data
binding works inside of our data in the
component we're gonna go right after
this jobs and let's say new job which
I'm going to set to for now we'll set it
to an empty string and then up in the
input which is right here we're gonna
say value equals double curly braces and
new job okay now that's gonna be bound
to wherever we put this variable so
let's put it right under the form we'll
say new job and reload and now as I
start typing you can see that data is
being binded and it's going both ways
whatever we put in here is going to
output here and then also if we were to
set this to test you can see that it's
also filling in the value of test case
so that's how data binding works it's
really easy and also very helpful all
right so what we want to do is obviously
we don't want to echo our typing down
here so we're gonna get rid of that
right this new job I just wanted to show
you how that works so now what I want to
do is whatever we type in here I want to
add as a job okay but we're going to
need a couple more fields so we'll have
company job title and years so let's
grab this text input and I'm going to
paste two more inputs in okay this is
going to be the
company so we'll change this to add
company add title add years okay and
then let's change this to job title no
job company job title and job years and
then we're gonna add those down here
alright so then what we want to do is
when we submit it it's gonna go to this
add job and let's create a new a new
object here so we'll save our new job
set it to an object okay and I'm just
gonna grab this okay now we want to fill
this in with the form values and we can
do that with this don't get and pass in
company or was it job company and then
it'll copy that this will be a job title
and this will be job years okay and then
we want to push on to it right here
except we're just gonna put in a new job
alright so let's save that reload and
let's say tests company some title and
four years submit and you can see that
those have now been added okay and if we
want to clear the form afterwards we can
do that as well if we go
down here and let me just bring this
back we can say this dot get a job
company I'm sorry not yet set set job
company to blank and same thing with the
other two fields job title job years ok
we'll reload put something in here
submit and you can see that the form
cleared alright so we are getting there
let me just separate these inputs a
little bit here and put let's put a
title here I just want to make it look a
little better and then we'll put
actually let's wrap it in a bootstrap
class so div class equals form group
all right there we go so that looks a
little better now the next thing I want
to talk about is observers and observers
basically we can make it so that we can
watch a key path for changes and a key
path meaning the location of some kind
of data so we're gonna go down to our
main instance and let's say we want to
watch for the name alright so down here
we're gonna say our active dot observe
and in here we want to pass in what we
want to watch which is the name and then
a function okay and this function will
take in new value old value and key path
okay now we can have anything we want
happen when the name changes or name is
added whatever so let's just do a
console log okay it's something very
simple and we're gonna console.log the
key path and then let's concatenate a
string will say changed to and then add
on new value okay so now if we save that
and we run it it's going to say name
change to Brad because that was the
initial assignment up here now if we
were to set that say name Sean and we
reload we get name change to Sean okay
so it's constantly watching name and
then does whatever we ask you to anytime
it's set or updated or changed in any
way now if we want to watch something
like friends which is an array of
objects if I was to change this right
here name to friends
and reload you'll see we get friends
changed too and then just a bunch of
objects alright now we can target what
we want to watch if we say for instance
friends dot one which would be Mike
reload now Mike is an object so we have
to specify what property we want so
let's say dot name reload and you can
see friends dot one dot name is the key
path and it changed to Mike okay now we
can also use patterns if we want to
watch all of these we can replace the
one here with a wild-card with an
asterisk and now if we run that it's
going to run for all of them okay so it
shows us John Mike and Jen now let's say
we add a property to one of the friends
so right here let's say proactive dot
set and let's do Ren's
dot one which is Mike and we're gonna
actually know what we'll do is say
friends dot one dot is best
okay so we'll add a property called is
best and set that to true and then let's
change this observer to watch for is
best alright so I'll save that and
reload and you can see that we get
friends is best changed to undefined so
Mike is the only one that changed to
true so this console.log this isn't
really it doesn't really make sense for
what we're checking for so let's comment
that out and what we'll do is check will
say if new value dot is best okay so if
that's true then we want to console dot
log and in here we'll say you know we'll
do key path
or actually no let's do the new value so
new value dot name will say new value
name and then we'll concatenate is my
best friend okay so if we go and reload
mmm
new value dot name oh we need to get rid
of this is best we want to watch just
for the friends reload and now we get
Mike is my best friend all right if I
was to change this to let's say two and
reload we get Jen as my best friend
alright so we're gonna go ahead and stop
here I think I covered all the basics
and fundamentals of reactive and
hopefully find it interesting and you
can see how easy it is if I mean if you
have experience with angular or react
this is very similar and I think it's
even a little bit easier so I would
suggest looking more into it read the
documentation check out the course that
we created at EDX calm I don't have a
link yet but I'll put in this in the
