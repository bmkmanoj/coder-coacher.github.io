to show you how to install nodejs on a
bun - okay i'm using ubuntu 15.10 which
is the latest version at this time
alright so i'm going to open up a
terminal and we're going to use curl
okay so we're going to say curl SL HTTPS
and we're gonna get this from Deb dot
node source let's see no source comm /
setup we want to setup underscore v dot
X and say sudo e bash okay just like
that hopefully you guys can see that
all right so now what we want to do is
sudo apt-get install we want to add the
Y flag and then node J s all right so
now if we say node jsv
you can see we have version 5.6 zero ok
we should also have NPM we have version
three point six point O so just to test
it out let's go ahead and I will make a
directory called test app and we'll go
into it okay and let's run NPM in it
okay so that'll take us through our
little wizard here to create a package
dot JSON file okay and if we go to let's
just go to the node website and grab
some code okay so if we go to the about
page we'll go ahead and grab that
alright and I'm just going to go to it
through here
let's see test app and let's see you'll
create a new document let's call this
server dot J s
throw that in there save it okay now if
we go back to our command line we can go
ahead and run node server ok servers
running and what is it ports one three
three seven and there we go
all right so that's how you can install
nodejs on a bun two very very simple ok
leave like subscribe whatever you can do
