take a look at drywall drywall is a user
management system for nodejs and it's
really powerful it looks nice and it's
easy to set up all right so if we look
down here you can see some examples of
the user interface and it uses a
bootstrap layout all right so it's
really nice looking we have signup pages
contact forms we can have password
resets reminders and then down here you
can see there's a full administration
area where you can add users accounts
admins admin groups alright so there's a
lot of functionality here and it's very
simple to setup there is a couple things
we need to do but it's it's not too bad
alright so we're gonna need a MongoDB
database for this and you can certainly
install MongoDB on your system and use
that but what we're going to do is we're
going to use a remote MongoDB database
using M lab alright it used to be called
Mongo lab but it looks like they changed
it so this is M lab com and what you can
do is just sign up create an account
it's free and then once we set up our
database you'll have some options for
paid plans which can get really
expensive but there is a free developer
account which is what we'll be using
alright so I already have an account so
I'm just gonna log in here if I can
remember my password oops
sorry about that
that wasn't it there we go okay so this
is this comma Vence app this is actually
a database that I'm using in a course so
we're going to ignore that you won't see
anything here because you don't have
anything set any database is set up so
what you want to do is click create new
and we're going to keep the default
Amazon Web Services as our cloud
provider
you also have Microsoft Azure and Google
cloud but we're gonna keep Amazon and
then down here you can see that the
prices for the different clusters they
have which range in space SSD hard drive
space goes up to around $6,000 which is
crazy but what we want to do is click
single node and then we want this
sandbox account okay so this is
completely free and then down here you
just want to name your database I'm
gonna call it my app dev and you can see
it's free zero dollars a month and we're
going to create the new deployment all
right so let's say we have my app dev
now and should have a green checkmark
next to it okay if we click on that it's
gonna open up our interface this is
where you can see all your different
collections and your data but the first
thing we want to do here is add a user
okay so we click add database user
password okay and if you wanted to you
could make users read-only so they can't
make any changes we're gonna click
create and now we have a user all right
so that's pretty much all we have to do
on this side of it all right now if we
go back to the drywall website what I
want to do is open up the github page
alright and that's gonna give us some
instructions now it tells you to clone
it to clone the repo but we're actually
just going to download the zip file make
a little bit easier all right we're
gonna open that up drywall master and
this is where we want we want to take
these files and folders and put them in
our application folder all right which
I'm just gonna create on my desktop I'm
just gonna call it my app all right so
let's open that up and bring all these
files over all right we can close this
and if we go back to the github page
this tells you all the different
technologies and all the mob
dependencies that are included so on the
server we have Express which is a web
framework for nodejs Jade which is a
template manager or I'm sorry a template
library mongoose is an ORM that will
allow us to interact with MongoDB
passport takes care of authentication we
also have a sink in email j/s which i'm
not exactly sure how those work on the
client side we have bootstrap for style
you have backbone j/s which is a
JavaScript framework jQuery underscore
font awesome for icons and things like
that and then moment.js which is a time
format or date and time format and it
also uses grunt for its task runner okay
so down here
let's see bcrypt bcrypt is always an
issue for me
the reason being it did it needs so many
dependencies you need to have visual
studio you need to have a couple other
things that are really hard to find at
least for me so what I do when I use
drywall is I use bcrypt j/s which is
it's it's just strictly JavaScript and
there's no dependency so it's really
easy to get set up and all we have to do
is just change just change a line of
code and a couple different files so
that's what we'll do we're going to use
bcrypt j/s all right now what we want to
do before we get into that is we want to
setup our config file all right so if we
look in
our folder here that we just created and
there's a config dot example okay you
want to change this to just config J s
and this is a new this is a virtual
machine that I'm working in and by
default the extensions are hidden and I
don't want that so let me just change
that real quick okay so you want to make
sure that this right here hide
extensions for known file types should
be unchecked all right so now you can
see it's config dot example dot J s so
we just want this to be config yes all
right so let's go ahead and open that
should have sublime installed on this
yeah I'm gonna use sublime okay
let's make this bigger so what we need
to do here we need to do a couple things
one the Mongo DB URL we need to change
that so this is really easy to find in
Mongo lab it's right here so you'll just
want to grab that copy it and we'll
replace this alright and what we need to
change here is our user this is the user
you created in Mongo lab password
alright that should be all set now down
here you have some some details you want
to change company name I'm just gonna
say we can keep it as Acme Inc project
name call it my app and your email
address
let's see right here project name I'm
gonna call this my app I believe that'll
show in the navbar SMT SMTP details here
so that you can get emails from the
system I'm gonna put in my gmail account
okay and then down here I'm gonna put
that as well all right and then you want
to put your password obviously I'm not
gonna put my password here on camera but
go ahead and do that and then save it
and exit out all right so that should be
all set next thing I want to do is open
up the package.json file alright so here
we have all of our dependencies and all
of our dev dependencies the only thing I
want to change here is where we have
bcrypt we want to change that to be
crypt GA s and want to get rid of this
version and just use an asterisk for the
latest version all right and we'll save
that and you can see has expressed it as
all the passport modules Mongoose things
like that all right so we'll get out of
that and now what we want to do is open
up a command line to this folder
alright so the run this as administrator
so we want to go to that folder so I'm
going to copy that
and then we're just gonna say CD and
then we'll paste that in alright and
then from here we want to say npm
install what oh I don't have I don't
have no js' installed alright so you're
gonna make sure you have no js' and npm
installed so just go to node.js org and
download real quick
she's only take a minute alright so
let's open that up
all right so finish and we're gonna have
to just restart the shell all right so
NPM install and I could take a minute or
two now while that's going on we're
gonna have to have a way to connect to
our Mongo database you in a Mongo shell
so we're going to go ahead and just
download MongoDB for Windows ok so let's
see if you already have it installed
don't worry about this wait a minute
this isn't it this isn't the page I want
this is
all right so I'm on Windows 64-bit so
we're gonna grab that okay that's gonna
be that's gonna download and it's go
back here that's still happening all
right so let's run MongoDB or the
installer okay so really simple we're
just gonna keep the defaults here let's
do the complete actually you know what I
want to put this in my C Drive by
default it's gonna it's going to put it
in Program Files but I like to just put
it right in my C Drive so go there and
create a new folder called MongoDB and
that's good
okay that's still going on
finish all right now what I want to do
is open up a second command line and we
want to go to the MongoDB directory and
then in the bin folder okay
now from here we should be able to
connect using this string right here all
right so let's paste that in and then
we're just going to replace the user and
password this is the user you created in
Mongo lab alright so there we go we're
now connected so we want to use the
correct database which I called my app
dev so we'll say use my app dev all
right now we're connected I'm going to
just hold off on that just for a second
so this is good npm install' worked and
what else let's go back to the github
page oops
I'm in the wrong thing here I don't want
that
okay so what we want to do is it says
use drywall but our database was named
different so we already did that now
what we need to do is run this so I'm
gonna copy that and just gonna paste it
here because we need to change this
right here this email address change it
to your own account and then the rest of
this stuff we're gonna leave okay so
copy that again and then we're going to
paste that in to our Mongo shell and run
it okay so now if we go back to Mongo
lab and reload and go to collections now
you can see we have an admin groups
admins and users all right so next thing
is we need to run the app so let's open
up our command line not the Mongo shell
this and let's say NPM start ok so
that's going to run grunt alright we'll
allow access and servers running on port
3000 so let's go to localhost port 3000
and there we go success so we now have a
full user management system alright so
what we need to do now is we need to
click this forgot your password and then
you're going to enter the email that you
used all right and send reset
oh I forgot something you see how it
says cannot find module bcrypt that's
because we need to actually change a
couple things in a couple files so first
of all we need to go to let's see is it
an app Jess you know what I'm gonna do
is open this inside a sublime alright so
let's see I know there's at least two
files that we need to change this in
let's see I know that in schema and then
user dot J s all you want to do is in
this require you want to require bcrypt
j s okay same thing with right here
alright and then save that and then I
know there's there's another one
somewhere models nope till actually you
know what let me go to the documentation
here because right here if you have
issues relating to bcrypt
click this link okay so all right so all
package dot Jason we did that I think
that's it because I know that this init
J s we don't have I searched for that
and we don't have that so let's just try
this all right
okay so port running on 3,000 still you
know what let's restart the server
all right so now we'll go back okay
reset your password try it again okay
good
so now I'm going to go to my email
and there it is reset your password
we're going to click this link reset it
alright so now we should be able to log
in there we go so this is the admin area
this basically just gives us a summary
of our app the number of users accounts
admins groups categories and statuses
okay if we go to statuses we get that
categories we can create categories now
there's no there's not really any other
type of resources this is basically just
a starter like a boiler plate type app
you'd want to add post functionality if
it was a blog or whatever it may be
contacts events something like that you
could add we can add them in our users
here okay if we want to add a user it's
a brad add new alright and then we want
to go to edit and you can activate the
user give them an email address okay
update and we could add a password here
alright so we now have a regular user
you can also create administrators you
can create admin groups so what I want
to do is sign out and then we'll sign in
as a regular user that we just created
alright so now we're logged in but we're
only logged into the front-end okay
there's no way to get to the admin area
alright and then we have the boat page
if we're logged in and we click sign up
it redirects us home we also have a
contact form and if we look at the
structure real quick I'm not going to go
over this too much I might do another
video later on but the purpose of this
video is just to get this up and running
alright so let's see we have our V
okay the main layout is indexed Jade so
for instance we have the Jumbotron if we
want to change this to from success to
welcome we could do that all right and
then you have the boxes you can edit
content about all that all of the views
are in this folder all right now if you
want to add extra resources like blog
posts whatever you would go to the
schema folder and create a new schema
where you could specify the different
fields and so forth all right so I think
that's going to do it we have the thing
up and running it's a it's a really nice
boilerplate type application that you
could easily add on to alright so
hopefully you guys liked this video
