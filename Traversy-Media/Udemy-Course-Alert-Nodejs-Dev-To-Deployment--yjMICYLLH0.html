released my third udemy course called
ojs Express and MongoDB devta deployment
and I wanted to introduce it and give
you guys a promo code to get the fifty
dollar course for just fifteen bucks so
it's in the process of being reviewed by
you to me but if you're watching this
video it's already released and there's
a lip Romo link in the description now I
created this course because there's not
too many tutorials or courses that
really show how to create a no js'
Express app from absolute scratch and
then go all the way up to deploying to
the web with a domain name so what we're
doing here is we're gonna go in-depth in
building two applications which we'll
show you I'll show you in a second but
we're going to start from scratch where
we don't even have no js' installed
we're gonna go through the entire
process of building them and then we're
gonna deploy them to Heroku we're gonna
deploy a remote MongoDB database and
we're going to add the domain name now
this is a learn by example course
meaning that we're gonna this whole
course is based on building projects
it's not gonna be you know a bunch of
boring slides or anything like that but
I will be explaining all the concepts
every line of code that I write and
what's going on at the same time so it's
not going to be like a code along now
many of you may have seen some of my 10
project courses but the difference
between those and this is that in the
ten project course you can't really you
can't really get in depth because you
need to build 10 projects in a certain
amount of time and you can't really you
know explain every line of code you
can't deploy every single project so my
goal for this course was to just build
two projects but go much more in depth
and you can see this is an eight and a
half hour long course so it's it's
almost the same length as a 10 project
course all right now and of course I'm
not bashing those 10 project courses
either those are great for you know if
you want to learn a lot of different
technologies you know just the very the
basics in a quick
amount of time so I did try to make this
course for all skill levels I tried to
explain things well enough so that if
you just know basic JavaScript you can
learn and you can follow along but at
the same time if you've worked with
nodejs before you'll still learn a bunch
of stuff and have a good time doing it I
think the Google OAuth integration and
the second project is really valuable as
well as bcrypt hashing handlebars j/s
with helper functions mongoose models
and much more alright we'll also be
using es6 syntax like arrow functions
promises and so on so what I want to do
now is just take a look at the
applications we'll be building and go
through them real quick now the first
one is called vid jot and it's basically
this is an introductory project because
I wanted to make this project very
friendly to beginners that have not even
used nodejs and Express before I took
the time to really explain routing and
templating and things like that so
basically it's it's an application where
YouTube or content creators can come and
just register for an account and then
they can jot down their ideas for their
next videos alright so we're using
passport JSA where the local strategy
will be hashing our passwords and we'll
store our credentials in our database
we're gonna start off with a local
database a local MongoDB database and
then when we deploy we'll be moving it
to M lab which is a remote MongoDB
hosting service and then we'll push the
application to Heroku alright so what we
would do is just register so we have a
simple register page we're using html5
form validation but we're also using
server-side validation as well so let's
create an account we'll say Steve Smith
and we'll give them an address of Steve
at yahoo.com and you'll see if I try to
put like a two character password and I
don't match them we'll get we'll get our
errors here passwords don't match
password must be at least four
characters so we're taking the time to
do some simple things like validation
we're also making it so that you can't
register the same email just things like
that okay so let's go ahead and just add
a password here and submit and now it
says we're registered and we can log in
okay we're also using something called
Express messages that will allow us to
use these flash messages so we'll go
ahead and login with Steve at Yahoo and
we have our ideas page and once we log
in you have access to this drop down
here where we can list our ideas and we
can add a new one so let's say we wanted
to add a JavaScript crash course and
I'll say basic video on j/s I don't know
it doesn't really matter and we'll
submit and you see we get video idea
added and we have our crash course
listed okay so we can edit this now we
also made it so that if you're if you're
logged in as another user and you try to
edit someone's idea you try to go to
their URL you're gonna get booted out so
no one else has access to to your ideas
okay and then of course we can delete
now on the surfaces is a very simple
application but we really went over
things like like structuring our files
and folders you know making sure that
email addresses couldn't be registered
twice authentication access control
things like that okay you also notice
we're using bootstrap 4 for our UI all
right we can go ahead and log out and
that's our first application now the
second one is much more in-depth and
much more advanced so story books is a
it's basically a social network where we
can create stories and we can either
share them we can label them as public
or private where it's more like a diary
so only you have access to your stories
and we're using Google OAuth for this
project so you can authenticate with
your Google account
all right then you'll see that we're
using materialized CSS we have a little
slide-out menu here all you can do if
you're not authenticated is view the
public stories all right so these are
public stories you'll see that each one
is tied to a user and this is their
actual Google
Google whatever they have is their first
name and last name and whatever their
avatar is all right and if we click read
more it'll take us to that story notice
that we can have comments the user can
actually choose if they want comments
are not on their stories I believe this
one here yes one here has a comment on
it and then it also has the author
information over here and you can click
here and you can see all the stories
from that specific user if you notice
the URL it's stories slash user slash
and then the users ID so we did a little
bit with relationships between stories
and users in MongoDB alright so let's go
ahead and authenticate now I have
multiple Google accounts so I'm just
gonna choose this one here and I already
I've already authenticated before and
you can see I have a bunch of stories
this is the dashboard area and you can
see I have two public stories and a
private the private one will not be
displayed anywhere on the site unless
I'm logged in I'm the only one that can
see this this page right here alright we
can also edit our stories from here we
can choose public private or unpublished
we can choose to allow comments or not
and we have this editor for our actual
story we can also delete our stories of
course and if we go to our little
slide-out menu here now you'll see we
can actually view my stories so this is
just stories from this account notice we
have the little edit icon and even if we
go to the public stories page you'll see
that any story that belongs to us
actually has an edit icon alright and if
we look at the story itself it also has
an edit icon and we can leave let's
leave a comment let's go right here so
we can leave a comment will say great
post and submit and you'll see a comment
will get added and it also has the users
avatar name here and you can click on
that and it'll show that user stories
alright so this one is a little more
in-depth especially when it comes to
like access control and stuff like that
and like I said the Google OAuth is is
real valuable learn
how to create our keys in the Google
console and then implementing them for
our dev development our dev environment
and then in our production environment
because basically you don't want to put
your keys inside of a file on your
server what we did is if we go to our
Heroku dashboard and we go to our
application for storybooks you'll see it
has all the latest activity all the
latest pushes but if we go to settings
and we go to our variables you can see
this is where we have the Google client
ID and secret our MongoDB URL things
like that okay so this is stuff that
would not be in you know a basic node
express tutorial so you're gonna learn a
lot and I think you'll really enjoy it
you can see we have our M lab this has
the different databases for storybooks
we actually use M lab for our dev and
production database for vidya we used a
local database for development and then
used M lab for production so that's it
guys I just wanted to mention that if
