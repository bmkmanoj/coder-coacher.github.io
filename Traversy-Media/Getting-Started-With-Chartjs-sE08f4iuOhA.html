we're going to take a look at chart J s
which is a JavaScript library for
creating really nice-looking charts in
your browser bar charts pie charts I
think there's eight different types that
you can create and this tutorial is
going to be very beginner friendly so
even if you're not a JavaScript Pro you
should be able to follow along really
easily and create your own charts so
chart j/s is that is pretty similar to
d3 which is a data visualization library
I did a series on d3 about two years ago
and I find charge is to be much easier
to work with I don't think it says
advanced in as in-depth but it is very
simple to work with at least on a basic
level now there is a lot you can do but
we're going to be scratching the surface
if you do like what you see I'd suggest
going through the documentation and
looking at some of the more advanced
stuff but what we're going to be doing
is creating a chart that shows you the
top five or six cities in Massachusetts
by population okay and I'm going to show
you how we can create a bar chart and
then easily convert it to other types of
charts and if we want
okay so we'll look at the basics we'll
look at some of the options that we can
use and yeah we'll get going so we're
going to go ahead and click get started
here and this is the documentation which
is pretty nice it shows you the basics
of creating a simple chart I'm going to
click on installation and it shows you
the different methods you can use you
can install it using NPM if you want to
use nodejs you can use Bower which is a
front-end package manager but we're
going to go the simple route and use the
CDN okay which is just a remote link to
the chart.js file and of course you can
download and include it in your local
structure as well so I'm going to go
ahead and open atom which is the text
editor I'm using and we're going to
create a folder to work in so I'll go to
add project folder and I'm going to
create this in my projects folder and
let's just create a new folder called my
chart
okay we'll open that up and I'm just
going to create an index.html file here
alright and let's add some basic HTML
tags I'm using Emmet so I just did the
exclamation mark and then tab and it
gives us this basic file structure and
then for the title let's just say my
chart J s chart and we want to bring in
that CDN so let's put in our script tags
and we want to bring in for the source
let's go ahead and grab I'm going to
grab the minified version here so we'll
copy that and let's paste that in and
then I'm also going to grab bootstrap as
well all right so we'll just grab the
bootstrap CDN basically just for the
container and just in case you want to
add some styles later so go ahead and
grab the CSS for bootstrap and let's put
that right here so paste that in alright
so now we have charge is included now
what we want to do is go into our body
and I'm just going to create a div with
the class of container and then in here
we need an element to insert our chart
okay and you're going to use the canvas
element which is an HTML html5 element
okay and all we need to do is give this
an ID so we'll give it an ID of my chart
alright and that's where our charts
going to go everything else we're going
to do is going to be in JavaScript so
let's create our script tags here and
then we need to create a variable for
our chart looks to be that should be let
I'm using es6 let you can use a bar if
you want and then we're going to set
that to document dot get element by D
and we want to get the element that has
the ID of my chart and then when you use
when you use canvas you want to get a
context so we can do dot get context
and we want a 2d context okay so this is
what we're going to use now to create
our chart so I'm going to go ahead and
save this and then I'm going to open
this up I'm going to use something
called atom live server if you want that
plug-in you can just go to settings
install and search for atom live server
click on packages and you can download
this first one here and install it
alright once you do that you can go to
packages atom live server start server
and that will open it up okay it's going
to open up that that index.html file and
if we look at our source code here
actually let's do a control you you can
see that we have our script and then
down here this so this is just stuff
that's included by live server so you
can ignore that
okay now let's reload get rid of that
message now what we want to do is we
want to create a new object okay
and we want to use this my chart element
in that object so let's go down here and
let's say let and I'm just going to call
this bar chart okay we want to set it to
a new chart object and then we want to
insert that my chart element okay
actually it's not called this bar chart
because I want to be able to chain it's
not going to make sense if we change it
to a pie chart so let's call this I'll
call it mass pop chart because it's
going to be the population of the top
the top cities in Massachusetts and then
this is going to have a second parameter
which will be an object and this is
where all of our stuff goes all the
properties the data everything so the
first thing we want in here is the type
of chart that we want it to be which is
going to be a bar chart all right we'll
put a comma and then I'm just going to
put inside call a comment here the
different types we can have so we can
have a bar we can have a horizontal bar
we can have pie line donut radar and
polar area
I think that's it if you guys know of
any others let me know and then under
the type we're going to have data which
is going to be an object and then we're
going to have options which is also
going to be an object all right now
inside the data we want to have a couple
things so one is going to be labels okay
and the labels is going to be an array
and then we want the data set our data
sets which is an array and we can have
more than one and then I think that's
all we need for now now for the labels
in our case we're doing the top cities
in Massachusetts so that's what we want
to use for the labels so let's go back
to Chrome and I'm just going to search
for Massachusetts to the populations and
then we click on this first link here
which is from together we teach calm and
it just gives us the city name and then
the population so we're going to grab
like the first five or six here all
right and you don't have to do
Massachusetts populations you can you
can use whatever data set you want which
is really nice and there's all types of
ways to do it so what we'll do is for
the labels we're going to put those city
names so let's say Boston let's do
Worcester okay so and for you guys you
people let out for Massachusetts not war
stuff there it's not Worchester it's
Worcester we do have some very strange
pronouncing pronunciations for city
names let's say Springfield Lowell and
Cambridge and New Bedford
okay so those are the labels and then
inside data sets this is going to be an
array of object so you can have more
than one data set we're just going to
have one no it's going to have a label
of population all right and then it's
also going to have the actual data and
in this case it's going to be an array
of population numbers okay which we
could get from that website but I'm just
going to paste them in just to save some
time all right so it's just a simple
array of numbers so let's go ahead and
save that and go to our web page and
that's what we get okay so just from the
labels and the numbers it gives us this
really nice-looking chart we didn't have
to add any styles or anything now we can
customize this in a lot of different
ways so one thing you're probably going
to want to do is give these colors and
look if I hover over it we get these
nice tooltips with a little bit of
animation so to change the background
color we can go and go right after the
data array put a comma and we can say
background color and let's say you want
to make it green okay so if we save that
we take a look you'll see that now
they're green now in many cases you may
want to have different colors for each
one and we can do that by instead of
putting in one value here we can put an
array so I'm just going to comment that
out just so you guys know that you can
do that and then we'll save background
color and we're going to set it to an
array okay now you can use color names
you can use hexadecimal colors or you
can use RGB a values which is what I'm
going to use so I'm going to paste in a
bunch of different RGB a values okay for
different colors and then what it'll do
is it'll start with the first one apply
this one this one will be this color and
so on so if we save that and go back now
you can see each one has a different
color and then we have other properties
that we can we can add as well so
say after the background-color array
let's say we want border width and we
could put board with for let's say
border color and the border color we'll
just do a gray and we'll use a
hexadecimal value so let's see what that
gives us and now you can see it has a 4
pixel border with a gray color all right
but I'm going to actually change the
border width to 1 because that's too
thick and then if we want we can also do
hover border width and let's set that to
black and we can say hover focus legend
people act that should be let's say 3
and then we can do hover border color
and we'll set that to black okay so now
if we go and we hover over it you'll see
the border changes in color and width
and there's a lot of other properties as
well if you go to the documentation you
can see all that stuff but I just wanted
to give you some examples
now there's also global properties and
global options that we can apply so if
we were to go right here and we can take
X let's put a comment here we'll say
global options and we can take the chart
object and we can say dot defaults dot
global and let's say we want default
font family and let's set that to lado
or laddo I don't know how it's
pronounced and then we can also change
for instance the font size so we'll say
default font size and let's change that
to 18 actually this should Apple you
should have semicolons commas and then
let's change the color will say font
color and we'll say it will set that to
a light gray all right so if we save
that
oops what happen here unexpected token
this D should actually be equal sign
sorry about that and there we go so now
you can see all of the font is the same
size and same color and I'm going to
show you how we can target different
sections as well alright so let's move
on to the options down here okay so this
options object let's say that we want to
add a title to this chart so in options
we can say title set that to an object
and set display to true and then we can
set the text of the title so I'll say
largest cities and Massachusetts save
that and go back and now you'll see that
we have the title up at the top and it's
nicely formatted by default if we wanted
to change the font size which which by
default is 18 because that's what we set
for the global font size but we can
change that here and let's say font size
25 and now you can see that the title is
larger than the rest of the text we can
also target the legend which is this
right here so if we go and we put a
comma after title and say legend same
thing that's going to be an object and
let's say we wanted to position it to
the right because that's for being
quotes okay we can do top bottom left
right so if we were to do that you'll
see that it now moves over to the right
let's see another thing to do is change
the color now inside the legend we also
have an object called labels and we can
set that font color let's set that to
black
and now you can see the population here
and if we click it it actually we can
crop we can enable and disable it but
you can see the color is black
okay it overwrote the rest of the global
values now in this case since we only
have one data set it doesn't make much
sense to have this if this was a pie
chart it would and I'll show you why but
if we wanted to not show that we could
just say for a legend we could say
display false
okay now save it now you can see it's
gone alright so another thing we can
target in options is the entire layout
so if we go layout and we could set like
padding we could set a single value
which would add padding to all sides but
we can also set it to an object and we
can say for instance left
we'll say 50 right zero bottom zero and
top zero okay and that'll push it over
to the left 50 okay so now you can see
that it's over 50 pixels to the left and
then we can also target the tooltips you
see how we have the tooltips when we
hover over let's say we don't want to
show those we could go under layout and
say tooltips and set display to false
all right and now if we go back you'll
see that oops that didn't work
oh it's not display it's enabled okay
and now you'll see we don't have the
tooltips
I like them so I'm going to keep that it
true okay and there's other options as
well like I said if you want to really
look into it you can check out the
documentation I'm just trying to give
you some examples of some of the you
know the more common things that you
would look at and change
okay so let's see the last thing I'm
going to do is to show you the different
types we have here so let's change this
to a pie chart all we have to do is
literally just change the type and then
I'm also going to just change the legend
to display true because now it makes
sense
save and there we go and you'll see the
legend now has each city with its its
specific color and we can see it in the
graph we also have tooltips which will
show us the the population and the city
name alright so just imagine what you
could do here with with different data
sets and you don't have to create your
own data sets you can use api's that can
look up you know statistics and and data
sets on really unlimited things out
there and you can bring that in you can
make an AJAX request bring that data in
and then display it in a chart which is
really nice alright let's take a look at
see we'll look at horizontal bar and
there we go so there's a horizontal bar
and it's really nice you can just change
the type and you don't have to do
anything else now there are some options
that only pertain to certain types of
charts but like I said you can check out
the documentation for that so see what
else we have here a line chart so that
would be a line chart see it starts at
Boston and it just could gives you the
different points you can hover over the
points so you can do a donut chart which
is kind of like a pie chart just has a
hole in it and you can do a radar chart
which is pretty cool looking alright so
I don't want to get too deep into this
let me just change that back to bar I'm
going to make this code available in the
description hopefully you guys enjoyed
this and maybe you can find a reason to
use this in your own projects it's
really nice looking there's no C s
special CSS that you have to you know
you have to add yourself or anything it
just looks really nice right off the bat
