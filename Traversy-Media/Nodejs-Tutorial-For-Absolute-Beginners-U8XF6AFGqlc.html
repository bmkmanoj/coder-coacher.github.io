covering the fundamentals of nodejs now
if you've been following my channel for
a while then you may know most of the
stuff it's geared more towards beginners
but of course it never hurts to to brush
up on the basics now I know if you
search for nodejs and YouTube a million
different guides come up but
unfortunately many of them are just too
complicated and drawn-out or they don't
explain enough so I wanted to create a
simple spoken guide for anyone that's
wants to start working with node but
doesn't really know much about it as far
as prerequisites I would suggest that
you learn at least basic JavaScript
before even thinking about nodejs
you don't have to be a pro but you
should at least have a grasp on basic
JavaScript programming concepts so
here's a plan for this guide what we're
not going to really focus on building a
certain application we just want to get
you familiar with nodejs and how it
works all right I'll show you how to
install node and windows will look a
little bit at the repple that's included
that's read eval print loop and that
basically allows us to run JavaScript in
the command line
NPM or node package manager is a huge
part of nodejs which you may have used
before it allows us to install packages
and modules for node we'll talk about
how modules work we'll look at some
examples of some of the more popular
modules the package.json file which is
the main manifest file that you need to
have in your node apps and projects and
then we'll look at a basic web server
alright then we may go may go on from
there depending on how much time we have
left I don't want to make this too long
at all so what is no js' it is a
JavaScript runtime and it's built on
Chrome's v8 JavaScript engine all right
so v8 is extremely powerful it's written
in C++ and it's what's used in Google
Chrome which is in my opinion the best
browser by far you may
think differently but of course you are
entitled to that so note is essentially
JavaScript running on the server for
years javascript was thought of as a
client-side language that only ran in
the browser this made it very fast but
also extremely limited and it was mostly
used for things like user interface
widgets sliders things like that but now
it can be ran on the server with no js'
and we can build in-depth sophisticated
real-time applications with JavaScript
nodejs uses an event-driven non-blocking
i/o model and if that means absolutely
gibberish to you that's fine
let's go over it so this is one of the
parts of node that is one of its biggest
if not its biggest advantage but also
one of the most confusing to understand
especially for new developers node uses
a non-blocking i/o model now I'm
guessing that some of some of you have
experience with traditional server-side
technologies I'm going to use PHP and
Apache as an example so when you build a
PHP application on an Apache server each
connection or request spawns a new
thread which takes up system memory and
eventually maxes out whatever that the
maximum memory load handles all right so
it essentially needs to wait for one
process to finish before starting the
next and this works in it asynchronous
way note however operates on a single
thread and uses non-blocking i/o calls
which allows it to support tens of
thousands of concurrent connections
which are held in what's called an event
loop okay and that's why it's called an
event-driven system so the way that node
works optimizes throughput and
scalability in web applications with
many i/o operations and of course this
makes no extremely fast and efficient so
if we could see the event loop this is
kind of what it would look like it works
on one single thread it waits for events
and it uses an event emitter class to
bind events to listeners and it triggers
a callback
when an events detected which all
happens asynchronously and it's
non-blocking now I know to some of you
that what I just said may still not make
any sense but just know that with
traditional server-side programming you
would have to just wait for one task to
finish before you can start the next
with no js' it's on a single thread and
you can have tens of thousands
connections at once
okay so old tech shouldn't say old but
other technology such as PHP and Apache
is synchronous nodejs is asynchronous so
let's take a look at some of the things
that we can build with nodejs so it's
used extensively for restful api s if
you want to the ability to accept get
requests to get data from a database and
then serve it to a client or accept post
requests or put so you can update delete
requests all that stuff and I actually
have a couple videos on how to create
REST API using node so I would
definitely suggest looking at those
after this video real time services such
as chat chat applications games it works
really well with socket IO blogs content
management system social applications
utilities and tools pretty much anything
that you can think of that's not CPU
intensive so NPM is like I said
extremely important and a huge part of
nodejs it stands for an node package
manager or sometimes node package
modules and it basically is it's used to
install node modules or programs makes
it easy to specify link dependencies
modules get installed into the node
modules folder so if we go ahead and we
run NPM install Express that's going to
install the Express module into a node
modules folder alright and if we don't
have a node modules folder it will
create one for us now you can also
install modules globally by adding the
dash
flag and that will install it on your
system so that you can access it from
anywhere not just in that directory are
not just in that application so some
popular modules we have Express which is
a complete web development framework for
creating powerful applications Kinect is
an extensible HTTP server framework and
is basically that the the baseline for
Express socket IO is a server-side
component for working with WebSockets
POG which used to be called Jade is a
popular template engine inspired by
Hamill it's also the default template
engine for Express Mongo or and Mongo
Mongoose are wrappers to interact with
the MongoDB database which is extremely
popular with node CoffeeScript which is
a CoffeeScript compiler CoffeeScript is
a superset of JavaScript Redis which is
kind of a no SQL database but also a
caching system this is the Redis client
library so these are just some examples
of some of the thousands of modules that
are available package Jason is a really
important file that is used in node
packages and applications and goes right
in the root and it tells NPM how your
package is structured and what to do to
install it alright so it holds things
like the name of the application
the version description main is
basically the file that is the entry
point to your application in this case
it's server J s but it's often called
app J s or index J s and you can call it
whatever you'd want really author
license things like that there's a lot
of fields that are not here that are not
required as well it also lists all your
dependencies so all the modules that you
want to use in your app can go on this
file as well in this case we have body
parser express in Mongo J s and it has
the version for each one all right now
if you want to specify an
Astra's care that will basically stand
for the latest version of that module
all right you can create a package.json
file manually but you can also run NPM
in it and that will set it up for you
it'll actually ask you some of these
questions and create it for you all
right so enough with the slides let's
jump in install node and we'll start to
take a look all right so we're going to
jump in and install node on this Windows
10 machine so if you go to node.js org
we just want to click on the button here
we're going to get the at this time it's
version six point nine point one this is
the recommended version so that's what
we're going to grab all right we'll
download that it's very small file
twelve megabytes let's go ahead and open
that and we're going to click to run and
let's just go through this just your
standard Windows installer Program Files
is the default folder we're going to
click Next and install alright that's it
no js' and NPM should now be installed
now before I open up the Windows command
line I just want to show you that in the
Program Files there's now a folder
called nodejs and then you have this
node dot exe file I'm going to open that
up this is the repple the read eval
print loop program and it's basically a
command line and we can run JavaScript
in here all right so if we just type in
let's say a number
it'll give that back to us we can do
addition for instance okay that gives us
back four we can basically do anything
we can create variables so we'll say var
X equals five and it gives us undefined
because we did we're not actually
returning a value because we're just
setting a variable but if I were to type
in X and enter you can see it gives us
five okay we could say X plus two gives
us seven we could use for instance the
date function if we were to or the date
object rather if we say var
d equals new date and then we say D you
can see that it gives us the current
date what else can we do we can do loops
so if we say for let's say we have a
variable I equals 0 and then we'll say
as long as I is less than 10 then we
want to increment I plus plus and if we
put an opening curly brace and click
enter
it actually takes us to the next line so
we can we can have multi-line commands
here all right so let's say we just want
to console dot log we'll just
console.log I okay we click enter put a
closing curly brace click enter and it
gives us 0 through 9 all right we can
also create functions so if we want to
say function greeting and that'll take
in a parameter called greet okay we can
go on multi line here and then let's
just do console dot log greet okay and
then if we do greeting and we pass in
for instance hello world enter gives us
hello world all right so we can do
anything that we can do in JavaScript
now there are some things we can't do
that have to do with the browser for
instance we can't use the document
object because we don't have a document
if we were to for instance say
console.log document says documents not
defined if we do document dot get
element by ID that has no idea what
we're talking about okay so it's
JavaScript without the browser now I'm
going to close this up and I'm going to
open up my Windows command line and we
can basically get into that same
environment by just saying node all
right so now we can do one plus one or
whatever okay whatever we could do in
that repple environment but I'm going to
get out of this with ctrl C twice and
what I want to do is create a file so
I'm going to go go into my C Drive and
then let's see projects and I have a
test folder in the test folder I'm going
to create a file called app J s ok and
I'm going to open that up and we'll just
use sublime I was going to use something
different but we'll just use sublime for
the text editor so in here let's do
console dot log hello
all right now in my command line I'm
going to CD to that folder which is
projects and then test and let's do node
and we called it a pas ok so we can
actually run that file from our command
line we can put a function in here you
put our greeting function pass in a
parameter of greet and then console.log
whatever we pass in and then we can just
run it down here
and we'll pass in hello world ok so if
we run it with node and we don't even
need the dot JSP can just say node app
and we get hello world all right so what
I'm doing here isn't really useful it's
not something you would really want to
do it but just to show you that we can
we can run JavaScript from the command
line we can run the JavaScript files
from the command line as well so now
let's start to create a very basic node
application
so let's see in this test directory will
keep the app j/s there but we need to
create a package.json file okay we
talked about this so let me just clear
this out and what we're going to do is
run NPM and NIT now when we run that
it's going to ask us some questions here
the name of our application and
whatever's in parentheses is the default
if you just click enter so let's just
call it my app the version ok the
default is 1 0 0 that's fine description
we'll just say simple test app entry
point this is the main file we already
created a file called app J s so we're
going to keep that test command we don't
need this stuff git repository author
you can put your name there if you'd
like
license and then it's just asking us if
that's ok and we'll say yes all right so
now if we look in our test folder we now
have a package.json file okay if we open
that up it basically just has all the
stuff we just entered now what I want to
do is open up app KS and we're going to
create a very very basic web server
probably the most basic web server you
could possibly have all right with
something like PHP you take a PHP file
and you upload it to your server and
Apache or whatever server you're using
takes care of the all the requests and
all that stuff with note it's a little
different you have to kind of create
your own server so we're going to build
the simple server that's on the node.js
website so let's go ahead and create a
variable now I'm going to use the es2015
syntax and use constants Ted of var you
can definitely use var if you want but
it is almost 2017 so I do want to keep
this kind of modern so we're going to
set Const HTTP now HTTP we're going to
require that and that is a module
we're including a node module now we
didn't have to do n p.m. install HTTP
because it's a core module it's already
included in the system if we were to use
something else like Express we would
have to install that first so now we're
going to do is create a couple variables
we're going to create one called
hostname and we're going to we're
working on our localhost so I'm going to
use the loopback address which is
127.0.0.1 all right then we're going to
define a port we'll set that to 3000 so
now we want to do is create a variable
called server and we're going to set
that to use the HTTP module and we don't
want to call a function called create
server all right now this takes in a
function we could do this and then pass
in request response but I'm actually
going to use an arrow function because I
want to keep this es2015 so we're going
to put in a set of parenthesis pass in
request response and then use an arrow
function alright so we now have access
to these two objects so we want to set a
status code okay when you make a request
200 is the code that basically says that
everything's okay so we want to say res
dot status code set that to 200 okay
then what we want to do is want to set a
header we want to set the content type
in the header so we can say res dot set
header and if you look at the
documentation for the HTTP module it'll
show you all this stuff so we want to
set the content type we want to set that
to text slash plain all right and then
we're going to take that response object
and we're going to call dot end all
right we can actually put something in
here that will get output into the
browser so we'll just say hello world
all right so now we want to do is take
that server variable and we want to call
dot listen
and this is going to take in the port
the hostname and a callback which we're
going to use an arrow function and then
in here we'll just do a console log and
we'll say server started on port and
then we'll just concatenate that port
variable all right so let's go ahead and
save that and then if we go back to our
text editor here we run node app you'll
see we get server started on port 3000
alright and we get this blinking cursor
so that means that it's running so if we
open up our browser and go to HTTP you
could do localhost or 127.0.0.1 n't do
much all it does is output some text but
it is in fact a server now if we want to
actually load a file we can bring in the
filesystem module so if we say Const FS
and we'll set that to require FS and
then what we'll do is let's see we'll go
right here and let's say FS and it has a
function called read file which does
exactly that it reads the file and we'll
pass in let's say index.html and that'll
have a call back please use an arrow
function and then that will have an
error and let's say HTML check for the
error if there is one then you can do
whatever you want with it I'm just going
to safe throw error and if there's not
then we're going to continue on and run
the server so we want to take this cut
it and then we're going to put it inside
here just tab this over all right so now
in here what we want to do we want res
dot set header that's correct and then
we want to do for end I don't want to
actually output anything what I want to
go in here and say res let's do res dot
right and we'll put in here the HTML
that's coming from up here so let's go
ahead and save that and then we'll go
into our folder and let's create a file
called index.html and we'll open that up
and let's just put in some basic HTML
tags we'll say hello there and let's
wrap that in an h1 all right so if we
save that and we need to restart the
server so we'll do a ctrl C and then
restart it with node app we go back and
reload now notice that it's actually
showing us the HTML tags and that's
obviously not what we want but the
reason it's doing that is because if we
look over here at the content type we
have text planes so it's looking at it
as plain text what we want to do is
change this to text HTML all right and
then of course we need to restart the
server and if we go back and reload now
it's parsing the HTML because the
browser is getting that content type and
it now knows that it's supposed to parse
the HTML now this is obviously just
scratching the surface we haven't gotten
to installing modules yet and using
third-party modules so what I would
suggest now is that you check out the
Express j/s crafts course because we not
only use Express but we also use I
forget exactly which template engine we
use but we use a template
we use body parts or some other modules
so it's definitely the next step that
you want to take now that you know what
nodejs is you have it installed we
worked a little bit with some of the
core modules and so on so I would
suggest you check that out and thanks
for watching subscribe leave a like
whatever you can is great and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
