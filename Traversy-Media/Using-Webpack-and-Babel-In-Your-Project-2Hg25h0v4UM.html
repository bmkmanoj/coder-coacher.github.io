do a quick tutorial on webpack which is
a module bundler alright so we're gonna
go ahead and do that I'm gonna show you
how to set webpack up now the reason you
want to use webpack is if you want to
use modules okay for instance javascript
modules we could say require and then
some module okay whether it's a custom
module or something you want to install
using NPM and then I'm also going to
show you how we can use babel along with
web pack to use es2015 modules which
look like this so import something from
something okay so that syntax alright so
first thing we want to do is let's
create a folder for this small project
okay so I'm just gonna call this my web
pack and we're gonna open up a command
line and the first thing you're gonna
want to do well let's go to that folder
first and we're gonna want to install
web pack globally so you will need
nodejs and NPM so just go to if you
don't have that just go to node.js org
download it and install it and then you
should be able to run npm install web
pack and then add dash G which will
install it globally so that you can use
it from anywhere
alright so that's after that's done
we're going to create our project
package JSON file you can do that with
NPM in it it's just going to ask a
couple questions we're gonna keep the
defaults for these for the entry point
and we'll use app dot J s and then enter
for the rest and that should have
created a package.json file which you
can see right here alright now we want
to do is install web pack locally so
we'll say npm install web pack and
let's say - - save - dev that's gonna
save it as a dev dependency alright and
you should see that show up now in your
package JSON file alright now just to
show you how this works real quick I'm
gonna go ahead and create a new file
called people dot J s and let's see
we're going to say people are of our
people it's gonna be equal to an array
and just put some names in here alright
and then we want to export this as a
module and still say module dot exports
equals people ok we'll save that and now
we're going to create another file
called app dot J s and we want that we
want to bring that in as a module house
all right so we can say people equals
require and that's gonna be dot slash
people dot J s and then all I want to do
for now is just console.log people all
right so let's go ahead and save that
now what we want to do is we want to run
web pack and compile this JavaScript
into a static asset so we should be able
to say web pack dot slash fjs and then
we want it to go to compile to a file
called app bundle dot J s what happened
here
webpack app Jas what what did I do here
oh it's because I didn't use parentheses
here maybe I mean that's all I can see
that would be wrong here module explores
people all right let's try it again all
right there we go
okay so that compiled you can see that
now there's a file called app bundle j/s
which looks like complete gibberish
alright but now we should be able to run
that by saying node app dot bundle dot J
s and there we go it prints out the
array of people all right so that's how
web pack works on a very basic level all
right now if you're using any new
projects you're going to want to set it
up a little differently okay so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna create a
new folder called source or SRC and then
also create a folder called dist all
right the idea is that all of our source
code will go in here that's the code
that we we edit and add and then we can
compile it into the dist folder alright
so let's move people
and app J s we're gonna move those into
source all right and then in order to do
this we need to have a web pack config
file so let's go ahead and add another
file here and call it web pack dot
config dot J s alright so to set this up
close that to set this up we're going to
say module dot exports
and we need to provide an entry point so
the entry is gonna be in the source
folder app KS okay that's the source
file and then we need to provide an
output and provide a path which is going
to be dot slash dist
and then we also need a file name which
will be app dot bundle dot J s alright
so let's go ahead and save that and
let's add something we'll add another
person here we'll say John save it and
let's get rid of the app bundle that we
already created in the route we're going
to delete that and then when we run web
pack it should create it should compile
it into the dist folder alright so all
we have to do is run web pack and now
you can see that the app dot bundle is
in the distal der and if we were to run
that from here we could say node source
slash app dot bundle J s actually has to
be node dot slash nope why isn't that
working oh not sources in the dist
it's in the dist folder all right so now
you can see that it's giving us the
people and it has the new John at the
end all right so that takes care of it
if you just want to use JavaScript
modules but you may want to use the
es2015
type modules which like use the import
if you want to do that then we need to
set up babel alright so let's go ahead
and we're going to install a couple
things here I'm gonna say npm install
babel core and we also want to install
the es2015 preset so that's a Babel
- preset - es2015 and we're gonna add
this to our dev dependencies all right
that's all set now we just want to
install the babel loader so npm install
babel loader save dev okay
now what we want to do is we need to set
up that preset that es2015 preset so
we're gonna go into our root folder here
and just create a new file called babble
arse
I'm sorry dot babble RC alright and then
we're just gonna set up presets which
will be an array and we want to pass in
es2015 save that and last thing we need
to do to be able to use babble is to go
to our config file and we're just going
to add on to this add a module object
and then say loaders actually no that
needs to be square brackets and then
curly braces all right so let's say we
want to make sure we exclude the node
modules folder
okay and then let's say the loader we
want to use is Babel loader alright so
that should do it let's save that and
let's do let's install a couple modules
to test it out
so we'll say npm install jQuery and
let's also install Babel polyfill okay
we're gonna add the save flag here okay
so now what we'll do is go to our source
app j/s and let's see import Babel
polyfill we want to import the the
people file so import people from dot
slash people all right and then we'll
also import jQuery actually we wanted to
import dollar sign from jQuery which
should be in quotes okay so let's say
you'll save that oh it's
okay so that's saved so let's go ahead
and run web pack get that compiled Oh
actually no I want to go back here
because I want to add some jQuery
alright so in here we're going to put an
h1 and I'll just say people and then
let's do dot append to the body and
let's create a constant called ul and
we'll set that to jQuery ul and then
we're going to say dot append to body
and then let's do a for loop to loop
through the people
so we'll say for constant person of
people and then in here we're going to
use jQuery and say Li and we want to add
some text here and just pass in person
and then we want to append to ul all
right look save that and let's run web
pack again all right and then the last
thing we're going to do is just create
an index.html file
okay hmm let's see let's just put in our
HTML tags I don't like how this how this
editor indents alright so we need to
include the script now so script source
okay that's gonna be in dot slash what
is it we want the one in the dist folder
so disk slash app bundle not J s alright
so let's go ahead and save it and then
we'll go and open that file up or is it
right here
index and bring it over and there we go
you can see it's reading the people from
that people module alright so that's how
you can set up web pack in your project
so you can continue to install modules
using NPM and just use them as you see
fit just make sure you run web pack to
get everything compiled alright so
hopefully that kind of answers the
person that requested this video and
hopefully all you guys learn something
from it so thanks for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
