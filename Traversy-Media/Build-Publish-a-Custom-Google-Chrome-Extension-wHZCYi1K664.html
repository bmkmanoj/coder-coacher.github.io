video we're gonna actually create a
Chrome extension using just HTML and CSS
we're not even gonna have to use any
JavaScript here which what we're gonna
build is just a launcher I called it the
Traverse II launcher you can do this and
you can have my links or you can build
it for your own site and your own social
media links basically what it is I
already have it installed as you can see
and you can see up here I have my little
icon if I click that it's going to open
up the launcher which just gives us easy
access to my website YouTube channel
Twitter Facebook and github okay so if I
click it it's just going to take us to
each of those links and it's going to
open on a new tab so something very very
simple but I think it's nice we're gonna
style it nice and neat like this use
some font awesome icons and of course
you know a lot of you may want to do
something more in-depth and actually use
JavaScript and make something dynamic
but I think this is nice for beginners
just to see how Chrome extensions are
formatted how the manifest file is set
up and how to load developer extensions
and then to upload it to the to the
chrome store is very easy as well you
can see I just actually submitted it
about 10 minutes ago and it's in
progress for publishing it said it'll
take about an hour let's see we'll
reload this and at the end of the video
we'll reload it we'll see if it if it's
uploaded but if if it gets accepted
which I believe it should then you'll be
able to actually download this from the
chrome store
alright so that's what we'll be doing
guys I think it's a pretty interesting
project and something that even
beginners that are just getting into
HTML and CSS and so on can do there's no
complicated logic or anything like that
alright so let's go ahead and get
started
hey guys if you've been watching my
videos for a while and you really like
what I do when I've helped you out a lot
consider becoming a patron even for one
dollar per month it pushes me to keep
bringing you guys
the best content I possibly can there's
reward tiers for discounts for you to me
courses personal support and more so
check out the patreon link in the
description below for more info alright
so we're gonna go ahead and get started
with the launcher extension so I'm gonna
create a new folder here and I'm gonna
call it Travis e dash launcher and like
I said you can follow along exactly with
me and build this or you can make it
your own what I would suggest is
building this out first and then
recreating it as your own if that's what
you want to do alright now in this
folder we're gonna need a couple things
I want to take care of the icons okay
because we're gonna need a couple icons
we're gonna need one main icon which is
the the actual one that you see in the
button the toolbar and that's gonna be
19 pixels by 19 pixels and it should be
called icon dot PNG so I'm gonna grab
that and bring that in okay right in the
root folder here and if we take a look
at that I guess I guess we'll just open
it with Photoshop alright so you can see
it's just my tee logo and if we look at
the image size it's 19 by 19 so you can
use Photoshop or you can use something
else just go ahead and create that the
next one we're gonna need is the 128 by
128 pixels icon so you're going to want
to create that so I'm just gonna bring
that in real quick let me find it okay
and what we're gonna do is call it icon
underscore 128 dot PNG and we'll go
ahead and open that with Photoshop and
if we look at the image size it's 128 by
128 okay so those are the two icons for
the actual app now I am gonna have my
logo inside the actual markup so that's
gonna go in my images folder so I'm also
gonna create a folder called images okay
and you can put these in here if you
want but since these are actually part
of the the application the extension
itself I'm leaving them in the root but
I'm gonna paste in my logo here I just
called it travesty logo and if we open
this one up
this one is I think it's one Fiats 150
by 150 so this will actually be
displayed in the little drop down from
the extension so those are the the icons
that you're gonna want okay or the logos
so now that we have that done let's go
ahead and open this folder up in vs code
or whatever text editor or IDE you're
using and let's go ahead and create our
main manifest file every every Chrome
extension needs to have a file called
manifest Jason so we're just gonna
create that and inside here we're gonna
create or just gonna put in our curly
braces and we're gonna say manifest
underscore version and that's gonna be
version two okay at least at this time
you might want to check the chrome Doc's
if you're watching this a while from
when it was published and we're gonna
give this app a name and we're gonna
call it traversing launcher okay we're
gonna give it a description I should be
a lowercase D so description I'm just
gonna say quick launch traverse it media
and let's give it a version number this
should be legit Jason so version and
gonna give it a version of 1.0.0 it's
usually how I like to do my versioning
and let's see we're gonna add icons and
this is where we want to specify
different sized icons this should
actually be an object and then we want
to say the 128 pixel icon we want to
point to that image which will be icon
underscore 128 dot PNG okay next we want
the browser action
okay so browser action and in here we
want to put the default icon default
underscore icon which is that standard
icon dot PNG file okay and then we need
to specify the default pop-up so this is
going to be the HTML file that we're
going to use for the the launcher pop-up
where we have all the icons and stuff
that's going to be called pop-up dot
HTML okay and then we just want one more
it's gonna be permissions so for
permissions we only want one it's
actually an array but we only want one
called active tab and that's it that's
our manifest file so we can go ahead and
save that and in vs code I get this
little green line that says it should be
an array if you if you're getting that
just ignore it it's not actually an
error all right so now what we're gonna
do is create our HTML file so remember
that's called pop-up dot HTML and then
we're also gonna create a JavaScript
file called pop-up j/s now this
particular extension isn't using any
JavaScript it's just it's just
presentational but this is where you
would put your JavaScript if you are
adding any ok so let's go into the HTML
file and this is where we're gonna do
most of our work we're gonna put all of
our CSS here as well so let's go ahead
and use Emmet and just stick in our head
and body tags and for the title I'm just
gonna say traversing media or just
travesti launcher alright and then I'm
going to use open sans for my font so
I'm going to go ahead and put a link tag
in here and I'm going to link it to http
s and we want fonts dot Google api's com
slash CSS and then we want to add a
parameter so we want our question mark
family equals open
sans okay and let's just add a type here
of text slash CSS and then another thing
we're going to want to bring in is font
awesome that's what I'm using for icons
so I'm gonna go ahead and open up my
browser and we're gonna look for the
font awesome CDN gonna grab this one
here and let's just say we want the link
tag so copy that and we're gonna paste
that in there alright so now let's move
on to the markup so we're gonna go down
to the body here and let's create a div
with the class of modal - header and in
here we're gonna have our logo so we're
gonna have h1 with the class of logo and
we using Emmet as you can see and here
we'll have our image and give that a
class of logo - icon and then the source
for that is going to be in the images
folder and it's going to be that
traversée logo just can't spell my own
last name traversée - logo dot PNG okay
and then let's see we don't need I guess
for the alt I'll just say Travis C
launcher and then let's go right after
it and say Travis C launcher
okay and then I'm gonna have the version
so I'm gonna put a span tag here with
the class of version and inside that I'm
just gonna put parentheses in 1.0.0 so
that'll be the version next thing we're
gonna do is go under the header and
we're gonna have a modal content class
okay and in here I'm just gonna put a
simple paragraph and we're just gonna
say easily access Travis E media content
alright and then underneath the modal
content I'm gonna put a class of modal -
icons and in here I'm gonna put a class
called Flex container we're gonna use
flexbox to align these things and then
we're just gonna have some divs with the
class of Flex whoops Flex okay and in
each one we're gonna have a link and
this is gonna go to my website first so
I'm going to put an HTTP WWF oversee
Mediacom and we're gonna add a target to
open up in a separate page so we want
target equals underscore blank and
inside the a tag is where we're gonna
put our icon so it'll be an eye tag with
the class of FA and the class of FA -
globe that'll give us a little globe
icon okay so now what I'll do is just
copy the whole Flex div and we're gonna
have what I think it's four more okay so
the second one is gonna be youtube so
font awesome has a YouTube icon so we're
gonna change that and then change this
to my YouTube URL which will be
youtube.com slash traversing media this
next one here will be for Twitter
okay so we're gonna change that URL to
twitter.com slash traversing media all
right and then this one here will be
Facebook so that'll be facebook.com
slash diversity media and then this last
one here will be github so that's
github.com slash Brad Travis C and you
just want to change these icons this
should be Facebook and this one should
be github okay so that's it for the
markup now we can actually see this if
we want if we just open this up let's
see I'll open it up with live server and
vs code but you can just open the HTML
file up and it looks like that so
doesn't look too great so let's start to
add our CSS alright so let's see we're
gonna go to our head and let's go ahead
and put in some style tags and let's
start off we'll start off with the HTML
body
okay so we're gonna set the font family
and we want to set that to open sans so
open sans and sans serif okay we're
gonna set the font size and we're gonna
set that to 14 pixels we're gonna set
margin of 0 and we'll set a min height
so the min height is gonna be a hundred
and 80 pixels and then padding we're
gonna zero out and then we're gonna set
the width to 384 pixels so that's the
HTML body now we want the h1 which wraps
the logo so for this I'm going to say
font family and we're actually gonna set
this to mean low or Menlo and also after
that we're gonna say ma no space all
right in the font size for that is gonna
be 22 pixels we're gonna set the font
weight to 400 let's set margin to 0 and
let's set the color I'm going to set it
to my branding blue color which is to F
5 8 7 6 and that should be it for the h1
alright so for the links let's do a
we'll say a link also whoops no space
there a link also a visited we're gonna
set these to black
and let's set the outline to zero and
let's set the text decoration we don't
want any underlines so we're going to
set that to none okay now for the image
so the image I'm going to set to a width
of 30 pixels and that that'll be the
logo image and let's set the I'll start
to work on the modal so it's a modal -
header well the whole thing's a modal I
guess did the modal parts and that's
going to have a actually we're gonna
align the items of the header to the
center and then we're also gonna add a
border to the bottom which will be 0.5
pixels
solid and it's going to be like a really
light gray which is gonna be da da da
okay and then let's do the content so
say modal - contents and for that we're
just gonna add some padding we're gonna
say 0 on the top and bottom 20 - on the
left and right okay now for the icons so
we have modal - icons and for that we're
gonna set border top again to 0.5 pixels
solid and the da 3 times
okay we're also gonna set a height of 50
pixels and a width of 100% alright so we
can see what that looks like so far okay
so it just looks like that you can see
we have the border and stuff now for the
logo class actually know what let me
snap this over
so let's see for the logo class we're
just gonna add padding of 16 pixels and
let's do the logo icon so the logo icon
I want to vertical align to text -
bottom and then we're just going to add
a margin right of 12 pixels okay that
way it's kind of in line with the h1 the
version number so that had a class of
version that's gonna be color 444 which
is kind of a darker gray and then the
font size we're gonna set that to 18
pixels okay so that looks good next
we're gonna work on this part the Flex
the icons so we have flex container okay
so obviously we're going to display that
to flex and we're gonna justify the
content to space between that way all
the extra space is kind of put in
between we're gonna set padding to 10 on
the top and bottom 20 on the left and
right okay and then for each flex item
we're gonna add opacity opacity one and
I just want a little transition when we
hover over it so let's say transition
opacity and let's say 0.2 seconds and
then we want it to ease in out alright
and then we're just gonna set a width of
120 pixels okay and then the Flex hover
so for the Flex hover we're just gonna
say opacity is gonna be 0.4 so we wanted
to just get a little lighter when we
hover over it and then the icons you can
see how small they are we want those to
be bigger so let's say flex and then FA
which is the class of the icons we're
gonna set the font size to 40 pixels and
set the color to my other blue which is
the darker blue so that'll be 2 F
actually no it's the same below 2f 5 8 7
6 okay so that should be the CSS let's
save it and there we go
alright so like I said the pop-up j/s is
for your JavaScript so what I'm gonna do
is even though I'm not using any
JavaScript I'm going to link that file
just in case I want to add some later so
that'll be two pop-up dot J s alright
and I think that's it so let's save it
and we're ready to add this as an
extension so what we need to do now is
go to our browser and we're gonna go to
more tools and then extensions or you
can just type in Chrome colon slash
slash extensions and you want to make
sure developer mode is checked so that
you can upload your own and then we're
gonna say load unpacked extension and
we're just going to go to the folder
that that we just created which is
travesty launcher and let's click OK and
there we go now if you don't see the
icon here you may see a little puzzle
icon just exit Chrome and go back in and
your logo should show that with the 128
this is that 128 pixel icon and you'll
also see up here we have the little icon
if I click it there we go there is the
HTML that we just created the HTML and
CSS and if I click one of these it'll go
ahead and open up the link in another
tab which is exactly what we want
now for the chrome store what you want
to do is go to your developer console
actually let me just search chrome store
upload I forget the exact URL let's see
publishing the Chrome Web Store so this
is kind of a tutorial on how to publish
it let's see so basically you want to
zip your application up so you would
take this whole folder so everything in
it and actually would you yeah you would
just grab everything and then add it to
a zip file so we'd go like that and then
you could actually upload that to the
store so if we go back and let's go to
the chrome developer dashboard and you
could go down and say add new item and
this is where you choose the zip file
and click upload and then it's going to
ask you for a couple images some
screenshot images and I think it says it
on the documentation page sizes let's
see does it say it's right here so you
want a 128 by 128 icon and then you want
at least 1280 by 800 or a 640 by 400
screenshot so this is what my screenshot
looks like I have the 1200 by 800 here
and then the 640 by 400 here and this is
what I use so that's what will show up
all right now if I go back to my or is
it developer console which is right here
and you can see it now says published if
I click on this there it is so it's now
added to the store now instead of me
having it added through developer tools
I'm going to delete it so I'm gonna go
to extensions and I'm just gonna trash
that and then what I'll do is go back to
the chrome store and let's see if it
comes up in search
there it is I literally just uploaded
this less than an hour ago so let's say
add to Chrome add traversing launcher
add extension there it is so it's as
easy as that awesome so if you guys I
mean you know obviously if you don't
watch my content that much it's not
worth it but if you watch my content
quite a bit and you want easy access to
YouTube and social media my website to
see if my udemy courses have been
updated go ahead and install this and
give it a rating I'd really appreciate
that but yeah so that's that's how you
can create your own Chrome extension and
get it live and up and running so people
can actually install it alright guys so
thanks for watching please subscribe if
you're not subscribed already and you
like this type of video and leave it'll
