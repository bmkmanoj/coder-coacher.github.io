take a look at default parameters in es6
as well as the spread operator so with
default parameters they actually made it
really easy in fact if you know PHP and
a bunch of other languages
it pretty much much works the same way
so let's say we have a function called
greet and this is going to console.log
let's put up here the greeting and it's
just gonna log the greeting down here
we'll call it say greet and we'll say
hello
save that run it and we get hello now
what if we want to be able to actually
run this without a parameter okay it's
gonna get undefined obviously because
greeting isn't defined so all we have to
do to find the default value is just say
equals and we'll make it say hello world
save it
reload and we get hello world so this is
very very simple but let's take a look
at the difference between es6 and es5 in
this in this aspect alright so at the
Babel website I'm gonna go to try it out
and I'm just going to copy what we have
in here actually it's already there
alright so if you look over here you can
see the difference we have to define the
variable greeting setting it to argument
if the arguments length is greater than
or less than zero or it's equal to
undefined if it's not then it's equal to
hello world then we have argument 0 so
it's just a lot more complicated to do
it this way so I think it's a really
nice feature it's a simple change but
it's it'll make things more efficient
alright so that is default parameters
now we're going to take a look at the
spread operator
close that up so the spread operator is
is represented as three dots and it's
used to allow an expression to be
expanded in places where multiple
arguments are expected so what I'm gonna
do here is let's say let args and I'm
gonna set that to an array of one two
three all right and I'm gonna have a
function called test and all this is
gonna do is console dot log args all
right so if we want to get these args
into here what we could do is use we can
use the apply method which is what we
would do in es5 so we would say test dot
apply passed in null and then pass in
args all right and if we save that and
run it you can see down there we get one
two three all right now we don't have to
do this with the spread operator okay
all we have to do now is just say test
pass in the spread operator which is
three dots and then args reload and we
get the same thing we could also do
something like this
we could do two sets of arguments we'll
set this one to four five six down here
we'll say console dot log args and then
let's do a little concatenation put a
comma there this will be args two this
will be odds one and then down here all
we need to do is pass in x2 x1 where he
load what do they do
oh I put that one on the wrong side okay
so now we get one through six all right
so I don't know how much that'll help
you it's just a new change and makes
things a little easier a little cleaner
so that's going to be it for this video
in the next video in the next couple
we're going to start getting into some
of the new data structures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
