couple requests to do a video on
Google's reCAPTCHA version two so what
we're gonna do here is we're gonna
implement a client-server implementation
of reCAPTCHA okay we're gonna use nodejs
for our server and we're just gonna have
a form on the front end that enables the
reCAPTCHA if you guys don't know what
i'm talking about it's this where is it
right here this I'm not a robot thing
and sometimes you'll have the boxes
where you have to choose like the street
signs and stuff so I'm gonna show you
how to implement that all right now the
actual form isn't gonna do anything
beyond that if we want to take what you
learn in this video and apply it to my
node mail or video where we create a
contact form you can do that but I did
want to just keep this separate from
that so first thing you're gonna want to
do is go to google.com slash reCAPTCHA
and just click on this this button right
here okay you're gonna need a site key
and a server key so that's what we're
signing up for right here so let's give
this a label I'm just gonna call this
localhost we're gonna choose reCAPTCHA
version two and four domains I'm just
gonna put in localhost okay if you're
using this on a production server you
want to make sure you put your domain
name in there or it won't work
so let's click register and now you'll
see we get a site key and we get a
secret key and we have some instructions
down here now before we get to the form
and the client side we're gonna go ahead
and create our server so let's go ahead
and minimize that and I'm in my Visual
Studio code here I have an empty folder
called reCAPTCHA node and just clear
this out and we're gonna go ahead and
run NPM init make sure you have no js'
installed all right so let's go ahead
and go through this name that's fine
version we don't need a description the
entry point
I'm gonna call server dot J s and we'll
just go through the rest all right
so now we have our package dot jacent
filed now there's a few modules that
we're gonna need to install so let's say
npm install - - save
we're going to install Express to handle
routes we're going to install something
called requests because we need to once
we get the CAPTCHA access token or
whatever it is the big string that that
it gives you we need to then send that
to Google's verify URL okay and then
we'll get the response back so we're
using requests for that we also need
body part sources so that we can get the
form data all right make sure you do - -
save what happen and then want that
slash there all right so let's run that
so now that we have that setup let's go
ahead and create our server JS file
server J s and we're gonna bring in
Express so we're gonna say require
Express I may do a PHP version on this -
let's do body parser alright let's bring
in request alright and I apologize if
you hear any banging upstairs it is the
weekend so my family's home and they're
pretty freaking loud so now we need to
initialize Express so we're gonna say
Const app equals Express and in order to
use body parser we need to add two lines
of middleware so we're gonna say app dot
use and let's pass in here body parser
dot URL encoded if you use vs code
you'll get these little pop ups and
we're gonna put in here extended or yeah
extended actually this needs to be an
object so we need our curly braces and
then extended and we're going to set
that to false and then we need one more
line which will be app dot use body
parser dot jason
okay so that's our body posture
middleware now we're going to create a
route that's going to load our client
index file our index.html file so we'll
say apt-get and it's gonna be the index
route okay you can put a call back here
I'm gonna use an arrow function and use
es6 and here we need a request and
response and then all we're gonna do
here is load an index.html file so we
can say res dot send file and we want
the current directory so we'll say
double underscore dur name and that we
just want to concatenate slash index dot
HTML all right so now when we go to our
localhost it should load the the HTML
file all right so now let's say app dot
listen we want to listen on a port we'll
say three thousand and then I'm just
gonna put an arrow function as a second
parameter and we'll say console dot log
and it'll just say server started on
port 3000 alright so now we should be
able to run node server since we named
it server j/s and it started up alright
so now let's go ahead and snap this over
here and we'll go to HTTP on just got a
localhost 3000 ah
no such file directory what I do here
res dot send file to her name all adding
creates and create the index.html so
let's go ahead and do that
and we'll just put some basic HTML tags
in here using Emmet and let's say
subscribe form and we'll just say hello
let's save now we're gonna have to
restart the server and reload and we get
our index.html file alright so I
actually I'm going to use node Mon which
is a module that will watch our
application so that we don't have to
keep restarting it so I usually use it
globally so if you want to do that you
can say NPM install - G node Mon alright
and then instead of running your you
know node server we can just run node
Mon and we won't have to keep restarting
it all right so that's our HTML file now
before we do the client form and all
that stuff we're gonna finish this
server so we're gonna want to make a
post request and we're gonna we're gonna
submit the form using the fetch API all
right now you can use jQuery or you can
use just you know Ajax xhr or Axios or
anything like that we're gonna use the
fetch API to actually make the request
to the server but we're gonna make a
request to slash subscribe so let's go
ahead and add a route for that so this
is gonna be a post request we're gonna
make and it's gonna be to slash
subscribe we'll say it's like an email
subscribe form
alright so let's put our arrow function
and this will take in requests and
response and what we're gonna do is
we're going to check to see if the
CAPTCHA is that if it's undefined or if
it's just an empty string or if it's
null okay if it's any of those things we
want to return a success false error
okay basically we're just returning JSON
objects so let's say if and I'm going to
put this on multiple lines because we're
gonna check for a few things we're going
to say if request body dot CAPTCHA is
equal to undefined or
request dot body dot captcha is equal to
nothing or request body dot captcha is
equal to null then what do we want to do
we want to return res dot Jason and
we're gonna pass in an object and you
can return whatever you want we're going
to return success which is going to be
false
okay and we'll also send the message
with that so we'll put in will say msg
and then our message will just say
please select captcha okay so that takes
care of that if it's actually if it's
not checked then what we need to do is
we need to define our secret key so
under the if statement here put our
secret key let's create a variable call
it secret key and we're going to grab
this from here okay so right here make
sure it's a secret key not the site key
the site key goes on the client so we'll
paste that in I'm just gonna close this
up all right so now we have that and
we're also gonna need the Google's the
verify URL that we need to make their
request to so let's create a variable
here called verify URL all right now
this I'm going to set to a template
string so I'm going to use back ticks
instead of single quotes and this is
going to be HTTP and it's going to be
google.com slash reCAPTCHA
/ api / site verify and then we're going
to put on some parameters so we want a
question mark I'm going to say secret
equals and then we're going to put in
the variable here so we want to use this
this is es6 syntax using a money sign
and then the curly braces and then this
is where we're going to put our secret
key that we have right here all right so
we're going to pop that in there so we
have our secret key then we want another
parameter so we're going to put an
ampersand and this is gonna be the
response we're gonna set this to a
variable and it's going to be this it's
gonna be the value of the captcha so
it's gonna be request body dot captcha
alright and then we're gonna add one
more parameter so another ampersand
we're gonna say remote IP equals and we
can get this let's use a variable we can
get this with a request dot connection
dot remote address all right so that's
our verify URL string now what we want
to do now that we've constructed that is
we want to make our request to it so say
make request to verify URL and we're
going to do that using that request
module that we installed so we're going
to say request we're going to pass in
our verify URL and then that's going to
give us back let's put an arrow function
here get rid of that so that's gonna
give us back error response and body
okay and then what we're going to do is
we're gonna take that body that it gives
us and we're gonna just parse it as
Jason I'm gonna say Jason dot parse and
then pass in body all right so now what
we want to do is check this body so
we're gonna do an if statement what this
will be if not successful
oh all right so if not successful then
we're going to basically return an
object that says success Falls just like
we did up here with a message
so we'll say if body if body dot success
is not equal to undefined and not body
success alright so if this is true then
it's not a successful CAPTCHA so we want
to return actually we'll just copy what
we did up here okay well so we'll paste
that in and we'll paste the message here
and we'll say failed CAPTCHA
verification okay and then we're gonna
go under that if statement and that
means if that didn't if that didn't run
then we're successful so we'll say if
success or if successful then we want to
also return an object but it we're going
to say success true and then we'll set a
message and we'll say CAPTCHA passed
okay and that's it that should do it for
our server so let's save that now I'm
there may be some errors here I don't
know we'll know when we actually do the
testing so now we're going to go to our
index.html and I'm gonna use bootstrap
so let's go ahead and go to get
bootstrap just to make this form look a
little better we'll grab the CDN right
here and just paste that in alright now
we're also gonna need if we go back to
our reCAPTCHA settings here I think I
have to make this bigger so we're gonna
need this script tag right here which
points to google.com reCAPTCHA API dot j
s that needs to go in the head so I'm
going to put that right here and then
this right here is the actual reCAPTCHA
okay that's the actual checkbox thing
we're gonna we're gonna put that in in a
second but what I want to do is just
paste in a form I don't want to waste
time typing in a form you guys you know
should know what a form is so let's go
ahead and paste this in and basically we
just have a container we're using
bootstrap we have a form as an ID of
subscribed form and then we have some
fields just a name and an email the hell
is that - doing there but the each field
has a name and an ID okay and then we
just have our submit so let's save that
let's reload and there's our form now to
add the CAPTCHA what we want to do is go
back to here and we want to grab this
okay we're gonna put this right above
the input the submit button we're
actually going to put it in a form group
Dib div just to add that spacing okay
your your site key will obviously be
different and let's save it let's go
back and there it is alright so we need
to submit this form using Ajax or we're
gonna use the fetch API so let's go down
to the bottom here and put in some
script tags okay and we're gonna have to
add an event listener for this form
submission so and you could use jQuery
if you want but I'm gonna use vanilla
JavaScript I've been trying to stay away
from jQuery like most developers let me
just fix this real quick just format
that up alright so in here we're gonna
say document dot get element by D the
form has an ID of what was it subscribed
form and we're gonna say dot add event
listener and we want to listen for a
submit event and then we're gonna call a
function called submit form
all right so let's go ahead and create
that function submit form and since it's
a submit event we need to pass in an
event object and we need to say e dot
prevent default and that'll prevent the
actual submission to a file all right so
let's just test this out real quick
we'll say console.log one two three
let's open up our client-side console
and let's reload this and submit and we
get one two three okay so let's go ahead
and clear this out and what we want to
do is catch the form fields we want the
name the email and the CAPTCHA so we're
going to say Const name equals document
dot let's use query selector okay and it
has an ID of name and we want the value
all right now I'm just going to copy
this and we want the email so that'll be
the ID of email and then we want the
CAPTCHA now this we're actually going to
be using an ID of G - reCAPTCHA -
response okay and notice that it that's
not actually included in the div but
this is just part of the API so this is
what you need to use that actually got
me stuck for a while trying to figure
that out alright so now that we have
these fields we want to use fetch so
let's say fetch
and here we want the route that we want
to post to which is going to be slash
subscribe on our server
alright so we're also going to pass in
an object and we want to specify that
this is going to be a post request okay
it's gonna be a post request and then we
want headers that's going to be an
object and we just want to specify
headers acept
and we're gonna set this to application
slash jason and also we put a comma and
then we'll say text slash plain another
comma and we'll say asterisk slash
asterisk alright and then after that
quote single quote we're gonna put a
comma and then we want to put the
content type whoops
should be single quotes or double quotes
and we'll say content - type and we want
to set this to application slash Jason
all right so that's the headers and then
we just want to put the body this is
what's going to include the actual
fields we're gonna say body and I'm
gonna run this through Jason dot
stringify we don't want that and then
we're gonna pass in an object with the
name which will equal the name the email
which will have the email and the
CAPTCHA which will have the CAPTCHA all
right and all these variables are coming
from these right here so we're just
sending this stuff in the body with the
request alright so the way that fetch
works is it gives us a promise so we're
gonna say dot let's go on the next line
we're gonna say dot then and we have to
take the response we have to take the
response I'm gonna put another set of
parentheses and say res and then we're
gonna set that to res dot jason like
that and then we need to do another
dot then I know it's a little weird but
that's that's what we need to do and
here we're going to get the actual data
so we'll put in parentheses data we'll
use an arrow function and then you're
gonna do whatever you want with the data
so I just want to log it and that should
do it so let's save this alright let's
go ahead and let's just refresh this
whole page and first thing I'm going to
do is I'm just gonna put whatever in
here and then not check it
let's click Submit so we get back our
response which which is success false
message please select CAPTCHA all right
and you can do whatever you want with
this if you want to one thing you may
want to do is maybe doing alerts and say
let's see we could say data yeah say
data dot message or data msg all right
so if we go ahead and we submit and say
please select CAPTCHA now that's not a
very elegant way of doing it you may
want to put in a div and have a nice
little alert up here but you know I'm
not gonna get into that so let's go
ahead and try to actually submit it put
in whatever it doesn't matter we'll
check that off all right now sometimes
it doesn't doesn't show these boxes I
think the reason it's doing it for me is
because I've during development I've
submitted it so many times because the
first few times that I did it it didn't
actually show these boxes so I'm not
exactly sure how that works but we're
gonna go ahead and just do this click
Next
let's see once the vehicles looks like
that's a vehicle I don't know is it
vehicles up there some of these are
pretty tough let's verify okay so we get
the little check here and let's submit
and we get failed CAPTCHA verification
all right so that actually shouldn't
have happened so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go where we make this
request and we get the body back we're
gonna console.log the body and see what
that gives us so let's go ahead and
reload this and we'll just check this
off vehicles vehicles verify submit all
right so failed CAPTCHA
all right so over here the we're getting
missing input response missing input
response so let's see let's actually
search for that so search for a missing
input response and verifying the user
response this page explains response so
we sent the secret so if we look at the
verify URL we have the secret response
and always spelt response wrong there's
no s that should be it that makes
perfect sense it's not it didn't it's
not getting the CAPTCHA to the verify
URL all right so hopefully that fixes it
so let's go ahead and reload that let's
try it again
so street signs whoops let's click next
god she's allowed up there street signs
so I guess we want those verify submit
there we go CAPTCHA past's all right
cool so I mean you can decide what you
want to do when it passes you know we're
just we're just alerting it and of
course if you're doing something on the
server side I mean you know if it's
successful then you could move on to you
know send the email I mean that's what
you if you're gonna implement this with
the node mail or tutorial I did you're
gonna say if it's successful then send
the email used node mailer or if you are
entering something into a database you
want to then do that here anything that
you want when it's successful all right
so hopefully this gives you guys a
little bit of insight on how to use this
on the client and the server side and
that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
