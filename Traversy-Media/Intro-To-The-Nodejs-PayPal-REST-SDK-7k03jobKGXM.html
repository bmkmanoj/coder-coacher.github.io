asked a lot lately to do something with
PayPal so in this video we're gonna take
a look at the PayPal rest SDK module for
nodejs and this is used to work with the
PayPal restful api alright so you can
use it to you know create your shopping
cart create subscriptions invoicing
pretty much anything it's really
powerful but the documentation is not
that great there's a lot of samples but
they're all spread out and they're just
basically just you know separate
snippets that it doesn't really show you
a clear way to do things and to put
things together so that's what I want to
do in this video is show you how to get
everything set up show you how to
actually take a payment have them get
redirected to PayPal pay come back and
then you'll get that info like shipping
at like the shipping address all the
transaction info the stuff that you
would put in your database for your
application
alright so that's what we'll do in this
video let's go ahead and get started I
want to give a huge shout out to today's
sponsor male tag male tag is a chrome
extension that allows you to track your
emails in real time for free it also
lets you track other cool things like
link clicks email reopens and even the
device that was used to open your emails
be sure to check out male tag by
clicking the link in the description
below alright now before we do anything
before we write any code we need to do a
couple things we need to set up some
sandbox accounts to work with because
you don't want to be testing with real
PayPal accounts and real money
and PayPal makes it really really easy
and really nice because they have a
complete platform that mimics their real
platform it's a it's for testing it's at
sandbox PayPal com
so you can actually create basically
fake accounts business and personal and
you can log in here and you can manage
the account just as if it was a real
account except it's not real money all
right now to create these accounts to be
able to log in here you need to go to
developer PayPal comm and log in with
your real PayPal account alright once
you do that over here on the side here
you'll see sandbox and you go to
accounts and from here you can create
busy
in personal accounts you see I already
have a couple testing accounts but I'm
gonna you know show you how to do that
so let's go ahead and click on the
create account button and we're gonna
first create a business account which is
the merchant account and for the email
address it can be anything it doesn't
have to be a valid email address it
doesn't have to be yours it just it just
can't have been used before in this
platform alright so I'm gonna go ahead
and use this is like my tenth time
making this video so I have to think of
something that I haven't used before
I'll just say Brad business at gmail.com
all right so let's say we're gonna do
one through eight has to be eight
characters for your password first name
last name and then you can add how much
money you want this account to have I'm
just gonna say a thousand all right bank
verified yes credit card visa that's
fine and then we'll click create account
all right so now we have a business
account now this is what's going to take
the payments we now need a personal
account to test it out and actually make
the payment okay so let's go create
account this is gonna be a personal
we'll call this Brad personal at
gmail.com
and let's give this a different name
we'll say John Doe PayPal balance will
say 700 verified for this select payment
card I'm going to select PayPal and then
click create account ok so now we have a
personal and a business account to test
with now if we look at the documentation
for the SDK here we're going to need a
client ID and a client secret so what we
need to do is go back to the sandbar the
developer console and go over to my apps
and credentials and we're gonna just
create if we go down here where it says
REST API apps you'll see I already have
a couple here I'm going to click create
app and we'll just call this PayPal no
test and it's going to ask you to choose
one of your business accounts I'm going
to choose the one we just created and
click create app alright so now you can
see we have our client ID and if I click
the show link it gives us the secret all
right now before we start I just want to
show you that we can go to sandbox
PayPal comm and we can go ahead and we
can log in with either of those accounts
so let's say Brad business at gmail.com
put in my password and it should log in
and we should get an interface just as
if it were a real business account all
right you can see I have $1,000 in there
that's obviously not real money I could
have put a million dollars if I wanted
to it's just for testing all right and
you can do the same stuff you can go to
your profile set up your business the
same exact thing as if it were a real
account okay it's just at sandbox PayPal
comm instead of PayPal comm and you can
log in with your personal account too
alright if you want to test that out but
we're gonna go ahead now and start on
our application alright guys so I just
have an empty folder here called node
PayPal sample so just create a directory
somewhere where you want to create this
app and then I just have vs code open
and I'm using the integrated
terminal all right so we're gonna go
ahead and create our package.json file
with npm in it okay obviously you need
nodejs installed and we'll just go
through this so description I'll just
say sample PayPal app entry point I'm
gonna use app dot J s and then just
enter through the rest all right so now
we have our package JSON file so now
what we want to do is install a couple
dependencies I'm gonna say npm install
do - - save and let's install the rest
paypal rest SDK so paypal - rest - SDK
we also want Express and we want AJ s
for our template engine and as far as
templates I mean we're just gonna have
one view and we're not using any style
or anything I don't really care about
that I just want to show you how the the
rest SDK works with the API alright so
let's go ahead and close that up
now we're gonna create our App J's file
our app J s and I'm gonna paste some
stuff in here because I see I've been
doing a lot of node videos lately and I
seem to just keep repeating myself with
just setting up a basic Express server
so we're just bringing in our
dependencies here setting the app to
Express setting the view engine - EJ s
we created an index route that's just
gonna render an index template or view
and then we're starting our server on
port 3000 alright very simple so let's
go ahead and save this and then we're
going to create a views folder and
inside views we're just gonna have one
file called index dot JSP ml stuff in
here with Emmet look
and so you'll change the title to PayPal
I don't know
PayPal note app and then all we're gonna
have in here is basically a form but
let's put an h1 and we'll say Boston Red
Sox hat okay we'll say that that's
that's what we're buying on this page
we'll put in h2 and we'll say buy for
$25
okay so now what we want to do is have a
form and this form action is gonna go to
slash pay okay so we're gonna have a pay
route and this is gonna be a post
request so we're gonna say method equals
post okay and then inside here all we
need to have is an impasse abutting so
we're gonna say input submit and the
value will just say bye all right and
that's it so let's save this and then we
should be able to run our application
with node fjs or just note app we get
server started let's go over to
localhost port 3000 and there we go
now if I click buy it's gonna make a
request to slash pay but we haven't
created that in our app j/s so it's not
gonna do anything now to run the
application instead of doing no tap j/s
I'm gonna use node Mon so node Mon will
constantly watch the application you
know so that we don't have to keep
restarting it if you want to do that you
can install it with NPM install - g4
global and then node Mon alright and
then once you do that you can just
simply run node Mon okay and that will
constantly watch the app alright so back
to our app je s now we're going to start
to get into the SDK so let's go to the
documentation and first thing we're
going to need is to add our client
secret and ID so I'm going to copy this
I'm gonna put this right up here and
then we obviously need to replace both
of these I'm just
gonna make those blank and then we'll go
to this page here in our developer
console we'll grab our client ID yours
will be different I'll paste that in
there we'll grab the secret make sure
you copy it exact and make sure that
this is sandbox okay once you're ready
to actually go live you can change this
to live alright so that's the first
thing now we need to do is create the
pay route that the form is getting
submitted to so we'll say app dot post
it's a post request alright and then in
here this is gonna go to slash pay and
for a second parameter I'm going to use
an arrow function of course we need to
have our request response in here and
then if we go down to this part of the
documentation this show this gives us
basically a starting point alright so we
have to create this JSON object and this
will have all of the item info you can
have more than one item so if you had
like a shopping cart and you were adding
items you could do that we're just gonna
have the one Red Sox hat and then our
return URL and the cancel URL alright so
we put this stuff in here and then we
pass it into PayPal payment dot create
ok you can see we're passing in that
JSON object then we get this callback
with this payment object alright and
this is going to give us a bunch of
stuff including the link that we need to
redirect the user to all right now this
this is kind of deceiving because it
seems like you know this this is all we
need to do to make a payment and that's
not the case we need to get we need to
get the link from this object all
they're doing here is console logging it
we get the link we redirect the user
they go through the whole process they
get sent back to whatever we put in this
URL and that's still not the end they
didn't get charged we have to then
execute the payment on our server and we
do that I'm going to show you this other
page here we do that by creating another
object and execute payment JSON object
and we need to include the payer ID
which is going to be put into
a parameter in the success or in they've
returned URLs we need to pluck that out
and then put that in here and then call
PayPal payment execute all right so you
can see that the you know I think that
they should have a nice laid out example
of how this all works instead of just
you know giving use little snippets this
doesn't show anything about like the
redirection to PayPal or anything like
that I don't know what's up with with
documentation lately but it's just not
clear and that's where I come in that's
what I try to do with my channel is make
things easier for you guys alright so
enough with that spiel let's go ahead
and copy this right here okay and we'll
put this inside of our pay route all
right I'm just gonna change this to
Const all right and let's see we're
gonna edit this a little bit so let's
see the return URL we're gonna make a
localhost port 3000 slash success you
know what let me make this make this
bigger so slash success and then for the
cancel will do localhost 3000 slash
cancel okay so those are the two URLs
and then down here we'll put the product
info so name will say Red Sox hat and
this stuff can come from a database and
I probably would instead of being
hard-coded but I'm not doing that I'm
just showing you how this works I'm just
gonna put 0 0 1 for the SKU the price
will do 25 this stuff can also come from
your form alright so when you have your
form you could send fields and use the
body parser to get those fields and
input stuff in here too like the price
alright so quantity 1 total amount is
gonna be 25 description will say hat 4
the best team ever and that's our that's
our JSON object alright so now we need
to pass it into this PayPal dot dot
create so let's copy that and let's go
under the object here and paste that in
whoops I'm using a Mac keyboard and the
function in control spacing is really
throwing me off all right so put that in
there so we're passing the JSON object
in it's gonna give us this payment
object back and then we're gonna
console.log it so let's try it as is all
right so let's save and let's go to our
application and we'll click buy actually
you know what after we console.log let's
just do a res dot send just so it
doesn't hang or anything so we'll just
say test alright so let's go ahead and
click buy all right so now if we look in
the console this is what that payment
object gives us an ID intense sales
state created transaction info
description all that what is really
important for us here is this links
array gives us an array of different
links what we want is the approval URL
this is where we want to send the user
to pay alright so what we're gonna do
here and what they don't show you in the
documentation is we're gonna do a loop
through the links array and then find
the approval URL and send the user to
that URL all right so we can go ahead
and get rid of this stuff here and let's
just put a simple for loop in here okay
and there's obviously different ways you
can handle this so what we're gonna do
is say for let's say let's I equals 0
and then we'll say as long as I is less
than payment now this payment is coming
is this object here that I just showed
you and remember it has an array called
link so we're gonna say dot links dot
length okay so as long as I is less than
the length of those that links array
then we're going to increment by one
and then down here we want to just do a
quick if statement and we want to see if
it's the approval URL okay so for that
we can say if payment dot links get the
current iteration and then look at the
rel attribute okay
which you can see here there's there's
execute we want the approval URL so we
want to say if that is equal to the
approval underscore URL okay if it is
then we want to redirect the user so
we'll say res dot redirect and we'll
pass in payment dot links current
iteration dot href okay eight ref is is
where the actual link is and that should
do it that should redirect the user so
let's go ahead and save that so let's
try it up to this point let's see what
happens so we click buy we should get
redirected to PayPal and we're going to
log in with our personal account
all right so we're gonna just agree to
this just it's just like if you were
checking out you know a real paypal
let's see
hi John $25 continued all right so what
happened is it redirected us back to
success because that's what we put right
here and then it adds on some parameters
a payment ID a token and a payer ID all
right now like I showed you in this
documentation page we need to now create
this X inside the success we need to
create this execute object with the
payer ID and that payer ID we have to
take out of this URL alright so what
we're going to do now is go under the
pay route which ends right here and
we're going to create a route for the
success all right so say app dot get and
inside here we're gonna say slash
success
all right and it's gonna take
request/response and then what we want
to do is like I said get those
parameters from the URL that's sent back
so we're gonna create a variable called
let's say payer ID and to get parameters
from the URL with node we can just do
request stock query dot and then the
parameter so the payer ID actually has a
capital P and capital ID like that so we
want to make sure that we get that exact
alright and then we want the payment ID
which will be request dot query dot and
I believe it's just yeah payment ID like
that so put that in there alright so
that that'll get those parameters now we
need to create that execute object just
like they did here so I'm gonna copy
this I'm gonna paste that in here I'm
just going to change this to Const and
then pay your ID we need to put in this
variable like that
alright and then the transaction I'm
gonna change the price to 25 that
creates the object then we need to call
PayPal payment execute so I'm gonna copy
this and we're gonna put this right
under the object here and just tab that
over alright so this will go right here
and let's see it's gonna take in the
payment ID which I've already created
the variable right here so that's okay
and then down here if we get an error
will log it and then if not if
everything goes through it's just gonna
log this payment object which will give
us everything we need for the
application every we would put stuff in
our database like the address info and
all that and then I'm just gonna res dot
send
and we'll just say success alright and
you should also have a cancel route
because you we did define it right here
in case they cancelled the order or
whatever so let's go ahead down here and
just say AB dot gets oops stupid Mac
keyboard app dot get and it's gonna be
slash cancel and we'll just do an arrow
and all I'm gonna do here is just do a
res dot send and we'll say cancel okay
that also needs a request response all
right so this should actually work it
should make the payment okay it should
execute the payment and then it should
give us that info that we want I'm gonna
get rid of this log oh all right so
let's go ahead and save this alright and
then let's go to our application we're
gonna go to the localhost 3000 and we'll
click buy it's gonna go through the same
process it just did except this time it
should actually do that should make the
payment once it returns so let's
continue alright so it redirected us
back to success and it's logging out
this payment object right here from this
execute and you can see all the stuff
that it gives us all the transaction
info where as where's the address right
here shipping address and when you
create a fake account a fake personal
account like we did it gives you this
fake address as well this San Jose
California and then just a bunch of
other stuff that's very helpful and that
you would use in your app alright so now
to check to see if the payment actually
went through we're gonna go to the
sandbox account let's login with our
business account I'm sorry this is the
personal account and you can see that we
now have 675 remember we put 700 as the
default and over here you can see we
made a payment to Brad Traverse ease
test store for
twenty-five dollars all right and if we
log out and go into our business account
which is Brad business
we should have 25 more dollars and there
we go well 23 97 after PayPal takes its
cut but you can see right here our
payment from John Doe 25 bucks so that's
how you can set up the SDK to actually
take a PayPal payment all right and you
can see that this stuff is just I mean
these little snippets here they are in
the documentation as I showed you but it
doesn't show you a clear way to use it
so hopefully this will help you guys out
on how to do this stuff and then if you
look in the samples right here there's
all types of snippets for invoices so if
you want to send invoices creating
invoices it's all about creating the
object first and this stuff can come
from wherever from your database and
then running it through a method like
create okay but it like I said it's
basically just snippets so this is this
is how you can put it together with
routes and redirects and all that stuff
okay hopefully it's clear alright so
that's it for this video guys
I continue to look into this to the
PayPal REST API I've used PayPal a lot
in the past with PHP but not too much
with nodejs so I do have some studying
to do you know whatever I learn you guys
learn is the way I look at it whenever I
learned something new I like to make a
video on it and share it
but yeah so if you liked it please leave
like subscribe if you like this video in
this channel and I will see you next
time so I just want to give another
