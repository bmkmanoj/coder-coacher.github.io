following me for a while then you know
that occasionally I like to take a
technology or a tool for web development
and programming and just touch on the
basics there's a lot of info out there
but oftentimes it's explained in a much
more complicated way than it really
needs to be so in this video we're going
to take a look at curl or see URL curl
is a tool for for transferring data to
and from a server and for making various
types of requests it's a great tool for
testing rest api's downloading files and
so on many developers would prefer to
use something like postman to test api's
but curl is another option and it also
supports just about every protocol under
the Sun you can see here it supports
HTTP HTTP FTP IMAP and pop3 SMTP so it
supports all these different protocols
alright in this video we're going to be
working with HTTP and FTP so as far as
your environment in your operating
system modern versions of OS X and most
Linux distributions have curl and live
curl installed by default if you're
using Windows as a few different things
you can do you can download it from here
curl hacks SC but what I would recommend
is to use git bash okay so this is git
for Windows it's that git - SCM com I
would suggest downloading and installing
that if you don't have it already it
gives you it gives you a whole bunch of
unix based commands that you can use
including curl it's also just a better
command line than the standard windows
or even powershell so i would suggest
that that's what we're going to do so
I'm just going to open that up we'll say
get fash okay and this is it right here
and if we say curl - - help it'll show
us all the different options that you
can use with your curl commands is just
a ton okay we're just we're just
scratching the surface today with using
some working with the HTTP protocol as
well as FTP all right now this is the
site that we're going to be working with
is Jason placeholder dot type
code comm and this is basically a fake
online REST API that we can use for
testing and stuff so if we scroll down
here you can see the different routes
that we can use so slash posts will give
us a hundred items comments will give us
500 we have albums photos to do's and
users and if I click on for instance
post you'll see it actually gives us a
hundred posts to go down to the bottom
here you'll see ID 100 all right so
that's what we're going to be working
with now if you wanted to just get a
single post you could just go / - for
instance and that will give you the the
post that has the ID of - all right you
can also make different types of
requests you can make a post request to
slash posts a put which is an update
patch or a delete request now it's not
going to actually delete stuff off the
server it's just for testing so what
happens is it'll give you a response
back ok it's not going to actually
update anything in their database or
anything like that it's just for testing
and you can also install this locally if
you want through NPM alright so let's
get to it we're going to go over into
the command prompt I'm just going to
make this a little bigger ok we'll clear
that out and the first thing I want to
do is simply say curl and then we're
going to grab this I'm not that we want
the posts so we'll go right here and
just grab this and paste that in and
we'll go ahead and run it and notice
that it gives us all 100 posts ok that's
the response we get now if we wanted to
get a single one again we could just do
curl and then that URL and then let's
say slash 3 run that and it gives us the
post with the ID of 3 alright so if
you're creating a REST API this is a
really good tool to test this stuff out
now there's a ton of options I'm not
even going to get close to to them all
but one option is to use the - I flag
here so it's just a - lowercase I and
run that and what that does is it
includes all the header information okay
so things like the content type you can
see it's Jason
the length
what else access control cache stuff
some stuff that I don't even understand
but that will include the header now if
you just want to get the header you
could use either - - head
I believe yet or you could do you could
use the capital I flag so if we go yeah
capital I and then that just gives us
the head as well most of these options
have a - version and then a - - version
all right so let's say we want to to
make the request and get this get all
these posts and put it into a file okay
so for that we can use - lowercase o or
- - output so what I'll do here is
actually going to navigate to a
different folder I'm going to go to my
test folder and see what's in there I've
hello text I'm actually going to delete
that so I'm going to do in R M R and
then hello dot txt alright so that will
delete it now I want to make the request
so let's go back - yeah we'll go right
right here this is all the posts and
then I'm just going to add on a -
lowercase o alright now I also want to
specify the name of the file that I want
this stuff to go in so let's say test
dot txt alright so if we run that and
now we take a look we have test txt and
if I do cat test dot txt you'll see we
have all of the posts in that file now
we can also download files with curl so
if we were to do let's take away the
test txt and then use an uppercase o
here and that'll download it so if we go
ahead and run that you'll see now we
have this post file it doesn't have an
extension or anything but if we were to
say cat posts you can see they're all in
there now if we wanted to download let's
say an image
for instance this one right here let's
go ahead and copy the image address and
then we'll go over here and say curl -
uppercase o and then we'll go ahead and
paste that in that image alright now if
we look you'll see we have the PNG image
now we can also limit the transfer rate
for download let's go back to that
command and then we're just going to add
on right here we'll say - - limit - rate
and then we'll say 1000 bytes all right
and that'll download it with that limit
to the the data transfer so let's say we
wanted to make a post request to
actually add data to the server and like
I said this is only uh this is a fake
REST API it's not going to save anything
if we make a post request but it will
give us a proper response if it goes
through so what we're going to do here
is say curl and then - D you can either
use - D or - - data and then we want to
put some quotes and let's say we want
title to be hello and let's say the body
so we'll say and body equals hello world
all right so that's the data we want to
send then we need the URL which we go
down here you can see you're allowed to
make a post request to slash posts so we
obviously want that entire URL which is
this right here and then we'll go ahead
and put that in here and let's run it
and you can see it gives us a response
with the title the body and the ID is
101 okay because there's a hundred
stored here and the idea is auto
increment so the next one is going to be
101 okay I mean it's not going to get
saved if we reload this you're not going
to see it here but it was a successful
response now we can also update data
with put of making a put request you'll
see if we go back here look at the
routes you can make a put request to
post slash and then
ever ID so let's go over here and just
bring that back up and we're going to
say post slash three and let's just do
the title hello and then we need to add
on right here and specify that we want a
put request and we also want to use this
- capital X flag so if we run that and
what happened oh you know what I did
that wrong we have to do - X we don't
want the data right there that - - data
alright so we run that wait that's not
right either we do need to D it just has
to go after put sorry about that guys so
right here will do - D ok so now you can
see we took the ID of 3 and we change
the title to hello okay so that's what
it gives us back now to make a delete
request same thing we're going to go
back and let's change for instance we
don't need this we don't need the - D
all we want is - X and then delete ok
and that made a successful delete
request and you can see there's nothing
back we're getting back an empty object
alright now oftentimes when you're
creating an API you want to have some
secured routes so if that's the case
then you just need to add in a couple
things so let's say curl and then what
we would do is - you and then put your
username colon and then whatever the
password alright and then you want your
you know whatever comes next I don't
have anything to test with but that's
what you would do if you had something
where you needed to authenticate all
right so next we have the - uppercase L
flag and that's going to follow
redirection so let me give you an
example if we say curl HTTP google.com
basically we're getting this response
that says 301 moved
okay the document has moved to w w
google.com same thing if we go on the
browser we say HTTP google.com it
redirects us to the WWV version alright
now if you want to actually follow that
then you have to add the - el flag so
let's do that
uppercase L and now you can see it gets
google.com for us and it gives us all
this crap okay from from that URL
alright so next thing we want to do is
show you how to work with the FTP
protocol which is File Transfer Protocol
and I have FileZilla installed and I'm
connected to my Traverse II media
website in the test directory so what we
can do here is we can upload a file
through FTP using curl all right so I'm
actually going to say I'm going to go to
that test directory and let's create a
new file we'll just call it hello dot
txt and we just open that up
and we'll just say hello world save that
and then I want to upload this to my ft
to my server using FTP so to do that
we'll say curl and we want to put our
credentials just like we would as I
showed you before we want to use - u and
then the FTP account which for me is
test at traversée mediacom alright and
then we want to put the password colon
in the password I'm deleting this
account before I upload the video so
don't bother trying and it just goes to
a test folder anyway alright and then we
just want to add the - t flag and then
the name of the file which is hello dot
txt and then we're going
do FTP and it's going to be FTP dot
Travis e media.com alright so that
should do it let's go ahead and run it
could not resolve oh I forgot the F all
right so should have uploaded let's go
over here and refresh and now you can
see hello dot txt now we can easily
download files as well so what I'll do
is delete this hello text and then what
we want to do is go and change this
capital T to a capital o get rid of this
file name here and we'll say FTP Travis
Lee Mediacom slash hello dot txt all
right and then if we look you can see
that it's been downloaded all right so
that's all that's all we're going to get
into now there's a lot more you can do
with curl stuff that's a little more
advanced maybe we'll visit that later on
down the line hopefully this gives you a
little bit of insight as to what it does
and maybe you can use it in your in your
endeavors alright so if you like this
video please leave it a like subscribe
all that stuff alright so thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
