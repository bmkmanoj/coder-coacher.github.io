you how to install the SFTP plugin for
sublime text sublime text 2 which will
allow you to upload or sync your local
files and your local project with your
live web server you can set it up so
that you can do it manually or if you
want it to just save and sync
automatically but before we do that we
need to install sublime text package
control so that we can actually install
this so what we want to do is this two
two ways we can do it and let me just
take you to the site it's sublime dot W
bond dot net slash installation
I think yeah so we can do with two ways
manually we can download this file and
upload it to our install packages
directory or we can do it even easier
and just plug this into our console I'm
using sublime text too but you can use
three as well and I'm just going to grab
this and then I'm gonna go to my sublime
text and I want to go to view show
console and then just paste that in and
click enter all right so we need to
restart sublime text
so now that we've done that we should be
able to do a control shift P and if
you're using a Mac it should be command
shift P and then I'm going to start to
type install and now we should be able
to have click on this package control
install package now I'm going to do is
start searching for SFTP okay and then
we click on that and we're going to get
this is basically just telling us how to
map a local file and thing stuff like
that
so I'm going to close that up and what I
want to do now is again do ctrl shift P
and start to type SFTP and I'm gonna
click on setup server all right so it's
going to give us this file where we need
to enter some parameters and the first
thing that I do is take away the s here
because usually I have issues when I
keep it at SFTP I don't know if it's my
server or what and then you want your
host okay so I'm just gonna use my code
skillet domain your user name
and your password I'm obviously not
going to put my password in while it's
recording I'll do that after but remote
path what I'm gonna do is I just I want
to go to the root of this server so I'm
just gonna leave a forward slash all
right and then I'll enter my password
and I'll save and don't forget to
uncomment your password and once you
save it you'll get prompted to save it
as and you can name it anything you want
I'm just gonna call mine
skillet and once you save it you should
get something like this
basically we now have access to our
server you can see the public HTML
directory alright so what I want to do
is I want to map this folder this test
project which is just a file on my
desktop to a test project folder on my
server alright so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna use FileZilla just to get in
whoops what happened
all right so my code skillet server I'm
gonna go to public HTML and I'm going to
create a directory and I'm going to call
this test project okay
and I'm going to right click on my
folder here and you should see this SFTP
FTP option and I'm going to map to
remote and it's going to give us a file
like we just we just dealt with and it
changed this to FTP you want to put your
host
all right and password and you also want
to define your path here I want it to go
to my public HTML you want to make sure
you have this beginning forward slash
and I'm going to go to public HTML slash
test project
okay so I'll put my password in and save
okay so I have that file saved and it's
you'll see this SFTP config dot Jason
that'll just sit in your directory so
what I want to do now is create a new
file and I'm gonna just say test and
save I'm going to save it as index dot
HTML all right now if I go to test
project over here and I go to SFTP now
we have a whole bunch of new options all
right and we can easily just click on
upload folder and you can see all the
action down there and now if I go to my
FileZilla then we go to test project we
now have our index.html alright and we
can actually open that
say code skillet comm slash test project
and there we go now if we want to upload
it on save then we can go to let's go to
edit remote mapping and we have some
options here what I want to do is look
for upload on save and I'm gonna set
that to true all right now I think I
might have to restart sublime so I'm
gonna do that alright so right now our
live server just says test so let's
change it to testing and then save all
right so now if we go ahead and reload
now we have testing and that's how you
can use the SFTP plug-in alright so I'm
gonna be making more videos on sublime
text I think it's just a really great
text editor so if you like this video
please subscribe and I will see you in
the next one thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
