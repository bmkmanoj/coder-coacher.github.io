below hey guys in this video I'm going
to show you how to deploy an angular
application to firebase ok so you can
have firebase host your application and
you can do this with angular 4 or 5 it
doesn't matter we're gonna be using the
client panel application from my udemy
angular 4 front to back course alright
so right now I just have it running
locally I'm gonna go ahead and stop that
with ctrl C and let's clear this out now
I would suggest if you're on Windows
don't use git bash because you're gonna
run into issues with selection when you
have to use the arrow keys to select an
option
it wouldn't work for me so that's why
I'm using the standard Windows command
prompt you shouldn't have any issues
than any other operating system so what
we want to do is go to our firebase let
me just get out of this so you want to
go to your firebase console and you just
want to select the project so client
panel and we're gonna select hosting get
started and then it's gonna tell us to
install the firebase tools which is the
CLI that is used to initialize the app
and deploy the app so let's install that
globally with NPM install - G firebase -
tools ok and once that's done what we
want to do is do firebase login and
that's going to pull up our Google
accounts if you have more than one
you'll be able to select the account and
we'll be able to authenticate so let's
go ahead and do that we're gonna say yes
here alright so I'm going to choose the
account that I use to create the
database with and we're gonna say allow
so firebase CLI login successful
all right so next thing we want to do is
initialize the app with firebase in it
this will create a couple of JSON files
let's go ahead and clear this out
actually and then we'll say firebase in
it and yes and this is where get bash
wouldn't work for me so we're gonna
choose database because I am using the
real time database with this application
if you're not then you don't need to
choose that we also want to choose
hosting okay if you're using fire store
functions or storage you want to choose
those as well all right so let's see I
actually already have up there we go so
we want to select the default firebase
project and you might want to make sure
you select the correct one - the client
panel what files should be used for
database rules the default is fine now
here what we want to use for our public
directory when you use the CLI to
compile your angular project it's going
to put it into a folder called dist by
default okay you can change this in the
settings but by default it's going to be
dist and that's what we're using so
that's what I'm gonna put here d is t
configure as a single page application
yes and enter all right so firebase
initialize complete now what we want to
do before we deploy you want to make
sure you compile your application for
production so you can see I have a dist
folder already but I'm going to actually
delete that and recompile so let's clear
this out and we say ng build - - prod
okay that will recreate the dist folder
for us alright so now what we want to do
is firebase deploy
and hopefully this works
deploy complete all right
so gives us our URL so I believe we can
do firebase
open hosting : site and we get site not
found oh there we go
all right so we are now deployed let's
go ahead and try and log in now if I
look at my back-end in firebase and go
to authentication you can see I have a
user Brad at gmail.com let's go ahead
and do that and password and there we go
so we are now deployed to this domain
now you can add a custom domain if you
go to hosting and right here you can say
connect domain you can put in your
domain verify your ownership and then
that will be connected I'm not going to
go through that but that's it our
application has been deployed in just a
couple minutes all right just check
around here I guess we could try and add
a client make sure that that works so
it's a Harry Smith
and submit and new client added there is
Harry Smith okay we can edit him let's
change him to Harry Jackson submit
everything's working let's delete them
good client deleted client updated
settings
all right so everything's working we
have a deployed application so thanks
for watching guys hopefully this helped
if you're interested in building this
application I'll put the link to the
udemy course with a promo code in the
description and it doesn't matter if you
use angular 4 or 5 and that the whole
entire course will be updated to angular
5 very soon within the next couple weeks
or so alright so thanks for watching
guys and I will see you next time so I
just want to give another shout out to
