talk about set in map okay so the set
object lets us store unique values of
any type that can be primitive values or
they can be object references so what
I'm going to do here is we're going to
create an array okay we'll call this my
array and let's set it to just some
random numbers alright and then what
we'll do is we'll create a set from this
array actually instead of violets use
let so we'll say let my set and we'll
set it to new set and then pass in my
array now we can call different methods
on the set now so before we do that lets
just console.log it okay so that's what
it looks like now let's say we want to
add to the set will say my set dot add
and let's add 100 okay if we go and
reload you can see that we now added 100
and I added it as a string which is
actually good because you can see that
it can store different types of values
it doesn't have to be all numbers all
right which is really nice if we wanted
to let's say my set
I'll say my set dot ad and let's put in
an object okay we'll say a1 b2 take a
look and let's see look at it this way
and you can see that fifth one here is
an object with a 1 and B 2 we can also
delete stuff so if we say my set my set
dot delete and let's say we want to
delete the 20 to save that reload and
now you can see that the 22 is gone we
could also clear it all out so my set
dot clear save that reload and now it's
empty okay if we wanted to add something
again we could of course do that now if
we want to let's say see the size of the
set we could say console.log my set dot
size and that gives us a 1 okay if we
add something else here reload and now
we get to ok it's giving us the size
after the clear if I get rid of the
clear and we reload we get 6 now another
thing we could do is we can actually
loop through our set so let's say my set
and we can do a dot for each okay and in
here we're going to put a function and
let's put Val and then down here we'll
say console dot log Wow
reload and now you can see it's looping
through each element in the set and
spitting it out in the console now we
can also use what's called a map and let
me just Constance let me just comment
this stuff out okay now with a map a map
is their key value pairs as opposed to
sets which are individual values so
let's create a variable called my map
and we'll set it to new map and in here
we're going to have set up brackets and
then in those brackets we want another
set of brackets with a key value pair so
let's say a1 and actually we don't want
that we want a comma we'll set that to
hello okay put a comma here so put up
another set of brackets will say b2
comma goodbye alright so now we have a
map and if we go and say console dot log
and pass in my map
reload you can see we have our map here
okay we can add things to it
we don't have my map dot add but we have
dot set and what we can do is pass in
will say c3 and it'll just say foo
okay reload and now you can see that
that's been added to the map we can also
delete stuff we'll say my map dot delete
and we want to delete say a1
okay you want to delete by the key
reload now you can see that a one's gone
we can also use dot size to see how big
the map is which is two now in addition
to set in map we have week set in week
map and these have to do with objects
all right so let's go ahead and comment
that stuff out and then I'm going to
create a variable here let's call it
name week set and we'll say new week set
all right and then let's do let name one
actually you know what let's not do name
that doesn't really make sense
let's do car car week set and then we'll
say let car one and this will have a
make ok so we'll have a make of Honda
okay let me just why is this on huh
comment it out fix that okay so make
Honda and then we'll stay model will be
Civic all right and then we'll take that
car week set and we'll say actually
let's just console.log that
okay so week set now it says it's empty
because we just created the object here
we need to actually add it so we'll say
we set our car week set dot add and then
pass in car one all right so now that's
been added to the week set if we want to
take another one
you can copy that call this one car two
and we'll set it to Toyota Camry and
then we just want to add to reload and
now you can see that the Camry has been
added we can also do deletes so if I
want to say car week set dot delete and
we want to put in here
carve one reload and now you can see
that only the Toyotas left because we
deleted car one so saying on the same
way we do the week set we can do a week
map so down here we're going to say let
car week map equals new week map all
right and then let's do let ki one okay
these are going to be objects it's going
to have an ID of one and then let's copy
this car one up here okay we put that
here and then let's do car week map dot
set and in here we want to pass in the
key the key object and also the
reload okay we're not getting anything
because we didn't console.log and there
we go okay so we're doing the same thing
only with key value pairs if we wanted
to add another we could call this one to
Toyota Camry and then let's do copy that
and we'll set key to and car - okay
we'll reload car one is already been
defined have to change that to car - all
right and we can also do deletes car
week map dot delete and we can just pass
in the key say key one and there we go
all right so that's how we can use set
map week map and week set in the next
video I'm going to show you how we can
use set and map and we can use them
along with iterators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
