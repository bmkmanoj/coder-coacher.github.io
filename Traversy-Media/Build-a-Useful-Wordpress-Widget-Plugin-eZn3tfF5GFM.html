I'm gonna show you how to create a
wordpress widget plugin from scratch and
it's actually gonna be something that's
pretty useful it's gonna be a YouTube
subscribe widget that displays a
subscribe button as well as your avatar
and the number of subscribers and we're
also gonna have some options in the
backend to disable the sub count
obviously change that the channel name
change the layout things like that now
I'd suggest watching this even if you
don't know PHP because WordPress plugins
are basically just a boilerplate and you
have to just edit certain parts of them
to change up the functionality and make
it your own
alright so that's what we're gonna do in
this video let's go ahead and get into
it so if you guys really like my videos
and you learn a lot from them and maybe
you have a couple extra dollars to spare
check out my patreon page I'm working on
creating special content for patrons you
also get special deals on future courses
and there's even an email support tier
for all YouTube videos and projects to
learn more visit patreon.com slash
travis e media alright so this is the
front end of our WordPress website and
this is this has been untouched this is
the default installation this is what
you'll see if you go and install it
right now ok it's using this default
template which just has a big image and
then we have some content down here
alright now i'm using xampp which is it
gives me an apache server PHP and mysql
all on my localhost that's why you see
localhost WP site right here i do have a
video on showing you how to set up xampp
i think it's the second video in the PHP
front-to-back series if you want to set
that up and then installing WordPress is
really easy I may create a wordpress for
beginners video as well but what we're
going to do is we're going to create our
plugin our widget and we want it to
display over here so we're gonna have
the subscribe button with the number of
subscribers for our channel and the
image and we're gonna have it on the
sidebar here so if we go over to our
back-end okay so this is the the
WordPress dashboard we're going to be
able to go down to
plugins and we're gonna see our plug-in
here we'll be able to activate it and
then we'll be able to go to appearance
and then widgets and we'll see it over
here and we can bring it over to
wherever we want to put it in our case
it's gonna be the blog sidebar ok so
here you can see there's the search
widget recent post recent comments
that's what you're seeing right here on
the sidebar alright and then we'll be
able to have some options if we click it
it will have the the ability to change
the channel name to change what else if
we want the the subscriber count' to
show the layout things like that all
right so it's actually pretty useful so
let's jump into we're gonna jump into
Visual Studio code and you can see I
have over here the entire WordPress
website it's just called WP site so if
you install WordPress this is exactly
what you'll have all right so we want to
go into the WP content and then into
plugins this is where you want to build
all your plugins so we're gonna create a
new folder here called YouTube subs
that's gonna be the name of our widget
when I say widget and plug-in I mean
that that interchangeably a widget is
basically just a plug-in that you can
display on your site somewhere there are
plugins that do other things like SEO
and stuff like that but this is actually
a widget so let's create a new file in
here it's gonna have the same name as
the folder so it's gonna be YouTube sub
dot PHP okay and this is basically like
the entry point for our plugin now every
plug-in needs to have a header and I
actually have a couple links open let's
say you want to go right here so this is
this is part of the documentation for
building a wordpress plugin this is
where code X dot wordpress.org slash
file header and this right here is an
example of a file header it's basically
just a PHP tag and then a comment with
some stuff inside of it okay and it
looks at this stuff
the system looks at this stuff for your
plugins so what we'll do is just copy
that
and go back into our file here our main
YouTube subs PHP and we're going to
paste that in okay and then we just want
to change some stuff up like the plug-in
name we're gonna change to youtube subs
and then for the plug-in URI I'm just
gonna put my website and description
we'll say display YouTube
I guess YouTube sub and count
okay version I'm gonna do 1.0.0 author
I'm gonna put my own name and this is
completely open-source you guys can put
your own name if you want author you are
I'm gonna put the same thing and I'm
going to just get rid of the last two
text domain and domain path alright so
let's go ahead and save that and just by
doing that if we go back into our
WordPress back-end and we go to plugins
there it is YouTube subs okay display
YouTube sub button and count as the
version as the name and it has a link to
your site just by adding that one little
comment section now we need to do a
couple things in that file basically
we're gonna mostly require other files
in that file but we don't want it to be
accessed locally or directly I should
say so right now if I go to WP site
actually you know what let me go back to
that file and I'm just gonna do an echo
one tooth one two three all right and if
we go back to and what let me close this
stuff up
oh did I close the wrong window I did
damn it hold on guys so was a local host
WP site alright so if I go to WP site
slash and then we navigate to this
directory so it was WP dash content
slash I head comes up right here plugins
/youtube sub slash YouTube subs dot PHP
you'll see that it'll actually echo out
one two three and we do not want that we
don't want anybody to be able to access
this file directly so we need to put
something in here we're going to say
exit exit if accessed directly and to do
that we're just going to do a simple if
statement we're gonna say if not defined
ABS path
okay absolute path then exit okay and
then down here if I go when I say echo
one two three and we go ahead and save
and we go back and reload you'll see
that it's not going to show up it's not
going to basically it's not get allow us
past that point all right so you want to
make sure you have that and that's a big
security issue all right so the next
thing we want to do is we want to create
a file for our scripts because your
plugin may have javascript files
associated with it CSS files things like
that so inside YouTube subs let's create
let's create folder called includes
alright and this is typically how
WordPress plugins are built you don't
want to put all your files right inside
the main folder you basically just want
your main file and then everything else
you want to put in includes so except
for your your assets like CSS files and
things like that but we're gonna say new
file and then we're gonna do YouTube
subs - scripts dot PHP
all right and then in here what we want
to do is its first put in our PHP tag
and then we're going to say add scripts
and let's put a function here okay so
this function now all your functions
should have a prefix which should be
your your domain you can use anything
you want just make sure you're
consistent so I'm gonna use YT s for
youtube subs and then the function is
gonna be called add scripts all right so
YT s add scripts and we want to do two
things you want to add main CSS okay I
want to have a CSS file and then we want
a J s file so add main J s alright so
right here what we want to do is we want
to use a function called WP underscore n
Q so en qu eue underscore style okay and
then in here we want to paste in will do
YT as - main - style
now this NQ style this is part of the
WordPress API in fact if we go when we
search for it we'll get a page on it so
basically NQ a CSS stylesheet registers
the style if source provided so
basically it takes in a bunch of
parameters the first one we just put in
as the handle alright then we want the
strip D source okay so basically the
location of the of the stylesheet so
full URL of the stylesheet so let's go
ahead and add that okay this is the
handle we're using now we want to access
basically our plugins folder and there's
actually a function we can use as a
shortcut to get to that and that's
plugins
excuse me underscore URL alright so
that'll bring us to the plugins folder
and then we want to just concatenate
/youtube subs which is our plugins
folder actually
should have quotes alright so /youtube
subs and then we want to go into a CSS
folder which we haven't created yet but
we will and then we'll call it style dot
CSS I hate this keyboard alright style
dot CSS okay so it's just gonna load up
that file for us now for the JavaScript
we basically gonna do the same thing I'm
losing my voice so we're gonna paste
this in except this time we're going to
use NQ script okay this just signifies
that we're using JavaScript instead of
instead of a style instead of CSS so for
the handle will do YT s main script same
thing plugins URL except this time it's
gonna go to js' and it's gonna go to a
file called main dot j s alright so
that's the function to create our
scripts now right now it's just a
function sitting there we need to
actually hook it into WordPress so we
need to use something called a hook and
we use a function called add add action
for that the hook we want to use is WP
underscore and Q I always have an issue
spelling this enq you eue underscore
scripts okay and then the next parameter
is just gonna be the name of this
function so why TS underscore add
scripts alright and that should put it
right in there when WordPress hits this
hook it's gonna know to load this
function and add our scripts alright so
what we need to do now is include this
youtube's subscripts file into our main
file okay so we're gonna go down here
and what we're gonna do is we're going
to use a PHP function called require
once okay and all that basically does is
it's going to just include one file into
another so we want to access that
scripts file
we can actually use a shortcut function
to access our plug-in directory so
that's gonna be plug-in underscore dur
underscore path and then we just want to
pass in double underscore file double
underscore okay so that's going to
access our plug-in directory and then
from there we want to go into the
includes folder so we're just gonna
concatenate and we're gonna use a dot
and then some quotes we're gonna say
slash includes /youtube subs - scripts
dot PHP okay so that's going to include
that file all right actually let me put
a comment here we'll say load scripts
okay I'll save that now if we go to
actually first of all let's create our
CSS and JavaScript folders because what
that file that we just created did is
gonna try to load these files now we're
not even going to be writing any CSS or
JavaScript but this is really important
because in your plug-in that you write
you may need to so it's good to just do
anyways even if you don't plan on it
just just in case you know for the
future so in our YouTube subs core fold
or not the include so we're gonna create
a folder called CSS inside there we're
gonna create a file called style dot CSS
and then inside same thing inside
YouTube subs we'll create a folder
called j/s and inside there we're gonna
create a file called main jeaious
alright and now what we'll do is go to
WordPress we're gonna go to the back end
which I need to actually go to so it's
going to be WP dash admin and what I'm
gonna do is go to plugins and we have
our YouTube subs plugins let's go ahead
and activate it and then if we go back
to the front-end so visit site and we do
a control you and will search for
YouTube you'll see that the style sheet
is actually now being included
plugins YouTube subs CSS style CSS it's
also including the JavaScript file all
right so really cool and if we were to
just go to let's say main J asks to our
JavaScript file and say console dot log
and we'll say we'll just say YT s loaded
and we're not going to be writing any
other JavaScript I'm just doing this
just to show you but if we go back to
our front-end and let's go ahead and
open up the console with f12 and reload
you'll see we get YT s loaded ok so we
know that it's loading our scripts so
now we want to do is we want to create a
class ok our main widget class I'm going
to close all this stuff out and let's
see we're gonna go to our includes
folder once again and create a new file
called YouTube subs - class dot PHP now
I'm going to open up a documentation
page here which is really important
it's the wordpress widget class i don't
know the exact URL right here widgets
api and if we look at this right here we
have a class called my widget and it
extends something called WP widget and
then there's four different functions
there's a constructor which it which
takes care of naming the widget things
like that then we have the widget
function which takes care of the output
of the widget so the front end output
which is going to be right here alright
and then we also have the form function
which takes care of the form on the back
end so if we go to appearance widgets
well and we have will have a form like
this right here that's that takes care
of that and then we have let's say we
have the update function which takes
care of processing the data so when we
add something in the
in this back end form and we save that
update function is what takes care of
that okay so the four main functions now
what I'm gonna do is copy not this but
if we go down here there's an example
here I want to grab all of this okay so
it's kind of like a boilerplate for any
widget that you're gonna create and then
we're gonna go to vs code and we're
gonna paste that in here actually let's
put in a PHP tag first and then we're
going to paste that in alright so from
here we have quite a few things to
change and to add let's go ahead and
change it's not going to be few widgets
gonna be lets say adds youtube
underscore subs widget that's what we're
gonna call this we're gonna leave the
word widget we're gonna say youtube
underscore subs underscore widget and
it's gonna extend WP widget which gives
us a whole bunch of properties and
methods so for the constructor let's go
ahead and change the base ID so we're
gonna change that to youtube subs
underscore widget we're gonna give it a
title so say YouTube subs now the text
domain is kind of like an identifier you
want to make sure this is the same
throughout your entire class I'm gonna
change it to white ES domain okay we'll
change it here as well for the
description let's see we'll change this
this is the description will just say
widgets to display YouTube subs
all right so that's it for the
constructor now this right here this
widget function is this is responsible
for the output now you'll see we have
this this echo args before widget and
then down here we have this echo acts
after widget so this is this just
represents anything you want to put
before your widget so if you wanted to
put like a div tag with a special class
things like that
in fact I'll put a comment here we'll
just say whatever you want to display
before widgets so like an opening div
tag alright and then down here we'll say
whatever you want to display after the
widget like the closing div tag because
obviously if you have an opening div tag
you need a closing one so this right
here is just about the title it's going
to check to see if there's a title if
there is one it's going to display it it
also has this before title and after
title so if you wanted to put an h3 if
you wanted to put an h1 it gives you it
does this to make your widgets very
customizable and then this right here is
the actual output ok so this is the
widget content output now this escape
HTML what this is it's a special
WordPress function that's going to
display whatever you put in here but
it's going to escape any HTML so if we
put a paragraph tag in here it's not
gonna it's gonna escape it now we don't
want to use that because we do actually
want to display HTML in our widget so
what I'm going to do is just get rid of
that that escaped HTML and let's just
echo out a string for now we'll say
hello from YT s widget
all right now we're gonna change this
obviously but for now that's all what
we're gonna have now down to the forum
this is where we want to put all of our
inputs for like the channel name whether
we want to display the count or not and
I'm just gonna format this a little
better
so basically each field will be wrapped
in a paragraph so we'll have a label and
an input and what I'm going to do is put
each attribute on a separate line so
that's the four attribute let's see
actually that only has a four attribute
but let's go like that alright so we
have a label tag wrapped around this
right here let's change text domain any
instance of text domain should now be
white es domain in fact what I'm going
to do is go to edit replace and we're
gonna replace any text underscore domain
with white es domain it looks like
there's only two left so let's just go
ahead and change that alright so we have
a label for the title and then we have
our input so for the input they'll have
quite a few attributes so I'm gonna put
each one on a separate line the class
class of wide fat it's basically just
for the WordPress UI for styling so we
have the ID the name the type and the
value all right so we have our paragraph
with the label and the input and I'm
just gonna put a comment right here look
yeah we'll use and we'll just say title
all right so we're gonna add more fields
but for now we'll just leave title but
one thing I do want to do is for the
default title I don't want it to be new
title I want it to be YouTube subs
all right and then down for the last
function here update this just takes
care of updating whatever fields you
have we only have a title so this is
fine to leave for now and it's going to
be all your fields will be inside of an
array called instance okay so it's
basically going to check to see if it's
been changed if it has it'll change it
in the database so let's go ahead and
save this now one more thing we need to
do before we can actually display our
widget and see it in the backend and the
front-end is we need to register it so
we're going to go back to our main
YouTube subs PHP file and we need to
include that class file just like we did
with the scripts so I'm gonna copy that
and let's just say load class and we're
just gonna change this to youtube subs -
class dot PHP okay that way it includes
that file now to register it okay we're
gonna create a function and we're gonna
call this register underscore YouTube
subs and then we're just going to call a
function called register underscore
widget and then we want to pass in the
title of the class which is if we go up
here this right here YouTube subs widget
so we're gonna grab that and we're going
to put that right in here inside of
quotes now we've just defined the
function we now need to hook it in just
like we did with these scripts and we
use the add action we need to do that
here so let's say hook in function so we
want add action and WordPress has a
whole bunch of different hooks you can
you can you can hook into and that's all
in the documentation but what we want to
do is we want to hook into widgets it's
gonna be whoops that's not right widgets
underscore and knit okay and then we
just want to put in this function name
right here okay and that'll register it
and that'll hook it in so let's save it
now if we go to our backend
and we go to appearance make sure it's
make sure your plugin is enabled or
activated and then you should be able to
go to appearance widgets and there it is
YouTube subs see it right there
and what we can do is bring it over
let's put it right under the search and
we have a title okay that's the only
field we have right now but that's fine
let's go ahead and save it and now let's
go to our front-end and reload and
there's our widget YouTube subs that's
the title and we get hello from YT s
widget because that's what we put inside
the widget farm
yeah the widget function which handles
the output all right so it's as easy as
that to get your your widget up and
running now we just need to add special
functionality to it and we need to add
our fields all right so to add a YouTube
subscribe button I don't know the exact
URL let's say add YouTube subscribe
button right here configure a button
okay so this is just you know if you
want to display this in your HTML it's
as easy as just putting this this code
in and you can change these options here
like the channel name my channel name is
actually tech guy web okay and you'll
see that it actually change 159 thousand
subscribers if I change the layout to
full it'll actually display the name and
the image we can also choose to hide the
subscriber count' what we want is we
want these to be options in our
WordPress back-end ok and you can see
that these are implemented by attributes
so data channel we have data channel we
have data count which is either default
or hidden we have data layout which is
either full or default so we want to
display this HTML in our output but
before we do that we also need to
include this script right here so we're
actually going to add to our scripts
file so let's go to let's go to want to
go to our YouTube's subscripts and let's
see from here
inside the add scripts function let's
say add add Google script so for this
we're gonna do WP underscore register
script and we're gonna give it a handle
call it Google and then we need the
actual script the actual file so let's
go ahead and just grab this link right
here it's this platform j/s we'll copy
that and we're gonna paste that in right
here now just doing this isn't going to
do it we actually need to add another WP
and Q script like that and then we just
need to pass in the handle which is
Google okay and that should load this
this external script so it's save it and
then that should be all we need to do
there so now we want to go back into our
class and we want to take care of the
output and all that stuff so let's grab
let's see we'll leave full we'll leave
subscriber count' default all right and
then I'm gonna copy this div okay we're
gonna grab that div right there and then
go back to our class and remember the
widget function is what takes care of
the output so instead of echoing this
out hello or whatever we're gonna just
paste that in let me turn on word wrap
okay so we paste that and now if we save
this and we go to our front end and
reload there it is okay now as it is now
if you were to take this widget and
install it on your site you always have
traversing media there and you obviously
don't want that we want to have options
to change the channel to change the
options and all that so that's what
we're gonna do now so let's go back to
vs code and we're gonna start off with
the form okay we want the we want some
more for
values aside from just a title so notice
at the top here we have a title variable
it's getting set to whatever the
instances in the database so we're gonna
copy this right here paste in another
one actually it should be okay make sure
it's within the PHP wait a minute this
should be up here and then we just want
to know that's not what I want either so
the PHP ends right there alright that's
what we want so instead of title let's
change it to channel alright and then we
want to change each instance to channel
and let's see for the default this is
actually the default value I'm going to
put my channel name you can put your own
that's what's going to show up just you
know when they first install the plug-in
and then down here we need a form field
for the channel so let's just copy this
whole thing the whole paragraph alright
we'll change this and we're going to
change all the instances of channel to
tighten I'm sorry
title to channel
just like that and then this variable
here okay that variable is coming from
this right here alright so that'll
actually add the input if we save that
we go take a look at the back end and we
reload the widgets area you'll see now
we have a channel name now if I change
this and save it's not gonna it's not
saving the reason for that is because we
need to we need to update the update
function so let's go back to vs code go
down to update and we're gonna copy this
right here this instance title and we're
gonna paste that in and change this to
channel channel and channel alright so
let's save that and now let's go back
and we'll go ahead and change this let's
change it to another great channel which
is dev tips for designers I think that's
it save and now you can see it's still
there if I reload it's still there now
if I go to the front-end and reload it's
still traversing media because we
haven't implemented the actual you know
the value coming from the database so we
need to go back to our code go but up to
the widget function which is the output
and you can see it's hard-coded tech guy
web all right so we want to change that
let's see I'm going to change that by
just concatenating in here we'll put
some single quotes and then some periods
and then we can just say instance yeah
instance and we want the channel all
right so let's save that and let's go
back to the front-end and reload and
there we go now we have dev tips so as
as simple as that to add a field and
have it update and then have
output in the front end so now we're
gonna do the same thing for some other
options we want the option to let's
change this back I really like dev tips
but I don't want to give them too much
promotion there we go so let's add the
option to to change the layout okay
because we can change the layout here
you see we have default and then we have
whoops I'm not going to do doc we're not
going to implement the theme but we can
change it to its full and then we have
default which just gets rid of the icon
and all that alright so let's go back go
down to our form function and we're
gonna copy this okay and this is gonna
be for the layout so for the label we'll
just change this to layout layout now
this is actually going to be a select
okay it's not going to be a input so
let's change this to select alright
class-wide fat still applies ID same
thing we're going to just keep it at
this get field ID but we want to change
this to layout same thing with name we
don't need a type because it's a select
let's see we also don't need a value
excuse me yeah we're gonna get rid of
this so that's the opening select of
course it needs a closing select
all right and then we're gonna have some
options so let's put in option value so
value will be default and fall so this
will be default and then we would just
want to put in a PHP tag here we're
gonna say echo layout so layout equals
default
okay we're using a ternary operator here
we're basically saying if layout equals
default then we want to display selected
okay
else then we want to display nothing all
right and then we'll end our PHP here
and we'll end the option tag or the B
key this the beginning option tag all
right
and then let's see inside the text for
option will just say default all right
so this here is just saying if it's if
it's enabled if that's what what it is
if it's default and adds selected so
that it's pre selected in the in the
form and then what I'll do is copy this
and we're gonna paste that in here and
then we're gonna change the value from
default to full okay we're going to
change it they're also going to change
it here and then change the text to full
so let's save it and let's see if it
actually shows up in the form so we'll
go back to our back end and reload and
if we look now we have a select with
default and fall all right so it's not
going to save now if I change it to full
you see it's not going to save yet
because we have to do the update
function so we'll go down to update
we'll copy one of these paste it in
we'll change this to layout layout and
layout
okay so now that's gonna make it save
and then we want to implement it up in
our output
okay so right now we have where is it
right here so we have data layout equals
full its hard-coded what we want to do
is just get rid of that and concatenate
instance we want to do instance and then
layout okay
so let's save it and let's go back let's
check the front-end it should be yep so
it's default by default but if we go and
we change it to full and we save wait a
minute
say full and save okay so it's not
saving for some reason let me see what
what I do wrong here so if we go down to
update let's see instance layout new
instance layout so that should be saving
did I not save this file
hmm
something up here maybe let's try it
again
so fall save yeah it's not saving is
this stuff saving tech guy one tech iweb
one that saves hmm I'm not sure why this
is happening so we got a layout here oh
you know what we didn't add it up here
as a variable that's what it is
so let's go ahead whoops should be
within the PHP tag alright so we need to
add this layout layout and let's say for
the default here we'll just leave it at
default I guess yeah like that all right
so let's try it again
hopefully it works it should if we
reload and we go ahead and change it to
full and save there we go and now if we
go to our front-end and reload nothing
so it is saving here it's saving to
fault I must have something wrong hmm
let's go back up here to the output I
spelled instance wrong all right so now
it should should look it should look
should have a full layout now there we
go
all right we'll change it back to
default just to make sure and reload
there we go
good so the last thing we want is the
option to not show the subscriber count'
if we don't want to so let's do that
let's go back to our forum function here
and just so I don't forget let's do this
first
so this will be for count you guys can
see that even if you don't know PHP this
is kind of just a boilerplate that you
can edit to your liking and you don't
really have to understand every single
line of code let's see so count we're
gonna leave it at default because
there's two options there's default and
there's hidden okay now let's add the
form field which is also going to be a
select so I'm gonna copy everything we
did for layout paste that in this will
be count change all these to count
that so we do have a default option
that's fine this one however full is
going to be hidden ok we'll change that
to hidden and then finally let's go down
here to update and we'll just copy one
of these ok we'll change that to count
count and count all right and then for
the output so up at the top here where
we have data count equals default I'll
just grab this so it'll be instance
count all right let's save let's go to
our back end and reload and then we
should have a count option which is set
to default and if we look at the front
end you'll see it shows the count but if
we change it to hidden and save which it
didn't save did I do the same crap
instance counts see
why did that not save IAI sorry guys
alright got it
so in our field here the Kyle field I
have it set to lay out equals default
this should be count okay that should be
count and so should this it was looking
at the wrong variable all right so let's
try it okay so it's changed to hidden
now let's go to the front end and reload
and now the SUBSCRIBE count is hidden
all right so now we have a customizable
widget let's change the delay out to
full and save reload so now we have a
full layout but the SUBSCRIBE counts
hidden we change that to default from
hidden there we go so now we can see the
subscribers so that's it guys we have
created a widget and it's pretty useful
you guys can use this in your WordPress
websites if you want if I wasn't
changing my site from WordPress I would
use it but I'm gonna be changing the
whole my whole website I'm not happy
with it not happy with using WordPress
but yeah so that's how you can build a
plug-in or widget or both so thanks for
