to do is correct this issue if we click
on a link it takes us to this axis
forbidden now you can see it gets taken
the localhost / joomla which is the site
we're working on and then it's heaven
it's doing the HTTP localhost joomla
again so it has the rest of it right it
has this index PHP and all the other
parameters right so what I'm going to do
is in the helper file for some reason
this jui RI route is causing problems
for us and I'm not sure if this would
work on a remote on a regular domain and
not in local host but what we can do for
this is just delete that entire Ju RI
route and then the space here just close
that up or you could even let's just get
rid of it altogether so we got rid of
that Ju RI now I have a feeling it'll
work now so if we save this and then
what I'm going to do is packaged up
second
I'm going to package up our extension
again
if I can find it
yeah so this helper should be changed
alright so now I'm going to just add a
zip I'm going to create a zip file again
and then I'm going to replace the one on
my desktop and I'm going to re-upload it
I remember i showed you that upgrade
instead of install in the xml file and
that's why I did that so now we can just
write right over it
and upload that now if we go to our home
page and reload you click read more it
goes to the beginners article
professionals goes to the professionals
article so it's working well now we can
adjust some parameters if we want would
it go I think I put it in position seven
yeah featured articles so let's say
let's not show the intro text save it
and if we reload it's just a list of
titles we can show the intro text and
not the read more if we want so there's
no read more what else we could meet the
the article longer let's say 50 words so
now it shows 50 words for the intro text
so this is a really clean module it's
it's coded perfectly and a few if you
can do this then you can probably do
bigger and better things with with
custom modules I'll be making a custom
component video soon I'm not exactly
sure what the project will be probably
some kind of portfolio component so make
sure you subscribe and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
