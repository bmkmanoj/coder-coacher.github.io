getting a lot of requests after creating
my HTML crash course in CSS crash course
people are asking for a JavaScript crash
course but I think a lot of people don't
know that I already have one it's called
JavaScript fundamentals for beginners
it's not actually called JavaScript
crash course but that's what it is we
look at things like creating variables
creating arrays and functions and loops
just the basic language fundamentals
alright so if that's what you're looking
for then that's the video to watch and
it's actually in the vanilla JavaScript
playlist on my channel alright now what
I want to do in this video is go a
little deeper than just show you how to
create variables and and talk about
datatypes and stuff and show you how to
actually work with the Dom okay so
select items how to change styles how to
replace content things that you would do
with jQuery but I want to show you how
to do it with vanilla JavaScript because
using jQuery just for Dom manipulation
and just like you know changing a style
adding of and event things like that is
kind of like using a sledgehammer to
kill a mosquito it's just not needed
anymore
we have query selector which is just as
good as using you know jQuery selectors
so that's what we're gonna do we're also
going to just take a look at the Dom in
general we're gonna look at all the some
of the different properties of the
document object and we're gonna do a
little exploring and this is the page
we're gonna use to do it with this is
just a simple HTML page that I created
that includes bootstrap has some
bootstrap classes just to make it look
good but it's basically just a header
and then we have you know a card with a
form and then a list group okay and we
have certain classes and IDs and stuff
so that we can select certain elements
all right now in the description you'll
find a link and it will it will include
this that the bare HTML file without any
JavaScript and then as we move along you
can
you can code along with me and add the
JavaScript I'll also have the final
versions of the code as well alright so
let's go ahead and get started so if you
guys really enjoy my content you feel
like you really get something out of it

tree of nodes or elements created by the
browser JavaScript can be used to
manipulate the DOM and its elements the
Dom is object oriented meaning that each
node has its own properties and methods
that we can go and we can change and we
can add we can remove things so we can
manipulate that basically everything on
the page using javascript ok jquery was
used to do this for a long time but it's
becoming more and more popular to use
just vanilla JavaScript for this and
that's what we'll be doing so you may
have seen diagrams like this around the
web now the browser gives us a window
object which represents the browser
itself it's the top-level object and
then we have a root element inside the
document okay so well in the window we
have the document object basically the
the core of the DOM and then we have a
root element which is the HTML tag or
the HTML element our node whatever you
want to call it and then inside that we
have children like head and body tags ok
our head and body elements nodes and
then those have their own children so we
have a title for inside the head we have
titles we have things like meta tags in
the body we have things like H ones and
a tags and all kinds of stuff and then
those tags those elements they have text
nodes so for instance we may have an h1
with the text of my header
that's also considered an ode we also
have attributes okay can connected to
elements for instance we have an 8 and
href attribute on an a tag or an a
element so this is this is the Dom okay
all this stuff together looked at kind
of as a tree like this is the Dom okay
and we can manipulate this stuff with
JavaScript and that's what we're gonna
do all right so let's go ahead and do it
alright guys so on the left here I have
Visual Studio code open I'm using live
server if you want to use that you can
just click on extensions and search for
it and install it and that'll make it so
this auto loads every time you save if I
go ahead and I say item list or one and
I save you'll see that it'll auto load
alright so if you're not using an
extension like this or Adam live server
or something like that then you just
have to reload alright but let's go over
this real quick so it's just an
index.html file this is going to be
included in the description ok and a
link in the description and we just have
a link to bootstrap to the CDN to
version 4 but this doesn't really matter
I just wanted to use it to kind of give
it a nice style then down here we just
have a header inside the header we have
a container with an h1 with an ID or you
have some bootstrap classes then we have
under the head or a container we have a
div with the idea of main class of card
which gives it this border around it and
then we have an h2 a form with one field
and a submit button and then we have an
h2 and then a ul with the idea of items
in the class of list group ok and each
list item has a class of list group item
so that's the Dom that that's the that
the HTML structure that we're going to
be working with we will be adding and
removing a couple things but this is
going to be the basic page that we work
with all right now down here we have a
script point are pointing to a script
called Dom j/s which is right here and
is completely empty and that's what
we're gonna be working with all right
now guys I'm gonna be moving a little
fast here because this is a crash course
but I'm gonna go over the the most
important things as well as I can
okay so what you want to do is you want
to have your console open so you want to
either hit f12 or go to your your tools
and go to your developer tools that the
console is also available on other
browsers Firefox Safari whatever you're
using because we're going to use this
for our output for awhile all right and
then once we get into actually changing
things in the Dom we'll be able to
change text and styles and all that okay
so the first thing I want to do is just
kind of examine the document object okay
so remember in that diagram I showed you
the document is at the top and then
under that we basically have a tree of
elements so we can actually type in the
console here JavaScript if I were to say
alert one it'll actually execute that
JavaScript in fact everything that we do
in our file here we could do in the
console but I want you guys to have this
as a reference all right that's why I'm
doing it all in the file here so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna say
console dot der and we're gonna pass in
the document object okay so what this is
gonna do is it's going to show us all of
the different properties and methods
attached to the document object alright
so you can see we have like the URL we
can access we have document dot all
which will give us an array not an array
but an HTML collection of everything
that's inside of that page that's inside
of that document
there's the document dot body which we
can access and all the properties of
that so this is a very large tree of
properties and methods I'm not going to
go through all of this stuff but I do
want to show you some of the the useful
stuff so let's go over here and just
we'll just comment this out and let's
look at some of the stuff that we can
access through the document alright so
let me put a comment up here and we're
just gonna say examine I will say
examine the document objects all right
and you guys can use this stuff from
within your scripts when you create a
JavaScript program you can you can
access the stuff you can edit it it's
not read-only if you want to change
anything in the document you can do that
so let's take a look at let me see first
of all we'll look at the domain so we
can say console dot log we can say
document we can use our dot syntax and
we can access any of these properties so
you'll see that there is a where is it
domain right here which is going to give
you whatever domain name you're running
so we say document dot domain and Save
you'll see that we get one two seven
zero zero one which is just basically my
localhost that's the loopback address
all right we can also access the URL so
we'll say document dot URL and save and
it gives us basically the entire page
and the entire URL alright another thing
you know what I'm just gonna copy this
because we're gonna be doing this quite
a bit this console.log document another
thing we could look at is the title of
the page so we'll say document dot title
and we get item lister okay and you'll
see the title is item lister if I were
to go and change the title over here -
let's say item list or - and save now
you'll see that that has changed as well
and this stuff is not just read-only we
can change it we could say document dot
title and we can actually set that equal
to we'll say one two three and now you
can see the title has actually changed
so you can change this stuff from your
from your scripts alright so another
thing we can look at is let's say let's
look at the doctype so if we say dot
doctype and Save you'll see that we're
using excuse me we're using the html5
doctype alright so we can also look at
the let's see the head and body
so if we say document dot head
that'll that'll grab the head element
and we're out putting it to the console
and you can see everything that's in the
head and as you could probably guess we
can also do document dot body which will
grab the body for us and help put it all
right so another thing we can do is
document dot all so if we do this what
it gives us is an array or an HTML
collection of everything that is in the
Dom so if we go over and we look let's
look at our index.html file you'll see
if we go if we start right here at 0 we
have our HTML tag which is up at the top
okay and then the next one and the one
index is going to be the head then we
have the meta we have another matter
okay and if we open this we can see all
the different properties of each of
these elements okay so we can get pretty
much anything we want on that element
and if you go down you'll see the link
okay title then we have the body then we
have the first element in the body is
the header you can see it also has the
ID in the classes then we have the
container then we have the title so we
can access any of these okay and we can
specifically access them by their index
so for instance the header title you'll
see as I hover over it it'll it'll it'll
highlight it in the browser let's say we
wanted to grab this and it has an index
of 10 so what we could do is we could
say console.log document dot all and we
could grab the index of 10 and save and
it'll actually give us that h1 all right
now again we can change things based on
our selector now this isn't this isn't
the way that you want to select things
I'm going to show you the specific
methods for selecting things but you
could say document dot all and then grab
that's in the index of 10 and say dot
text content equals hello and save and
you'll see that it actually changed that
in the page but this this is not the way
that you want to slow
things alright for one thing if you add
something this 10 is going to change if
I go and I go before that and let's say
we add out of span and we'll just put
like a 1 in here or something and save
now that span is now the the 10 index
and that's what's hello so you don't
want to use that method of selecting
from the Dom alright just to let you
know that and anything you add into your
file here whether it's in the head or
body it's going to get added to document
all it's gonna get added to that
collection alright so let's see what are
some other things we can look at now
let's say you wanted to get all the
forms on the page you could say let's do
console log document dot forms and save
and we're looking right here if we click
this arrow it's basically going to be a
collection of all the forms we only have
one so we have in the zero index ok
these always start at zero just like a
regular array and then we have our form
and you can get all the different
properties of the form all right now you
can do the same thing with like links so
if you wanted to get all the links on
your page you could say document dot
links we don't have any so we just have
an empty array I say array but it's
actually an HTML collection and there is
a difference you there are some there
are things like like let's say you
wanted to use dot reverse which is an
array method in JavaScript you couldn't
do that you'd have to first change it
into an array okay but you can select
items like it's an array now if you
wanted to select a certain item like in
our form we have our zero index we could
say forms 0 like that and it'll give us
that actual form alright so hopefully
that that makes sense I'm gonna just
comment all this stuff out so that this
doesn't get too confusing
so what else then it's in addition to
links we could do images so we can say
document dot images and you can get
those we don't have any
so we're gonna get an empty collection
what else I think that's it I mean
that's not it definitely there's more to
it you saw when we did consoled ER doc
ument there's a lot of different
properties but I'm not going to go
through them all cuz we'll be here all
day but those are some of the the
interesting ones so what about selectors
okay so basically we have a few
different selecting methods we can use
to query the Dom so the first one we're
gonna look at is get element by ID which
I'm sure you've heard of so what we're
gonna do here is let's console dot log
and let's take a look at our Dom or our
structure here and we have an h1 with
the ID of header title so what we'll do
is we'll say document dot get element by
D and we know that it has an ID of
header title was it header title or no
header - title okay so if we save that
you'll see that it'll actually pull it
from the Dom and we're just logging it
we can also put it inside of a variable
so if I copy this and we say I'm just
gonna use es5 syntax so we'll say var
and we'll call this header title equals
and then we'll paste that in and save
and actually let's let's log it
so head our title save and you'll see we
get the same thing now we can do certain
things with this header so we can change
the text so there's certain methods we
can use such as text content and we'll
just set that to hello
save and that'll change it okay in
addition to text content we also have
inner text which for the most part does
the same thing let's set this to goodbye
and save and you'll see a change because
we basically just overrode it we over
wrote this with this now the difference
are one of the differences between inner
text and text content is one of them
pays attention to the styling so let me
give you let me show you what I mean so
if we go into our h1 here and we put in
a span and we'll just say I don't know
one two three and we'll save actually it
this is gonna overwrite that so let's
just comment those out but we get item
list or one two three okay so let's go
ahead and console.log header title dot
text content all right so we get item
lister one two three now if I go to this
span and I add a style to it of
display:none okay in the dot and in the
page here it's gonna disappear it's
gonna go away now text content is still
showing the one two three it's it's it's
disregarding that span even though it's
set to display:none it still shows it
here but if we were to change this to
inner text and save you'll see that the
one two three is not there okay so it
actually pays attention to the styling
so that's one of the biggest differences
between the two but you can use them for
the most part pretty interchangeably
all right so that's that's what text
content intertext we also have inner
HTML which I'm sure you guys have seen
before if you've worked with JavaScript
at all so let's say header title and
we'll say dot inner HTML equals and
let's put an h3 and we'll say hello save
and now I have an h3 now if we look at
if we look at it through the inspector
you'll notice that the h3 is actually
inside the h1 now it doesn't change the
h1 to and h3 it puts the HTML inside of
that that Dom element okay so that's
what inner HTML does now if you wanted
to actually change it the h1 to + H so
you'd have to use some other methods to
access the parent element and it's a
little more advanced and we'll get to
that in a little bit alright but just
keep in mind these these three methods
so text content inner text and inner
HTML now we can also do style changes
let's go ahead and save this alright so
we just want to just going to comment
this out too so basically we just have
the header title so if we wanted to
change a style like let's say header
title and in all of these this text
content enter text the stuff that I'm
doing right now you can use with any
selector not just document dot get
element by ID in fact maybe I should
have done all the selectors first and
then showed you this stuff but you can
use this with any with any selector ok
selecting elements and then using these
methods are two different things so
let's say header title and we'll say dot
style that's how you can change CSS
Styles let's say we want to change the
border bottom all right now notice that
I used camel case here because you can't
do border dash bottom even though this
is the the actual CSS property you can't
do that so you have to just change it to
camel case
all right so let's say we want it to be
solid three pixels and black and save
and now you can see that the h1 has the
border actually I wanted I want to put
that border on the header so what I
would do if I wanted to use get element
by ID
we know that the header actually has an
ID of main header so let's grab that
instead or its main - header and then
we'll just change this to header and
save and now we have the border on the
actual header alright so now you should
understand get element by ID text
content enter text enter HTML and then
changing the styles with style dot
whatever the CSS property all right so
all stuff that used to be used with
jQuery but should be used with vanilla
JavaScript now you can see how easy it
is so next thing we're gonna do is look
at another selector I'm gonna comment
these out too so we're gonna look at
getting elements by class name okay so
let's say get elements by class name now
notice that it's elements plural so this
works a little different it's not like a
get element by class which doesn't
actually exist for that you would use
query selector but I'll get into that in
a minute
so get elements by class name let's say
we want to get all these list items okay
so we know that these list items have a
class of Lists group item so let's say
we'll put it in a variable say var items
equals and then we're gonna say document
dot get what am i doing get elements by
class name and they have the class of
list group item
okay so if we go ahead and we console
dot log console dot log items what do we
get here so what it gives us is an HTML
collection okay just like document dot
all gives us and each one has an index
okay and you can see if I highly if I
hover over one it'll highlight in the in
the browser so we can access individual
elements by saying like items let's say
we want the second one we would use one
because there's zero based so we'll save
and you'll see it'll give us the item
two okay that's in the one position so
if I wanted to let's say change the text
of that particular item I could say
items dot are not items dot but items
one dot text content equals and we'll
say hello to and save and now you'll see
that it actually says hello to if I
wanted to change the style let's say
items one dot style dot let's do font
weight can't do that we got to use camel
case so font weight and we'll set that
equal to bold and save and now you can
see that we've we bolded that that
second one here all right if we wanted
to do a background color for it let's
say items one and we'll say style dot
background color and we'll set it to
what's a yellow
and there we go okay so you can see we
can we can do a lot of the same stuff
that we did we could do in jQuery now
where it gets tricky is if we want to
add a style to all of these so let's say
we want to give them all a light gray
background so if we just say items items
dot style dot background color and set
it to let's say light gray and save
that's not going to work all right
now this isn't gonna work because it's
an it's an HTML collection or it's an
array we have to actually loop through
it to be able to do this so what we can
do is we can iterate through it with a
for loop so we're gonna say for we'll
create a variable called I equals 0 and
we're gonna say as long as I is less
than items dot length okay dot length is
a property it gets the the number of
items in that array or collection and
then we just need to increment by one
each time and then in here what we'll do
is we'll say items and we want to get
the current iteration and then from
there we can say dot style dot
background color equals our gray color
and save all we need to actually comment
this out because this is giving an error
actually to put a comment right here
we'll just say gives error and save and
now you'll see that each one has a gray
background now all right so that is get
elements by class name now we're going
to take a look at get elements by tag
name now this works basically the same
way except instead of getting it by
class you're getting it by tag so what
I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna copy
this whole thing I'm gonna copy it and
then I'm gonna comment it out
okay well paste it here now let's change
the variable to Li and what I want to do
is say get elements by tag name and then
just pass in here Li so it's gonna grab
all the allies on the page and then
let's console.log Li we can get each Li
by its by its index so let's change this
to Li so this should basically do the
same exact thing we're just not using
the class we're using the Li and then
down here we can loop through it works
the same way so Li dot length save let's
save it and it does the same thing
alright now if I were to add another
list item here so let's add a list item
and we'll just say item five and save
now even though I don't have a class of
list group item it still applies because
it's an Li it's going by the tag not by
the class if I were to just do it by the
class like I did up here then then that
would have this would have no effect
alright let me just show you what I mean
so if I comment that out and we
uncomment this and save you'll see that
now that this stuff nothing's being
applied this this grey background and
all that is not applying to this because
it doesn't have that class alright so
hopefully that makes sense
alright so let's get ELINT by tags name
I'm not gonna spend too much time on it
because it's identical to the class name
now what I want to do is look at query
selector all right so this is an
important one
so query selector
so for this this works pretty much just
like jQuery okay the only big difference
is it's it only what you're all you'll
use it only for one item okay if you
want to use more than one item then
you're gonna use query selector all
which I'm gonna go over in a second as
well alright so and an only effect it
only grabs the first one so if we try to
grab let's say the class of title and
there's more than one title on the page
it's gonna grab the first one so let's
go ahead and save this and let's get rid
of that extra li we added alright so
we'll save that and we're gonna say
let's save our header and we're gonna
say document dot query selector and we
can use anything we want in here so we
can use tags you could grab a list item
you could grab a class okay so you could
say dot header you can use any CSS
selector just like you could with jQuery
okay so just replace the jQuery money
sign like that with documents a document
dot query selector so if we want to grab
the header for instance it has an ID of
main header so make sure you use that
hash right there alright and then we
could say header dot style dot border
bottom will set it to solid four pixels
and gray save and now you can see it has
that that border alright so another
thing we could select is let's grab the
input we haven't done anything with that
input form so let's save our input and
let's set this to document dot query
selector and we want to grab the input
and we'll say input dot value equals
hello world and save and you can see now
we've actually added a value to that
input now even though there's two inputs
on the page because this this button
this is actually an input as well it
only grabbed the first one okay so it's
gonna grab the first one by default now
with query selector we can use any CSS
selector so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna say var submit and let's set this
to document dot query selector and
instead of just input let's use the
input and then brackets and we can say
the type equals submit okay just like we
could do in CSS this should actually be
in quotes though alright so if we do
that and then we say submit dot value
and let's see well so we'll change it to
send and save and now you can see we've
actually changed the button to send
alright so what about these list items
what if we were to save our item and
send it set it to document dot a query
selector and we put in here a class of
list
what is it list group item all right and
then let's say item dot color not color
item dot style dot color equals red what
happens it's gonna get the first one on
the page all right now let's say we
wanted to get the last one we could use
the the seat the CSS last child
okay so we'll save our and let's say
last item I shall just copy this
so we'll say last item and we'll select
list group item :
blast child and then let's say last item
dot style dot color equals blue and save
and you'll see that now the last one is
blue all right we could also use our nth
child so let's say we want to grab the
second one so we'll say second item and
we'll change this to let's say n child -
and then we'll change this to second
item and we'll change it to let's say I
don't know Coral and save wait a minute
and look got the the - there we go so
now the second one is coral okay so we
can use these CSS pseudo classes or
pseudo selectors whatever they're called
alright so what about query selector all
let's take a look at that
so query selector all works similar to
like get elements by tag name get
elements by class name it's going to
grab more than one thing so what I'm
gonna do here is create a variable let's
see I think we have two title classes
yeah we have h2 class title and h2 class
title here so let's grab both of those
so we'll say titles equals document dot
query selector all and we want to get
and we can put anything in here classes
IDs just tags anything so we're gonna
say class title all right and then let's
go ahead and console dot log titles all
right and I'm just gonna comment all
this stuff out okay so that gives us
what's called a node list which is
similar to a collection except we can
actually run array functions on a node
list so zero is going to be the first
title which is that add items and then
one is the items and of course we can
access these like this we could say
titles 0 dot text content equals hello
and we'll save and we'll change it that
way all right now another thing that
used to be really hard to do with
vanilla JavaScript would be to let's say
alternate let's say we want each other
one to be gray to have a grey background
but we can do that with query selector
also what we'll do is we'll create a
variable called odd alright and we'll
set it to document dot query selector
all and we're going to use the we're
gonna say Li and let's use nth child and
we'll pass in here odd okay now that
this is a CSS selector this is a pseudo
selector so we're grabbing all the odd
ones and then what we'll do is we'll
loop
who will use a for loop and we'll say
for VAR I equals 0 as long as I is less
than odd dot length and let's see we
just want to increment by 1 and then
down here what we'll do is we'll say odd
we'll take the current iteration and
we'll say dot style dot background-color
and we'll set that to light gray and
save and now every other one it's like
gray all right if we wanted to do even
we could go ahead and set this to even
and then for the selector we'll just do
and child even and we'll go ahead and
copy that let's say even and we'll
change the color let's say to a darker
gray and there we go all right so we can
do things like that in vanilla
JavaScript pretty damn easily alright
guys so I'm realizing that I still have
quite a bit that I want to cover we went
over all the selectors so I think that
this is going to be a good place to stop
for this video and we're gonna have to
turn this into a little series maybe one
or two more videos because I want to get
into traversing the Dom I want to show
you how we can move like up how we can
get parent nodes and child nodes how we
can use events okay I want to show you
how we can use mouse and keyboard events
things like that how we can change the
Dom with those events so there's quite a
bit more than I want to do so I'm gonna
stop the video here and I will see you
in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
