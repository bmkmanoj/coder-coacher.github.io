we're going to be diving into Keystone J
s so I've been getting a lot of requests
for this and they try to fulfill as many
requests as I can
plus it's something that I've been
wanting to get into so Keystone is a
content management system and web
application platform built on nodejs and
it uses Express and MongoDB
so it uses a yeoman generator that we
can use for rapid development and
prototyping and it can give us things
like a blog a photo gallery contact form
you don't have to set these things up
but I'm going to just to show you what's
available now if I was to just show you
how to generate an application you
wouldn't learn too much from that so
what we're going to do is we're going to
add a completely new section to the
application we're going to add a store
or a product section I'm not going to
add purchase and check-out functionality
because that's just too much at this
point I honestly don't know enough about
Keystone to do that but what we'll do is
we'll add a product section to the admin
side so that we can manage products
we'll be able to add images a
description quantities things like that
we'll be able to display them on the
front end on the list page and we'll be
able to also create a details page with
a link to the contact form and then
we'll add a product enquiry option on
the contact form alright so hopefully
you enjoy this I think Keystone is one
of the best node.js platforms out right
now
it's very expandable and easy to work
with so let's go ahead and get started
so the very first thing you want to do
before we start is get nodejs installed
on your system and get MongoDB installed
locally ok so I have videos showing you
how to do that if you don't know how to
do that but you definitely want those
two things up and running or this won't
work okay so I'm at Keystone J Escom and
I'm going to just click on get started
and that's going to basically just give
us the initial commands we need to
install the generator and then create a
project now it's not here but you won't
you want to install the yo generator
or the Yeomen scaffolding tool so to do
that I'm on Linux so I'm going to use
sudo and then we're going to say NPM
install - gee yo and that's going to
install the yeoman scaffolding tool
alright so now that that's all set we
can now install the Keystone generator
so we're going to say npm install
actually I need to do sudo npm install -
G and then generator
- Keystone okay that all installed
generator globally
okay so once that's done we're going to
create a project folder so I'm going to
say make directory and we're going to
call this project acne and then we'll CD
in to acne and then we want to generate
our application with yo Keystone okay
and this can take a little bit well
actually we have to answer some
questions first so the name of our
project will say Acme now it asks us
which template ng we want to use you can
use Jade nunchucks twig or handlebars so
I'm going to choose handlebars which is
HBS and I'm using handlebars because
that's what I'm the most familiar with I
do know Jade but I really don't like it
I'd rather use standard HTML than then
Jade syntax now the preprocessor by
default uses less but I prefer fast so
I'm going to say fast
now would you like to include a blog
we'll say yes image gallery yes contact
form yes and then it asked us what we
want to call the user model so I'm just
going to use leave the default of user
and click enter and then you need to add
an email address this will actually be
your admin username so I'm going to say
travesti media at gmail.com and then
your password and then a specific we
want to include gulp or grunt which are
task runners I'm going to choose to use
gulp
and then would you like to create a new
directory for your project I'm going to
say no because I want it created in the
Acme folder and also would you like to
include email configuration I'm going to
say no now with images you have the
option to use cloud inari if you want to
do that you can put in your URL I'm just
going to click enter and then would you
like to include extra comments in your
code I'm going to say yes because that
could help us out
all right now this takes a little bit
takes a little three or four minutes or
so so I'm going to go ahead and pause
and I'll be back when it's done all
right so that only took about two
minutes or so now it tells us to run
node Keystone to start our project so
let's do that and our project has
started on port 3000 so let's go to
localhost 3000 and this is what the
front end looks like okay so you can see
it uses Twitter bootstrap by default and
basically have a navbar and then we have
this Jumbotron with some information
tells us a username password obviously
you want to get rid of this before you
go live and then we have our blog link
so we don't have any posts but we have a
blog with with category functionality we
have an image gallery
there's no images but we have one and
then we have a contact form where
enquiries will go and they'll be listed
in the admin area for us to see and I
believe it'll send an email if you
configure your email all right so let's
click on sign in and this is the back
end login so I'm going to go ahead and
log in alright so this is the back end
it's pretty simple we just have
different sections here we have our
posts or post categories galleries our
enquiries from our contact form and our
users and we have the same menu up here
as well so before we create our product
section let's just test some of this
functionality out so let's actually add
a post category so post category will
say node GAF's
and create and let's create another one
well
they react create okay so now we'll go
to post and say create post and let's
call this we'll just say my first blog
post and create so it takes us to a
screen like this which is pretty nice we
have different states for our posts so
the default is draft we can choose
published or archived we can choose the
author which I'm going to select the
only one which is the admin user we can
choose to upload an image so I'm going
to click that and I have this nodes s
image here I'm going to upload and
content brief I'm just going to grab
some sample content from larom it's um
so I'll just generate a couple
paragraphs and let's just grab this okay
we'll just go and paste that in here and
paste it in here this is the brief
version so I'm going to take some of it
out and then this is the extended now
categories will choose nodejs
and click Save and that's it we created
a blog post so let's actually set it to
published and then save okay so now
could go back to post you'll see we have
my first blog post and if we go to the
front-end just go to localhost 3000 and
we go to blog you'll see we have our
first post okay so this is the list page
and then we have the the actual post
okay so pretty cool I don't believe
there's no comment functionality by
default you'd have to do that yourself
okay but we can filter by category over
here which is pretty nice so it's nice
not up you know a full featured blog but
it has it's pretty nice for you know not
even typing any code at all it's just
given to us alright then we have the
gallery so if we go to galleries and
create let's say we'll just call it tech
and then we can choose the date we can
choose the image I'll just grab that
note image oh that's the hero image I
guess that's like the cover and then we
can select other images can I simply
click save that creates the gallery so
let's go to the front end and now we
have our gallery not much functionality
here there's no lightbox or anything
you'd have to program that yourself okay
so it's just it's just kind of a base
base functionality that we'd have to
work off of and then contact so if we
were to fill this out say John Doe
test last time I did this when I sent
the server okay so that worked I think
it last time it messed up because I
think I chose to have email
configuration when I don't I didn't have
it actually configured so it messed
things up but that works fine so if we
go to enquiries you'll see John Doe okay
so that gives us his message and
information so that's the default
functionality all the users so we can
add users here if we want you can choose
if they can access the backend or not as
well so now what I want to do is jump
into the code and we're going to add a
product section to our website alright
guys so I have Adam open that's what I'm
using for a text editor you guys can
obviously use whatever you'd like and
I'm going to add the project folder so I
want the Acme folder and this is what
the structure looks like okay so we have
our package JSON file with all the
dependencies now you don't see Express
here in our Mongo driver because that's
handled with Keystone all right but then
we have lo - we have our handlebars
template engine cloud nary moment for
dealing with times and dates node SAS
and then down here we have the dev
dependencies which we're using gulp for
our task runner and es went okay so
Keystone Jas is the main configuration
file for Keystone has our
with directories things like that we're
not going to have to touch anything in
here and then we have up here our models
folder this is where you want to create
all the models so you can see we have
examples from the post and from look
from the gallery
we're going to create a product model
okay and then down here we have our
routes so our index J s is where we can
set the actual route right here app get
and then point to a view and then in the
routes folder we have a views folder
where we have each route this is
basically like the controller okay if
you're familiar with MVC
this is where we can actually call our
queries so call the model to create our
query as you can see here we're getting
the gallery model and we're calling find
and then we're sorting it and then we're
going to render a view in this case it's
rendering the gallery view which if we
go down here into templates and then
views you'll see gallery dot HBS this is
the handlebars page okay and basically
we did our query and we can now access
that data in here with this galleries so
basically we're saying each galleries
we're looping through each one and then
displaying the name the hero image and
then we're looping through the images
okay so pretty simple that's really the
main three parts is the model and then
the routes and the route views or the
view controller I guess it's what it is
kind of and then our templates okay and
then we also have this helpers folder
where we have different helpers and
we're actually going to add a post URL
helper as well I'm sorry a product URL
helper so what's going it started first
thing we'll do is create our model so
we're going to say new file and we're
going to say product product dot J s
okay we want to keep our model singular
and what we want to do is bring in
Keystone so we'll save our Keystone and
require it
okay sorry for the banging upstairs as
you guys can hear that I asked them to
be quiet but no one listens to me in
this house so let's say Keystone dot
field dot types okay so basically we
have a whole bunch of types we can use
in our for our fields and there's a
really good documentation page to go
here and then get started okay so this
basically tells us how to create our
project from scratch if we wanted to it
tells us how to create a model this is
what we're doing right now okay see we
bring in types and then what we want to
do is call new Keystone list and then
the name of our model okay so we're
going to save our product and we're
going to set that equal to me new
Keystone dot list and then what new
Keystone list and product okay so does
exactly what it did they do here and
then we're going to also pass in some
options here so it's going to take a
second parameter and we're going to open
up some curly braces and we want to add
map so I'm going to say map name is
going to be title so title is basically
the main field and then we can also
include options for singular okay so
singular version of our model should be
product and then plural should be
products okay and then we want to set in
Auto key okay
so AutoKey if we search for that I guess
this isn't the page I was looking for um
see say doc database Auto key okay so
Auto key adds a plug-in to the list that
automatically generates a key for each
document when it's saved okay it's based
on the value of another field of path so
Auto key paths are automatically indexed
basically what we want is we want to
create a slug and we want to use that
we're going to use that in our URLs so
for instance if we want to see the iPad
products we want it to go to product /
iPad and use that as a slug so we're
going to save past slug and let's say we
want that from the title okay we want
the slug based on the title and we also
want it to be unique so we're going to
say unique true I could this shouldn't
be two of the same slugs okay so that
pretty much creates our list our product
model and now we want to do is add the
fields we want to use so we can say
product dot add and in here we're going
to put our field so obviously we want
title and it's going to have a type of
string type string and let's say
required true okay we want it to be
required next thing we'll have is a
price and we're going to set price to
have the type of number we also want a
quantity so let's set quantity that will
also be a number and description
now for description I actually want to
use 8 and HTML field and I want to have
an editor the WYSIWYG editor so we're
going to say type is going to be from
types which we imported above and watch
the HTML type alright and I'm going to
say WYSIWYG or what you see is what you
get and I'm going to set that to true
and we can also set the height of the
editor let's set that to 300 alright so
next thing is going to be the image now
when you when you're working with images
we're going to use the cloud and airy
type even though we're not using cloud
Neri we that's just what the type is for
some reason so we're going to say type
dot cloud Neri image I think that that
should be good ok and then finally we'll
have a publish date okay so publish date
and we'll set that type to date and then
we want to set a default and we're going
to set that to date dot now okay because
we want that to just use the current
time and date alright I spelt that wrong
that should have an out just cloud Neri
image so that's it for our fields now
the last thing we want to do is register
our model so we're going to say product
dot register and that should do it
so we save it and the next thing we're
going to do is go to our view controller
let me make this bigger let's go to
routes and then views and we're going to
create in here basically we're going to
have two files because we want a product
and products okay because we're going to
have two different views so let's create
one called
products products j/s and then we're
also going to create product jf okay so
let's start with products
so we're going to bring in Keystone and
then what we're going to do is say
sports explores equals the module dot
exports equals function okay because we
want this to be available outside of
this file and then that's going to take
requests and response and in here let's
create a variable called view and we're
going to set that to a new Keystone dot
view okay so and he ever also want to
pass in the request and response object
alright and then we're going to create a
variable called locals and set that to
response dot local so basically our
global variables okay now we want to set
our locals and we're going to set a
section ok so let's say locals dot
section and when it's set it to store
and it usually what we do it
store so it uses the section to do the
UM see let's go to the front end it uses
the section to do the active class for
the navbar so we want to set this and
the product jazz view controller we want
to set them to store and we're going to
have the menu item say store as well
alright so now what we want to do is
want to load our products so let's say
we're going to take that view and we're
going to call query and let's pass in
here products and then we want to pass
in our model so Keystone dot
and we want to grab our product product
model and then call dot model and then
dot find okay and that's going to grab
all of our products and then the last
thing we want to do is just render our
view so if you dot render and we're
going to render a view called products
okay and that's it
so let's save that now to set the route
we're going to go to routes and then
index J s and we're going to go down
here and let's put this here so we'll
say app dot get and it's going to be
slash products and we want that to go to
route dot views dot products just like
that okay we'll save that and then I
believe we have to add something to
middleware J s as well yeah so right
here let's this is actually the menu
item so let's just go ahead and paste
that in and label will be store and then
the key will be store and then the href
is going to be products ok now this key
store is going to connect it to this
right here this section and that's how
the active class in the bootstrap navbar
works as well okay so we did that and
now we want to do is create our template
for products so in templates views look
I'm going to create a new file called
products dot HBS okay for handlebars and
for now let's just say products and save
so I want to see if this works what
we'll do
is we have to actually restart the
server so ctrl C and then note Keystone
it looks like we're getting an error
type is not defined all right so let's
go to our model and let's see did I do
this right Keystone dot field dot type
all right here this should be typed all
right let's try that
okay so server is running if we reload
the back end now we have products okay
if we look at the front-end we have a
store
okay now that that is not supposed to
happen
key list model find is not a function
all right so let's go to our products
you I just call it a view controller I
know that's not what it's called but
that's pretty much what it is
I'm let's see so it's looking at this
line here and the issue is model should
not have parentheses all right so let's
save that and see do I have to restart
this
the models not fine yeah we have to
restart the server all right so let's
try it again
store and there we go we're loading up
our products template so that's good
and then if we go in the backend and
click on products we get no products
found and we can now create them cool
so let's actually do that we'll create a
product and let's say we want to add the
iPhone 7 create and you can see we have
our fields so price will say to 99.99
say we have a hundred of them
description I'm just going to paste this
in it's just description I got from the
Apple website and then I'm going to
upload an image so I have this iPhone
image and the publish date is going to
be set to now and then we're going to
save okay so it says your changes has
been saved and now if we go to products
there it is iPhone 7 so let's create one
more product will add the iPad air so
price will say 699 quantity let's say we
have 50 description paste that in look
that's formatted you can also view the
source code and use that as well and
let's upload an image and save okay so
now we have our products and now we want
to display these on the front end okay
right here so we're going to go to see
we're going to go to our handlebars
template so products dot HBS and
freezing bootstraps so let's add a
container
and we're going to have an h1 will save
products ok and then to a row and this
is going to be let's just do a 12 column
so it'll reach all the way across
we'll say column d12 and call LG 12 and
if you don't know bootstrapped these are
just some predefined classes for the
grid and let's see now we're going to
create a row again and basically what I
want to do is I want to have each
product in a four column div okay so we
want to do in each loop to loop through
the product so we can put a number sign
and we'll say each products and then
that's going to end down here so for
each one we want a div with the class of
call md4 and call LG four and let's put
in h2 okay so this will have a link to
the details page which we haven't set up
yet we want to put the title here so we
can use the triple curly braces and say
title so let's just try that see if it
works okay there we go
iPhone 7 iPad air and then underneath
that we want to put we want to put the
image so let's first check to see if
there is an image so we can say if image
put an image tag with a source attribute
and the source is going to go I'm going
to do three curly braces and say cloud
Andheri URL image and we can set ah
let's set the width actually I don't
think we need that let's just do crop
equals fit and it's also given a class
of thumbnail which is a bootstrap class
okay so we'll save okay so we do want to
settle with let's say with you could do
this in your CSS if you want with 160
height height 160 to try that
yeah that's what I have I guess that'll
do alright so I mean if you want to mess
with the styling you can do that that's
fine but I'm just going to leave it like
that
so we have our listing page now we want
the individual product page so we're
going to use the same model we have one
model for both but we do need to create
in our routes views we have product J s
so let's work on this now I'm going to
copy what we have in products jazz and
put it in product J s alright and then
we want to say this is going to be the
same the section is going to be the same
it's going to be in the store section
now we're going to change this query is
going to work a little different so
we're going to get rid of this and we're
going to say view dot on view dot on and
knit so when this view initializes we're
going to run this function okay and this
function will take a parameter of next
and then we're going to create a
variable for our query so we'll save our
Q and let's put that to Keystone dot
list product dot model and we want to
call instead of find we're going to say
find one right and then in here we'll
pass in some curly braces and we want to
say slug for locals dot filters dot
product
okay now this locus filters we want to
set this up here
we want to let the system know that this
is part of the products all right so
we're going to say locals dot filters
and set that to an object and then just
say product set that to request dot
params
dot product and then we're just going to
set another local variable called data
and set that to an object with our
products which is going to be an empty
array all right and then we want to be
able to basically click on this and have
it go to slash products slash and then
the slug which in this case would be
iPad air just formatted differently
formatted for a URL so that's our query
and then we want to execute the query so
say Q dot exec and pass in a function
okay so this function will give us an
error if there is one and then a result
okay and then what we want to do is put
that result into the data dot product so
locals dot data dot product and we're
going to fill that with the result we
get and then we'll just call next okay
which will just proceed to do whatever
is next and then we just want to change
the view to render the product view so
let's save that now we need to add a
route for this so let's go to routes and
then index J s and let's go right here
you know just copy this so this is going
to be products slash and then we want to
do ID like that
I'm sorry not ID product okay so this
product this is basically a placeholder
for whatever the slug is and then if we
go back and look at what we just did
we're getting that from this request
params
product so if you were to put : ID there
you would do request params ID alright
so that's how that works
and you want to match that to the slug
alright so make sure you save that
actually we need to change this to
product for the view and then go ahead
and save that then what we want to do is
create a inside the template views
folder we want to create a view for the
single product
okay so we'll call this product dot HBS
and for now let's just put in product
and save now we need this to go to that
page and if we go to see products we
want it to go here in this link now
there's actually a helper for this for
the other resources if we go into views
templates views helpers index jf and
just going to search for URL and let's
see it's going to be where is it right
here you'll see that there's this helper
called post URL page URL category URL
and basically it goes to the resource
and then the slug so I'm going to
actually create a helper for the product
so let's copy this and let's put in here
product URL and then we'll change this
to product slug and we want this to go
to products slash product slug
all right and let's just change this
comment and it will save that then let's
go back here and in this link we want to
call that product URL so we'll put a
double curly brace and product URL and
pass in slug
okay so let's save that and we're going
to have to restart the server okay
Oh see so it's going to the right place
product iphone7 see what this says local
is not defined and that's in view
product I would say yep this should be
locals swimmin s okay so let's try it
again
and there we go so it's going to product
now we just need to add the content to
that handlebars template so let's go to
product HB s and we're just going to
throw in a div with a class of container
clicking on to sell okay and let's put
in I would say what do I want to put in
put in a row and we're going to do a 12
column div right is that what I want
yeah call MD 12 call LG 12 okay and in
here I'm going to put I'm actually going
to use an article tag okay html5 tag and
I want to put a link to go back to the
products so let's say say a trap and
this is going to go to slash products
and let's put in a symbol here we'll say
ampersand
Larr to give us an arrow and we'll say
back to products okay and then under
that let's put an H R and then we're
going to put in the header and then the
header we'll put an h1 and we want the
title now for this we're actually going
to do data dot product
look data dot product dot title and save
and there we go iPhone 7 click on iPad
air there we go so under the header
we're going to put in another row and
basically I want to have two six column
divs okay so there's one two and then
this side is going to be the image so
first thing we'll do is check for the
image so if and it's going to be data
dot image
I'm sorry data dot product dot image and
if there is one will display it so
source is going to be cloud Neri URL
data dot product dot image and let's
just to crop equals fit and let's give
it a class of image responsive all right
now on this side in this sixth column
did we're going to put the information
so I'm going to put this in a ul right
here and say class list group and then
we'll put in Li with a class of list
group item and this is going to be the
price put in some strong tags here and
say price and then we'll do data dot
product dot price okay not proof and
then I'm just going to copy this Li and
then this is going to be the quantity
okay and then underneath that will do a
div and I'm going to give this a class
of well and then here we want the
description so data dot product dot
description and then finally I just want
a link right here give it a class of BTN
BTN success and BTN block and this is
actually going to go to the contact page
okay so we'll say ask about this product
and let's save it take a look there we
go there's our product page
notice that the store is also
highlighted up here is active because
this and this page are both in the store
section so we'll go to the contact page
I just want to add an extra select
option here to ask about a product for
that you go into it gets in the model
and then in inquiry j/s and then we just
want to add to this array right here
we'll give it a value of product we'll
say ask about product or a product okay
so you have to restart the server if you
edit the model
so now we have asked about a product
alright so we have successfully added a
an entire resource to Keystone and you
could do this with anything if it was a
to-do list or a music gallery albums
movie something like that you can do
absolutely anything and you can have
this admin area for it as well so it's
pretty nice now last thing I want to do
is on the front end I want to change
this page here I just want to get rid of
like the login info and all that stuff
so that would be under templates views
and then index and let's see I'm going
to get rid of everything below that
paragraph inside of the Jumbotron and
then under the Jumbotron let's do div
class
row okay and then we're going to do div
class call MD for call lg4 and I'm just
going to grab some dummy text actually
know what I can just use the plug-in
hangar so if we say actually let's put a
h3 and here I'm just going to put
alarmed Epsom and then we'll do a
paragraph and I'll say larum tab and
that gives us a whole bunch of sample
content and just want to get rid of some
of it though okay so let's go ahead and
copy this four column div and we'll
paste two more in and save reload and
there's our home page alright so you can
see we have a lot of functionality here
for such a little amount of code all
right now I might plan on doing a video
where we build from absolute scratch so
that maybe you can get a little more
from
with the files in the file structure and
the syntax and all that so I may do that
but I just wanted to start with
something simple and I also didn't want
to just do you know show you how to
generate it like a lot of videos will
just show you how to generate it and go
through the backend I wanted to show you
how we could actually add something to
it so basically you know you could add
any resource you just want to add your
model your view model or view controller
whatever you want to call this and then
your template view okay so those three
things is what you want to do when you
want to add pretty much any any kind of
functionality with with your Keystone
app alright so that's going to be it for
me for this video guys hopefully you
liked it if you did please subscribe if
you haven't already leave a like or
comment or whatever you can do is fine
alright so thanks for watching and I'll
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
