to do a video basic video on the YouTube
data API version 3 so in this video what
I'm going to do is get a list of videos
from a certain channel and have them
display on a web page
alright now to do this we need to use
two different methods or API calls from
the YouTube API and the first one is
going to be channels list alright so
what this is going to do is get us
information about a certain channel
it'll get us give us the name of the
channel the description ID things like
that but what we really want from this
the channels list is the uploads
playlist ID alright there's there's a
lot of different things in the YouTube
API that are known as playlists or
categorizes playlists and a channels
upload uploads is actually a playlist so
we want to get that ID using this call
here we're going to make a get request
to this URL and once we get that uploads
playlist ID we're going to then use the
playlist items method alright we're
going to plug that ID into this call
here and that will give us back all of
the videos for that channel it's a
little tougher to do than with the
version 2 API so I guess that's why it's
I'm getting requests to do this so what
we're going to do is if we scroll down
we can see the parameters that we can
include in our request and the required
parameter here is called part and we
have a lot of different parts we can
request
what we want to get here is content
details all right that's what's going to
give us the uploads playlist ID for that
channel alright and then you can have
filters down here category ID for user
name is going to be another field that
we want that's going to be the channel
name alright we're just going to use my
channel tech guy web and there's a whole
bunch of other things you can include as
well and then down at the bottom we have
kind of a form here that we can fill out
and make it make an API call alright so
the part is required what we're going to
do is get the content details and then
for user name I'm going to say tech guy
web alright and then we'll go ahead and
execute that and it'll give us a
response and I'll see where is it right
here uploads okay this is the uploads
playlist ID that we're going to need in
order to get videos for that particular
channel and we can actually do that
through this desaad I guess
testing interface so let me grab that
and then go over to playlist items and
go down to the bottom
instead of channels list I'm sorry
content details we're going to use
snippet and then we want to put this ID
in the playlist ID input field
okay so we'll execute that and then down
here you can still see that it's
outputting videos okay we have my
building audio player using html5 video
the description it has it goes from
latest and then the next one you can see
is part one all right so it's given us I
believe five results by default alright
so you can see how exactly how the API
works and how the requests work so what
I want to do is we're going to do this
in an actual web page and we're going to
use jQuery to make our requests alright
so let's go ahead and create a new
folder
and we'll just call it YouTube
now I'm not going to go nuts with design
or anything like that we're not going to
create an actual application I just want
to show you how to how to get those
results and put them in your web page
all right so let's create a new folder
called Jas
and our index
okay and of course we want to download
jQuery
all right and I'm going to put this into
the Jay s folder
all right and then we're going to create
a javascript file called script Jas
all right so that should be all we need
for now let's go ahead and open up index
I'm going to use notepad plus plus and
I'm also going to open
- script Jas
get rid of that
all right so let's go ahead and create
just a basic structure I'm going to use
html5
YouTube channel vids
okay so in our body
basically all we're going to have here
is going to be a ul with the ID of
results and we're going to use Ajax to
just just fill this in oops
ul
all right so that's pretty much the HTML
I'll you can put a head header in here
you to videos
and I mean I guess we can give it a
little bit of style we'll put a
container
and then I'm just going to throw a
little bit of style on the heading
okay so container here the width of 800
margin auto overflow:auto
and background:white and then we'll just
do the body give the body a background
of light gray and font-family:arial
all right
so that's our HTML page go ahead and
just open that up
all right
I guess we could give padding to the
container as well
all right so now we we also need to
connect our javascript file and jQuery
so I'm going to say script SRC
well KS / jQuery 1.11 I think that's it
window
all right and then we want our script
file
whoops need to chain you to ah close
this and add the ending script tag okay
I'm just going to copy this
and I'll change this to script all right
so let's just make sure that this is
loading
all right
all right so now we're going to do is
create we want to make a get request to
the channels list URL which is
this here
all right so let's go in here and we're
going to make sure the documents ready
so documents dot ready and then we want
a function all right and we're going to
use get
okay so first we want the URL so let me
grab this
that in there okay now the options so we
want to do a comma and then some curly
braces and inside here we want the part
alright the part is going to be content
details
and for username okay so what we're
doing here is the same exact thing that
we did on that test page that Google
gives you that form that allows you to
make calls we're doing that same exact
thing here through jQuery
all right so channel name I'm actually
going to create a variable called
channel name let me just put this
just put it right here okay I'm going to
set that to my channel
okay channel name
now we need an API key all right so let
me show you how to get an API key for
this you want to go to the Google API
console
all right and you want to go to api's
and off and then credentials I believe
yeah
and then I just have a public key that
I'm using that's why I don't really care
if you see it or not you just want to go
to create new key and browser key and
here's where you want to put your your
domain names that you want to be able to
use this key all right you can see an
example right here this is going to make
it so that any page on example.com will
be able to use this key all right but
it's fine to just leave it blank if it's
going to be just a quick staging test
app like we're doing here you can just
click create and you'll get a new one
and where's my new one
well whatever you'll see something like
this and then you just want to grab this
key all right and then paste it in your
JavaScript file
all right so very simple if you don't
have a Google account or a developer
account just go ahead and create one and
you should be able to do that no problem
ah yeah so that's it so just do that all
right so I'm going to throw my key in
here which is public so I don't care if
you guys see it
let's see so we want to say key and I
meant to do that I meant to show you how
to do that at the beginning of the video
so I apologize for that and that's all
we need here so I'm going to bring this
up here and then we want to calm our
after the curly brace and then we're
going to have a function all right and
the function is going to take a
parameter of data okay so now we're
going to be able to get the content
details from a channel so now we need to
figure out what we want to do with them
all right so usually you would create
some kind of loop here so we're going to
create an each loop so that we can go
through our results and for the loop we
want to provide data dot items and then
we want a function
all right and you may want to just
console.log and console.log the item
variable all right so what we want to do
let's actually try that okay let's save
that and go to our index page I'm going
to open up the chrome tools and go to
console and reload so what's this
I file not found
um
you know what this get I don't know why
I put that there that's not supposed to
be there all right so it should just be
like that
and item is not defined
on line 11 so item all inside of the
function we need to pass I an item
all right so down here we're logging the
content details so if I open this up
content details it gives us the Google+
user ID we want to look under related
playlists and we have the favorites
playlist likes and uploads okay so what
we want to do is grab this okay not from
here we need to actually grab it in our
script alright and we can access these
items through item dot
content details dot and then where I
want to go from there
so we went into item and then content
details next you can see that this is
under related playlists alright so we
want to go there related
playlists'
all right and then uploads alright as
you can see in related playlist we have
uploads and that's that's the last phase
I guess with this path so uploads
alright and what I want to do with this
is put this in the variable I'm going to
call it PID for playlist ID and we want
to just set that equal to that okay make
sure you have a semicolon there and what
do I want to do with this I'm going to
I'm going to plug it into another
function that's going to make the call
to the playlists to this here playlist
items alright so let's go ahead and just
I'm going to create a function called
get vids and then we're just going to
plug in that playlist ID all right and
then down here after this get request
we're going to create a new function so
public function get vids
all right and then that get vids is
going to take PID
all right now we're going to do
something very similar to what we did up
here so for now I'm just actually going
to copy this alright now the first thing
we need to do here is change the URL to
this oh that's what happened last time I
copied the actual get you just want the
URL
okay and then the part is going to be
different we don't want content details
we can want snippet all right it's not
going to have a four channel name but
let's change this to max results and we
can actually set the results here okay
so for max results let's just say ten
okay you will need your key well and
we'll also need that playlist ID
okay so playlist ID and then that's
going to be that PID variable that we
plugged in here all right and then we
have a function same thing we're going
to loop through it but before we do that
I want to create a variable called
output okay it doesn't have to be equal
to anything yet but this is the variable
that we're going to build on to have our
content display on the page okay so
let's go ahead and
actually we can keep the console.log
alright but what we want to do now is
get some data all right so let's get the
video title alright so I'm going to
create a variable called video title and
set that to item dot snippet dot title
what I'm not typing anything in here so
item dot snippet dot title all right we
can access any of those snippet
variables just like this all right now
let's just keep the tyga type just use
the title for a second and see if we can
up with that onto our page all right so
while we're still in this each loop I'm
going to say output
equals and let's make it equal Li tags
because we remember we're inserting this
into an unloaded list that we have right
here okay
so list items and we'll just let's just
do the vid title so basically we'll just
concatenate here vid title
all right so we have it in the output
variable boy we're not we're not giving
it to the HTML page yet so let's do that
so underneath the variable I'm going to
append to our results results list okay
so what we want to do is grab the
results ID and say dot append
and then what do we want to append is
output
all right so let's see if this works
okay unexpected identifier line 24 we
have our key all we own that we didn't
put a comma here
all right so what it's done is it's
printed out the first ten video titles
on from my channel okay we've also
logged them in the console we can look
at more down here so that's exactly what
we want
up to this point alright so obviously
now we want to embed the videos and not
just the title now sometimes as issues
when using when embedding videos using
the YouTube API you from your local file
system
alright because we're not on a server or
anything right now so what I want to do
is I'm going to finish the code here
okay we're going to put in our embed
code and then we're going to load this
up onto a server so we can see it in
action so we can see it work because it
might not work using the localhost okay
so what we want to do here is instead of
just having this video title and just
take this out for now
we want an iframe
all right and this iframe is going to
get a attribute called source or SRC and
we're going to set this to let's see
what we're doing here www dot actually
we want to we need to escape this first
quote so I'm going to put a backslash
and then two forward slashes and then
WW youtube.com slash embed slash and
then we need the video ID so we need to
concatenate here so we're going to do a
single quote and then a plus sign and
then the video ID variable then another
plus sign and a quote and then a
backslash all right so that should do it
okay so if we save this and reload on
out in our file system you can see that
the video is not showing all right so
I'm just going to open up FileZilla here
and just connect to one of my web
servers
okay so on code skillet calm and create
a directory called test okay and then
we'll just upload our odd JavaScript
folder and index file all right now if
we go to a skillet comm slash test
now you can see we have our videos
alright so it's giving me the first 10
or the latest 10 videos I have the
height and the width are not - not very
optimal so let's go back into our code
and what I'm going to do is set a height
and a width and I'm going to have these
I'm going to create some variables for
these right so let's go up here under
the channel name and create a variable
called vid with
and let's set that to 500 and then
variable vid height we'll set that to I
don't know 400 okay and I think is that
all that I want for a variable
yeah that looks good all the max results
I want that to be a variable as well
I'm gonna use vid results
good results equals 10
all right actually I don't need quotes
around these numbers
all right
and now we just need to insert them here
but you need to concatenate here so FID
height and then this one bid with
all right so let's save that I'm going
to re-upload it
okay
so I mean it doesn't look it's not the
best a good look you can go ahead and
use CSS and style it all up but
basically we're just taking we're taking
the first 10 videos from my channel and
you can easily go ahead and change the
channel from right here let's say we
want to change it to Google developers
save it
okay that didn't work
did I not save it
so channel name is Google developers
save and then upload oh I just upload
the HTML file we need to do the
JavaScript as well
actually I don't think this is a space
to try that
all right so there we go
so that's how you can use the YouTube
data API version 3 to get all the videos
on a particular channel if you liked
this video and you learned a lot from it
please subscribe and I will be making
more videos on the YouTube data API so
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
