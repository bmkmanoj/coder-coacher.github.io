you how to add a new domain to your
cPanel account you can add most hosting
companies allow you to add either a
certain number of domains or a set a
fixed number of domains on one shared
hosting account so you don't have to
have a reseller or VPS or a dedicated
server to have more than one domain and
I'm going to show you how to do that now
so you just want to log in to your
cPanel and the domain my main domain is
Meniere's help org but I'm going to add
a domain called health reduce com so I'm
gonna log in to my one second
so I'm going to log into my cPanel and
this is just a cPanel account from
Hostgator and you want to go down to
where is it
add-on domains and just put in a domain
name mine is gonna be health reuters.com
and it'll automatically add this
information so this is a FTP account a
username you could use to log in via FTP
and you want to create a password and
that should be it it's going to create a
folder that has the same name as the
domain in your public HTML folder so you
just click Add domain
okay so the add-on domain has been
created and now the only thing left to
do is to go to your domain registrar and
login to the panel and just change your
name service to point to this hosting
account if you haven't already done that
so very easy that's how you add an
add-on domain and cPanel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
