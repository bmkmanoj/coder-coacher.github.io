solutions I'm going to make a quick
video showing you how to UM bring a
MySQL database over to a new host we're
going to export it from one host and
then we're going to import it another
I'm going to do that through PHP myadmin
and you know you'll need to do this if
you have a if you feel like switching
hosting companies or or if you want to
upgrade to a dedicated server or
whatever the reason is there's plenty of
reasons to switch host so as you can see
here I have my cPanel open this is going
to be this the site we have with the
database that we want to explore and
then we want to put it on this host did
this obviously this tutorial is for
cPanel only if you're using something
else well if you're using something else
I suggest moving to a cPanel host but
it's it's most likely the same thing I
mean most most hosting companies offer
PHP myadmin
so let's get started we're going to go
to the first web host this is the one
where we're actually exporting so I'll
just show you what we have for database
is here just click on MySQL database
icon
this is a list of the databases we have
here it's prefixed with buzz flip which
is the account name and one we're going
to be exploiting is the right here
it's a Drupal site so um it's D ip3 so
we can't do anything in this in this
interface we have to go in PHP myadmin
so go back to the cPanel main page and
then in databases where we just where
you want to click PHP myadmin
and
and this is the PHP my admin interface
so we want to choose that the database
we want which is right afdi p3 and
you'll see we got a bunch of tables this
is Drupal install so it's all the tables
within the Drupal CMS so what we're
going to do is click export and here you
have all types of options you can you
can export individual tables if you want
you know you can change the format but
we're not going to touch any of this
we're going to stick to the quick method
and click go
and it will ask you to save a file a dot
SQL file so just save that we're about
to your desktop and depending how big
your database is this could take 10
seconds or it could take an hour or I
didn't realize how how big this database
was
I guess you're stuck on me for the next
five minutes well I guess while that's
downloading I can show you what we're
going to do I'm going to log into the
other yeah because this is the new host
right here we actually don't have a
database created yet to import it too so
that works out good so we'll go to
cPanel has a really good function it's a
database wizard so if you click on MySQL
database wizard you know it's really
quick to just name your database I'm
just going to name it Drupal and of
course Newberry P is the name of the
cPanel account so that'll get prefixed
on to the to your name so next step and
here you just want to create a user I
usually call it same same as the youth
database name and password you want a
really good password you can generate
one but I'm not going to do that I'm
just going to type it in me
and I have a really secure algorithm for
passwords I would advise you do the same
thing you can look up password
algorithms and find a nice little secure
system on but you just got to remember
it that's the problem
there we go all right so I'm going to
create the user and then it'll ask me
for the privileges we want this user to
have you know you can just click create
a delete or whatever we're going to
click all privileges and that's it I
knew our new database is set up new
grapey Drupal and that will the user and
then the new of the databases name the
same thing so now we'll just return home
and remember this is the the site we're
transferring the database to let's just
see how that downloads coming yep the
Downloads done so now we're going to do
is remember we exported it from PHP
myadmin on the first toast so now we're
going to go to PHP myadmin on this
server the new server
and you'll see I only have this one
database this is a brand new cPanel
account so you want to click on the
database the new one and you'll see it's
completely empty so what you want to do
is click import and now what you want to
do is browse and get the file you
downloaded from the other house the
other host which is right here and then
you want to click go
sometimes you can give you problems but
it's usually pretty smooth hopefully
sometimes the SQL file can get corrupted
or or what is some settings you can mess
you up but usually goes pretty well
and again the bigger the database the
longer it's going to take this is kind
of a big ones
huh
any second now
hmm
once Nicolas long
you know what I want to see how big that
databases
this one is all actually some
something's up with this cPanel it says
zero for all of my databases I don't
know why but all right let's cut yup so
it imported successfully 493 queries so
as you can see this is the new database
and these are all the tables I'll show
you here see all the tables are in there
and you can compare them to the other
side to the old post and you'll see it's
same thing so that's it that's how you
employ a database and it sounds a lot
harder than it really is
