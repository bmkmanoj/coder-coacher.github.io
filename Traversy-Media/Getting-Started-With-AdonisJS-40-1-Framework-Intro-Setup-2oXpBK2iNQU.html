Adonis J s framework initially this was
gonna be an hour-long crash course but I
couldn't get it under an hour so I
decided to break it up into a few
different videos now I've been asked
over and over for a crash course on
Adonis but I wanted to wait until
version 4.0 was officially released and
it has been and that's what we'll be
using version 4.0 so in this series
you'll learn what Adonis is what the
folder structure looks like how to use
the CLI how to create routes controllers
models views form validation and more so
we're gonna build a basic blog
application the application itself isn't
going to be very feature full are very
special it's not about the application
though it's about giving you the
knowledge to create your own apps so
without further ado let's get started
with Adonis Jas coding dojo is a
programming school that turns beginners
into developers and only 14 weeks over
90% of their grads land jobs within
three months of graduating often making
over 70 K per year to learn more visit
coding dojo com or click the link in the
description below alright so before we
get started let's talk about what this
technology is what is Adonis j/s so it's
a it's a no js' web framework and if you
don't know what nodejs is you're
probably new to this channel but it's a
JavaScript runtime that can be used to
build very powerful asynchronous
JavaScript applications on the server so
there's a lot of frameworks that run on
top of node the most popular being
Express which I use quite a bit and on
this channel but you also have happy Jas
loopback and a ton of others what makes
a dantas unique is that it has a hard
core MVC structure it actually kind of
reminds me of laravel laravel Ruby on
Rails MVC stands for model view
controller and if you've never heard of
that it's a design pattern where it
basically breaks certain functionalities
up into different sections of the
application so for example the
controller handles all incoming requests
it's responsible for communicating with
the model and loading views the model is
where all the
database interaction goes or anything to
do with the data and then the view is
the user interface it's the part of the
application that the user sees in the
browser so by default
Adonis uses the edge template engine
which is really easy to use now of
course you could use Adonis as a peer
back-end and just return Jason so that
you could use something like react or
angular on the front-end now this is a
course in the in just a dantas so we're
not going to be using any other
framework along with it we're gonna use
we're just gonna render our views on the
server all right so let's go ahead and
get started here now I'm using a tool
called get bash for Windows which is a
better command line than just the
standard windows CMD if you want to use
that if you're on Windows you can go to
get - SCM comm and you can download that
if you're on Linux or Mac you can just
use your standard terminal alright so
first thing we need to do is install the
CLI okay just like many frameworks
Adonis has its own CLI it's actually
very similar to angular it's even see it
even looks the same as far as the name
it's at Adonis slash CLI just like at
angular slash CLI so let's do NPM
install obviously you need nodejs
installed because we're using NPM if you
don't have no js' just go to node.js org
and download and install it now we want
to install this globally so you want to
add the - key flag that means that we
can use it from anywhere on our system
and that we just want to do at Adonis J
s slash CLI alright and that'll install
it globally all right so now that's
installed let's do Adonis - - help and
this will show us all the commands that
are available so the CLI is very
powerful it allows us to create things
like controllers models views database
migrations we have the serve command to
start the HTTP server the new command to
create a new application so there's a
lot you can do with this CLI all right
now what I want to do is generate a new
application
so I'm actually gonna go into my
projects folder you guys can go can
create this wherever you want and we're
gonna do
Adonis new and I'm gonna call this
Adonis 4-0 blog because we're using
version 4.0 and I want to make that
clear so let's go ahead and run that and
it's gonna create a folder called Adonis
4 before 0 blog and it's gonna add all
the files to it ok it's gonna create the
whole the entire folder structure so
let's CD into Adonis 4-0 blog and I'm
going to open my text editor I'm using
Visual Studio code so I'm just gonna do
code dot okay and what you don't have to
use Visual Studio code whatever editor
you're using just go ahead and open up
the folder structure inside of it now if
you are using vyas code there's a couple
extensions I would suggest one is Adonis
j/s itself just search for Adonis Jas
and install it that'll give you certain
snippets things like that and then also
this edge template support extension
which allows you to have syntax
highlighting and stuff like that inside
of edge templates because that's the
template engine that Adonis uses by
default now there's one other thing that
you should do and let's go to
preferences settings and if you want to
use Emmet with edge okay with edge
templates then you want to include this
Emmet dot included languages and then
just add edge HTML if you don't do this
then M it's not going to work inside of
your edge templates alright so now that
we've gone over that let's go ahead and
take a look at the file structure so in
the root here we have our package dot
Jason this is a pretty simple package
file we have a couple scripts to start
and test now we're going to be using
something called node Mon I'm sure many
of you are familiar with it it will
constantly watch our application or well
it'll monitor it and then it'll update
it when we make changes that way we
don't have to keep resetting the server
and I don't know about in Linux or Mac
but when I just run node server j/s or I
run Adonis serve
every time I stop the server the port
gets stuck and I have to go in and do a
net stat and then at a skill and
actually kill the port manually so
that's kind of a pain in the ass so
we're gonna be using node Mon now down
here in the dependencies you can see
that basically Adonis is kind of like
angular it's just a bunch of different
packages and we have the main framework
package here which is version 4.0 0.27
alright and then it's Auto loading the
app folder which I'll talk about a
little bit so pretty simple package dot
JSON file now we have this ace file here
the file itself isn't very important but
what aces is it bootstraps all of the of
the CLI commands for our projects okay
so it allows us to generate controllers
models run migrations things like that
you can also create your own commands to
file at this file itself isn't very
important for us we're not going to
touch it or anything but that's what ace
does and then down here we have server
j/s which is the bootstrap file for the
HTTP server now the dot NV file
E&amp;amp;V file is the environment variables we
have the host the port which by default
is three three three three we have our
environment set to development by
default and then down here we have our
database stuff so notice that SQL Lite
is the default database we're going to
be using MySQL so later on we're going
to configure this file to to link to our
MySQL database all right so that's the
route now if we look in the app folder
actually let's start with the public
folder public is where all your static
assets go so images CSS files
client-side JavaScript files things like
that and then in the app folder this is
where our controllers and models go
there's not a controllers folder by
default but as soon as we generate a
controller it'll appear in this folder
alright and notice that we are we have a
default model of user and token now
we're not going to get into
authentication and users in this in this
series well at least at the point that
I'm at
now I may continue it later basically
what I want to do is just get you
building a basic crud application and
then maybe later on we can either add to
it or we can create a different
application all right so let's see we
also have the resources folder this is
where the views are by default there's a
welcome dot edge view this is what we're
gonna see when we start up the server
initially just like laravel there's you
know the views are in the resources
folder there's a lot of similarities to
laravel actually now we also have a
Start folder this is where we have our
app dot JS file which is where we load
any providers that we're using later on
we're going to use a validator provider
for form validation and we're going to
add that to this file kernel Jas is
where all the middleware is registered
and then we have our routes JS file
which we're going to use quite a bit
this is where we create all of our
routes notice by default there's a route
for slash which is the home page and
it's just rendering the welcome view
which we just looked at now usually
you're not going to want to just render
a view from the routes file you're gonna
want to you're gonna want to map a route
to a controller method and then render
the view from the controller all right
so yeah we'll get to that in a little
bit and then the last folder we have
full second to last is the config this
just has different different config
files so if the main app J s we have
authentication cores for cross-site
origins if you want to you if you want
to make requests from different domain
names database j s
different connections SQL Lite SQL
postgrads
like I said we're gonna be using MySQL
now you don't want to edit this config
file you want to edit the dot env file
okay you also have a sessions config
file so the last one is database and
this just has your migrations notice
there's two migrations by default one is
going to be the users table and one is
going to be the tokens table all right
so when we go and we create our posts
migration and run it it's also going to
run these two migrations and create
these tables as well
now if you don't know what migrations
are it they're basically files that will
edit our database so in this case it's
gonna create a table for us you'll see
there's an up and a down method the up
is going to create the database the
tokens table it's gonna create all of
these fields
so basically increments is going to give
us an ID field with Auto increment it's
going to give us a user ID field a token
type is revoked
and then some time stamp fields now this
is what will happen when we run the
migration but we also have the option to
rollback the migration and that's gonna
run the down method and what that will
do is just drop the entire tokens table
all right so you can always go back if
you if you make a mistake or let's say
you you need to add another field here
you forgot to add a field you could
always rollback and then add it here and
then run the migration again and this
makes it much easier than having to go
into you know PHP myadmin
or into the SQL shell and actually
creating all your fields and stuff like
that your tables all we have to do is
create the database and then we can just
run migrations alright so and we don't
even have to create these files from
scratch we use the CLI to create the the
migration files so let's go ahead and
run the server now like I said I'm gonna
use something called node Mon so I'm
gonna clear this out and we're gonna do
NPM install - B for global and then node
1 alright so now that we have that
installed let's go ahead and run node
Mon server dot J s alright so now that
started the server and you can see it's
on port 3 3 3 3 so I'm going to open up
a browser here and we're gonna go to
localhost port 3 333 and it gives us
this default view right here so this is
actually the welcome view that we looked
at let me just where are we so this is
if we go to resources views welcome dot
edge alright now you saw that little
animation at the beginning that
actually from the CSS file notice that
all of this is just standard HTML except
for this part here this is the syntax we
use to include expressions and variables
and things like that the double curly
brace is similar to angular similar to
underscore and we can call this CSS
function put in the file name and it's
going to automatically load style dot
CSS from our public folder so if we go
to public you'll see style dot CSS and
if I go down here you can see the
keyframes and that's where that little
animation came from all right now what I
want to do is create a whole new
homepage so I'm gonna go to the routes
file which is in start routes j s and
then I'm also gonna open up my terminal
inside V s code all right I'm gonna let
the server run on this get bash window
and then for my CLI commands I'm going
to use the integrated terminal and to
open that envious code you can do shift
tilde or you can do view integrated
terminal all right so what I'm gonna do
is generate a new view and to do that we
can say add honest make : view and then
let's create a view called home alright
and what that did is it created this
this file called home dot edge so I'm
just going to put an h1 in here now to
use Emmet like I just did you have to
add that that option I showed you in the
beginning and then let's just say home
we'll put a paragraph and we'll just say
welcome to the Dantas j/s 4.0 blog so
that's our home let's save it now to map
this to our home page we need to go to
our routes and notice right here where
it says render welcome I'm gonna change
this to render home and save ok we'll
reload that and now we have our home
page now I want to talk a little bit
more about routes before we move further
so usually we're gonna do route get or
host or put delete whatever type of HTTP
requests that that we want to respond to
so let's do route get and let's put in
here slash test alright now we can do
whatever we want when a route is hit so
for instance we can put an arrow
function in here like this and then we
can just say hello world so if we save
that and we go to slash test and you'll
see we get hello world now if you're not
comfortable with arrow functions then
you could just go let's do row get and
we'll say let's do slash test too and
you could just put function and you
could return and we'll just say hello
there and save and now we can just go to
test two and we get hello there alright
so you can use either format now if you
want parameters in your URL for instance
if we want to go to likes test slash and
then three and you want to get that
three then see what I'm gonna do is just
copy this and we'll say test slash and
then colon ID okay so so we want to take
in an ID parameter and then we can
access that I'm just going to put a
template string in here which is part of
es6 so I'm going to use these back ticks
not single quotes and I'm just gonna say
this is the ID and then we'll put in our
es6 expression or variable syntax which
is a money sign in curly braces and
we'll say params dot ID and one thing I
forgot is to pass in right here params
like that alright so we'll save that and
then let's go to test slash 3 and we get
this is the ID 3 if I put in 500 we get
this is the ID 500 all right so just to
just a little bit of experimentation
with routes but this is just for testing
I'm gonna comment that out alright so
I'm gonna save this and in the next
video what I want to do is create a
controller because like I said what
we're gonna want to do is map routes to
controller methods and then render views
from there instead of just rendering it
like this the home page is the only view
that I want to render from the actual
row alright so in the next video we'll
go ahead and create our post controller
