building a custom jeweler module and we
left off on the the entry point file
which is mod featured articles dot PHP
and that's all set we have everything we
need there so the next thing I want to
do is build up the helper dot PHP file
so I'm gonna paste in the code so we
have our standard comments and version
info and we have this function now or
method whatever you want to call it of
mod underscore featured articles helper
okay so what this does is it's going to
get get the actual articles for us it's
going to deal with the database and
bring this back to the controller and
then we can display in the view how we
want so and if we go back to mod
featured articles PHP you can see this
rows variable is being assigned to the
featured helper featured articles helper
get Rose method and that is this right
here so it's the featured articles
helper get Rose method it's all being
assigned to that Rose variable now what
this does is the first thing it does is
it gets it creates a database instance
or a database object with this standard
J factory get dbo method so that gives
us a database instance to work with now
this next section is the query what this
this is just building up the query this
isn't this isn't submitting it yet or or
running it we're just putting it into
this variable and what it's doing is
selecting all this this asterisk means
all it's getting everything from the
content table now this this hash tag and
then these two underscores this
represents the the prefix of your table
so if we could go and we can look at the
table of our Joomla site I have the
prefix as Jos but your Joomla site might
have something different so this here
just replaces
that's what that is so we're selecting
all from content which I can actually
show you is right here okay this is the
Joss content tate table so it's
selecting all which means ID at asset ID
title alias everything okay and we're
doing it we're featured is a one so if
we go here we'll see we should have a
featured um
column which is right here so if you
make an article featured in Joomla this
turns into a one like right here this
article if we can scroll over it is the
article called beginners so that is
actually a featured article so that's
that's one of the Articles that were
grabbing and then the limit we're
setting to whatever we put for our art
count parameter which we can see is
right here we have five so really it's
saying limit to five and you can't
you'll be able to change that within
module manager the next thing it's doing
is actually running it so we have the DB
instance and then we're calling the set
query method onto our actual query and
then we're loading it as an object right
here into the variable rows okay so this
is how you would load your query into an
object load object list and here this
lets us get the article links so we're
actually assigning the links to role
link and we do this this Ju RI root just
means to get it from the root of the
site of the Joomla site and then we're
using the content helper route to get
the actual the links because I don't
know if you you've seen the Joomla links
but it's like index dot PHP option
equals whatever component
and then ID equals whatever the idea is
and that's what it's getting for us here
so now we're returning everything that's
in the Rose variable okay
and then we're actually putting that
into this Rose variable alright so now
what we want to do is deal with the view
file so that is that is in the TMP el
folder and the default dot PHP so I'm
going to copy and paste the code from
here so again we have this J exact line
so people can't just access this file
directly and the next we have a div with
a class this class is class is going to
be the module class suffix that we
define in the module manager
so that can be whatever we want and we
can separate this module different than
other modules and then we have a for
each statement and a for each what it
does is it loops through an array and
allows us to work with each each
instance of that array which in this
case will be a featured article and
we're using this Rose variable once
again if we go to our entry point the
Rose is grabbing all the rows from the
helper which is grabbing it from the
database so it's basically saying for
each featured article we're going to do
this we're going to have a div and it's
we just have some styling here just for
physical presentation we don't need this
but it's just to make it look nice we're
putting the the title because we can now
use dynamic fields we can use row to row
whatever we want so if we go here we
could use row ID we could use row title
like we are we could get the intro text
we could basically get anything from the
articles we need
using that row variable so we're gonna
have the title and it's going to be in
this h4 tag now the title is going to be
a link so you see this a tag and we're
styling it and then the href is pointing
to this row link which is going to give
us that the article on that instance is
it's going to give us the link and you
saw that in the help file so next we're
going to say we have a conditional
saying if show text is equal to 1 then
that means they want to show the intro
text so they're going to do that here
else if they don't want to show the
intro text wait I'm sorry
well we don't have an else for that so
if show text equals one it'll show the
intro text if it doesn't then it won't
show it now here is where we echo out
the intro text we're going to also put
it undo another conditional here called
if word limit is not equal to zero so
that means if they put a limit on the
text on the intro text then it's going
to do this say they put 50 450 words
then it's going to call this function
limit words it's going to call that on
the intro text and the word limit will
be the parameter so it'll show what
however many words is in this word limit
now this is a good time to bring up this
functions file because this is where I
want to put this this limit words
function here this is this has nothing
to do with Joomla it's just a function
that I created so we can limit the the
words so when the functions file we're
just going to have this function called
limit words and what it does is it just
basically if you know PHP then you can
see what it does but what it does
basically is just limits an amount of
text to a certain number of words
all right so save that so if the word
limit was if the person wants a word
limit then it's going to do this if they
don't if they leave it at zero and it's
just going to show everything so it's
just going to echo the intro text right
out and here we have if the read more is
equal to one if they want to shoot if
they want to show the read more then we
have this link to this read more text
and you can see it's the roll link just
like in the title we use the same thing
this roll link
and then that's it and we should be good
to go I'm gonna save this so we should
be able to actually package this up so
we want to just grab everything there
and put it into a zip file so we have
this mod featured articles zip okay so
I'm gonna actually put that on my
desktop and we're gonna go to Joomla to
our admin area log in and get the
extension install and we're gonna grab
that file on the desktop the mod mod
featured articles and upload and you can
see it's was installed successfully the
description is here so we should be able
to go to module manager and our featured
articles module is here and you can see
it has all the parameters and the
defaults I'm gonna choose to put this in
the position seven which is the left
hand position I'm gonna publish it and
put it on all pages and we'll just leave
this as the margin class suffix we'll
just leave this five articles show intro
text 25 25 words and show read more so
if I save this and then we visit the
front-end and reload and here it is it's
showing us five featured articles and if
you click on the lip on the axis
forbidden
all right so that's something we have to
troubleshoot real quick but you know
what we are running out of time so I'm
going to stop it here and I guess we
will have a third part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
