crash course this is going to be similar
to my bootstrap and foundation crash
course where we go through and we look
at the framework and we basically
manually type out the elements and
really look at the class names and study
you know what's available with this
framework so materialized CSS is
basically like a responsive front-end
framework like bootstrap and it's based
off of Google's material design which is
a whole new can of worms in itself it's
not something that we're going to really
get into there's there's certain
principles and guidelines that are used
it was created back in 2014 I believe
and it's what Google is trying to use
for all their UI is all their user
interfaces and elements and stuff so
we're not going to get too much into
that that's that's something that I'll
bring up in a later video but we're
going to really just dive into this
materialized CSS I really like it I like
the look of it I think it looks a little
better than bootstrap and it has some
really cool components so that's what
we're going to be doing in this video
there may it may be a two-parter because
I do also want to look at the JavaScript
widgets but I don't think I'll be able
to fit all of that into this video so
that's what we're going to be doing
let's go ahead and get started
this video is sponsored by dev Mountain
if you're interested in learning web
development iOS or UX design dev
Mountain is a 12-week design and
development boot camp intended to get
you a full-time job in the industry to
learn more visit dev mountain comm or
click the link in the description below
alright guys they went ahead and shut
the minicam off because it was getting
is getting in the way of some of the
markups so we're just going to do
without it for this video now this is
the documentation or the official
website materialized CSS calm and if we
go to get started this is going to tell
us how we can set up materialized now
you can do a few different things you
can build from source so you can use
sass and all that but that gets kind of
complicated and I want this to be more
about the actual look and design not so
much you know compiling code and
in working with it inside of a real
production project so we're just going
to use the CDN here to include it now if
we scroll down a little more you'll see
that there's an HTML setup area that
gives you you know the head body tags
all that it brings in material icons
which is kind of like font awesome they
have their own set of icons so what
we're going to do is just copy this
whole thing right here and then I'm
going to go into my text editor I'm
using atom and I have a folder called
materialized sandbox and then just one
index.html file that's all we're going
to need for this video and we're just
going to paste that in like that alright
now this here is actually including
materialized from a CSS folder and I
don't want to do that we're going to use
the CDN
same thing with the JavaScript down here
so let's go back to that page and we're
going to go up to where it says CDN it's
for content delivery network it's
basically just just a remote version of
the file so let's grab that and we're
going to go and paste that in right here
we're going to replace this okay and
we're going to also do that for the
JavaScript which is available right here
all right you'll need this JavaScript
file for any of the widgets which we'll
probably get to in a different video all
right but we just want to put that here
and it actually depends on jQuery as
well so that's why they have the jQuery
CDN right here now like I said or at
least I think I said this isn't going to
be an actual template like a like a real
project it's going to be a sandbox where
we look at the different aspects of
different classes all that stuff this is
actually my second time trying to make
this video because initially I typed
everything out manually by hand and it
just took way too long so I will do
mostly typing but for the stuff that's
really long I'll do I'm going to be
doing copying and paste and then I'll
just kind of explain it alright so I
just don't want this to be too too long
now I'm using atom live server to view
my index.html file on my local host but
of course you can just open it up in
your browser but I'm going to go ahead
and go Adam live server start server and
if you want to install this it's the one
by Jaz Chen which you
look up in the settings all right so
that's running and if we look at do a
control you you see all of our source
code let's go ahead and go back to our
editor here and I'm just going to add a
title in the head real quick so it's a
title and I'll just say materialize
sandbox okay and in the body here we're
first going to put a div with the class
of container
okay I'm using Emmet you'll see if I do
div dot container and then tab it's
going to give us a class of container if
I put a number sign container it would
give us an ID okay I would highly
suggest Emmet for for faster coding all
right now a container is going to do the
same thing as it wouldn't bootstrap it's
just going to kind of push everything
into the middle out of margin auto make
it responsive and so on all right now
first thing we're going to start with is
going to be colors so let's put it in
each one here and I just want to
describe each area that we're going to
do so for the colors we're going to use
a div and I'm going to give this a class
of red okay now these color classes can
go on anything it doesn't have to be a
div you can add it to a button
absolutely anything okay but for now
this is going to be a div with color
class all right and if we save that and
we go to our browser you'll see we have
the div with color class and as this red
background that spans across the whole
thing all right now if you have let's
say a color that's that's dark and you
want to change the text color you can
easily do that as well all right so to
do that let's go ahead and say white
dash text all right if we save that and
take a look you'll see now the text is
white it doesn't have to be white or
black it can be absolutely any color
okay now as far as the colors that are
available if you go to CSS color and go
down here you'll see all the different
you see the color palettes not only can
you use a bunch of different colors but
you can also lighten them and you can
darken them okay so for instance we can
do lighten one through lightening five
one being a darker five being the
lighter okay we can also do dark
so let's go ahead and try that where are
we I'm just going to copy this let's do
a couple more divs here so that's red
student let's make this one blue and
we'll make this one deep purple okay
have a wide range of colors so let's
just see what that looks like all right
so that's what it looks like let's say
we want this purple to be a little
lighter so we can go back and we can
attach a class called lighten and let's
do lighten three and let's also change
the color of the text we'll say blue
text okay if we go look here now we have
a light purple background with some blue
text and in addition to lighten of
course we can do darken so let's say
this blue we want to darken will do
darken to and save that and now you can
see that blue is a little darker alright
so I'm not going to spend too much time
on this we're going to use color classes
as when as we go but let's now take a
look at buttons alright I'm just going
to put a label here I want this to be
kind of a good reference for you guys to
be able to go back to alright so let's
see let's put in a button and we're
going to give it a class of BTN okay and
then here we'll just say read more for
the text let's see what that looks like
so this is your standard button and you
can see it has a very material design
you look at it kind of comes off the
page a little bit has the shadow very
clean this is the the kind of the style
that Google's going for with this
material design and you'll see that
throughout this video now another cool
thing that we can do is we can add a
click effects to our buttons so right
now if we click this or if we hover over
it it's just a standard button no
special effect but if we go and we add
to it so let's just copy this and put
another one in and then we're going to
add to the class we're going to add
waves
- effect and let's see what that does
so now when I click it you'll see that
we get this kind of wave effect now
what's really nice is when we click in
the middle you'll see it kind of shoots
outward if I click over here goes to the
left if I go over here goes to the right
so it depends on where you click it as
to the effect that it's going to give
you which is really cool all right we
also have a wave Lite class we can use
and check that out and you see that it's
just I guess it's brighter seems to have
the same effect it's just a lighter a
lighter visibility okay we can also make
these buttons larger if we want so if I
were to grab this and we can paste in a
class called BTN - large and if we look
at that you'll see that it gets a lot
bigger we can also add a disabled class
so if we say disabled that's going to
gray the button out and make it so that
we can't use it all right now as far as
colors go what's really nice is we can
use absolutely any color we want we
don't have to stick to for instance
bootstrap has button primary button
success all that stuff we can just throw
a color in there so if I were to take
let's grab the large one and paste that
in and then just say red and take a look
you see now we have a red button we
don't need any special danger or alert
class or anything like that and not just
not only do we have access to the color
but we can also change the lighten or
darken so if we were to say excellence
to darken will say darken 3 and then
let's do white text actually I think it
was white text but you can do that as
well okay so what I'll do is just copy
see we'll just copy this and we'll put a
bunch of different colors in alright so
let's make this one blue make this one
green
purple say we can do black and it's do
yellow all right now we're yellows are
really light color and by default the
text is going to be white you may want
to do black text all right and of course
we can do lighten and darken and say
lighten too for the purple and take a
look and you can see all the different
colors colors we get and all the
different shades
all right so very very customizable now
we can also add icons to our buttons so
let's grab this large one here and four
icons all we'd have to do is go in here
and put an eye clasp or I'm sorry an eye
tag with a class of material - icons and
then we just want to put a clasp in here
to align it I'm going to line it to the
left and what's cool about this is
instead of putting the actual class for
the icon you just put it right in
between the tags so let's say we wanted
the cloud icon with something like font
awesome you would do like FA - cloud but
with summit it with this materialise you
can put the actual icon name inside of
the tag and it's not going to show up
the text won't show up the icon well so
if we go and we look you'll see now we
have that cloud icon let's actually
change the color of that button as well
so we'll change it to say Brown alright
so now we're going to look at our
floating buttons so let me see I'm just
going to add a comment here just to tell
us that this is the container closing
because I don't want to go outside of it
alright and then let's put C I'm going
to put a comment and let's say floating
button
I don't want to overwhelm the page with
h1 so I'll just put a comment for now
and we're going to put an a tag here and
we're going to give this a class of BTN
- floating and I'm also going to make it
red and let's also make it large all
right we'll just put a number sign in
there
and see inside here we're not going to
put text we're going to put an icon so
let's say I and I'm going to give this a
class of large and also material icons
and for the icon itself
let's do ad which will be a plus sign
alright if we go back this is it right
here this is the floating button okay
which looks kind of cool now we can also
do a fixed action button which is really
nice we can take one of these and float
it like for instance down here and then
we can actually hover over it we can
have other buttons up here so let me
show you what I mean and this is
something that you don't see with with
something like bootstrap so you'll say
fixed action button and this is actually
going to be a div and I'm going to give
this a class of fixed - action - BTN and
then in here we'll put a floating button
just like we did here I'll actually take
this same one except I'm going to change
the name of it of the icon - mode
underscore edit so this would be good
for something like a UI for a blog post
back end where you have options to you
know publish the post or edit or attach
a file things like that so underneath
this we're going to put a ul and let's
put an li with an a tag and we'll give
this a class of BTN actually we'll just
take one of these we'll take this
floating button and just put it right in
there
okay and we're just going to change the
color I'm going to change it to yellow
and then change the icon from add to
insert chart and you can get all these
icon names on in the documentation all
right and then we'll copy that paste in
a couple more so for this one let's make
it blue and let's give this the icon of
format underscore quote okay this one
will make green and for the icon let's
do publish which is like a pencil or
something I think and then for this one
let's do red or let's do orange and for
the icons to attach file alright and
let's save and see what we get with this
okay so down here you see the pencil
icon if I go when I hover over it look
at that that is pretty cool alright now
in addition to these buttons we have
flat buttons so say let's go back here
and all right here put a comment we'll
say flat button and that's going to be
an a tag and we'll give it a class of
waves effect let's give it a class of
waves
- teal and let's give it a class of BTN
- flat and we'll just say button all
right so what that does it gives us a
button that doesn't have a background
initially but when we go and hover over
it we get that gray background that
fades in okay so very clean-looking so
that's going to be it for button so
let's move on to look at some helper
classes
okay helper classes have to do with
things like alignment
you know displaying and hiding content
things like that so we're going to go
right here and let's put in h1 and we'll
say helpers
and first we'll look at some alignment
classes okay so I would see we're going
to put a div here and then in the div
let's put an h5 and I'm going to give
this a class of left-aligned and here
let's just say this aligns to the left
and then we'll just copy this and we're
going to do a write and let's do a
center align as well okay we can take a
look at that
and there we go so we have left center
and right so pretty easy we also have
quick flow classes so let's do it did
let's give it a class of left will say
left float and as you probably guessed
we can do right float as well okay and
then when you do this when you do a
right or left flow you want to clear it
okay so it actually uses the same class
as bootstrap which is clear fix all
right so if we save that take a look and
you can see left flow right float now
we're starting to get to the bottom of
the page here and we're going to have to
scroll so what I'm going to do is put a
div that gives us a height of 500 pixels
just so you're not looking at the bottom
of the screen so let's see we're going
to go under the container here and let's
do a div we'll give it a style
let's give it a style of height 500
pixels save that and that should push it
up a little bit there we go alright so
let's see the next thing we're going to
look at our classes to hide content
based on how big the screen is or what
device you're on so let's go under the
clear and let's say hide content so
first we have a div with the class of
hide and say hidden for all devices so
if we go and we try to look at this
we're not going to see it because it's
hidden no matter what size of screen is
or what device you're on alright we also
have a div with the class of hide on
small only so hide on small only and
what this does is it's going to be
hidden for mobile devices okay small
screens only and then we have a bunch of
other ones too just to save a little
time I'm going to paste them in so hide
on med only is hidden for tablets only
we also have Medan down which is going
to be for tablets and smaller
Metin up which will be tablets and
higher and then on large only will be
hidden for desktop big screens so if we
save that and we go to our sandbox here
you can see all these all these divs
here and if I were to let's see let's
make this smaller now if I were to bring
this down to a tablet size you'll see it
changes so now this is hidden for our
mobile devices and desktops it's only
displayed these are only displaying for
tablets if we go down to mobile you'll
see hidden for tablets hidden for
tablets and higher and hidden for
desktops all right so it's really handy
to be able to show and hide things based
on what device the users using because
you may have a lot of content squished
into one place but if you're on a mobile
screen you're not going to want to show
all that because it's going to be really
crammed in
all right so that can be very helpful
another thing we can do is truncate text
so let's say we have a paragraph and
just going to put some dummy text in if
you're using atom you can type in larom
tab and it will give you all this sample
content and if we were to look at this
as is you can see we have actually you
know what let's make this uh let's do it
h4 it can be on any element okay so we
have three lines of h4 now let's say we
wanted to truncate this we can do class
truncate and now if we look at it it's
only one line okay so it's going to
truncate it down to one line and then
just put these these dots at the end and
this is really good for things like
blogs where you want to just show just a
portion of the article or the blogpost
until they click on a button and then
that takes them to the rest okay we also
have some effects we can do let me just
put a comment here alright so let's look
at some effects now these can be used on
any element but I'm going to use a div
so first we have hover Abul so let's put
a div and let's see we're going to make
it red and just give it white text and
then we're going to put a class of hover
ball alright and if we look at that
you'll see if I go over it it kind of
gets this shadow and kind of pucks off
the page and you can put that on
anything you can put that on a button or
whatever we also have one called pulse
so I'm going to just copy that and
change this to pulse we'll make this
blue and say pulse content and then
change the class of hover ball to pulse
and now if I save that we go back oh 10
what happened oh it should be
hello and it's you see that's going to
pulse on its own I don't even have to do
anything to it now this doesn't look
very good but if you were to put this on
a button that let's say you want it to
drive a user's attention to maybe a Buy
Now button or something you could do
that all right I don't want that to keep
going so I'm just going to put a
underscore before the pulse next thing
we'll look at is shadows okay material
design has has kind of a lot of shadows
and it's elements and it's basically
five different depths we can do so let's
say we want class and let's do C - depth
- one we'll do the same thing here and
we'll save that and now if we take a
look you'll see that this div is now has
a shadow behind it okay with the depth
of one now we can actually do one
through five so I'm going to copy that
two three four five and we'll just
change these up and it just changed it
changes the different level of the
shadow depth all right so you can see
that this one has just a little and then
this one down here is a lot all right
and we can change the color of one of
these if we wanted to say red and you
can see it still as the shadow all right
another thing we have is flow text okay
so with flow text let's just put a
paragraph here and let's say lorem tab
now what this does is it does a couple
things it makes the text more prominent
it makes it bigger if we were to look at
this now you'll see it just looks like
that but if we add the class of flow
text and then look at it you'll see that
it gets much bigger and prominent not
only that it makes it very responsive
you'll see if I go smaller the text the
font will actually change okay you can
see the fonts getting smaller as I move
the screen down which is really nice
okay and I just think that some of these
things are really cool they're not
common with with you know
some of the other frameworks let's see
now we're going to look at some stuff
with images
okay responsive images so let's put in
an image tag and let's do I'm just going
to grab a link to an image here just a
sample image and paste it in and see we
have a class of responsive image that's
actually what we want so let's save it
take a look and you'll see we have this
image and if I start to move this screen
down it's very responsive okay it'll
shrink with the page so whether you're
on mobile view or whatever it's going to
look good
another thing we can do is we can make
images circular just by adding a class
of circle okay which is this common in
frameworks just we have we have that in
bootstrap as well but just another nice
little feature all right now we're going
to get into navigation so for navigation
I want to go outside of the container
because I want it to go across the whole
screen and let's see I'm going to start
to paste some stuff in just to save some
time so this is a very simple navigation
we have a nav tag it has a wrapper and
with these nav navigation menus we can
make them whatever color we want
okay another great thing about this
framework we can just make any element
we want any color we're not stuck with
you know doc or light so that's really
nice and then we have the logo okay with
it which is an a tag with the class of
brand logo and then we have the UL with
the class of nav mobile and then we're
aligning it to the right and we want it
to be hidden on medium and down so what
this will do is it'll hide this when
you're on a tablet or smaller okay
because it's going to get in the way and
I'll show you how to create a
collapsible menu in a minute but let's
take a look at this I'm actually going
to put a couple line breaks after each
menu okay and if we look at that you'll
see that we have the logo aligned to the
to the right and I'm sorry the left and
then the UL on the right okay so another
thing we could do is align the logo to
the right
and the UL to the left so to do that
let's just let's just copy this all
right and then this will be right logo
so we can just add a class of right and
then change this one to left let's
change the color to red and there we go
now if I go smaller you see the UL
disappears okay makes it responsive now
what sucks is we can't see those links
at all on mobile devices and like I said
I'll show you how to fix that in a
second
but we can also we can also Center the
logo let's copy that
and let's say send our logo so we can
just add in here Center and then we can
keep the the UL on the left let's go
ahead and take a look at that actually
we'll make that green and there we go so
now we have a centered logo now for the
drop down let's go ahead and do that so
what I'm going to do is first paste in
the nav
okay now you can see it's the same same
thing we have a div with nav with the
div with the nav wrapper the brand the
UL but if you look at this link right
this Li right here this a tag has a
class of drop-down button and then it
has a special attribute of data
activates so what it's going to do is
it's going to look for a ul with this ID
and use that as the drop-down so what
I'll do is just paste this in right
above the nav just like that and you can
see that the UL has an ID of drop-down
one just like this okay so this is going
to bring down this menu and it just has
a class of drop-down content which hides
it initially okay until you actually you
know click on the drop-down you can also
add dividers like this so to take a look
at that and you have a dropdown if I
click it we get this nice little
drop-down
alright pretty simple let's see we can
also put icons and buttons in our
navigation so so you just put some line
breaks and I'm going to just grab this
real quick paste that in okay so we just
have actually we don't need this title
here so for this same thing ul logo
we're just using an eye tag in here
instead of an instead of some text and
see we have a button here or a link
formatted as a button so let's take a
look at that okay and that's what it's
going to look like we have to look we
have the icon we can do an icon with
text and we can do a button okay all
very easily okay let's look at the
search bar if we want to put a search
bar you can see when I first did this
video I typed all of this out and it
just took forever would have been about
two hours long so search bar we have our
nav wrapper we have our form inside the
nav wrapper with an input field which
has an input or div with the class of
input field input label and then a close
button alright if we look at that you
can see we have a nice-looking search
bar okay we can close it goes back to
being read I'm just going to take that
h1 oh we don't need that and then the
last thing I'm going to show you to do
with the menus is the collapsible the
mobile collapsible menu alright because
if you want this to be responsive so
that people can actually go to your
links even if they're on a mobile device
so let's paste that in alright so
basically all we added to this was this
right here this a tag it has data
activates mobile demo has a class of
button collapse we have an icon a menu
icon and then we have the UL inside
there so you're going to have two sets
of menus here all right so let's see
what that looks like so this is what it
looks like now if I go down if I make
this smaller you'll see we have this
button click that lets
why isn't that working when the hell
isn't that working did I include the
JavaScript yeah oh you know what we have
to initialize it that's right we have to
initialize it in the JavaScript so if we
go to let's see components where is it
navbar and let's see right here
initialization so we just need to throw
this in the JavaScript so let's grab
that we'll go down here and let's put in
some script tags and just paste that in
alright that should work hopefully
reload and it's going onto our menu
there we go so we get this cool side bar
that opens which I actually like better
than the actual drop-down all right so
that's enough for the navs you can see
we have a lot of different options here
and that's not even all of them but the
next thing we're going to look at our
lists which are actually called
collections in materialized okay they're
called list groups in bootstrap so I
want to open up another container after
all these Navs
so say div class container and let's do
collection slash list
alright I'm actually going to put an h1
here as well collections list alright so
basically we just want a ul and we want
to give it a class of collection and
then inside there we're going to have
allies that are going to have a class of
collection - item ok I will just say
item 1 and then we'll copy that
and I'll put a couple more say item two
three and four all right let's see what
that looks like okay so this is what the
collection looks like very similar to a
list group in bootstrap now if we want
to do links let's say we wanted it to be
a menu then we could have a div with the
class of collection and then we could
have a tags inside with a class of
collection item okay so here let's say
this would be link one and we could do
link two three and four all right so now
we have links and you'll see when I
hover over one it gets that darker
background okay we can also use
collections with headers so for instance
let's copy this UL right here let me
just put a comment here say link
all right and then this will be with
header so we can just add to this ul
right here we can add a class called
width - header and then what we would do
is we would make the first one right
here we would make this the header by
putting in let's say an h4 and say
header all right and then we'll change
that to one two and three okay and then
that's what it would look like so this
is the header another thing we could do
is an icon list now this is actually a
lot of markup so I'm going to paste this
in so let's go right here
let me just tab that over all right so
this would be an icon collection UL with
the class of collection same thing
Allies have a class of collection item
also Avatar and then what I did is I put
an icon here so that's a image of a
folder or an icon of a folder it has a
span with the title and then it has a
paragraph and then a link so let's see
what this looks like okay so kind of
looks like a like a mobile list like
something you'd see on a mobile app okay
so that's going to be it for the
collections next thing we're going to
look at is pagination
so let's actually put an h1 here we'll
say pagination okay so we'll have a ul
with the class of pagination and then
each Li we're going to give a class of
ways - effect all right now let's see
a season now usually your yeah one of
these would be disabled for instance if
we're on page one the previous button is
going to be disabled so let's go right
here and let's say Li class disabled and
we'll have a link in here so we'll say a
and let's say no class here oops
alright and then that would be lets say
an icon so i dot class material icons
and then let's make this a chevron -
left or underscore left alright so that
that's like the previous link alright
and then you can make one of these
active so for instance this one here
let's give this actually let's go right
above it and we'll stay Li with the
class of active and put a link in here
and let's put a one and then we'll do
two three four five six see what that
looks like so far okay so I'll see these
actually don't have links in them that's
why it looks funny
all right so that looks pretty cool and
we probably want a next one as well just
like we did with this one with the
previous so go ahead and paste that in
and we'll change it to a chevron right
and it's not make this one disabled
we'll do the waves effect all right and
there we go get some pagination so we
also have bread crumbs let's go down
here and put another h1c breadcrumbs
bread crumbs kind of give you a like a
directory structure of pages shows your
parent and child pages and so on so that
would be a nav and in here we'd have a
div with the class of nav wrapper just
like the navigation menus do and then
let's do div and I'm going to use a grid
system class here I'm going to say call
and then s12 oops should be dot s12 and
then in here let's put a link with the
class of bread crumb and then this will
be let's say first and we'll have first
second and third all right let's take a
look at that and there we go there's a
bread crumb all right so the next thing
we're going to look at our cards now the
cards actually have a lot of markup so
I'm going to do some copying and pasting
hopefully that doesn't really bother you
guys
so let me just grab this real quick all
right so these cards they have I mean
they can be very basic with just you
know some text with a border or they can
have headers and footers and links and
all kinds of stuff so this has a class
of card and you can give it a color
class if you want this one is blue grey
it's darkened and then inside the card
class we can have a card content class
which of course you can add classes to
and then here we have the card title to
the span with the class of card title it
has a floating button here and it has an
icon well that's inside the button or
the link and then we have some text and
then we have this card action which is
where we can put some links so let me
show you what that looks like okay so
looks pretty nice and see this is the
floating button right here kind of hangs
down here and then we have our links
okay we also have image cards so let me
just grab that real quick let me just
put a comment right here because this is
the container
all right so paste this in this is an
image card which basically just has an
image and then the title and then the
content and then the actions so let's
look at that okay that looks pretty nice
as well I mean I think this stuff looks
better than bootstrap is it a little
more complicated as far as the mark-up
it's yeah a little bit but I mean that's
you know this stuff is pretty quick
you'll learn it pretty quick we also
have horizontal cards see what that
looks like okay so we just have an h2
with the class of header we have the
card class and we just added this
horizontal we have the in image and we
have this card stacked class with a card
content div and then our actions at the
bottom okay and that's what it looks
like it has the image on the side
instead of on the top so pretty nice and
then we have card panels by the way this
stuff is all in the documentation so
don't worry about remembering this but I
figured that this document will be nice
for you to have if you want to just
throw any of this stuff in your site all
right so a card panel is pretty simple
it just has a class of card panel we can
add a color to it if we want and then we
just have some content in here so let's
look at that all right which is similar
to a well in in bootstrap 3 bootstrap
for actually uses cards and it's very
similar to this as far as the markup
goes we also have something called chips
which are kind of like tags when you see
of like a blog post and you have a bunch
of tags at the bottom this is similar to
that so we have a div with the class of
chip we have whatever text you're going
to put in and then just an icon to close
the tag all right or the chip okay so
that's what it looks like and you'll
notice if I actually click the X it goes
away so pretty nice so now we're going
to get into the forms okay and formed
this one I'm not going to copy and paste
because it's actually something that
you'd probably use quite a bit alright
let's put in h1 as well
alrightso performs let's open up a form
tag okay we don't need an action we're
not actually submitting it and we're
going to have a div and this is going to
have a class of input field and if
you're used to bootstrap you can kind of
think of this as form group
okay the class of form group and then
we're going to put an input and let's
give this an ID of we'll say name and
then we're going to put in a label and
let's say for name and then name okay
I'm also going to give this a class of
active all right so that's one field
let's take a look at that so this is
what the forms look like with
materialized and I think they look
pretty nice and what's pretty cool is
when you click in here you'll see the
delay will actually shrinks up and this
thing changes color so okay I don't know
I like that effect it looks better than
just having you know the white input box
so what I'll do is copy this and let's
put another field in here and we'll make
this ID email and let's make this type
email as well okay it will change that
and change the floor to email so what's
nice about this is we can actually add a
class to our input here and we can call
we can add the class validate and then
if we go back to our form and you know
we put in our name whatever we put in
email and if we don't enter actual email
address and we try to click out you'll
see that it gets this red line it's
actually it had some built in you know
client-side form validation which is
pretty cool and obviously if I put a
real email in there then it lets us okay
turns green let's see what else put a
text area so this will be let's say
we'll just say ID text area and this is
not going to be an input text area which
also has a closing tag from the label
will just say text area okay you can
take a look at that oh you know what
this should actually have an extra class
materialise - text area there we go and
you'll see we can actually do multiple
lines and as we make this you know more
lines it gets pushed down so some some
nice effects with this with the
materialized forms alright so another
thing we have is pre loaders which are
kind of like progress bars in bootstrap
so let's actually put an h1 here and
we'll say free loaders okay so we're
going to have a div and give it a class
of progress and then in here we're going
to have a div with the class of
determinants determine it like that okay
and then we can give this a diol
property and then give it a width of a
percentage and that will be you know how
how filled the progress bar is so let's
say style and set this to oops we'll set
this to width and set that to 70% all
right so let's see what that gives us
and there we go so you can see it's
filled 70 percent if I were to change
this to let's say 40 percent you'll see
that now it's only 40 percent now we can
also grab this and then we'll paste that
in and change this to indeterminate and
then take away the width here or the
style and what that'll give us is
something like this so it has a little
animation to it now we also have
circular pre loaders
which they have a little bit more markup
so what I'll do is just copy it and
paste it in okay so this is a circular
preloader you can see it has a
pre-loaded wrapper we're giving this one
a class of big and active then we have a
spinner layer we can change the color of
the spinner and then we have some other
classes in here so let's see what that
gives us all right so that gives you
kind of the spinner graphic which is
pretty cool all right now I want to get
into something that's very important and
that's the grid system okay whenever you
learn a framework the grid system is
very important and they're pretty easy
especially this one this is pretty easy
to use so let's go ahead and go down
here still above the container and let's
put an h1 and we'll say grid system all
right so let's create a div here I'm
going to give it a class of row you guys
have seen that before if you're familiar
with bootstrap or pretty much any
framework with a grid and then the way
that we do this is we'll have a div with
the class of call and then also the
class of let's say s1 so that's going to
be a one column row alright and then in
here I'm just going to put a card so
that I can give it a background so let's
say div and we'll give it a class of
card panel and it's also give it a class
of gray okay and then I'll just put a
one in here so this is a one column div
and it's a twelve it's twelve column
base so we're going to go ahead and copy
this and we're going to paste it in
eleven more times so one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven so
there's twelve of them alright we're
just going to change the number here
9 10 11 and 12 so let's let's take a
look at that okay so you can see that we
have one column divs
12 across so the class names pretty easy
we just need call and then s and that
the number of the number of rows that
it's going to take up okay are the
number of columns so let's do another
one under it will do div with the class
of row and let's do let's do an eight
column and a four column that's pretty
common you know if you have a main area
and then you have a sidebar so we'll say
div and we'll give this a call class of
call and also s eight okay and I'm just
going to grab one of these cards and
this is actually going to be what eight
columns so I'll grab this and then let's
do a for call so for four okay and if we
take a look at that you'll see that we
have them basically the main area in the
sidebar okay let's do well let's do
three for column dibs so I'm just going
to copy this and then we'll just change
that to four four and then we'll paste
in one more okay as long as it equals
twelve and there we go
okay and you can do any combination that
you want now we can also offset columns
so let's go right here and we'll say
offsetting so I'm going to do a div with
the class of row and in this row let's
do div with the class of call and s12
and see we'll just grab one of these
panels okay so this right here will say
this this div is twelve columns
and then under it let's actually just
copy it and then under it we're going to
put a six column div so we'll change
that to six and I want this to be offset
by six so it should be pushed over so
all we have to do is add in offset dash
S six alright and we'll say this this
div is six columns offset by six so if
we look at that there we go so it's a
six column div but it's offset the six
columns right here all right and
obviously you can do any ratio that you
want we can also change the order with
push and pull which is kind of nice so
if we have a row and inside here we have
let's say call s7 we'll just do that and
then let's grab one of these panels will
say this div is seven calls wide and
then let's see we'll grab this again and
then this one's going to be s5 we'll say
this is five columns wide so let's take
a look at that so we have seven column
and five column now let's say we want
these to be we want to switch these but
we don't want to change the mark-up we
just want to change up the classes to
switch them so we can use push and pull
all right so for this one for the seven
column we're going to do push - s5 and
then for this one we're going to do pull
which is going to go the other way
s7 okay and then if we go and reload now
you'll see the five is over here and the
seven is over here so we've switched it
okay much like flexbox ordering alright
so I think that's going to be it guys so
you can see this this looks pretty nice
all this stuff if you can build a nice
UI with
this framework it's pretty nice I
personally think it looks a little
better than bootstrap and it looks a
little more unique so if you guys want
to use this I will be doing a video
actually building either a UI or website
using materialized I may also do a part
two where we look at the JavaScript
widgets because you haven't even gotten
into that there's sliders there's
collapse collapse menus there's modal's
there's all types of that is
available with JavaScript as well and
it's pretty easy so be on the lookout
for that I'll try and you know see what
I can do about that but thanks for
watching guys especially if you've stuck
through this long I know this was kind
of a long video hopefully this this
cheat sheet or sandbox whatever you want
to call it helps you in the future and
you can look back to it and you can pick
and choose things you want to use
alright thanks for watching please
subscribe and I will see you in the next
