show you how to convert a static HTML
template into a wordpress theme and the
template we're going to be using is from
free CSS templates org
it's called escalate and it's a very
simple clean template we just basically
have a logo area a navigation bar we
have a main post area with these are
just static HTML posts with a title a
metadata info and an image in the text
so obviously we'll be converting this to
WordPress and we'll have a sidebar
widget area as well and then the footer
is just a simple text footer all right
so I have a default WordPress
installation on my localhost and this is
where we'll be developing this is where
we can actually see the results of the
theme okay so you can use any text
editor you want I'm going to be using
sublime text to I'm going to create a
new project so that we don't have to
keep going to Windows Explorer so let's
see if you're using sublime text - you
want to do add folded a project and this
is in my sea
go to my htdocs folder which is in my
dropbox and wordpress okay so this is
just making it so I can connect to my to
the WordPress to the site right here
alright so what we need to do is inside
of WP / con timing - content in the
themes directory you want to create a
new theme okay so I'm going to say new
folder and this is called what escalade
alright so now we have our escalate
theme okay we need to add a couple
crucial files to this to this directory
so the first thing we're going to do is
create a a style sheet so we're going to
save this inside the escalade folder as
style dot CSS
okay and we also need a folder called
header.php
okay we also need a file called footer
dot PHP
we need a file called index.php
and let's see you file the page dot php'
we need
let's see functions.php this is well
store all our functions and page dot PHP
is basically single pages let's see we
also need a file called single dot PHP
and this is for the single blog post
when you click on a title or the read
more button and it takes you to that
post
that's single PHP I think that's it we
also need a sidebar okay so don't let
all the files overwhelm you I'm going to
go through each one so you sidebar dot
PHP and that should do it for now
alright so the first thing we need to do
is we need to write a few crucial
comments in style dot CSS where it press
uses this for the theme name and just to
connect to the theme and we can go to
wordpress.org and they should have a
snippet so let me just search for style
dot CSS snippet I don't know if that's
going to work
let's see directory code snippet
um let's see
let's go to the documentation I'm not
exactly sure where it is
see theme development
yeah here it is all right so I'm just
going to copy this
and put that in here and you don't need
to have all of these let's see we want a
theme name
so the theme name is escalate you want
to put your theme URI so this would
basically just be our website
alright so the author name
author URL for the same one
description this is a simple and clean
WordPress theme license will keep as
general public
keep that tags you can have tags don't
need that if a text domain we're going
to put the name of the theme file which
is escalate okay we'll get rid of this
all right so that should do it
now all of our main CSS will go in this
file as well so let's save that now we
need to get the this dhtml theme files
or template files so I'm actually going
to open a new window so we can look at
that code as well so new window make
this a little smaller and I'm going to
add fold it to project and I just want
that HTML
folder so this is the actual HTML file
so let me just open up we basically only
have the index file and this in the CSS
file now what we need to do is is grab
the header code and let's say you want
just going to take a second to look at
this and figure out what we need to take
out input in the header file we're going
to want the top of the document down to
let's see where this wrapper ends right
here so that's the wrapper end so we'll
probably
header wrapper okay so we want that the
menu we want in the header.php file see
page
where's that end
right there
okay page BG top content
see where that ends right there so you
can probably grab from the content all
right
yeah so let's grab from this content all
the way up we'll copy that paste that
into the header dot PHP file and I'm
just going to get rid of the comments
here
all right so header goes there all the
way down to the content div so let's
save that and we're going to be adding
dynamic code in here so that we can that
actually make it a wordpress theme
let's see now we want the footer content
so we don't want the post that's going
to go that's going to be in the main
index.php file let me have us actually
we have our sidebar
this is where the content ends so we're
actually going to grab from the ending
content div all the way down copy that
and put that in the footer
okay and we're going to have a separate
sidebar file so we'll grab from here let
me just see where this ends right here
okay so we'll just grab all this cut
that and this is where we want the
sidebar to be included so what we want
to do is say PHP get sidebar
okay
all right so we'll save that now let's
grab all the CSS okay I'm just going to
grab all of it copy and place that in to
right here
you just get rid of this
all right so our CSS file is complete
so we want to add some code to our
header all right we want IC we want to
get rid of the these static meta tags we
can keep the con diem content type the
title we can actually use the blog info
API so PHP log info and this is title
okay so that what this will do is bring
in the dynamic title of whatever page
were viewing and as far as the okay so
this looks like we have we're using some
fonts from Google and then the style.css
we don't want to have that for the for
the href we're going to do PHP login fo
stylesheet URL
okay
um let's see that should be
that's good and under that we want to
add PHP WP underscore head and this will
bring in any other head content that
needs to be there all right so let's see
so the I mean the goal is just to take
out the static content and put in the
correct WordPress PHP code so for the
template this um logo or the title we
want to be this here okay which is that
I guess the site name and then we have
the slogan underneath so we're going to
replace this static content so we want
to say PHP blog info and you can look
all these api's up this blog info on the
WordPress documentation so this is going
to be the name so basically just the
name of the site that we can we can
change that inside of the WordPress
admin area same thing with the actually
we should probably do that before I
forget what what it actually is so in
the backend let's go to Settings General
and the site title and I change to
escalate and then I'm going to just grab
that grab
this and I'm going to take the link out
I don't think we can do that
so let me just get this link out
all right so save that
and now we want to replace the slogan
here with
I get will keep the paragraph tags in
the inside here let me just copy this
and this is going to be description
alright so that will grab that from the
wordpress set and the last thing we need
to do right now is replace the
navigation alright so we want I'm going
to delete this unordered list but to get
the dynamic navigation we want to do PHP
WP underscore nav underscore menu and
that will bring in the menu so I'll get
rid of this static one and we'll create
I don't know if we'll create these exact
pages but we'll create our pages after
okay so that looks pretty good
all right so I'm going to save that and
let's see what we can add to the footer
we have our call to our sidebar ah let's
see the footer here we could put a
widget here but I'm just going to I'm
just going to leave the text as it is
because we're not really going to change
this so footer is basically done for now
okay so header footer now we want to
deal with the index dot PHP and that's
basically the home page so we need to
create well first of all we want to call
in the header ah yeah so we'll say PHP
get header the index.php is basically
the Gateway to the home page so we want
the header and then we also want footer
now we're not going to say get sidebar
because we have that inside the floor
file right here alright so the header
footer save that
and let's just say test right here and I
want to actually install the template
and see if we can get it up and running
so you can see our results and see it as
we go along so what we need to do I'm
going to open up my wordpress folder
which is see
okay so this is my wordpress site and
we're going to go to content themes and
watch you yeah so we actually don't need
to look at that right now so let's go to
appearance themes and here we are we
have our escalate file we can include an
image of the template which we'll do
after I guess but let's go ahead and
activate this
all right so it's activated let's visit
the front-end and see what we got all
right so that looks pretty good we have
the dynamic site name we have the slogan
which is coming from here in the
settings and just to make sure let's
just change this to we'll say escalates
all right so that changes that and it
also changes the page title put it back
all right so we have one page here
called sample page I'm not sure what
will happen all right so our page dot
PHP file isn't set up yet so we're just
getting a blank screen so what we want
to do now is set up the index.php file
which right now only has this line test
aside from the header and the footer so
let's go to our header I'm sorry
index okay so here is what we want to we
want the main blog role all the feed I
guess and let's see we want to style it
a certain way well first we'll just put
the diet the code in there so that we
can make it dynamic all right so the
posts they run on a loop so we have to
create a while loop
all right so we'll say while have posts
which is a function the post and the
syntax here is just it's a little weird
to me but it's what's required I guess
you have to deal with it some of the
stuff I'm not really sure why it is the
way it is let's see
while host
I think that's right and then we want to
end that you can say PHP in while
all we want to have another parenthesis
here all right so that's the while loop
so everything we put in here is going to
iterate over each post so what I'm going
to do is create an estate article
well actually shoot this template is
XHTML I'm actually going to change this
to just HTML all right so now we're
using html5 that's fine
I actually get rid of this to just have
the HTML
all right so now we'll be able to use
html5 tags so back to the index page I'm
going to say article ID we want each
post to have its own ID so I'm going to
say ID post and then we want the ID so
we can say PHP the ID okay I think
that's right
so that'll attach this post - whatever
the number whatever the ID so that way
we can actually sit we can single out
certain posts if we want to from within
the feed and then after that we need to
say PHP post class
okay so that'll give it the classes that
it needs
okay so let's put in our ending article
tag okay so now what we want is we want
the title well actually now is where
we'll we can grab the the code from the
original HTML template so let me get
that let's take a look at that alright
so let's see we stopped
we stopped the header at
did we stop it page believes
no content all right content so let's
see under content let's grab this
div class post
just make sure
yeah so we'll just grab this first post
you know what let's not even use the
article yeah let's not even use the
article tag I don't know I usually put
that in there for my themes but I'm just
going to this is going to be just copied
so um that in
I don't want to add anything to the
template I just want to show you how to
convert an existing template alright so
the title ah if we leave it as that if
we leave it the way it is now it's just
going to show the static information
let's actually see that let's save that
and take a look
okay so there's just one post so it's
showing us the static content so let's
go ahead and change this
what
so for the title
we want
HP
I think it's just the title okay so if
we save that and look the title should
change okay so it changes to our post we
have one post we have the hello world
post okay so the title is now dynamic so
what else do we want to change here we
want to change let's actually
huh
so it looks like the actual text starts
from here and ends here
so we want to replace that will say PHP
the contents and inside we want the text
for the read more link which will just
call read more okay I think that's so
let's
I'm sorry I'm in the wrong I'm in the
original HTML let me just copy that and
put that back all right so
all right so this whole line is the post
all right so let's try that
this text should now be replaced with
our actual post
okay is that all that's in there really
Wow
it's actually direct grab some sample
content
this is just the alarm if some site you
can just grab just gobbledygook
just to make it look like a real post
okay update
all right so there's our text now for
the image so for the image we want to
replace
let's see where does that start right
here div class entry
okay I'm just going to replace the image
here with some dynamic code we're going
to say PHP the post thumbnail and we
want the full image
so that should
we didn't upload the image yet but I
just wanna
all right so let's go to the post and I
believe
believe if we upload the image just into
the post then they'll it'll show there
alright let me just try to upload that's
from the just want to open the theme
folder themes
escalate
oh we didn't we didn't bring over the
image all right so these are the images
I'm actually going to upload these two
images so I'm going to click Add media
select files Desktop HTML images and
we'll get this first picture and I'm
going to
down here for size I'm going to say full
size I'm going to insert into post and I
will Center it let's just see what
happens here
all right
actually you know what I don't that's
not we're all that's doing is showing
the picture in the actual post I want
the featured image which isn't available
because we need to add it to our
functions file so let me just update
that okay now let's go to our functions
dot PHP file and we want to add themed
support and this should be host
thumbnail so we need our PHP tags here
all right so let's save that and then if
we reload the Edit post page I guess we
don't get there
huh
we might have to enable it up here
vision tag slug comments
huh
not sure why that is not showing up for
us
I mean that should do it
functions are PHP let's make sure
host thumbnails oh I don't have my
quotes you need quotes around this sorry
about that so now if we reload
now we have our featured image so let's
select that J set featured image and
update hopefully this works
all right perfect
and we are running out of time here so
I'm going to stop the video here and
start the next one hi so next what we'll
do is make this this meta bar here
dynamic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
