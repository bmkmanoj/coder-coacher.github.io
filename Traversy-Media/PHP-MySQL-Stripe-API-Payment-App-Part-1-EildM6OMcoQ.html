learning edge wanax has a really
interesting course coming out that
focuses on building real-world projects
including a stock market clustering
project credit card fraud detection some
health based detection projects and more
if you're interested in backing this
course check out the Kickstarter link in
the description below hey what's going
on guys so today we're gonna be building
a payment application with PHP and the
stripe API now I didn't know Jas and
stripe API video where we use the
pre-made form that stripe offers and we
were able to make a payment charge a
customer and have all that happen in the
stripe dashboard but this is gonna be
more in depth we're actually going to
create a custom form and not only charge
a customer and store it in stripe but
also implement our own back-end with PHP
and MySQL so we're gonna create a
customers and a transactions table to
store the info that we get back from the
API and we're also gonna create some
pages where we can see that data within
our application now this isn't a
beginner tutorial I'm expecting that you
do know some PHP if you don't I'd
suggest my PHP front-to-back course on
YouTube and if you want to go further
than that my course on udemy which I'll
put a link in the description for we're
actually going to be using PDO to
interact with our MySQL database and
we're actually going to use the same PDO
class that we used in the udemy course
now we're gonna be focusing on
object-oriented programming with classes
for our models and so on to store our
data and to fetch our data so it's going
to be a decent-sized project the only
thing that I'm not going to do just yet
unless the series really gained some
traction is authentication ok to see the
transactions and so on but of course you
guys can add that on your own as well
you could even make a pull request to
the git repository if you want alright
and I'm guessing this will be a couple
videos but we'll see all right so let's
do a quick demo this is the landing page
it's a pay page for a product I'm just
saying that it's for an intro to react
course for fifty dollars so you would
put your name in here and we're gonna
make it so that you could put whatever
fields you want I'm just having a first
last name and email address and then the
credit card number alright so we'll do
first and last name and email and then
the card number now with the stripe API
they give you a credit card number that
you can use as a test which is just for
two all the way down so just all four
tubes it can be any expiration date
we'll say for twenty two the code can be
anything zip can be anything and that
should actually work if we have
something that isn't correct it'll tell
us that it's not correct and this is
going to be coming from the charge dot
J's file okay we will be doing a little
bit of JavaScript but we're gonna mostly
get that from the documentation all
right so this should be valid so we'll
submit our payment and then what's going
to happen is it's going to charge it's
it's gonna show up in our stripe
dashboard it's gonna get added to our
database and then it's going to redirect
us to the success page where it'll say
thank you for purchasing whatever the
product is give us our transaction ID
and tell us to check our email for more
info and stripe actually sends like an
invoice to your email showing you that
you paid for it and then we can just go
back to the form alright now if I go to
and by the way I'm using xampp as my
environment here but if I go to
transactions dot PHP will see that
transaction with the ID the customer ID
the product the amount and the date we
can also go to customers dot PHP and
we'll see that customer alright and if
we go back to the pay page and do one
more let's say Tom Smith
again we're gonna use the test number
and submit okay so now if we go to
transactions and I don't have a link to
it from here because you wouldn't do
that this is kind of like a back-end
page and now you can see we have that
that transaction as well with the new
customer ID all right and if we go to
our backend of our stripe dashboard if I
reload we see those two payments that
went through and if I go down to
customers we're going to see those two
customers Brad and Tom all right you
know and it gives us the card it's not
going to give us the actual card number
it'll give us the last four digits and
the expiration the way that the stripe
API works is it uses a token it doesn't
actually give you the card number it
uses a token to charge the card okay and
if you look in our PHP myadmin database
you can see in customers it stored the
customers we're using the customer ID
that came back from stripe as our
primary key same thing with the
transaction we have the transaction ID
all right I'm trying to think of
anything else this is the PDO class
we'll be using its Anna Geist file I'll
go over it a little bit but we'll
probably just paste that into a library
folder and if you did if you did watch
my you to me PHP course then you're
probably going to be familiar with that
all right so that's what we building
guys it'll like I said we'll probably
take a couple videos there's quite a bit
of code to do as you can see over here
we have our models we have our customer
model our transaction model we have our
deep PDO library that's the file I just
showed you in the gist we're gonna be
using the stripe API to do our charges
charge the customer create the customer
and so on and then we have our
JavaScript file which is gonna basically
take care of the validation of the
credit card and also putting the form
element on the page okay this right here
or is it's this here so this whole thing
is powered by the charge dot j s file
all right so that's what we'll be
building guys and let's go ahead and get
started all right so if you guys are
going to be following along then you
need to go to one of the documentation
pages which is stripe comm Doc's stripe
J s elements slash quickstart and this
is going to give us some HTML CSS and
JavaScript to basically create this here
okay so it's it's just the simple credit
card number form and it includes all the
validation and stuff if we put something
that's not correct it'll give us the
error message these three files combined
will basically give us something like
this now as you saw in our application
we're gonna add a first name last name
email all that stuff so we're going to
be customizing it quite a bit we're
gonna be using bootstrap so we're gonna
customize it but I just want to get this
down first alright and this alone isn't
gonna actually charge anything it's
basically just to give you the form and
to validate the card it's not gonna if
you submit it it's not gonna actually do
anything except for give you a token
where then your server-side would take
over and then you would use the stripe
SDK in our case with PHP to charge the
card all right so let's go ahead and go
into our server I'm in my htdocs folder
in my xampp if you're using WAMP or lair
agon or something like that or just a
regular lamp stack that's fine just go
into your server folder okay and then
we're gonna create a folder called pay
page and I'm going to open that up with
vs code
all right so from here we want to create
our index now in this case we're not
going to have an HTML page it's gonna be
a PHP page so we're gonna say index dot
PHP and then for the CSS and JavaScript
I'm going to put those into their own
folders so we'll have CSS and j/s CSS
let's say new file style dot CSS and
then for the j/s new file and we'll say
charge j/s okay so we'll start off with
our feet with our HTML which will go
into our index.php so I'm gonna add in
just some basic head body tags here with
Emmet we'll change the title to pay page
and let's link our stylesheet so that's
in the CSS folder style dot CSS and then
what I'll do is just grab this I mean
there's a lot of stuff we're gonna add
to this but let's grab the form so the
beginning form tag to the ending form
tag and let's stick that in there and
then let's grab this script to this the
stripe version 3 javascript file and
let's put that down here right above the
ending body tag and we'll tab this over
all right so we'll save that and then if
we click on the CSS tab there's some
styling we want so we're gonna grab this
for all the stripe element stuff paste
that in our style sheet and save and
then we're going to go to the JavaScript
and grab all this stuff and copy that
and put that in the charge j/s and then
one thing we're missing here is it's
calling a stripe token handler function
that's actually down here so if you
scroll down let's see where is it's
right here so this the stripe token
handler we're just gonna grab that and
put that at the very bottom
all right so what this is doing is
basically it's going to initialize
stripe with our client-side key now if
you are logged in looking at this
documentation your key is already going
to be put in here this is my key and if
I go to my dashboard and I go to API
you'll see my publishable key which is
right here it's the same thing okay so
it's XW right here alright if you're not
logged in you won't see it in the
documentation and you'll have to log in
and grab it and stick it in there okay
make sure you use your own don't use
mine and then we're going to just create
an instance of elements some custom
styling here that can be passed as an
option you can see that's being passed
right here into this elements dot create
and then we're going to mount to an ID
of card element and that's basically
going to put that right in here see this
ID of card element that's where that
field is going to be put and it's just
going to be the credit card field
nothing else we're gonna add the other
stuff in a little in a little bit and
then it's going to handle all the
validations so if the card isn't isn't
valid or something like that it'll it'll
handle it it'll handle the form
submission and then it'll call stripe
token handler which will send the Tokra
to its token to your server and that
function is right here it'll finally
submit the form all right so if I go
ahead and save this make sure all these
files are saved and we go to our local
host pay page we just let's see why is
that not showing up that's because we
didn't include the charge J's file so we
want to make sure we go down here and
let's add that
so it's gonna be charge dot J s actually
it's in the JavaScript folder so let's
do that alright so we'll save and there
we go so now we basically have just the
credit card field and we and it will
work if we put something in here that's
not valid it'll actually check if we put
our valid number that'll work if I
submit it it's gonna it's gonna get
submitted to charge because that's where
the form is actually submitting to okay
up to up to this point we're just we
basically just have our front end we now
need to build our server side which is
going to handle the rest now we don't
want this to go to Chuck discharge we
want this to go to charge dot PHP which
is going to be a file that that we're
gonna create all right so I'm actually
gonna put dot slash charge PHP so above
this actually let's bring in bootstrap
so I'm gonna go to get bootstrap com
hopefully with me so far and we're gonna
grab the link to the stylesheet and
paste that in now once I do that if I go
back to our page you'll see that it
messes up and that's because we need to
add that that bootstrap form control
class so right on the card
element this ID card element we're also
going to add a class of form control
okay so now we get that the form back
and we're gonna add a bunch of other
things we're gonna wrap everything
inside of a container class so let's
take this div and just we're gonna wrap
everything the whole form so right here
we'll have that ending div just to put
everything into a container okay so that
pushes it into the middle let's see what
else are we gonna do I don't want the
label this label right here I'm gonna
get rid of that and the button I want to
format that as bootstrap now the button
isn't you can clearly see it's not in
the HTML it's generated in JavaScript so
we're gonna have to do a little bit of
Dom manipulation through our JavaScript
so what I'll do is go right under this
style and we're just gonna let's say
style button with bootstrap so we'll say
document dot get not yet I'll do query
selector and it's inside the payment
form it has an ID of payment - form if
we look at the HTML here if we open up
our chrome tools and let's see right
here so the form has an idea of payment
form and we want the button that's
inside of that which is right here this
button so we need to add a class - to
that or a couple classes so we'll say
payment form button and then we're gonna
do dot class list
and this is pretty much the only
JavaScript we're gonna be doing guys
it's gonna be mostly PHP after this we
want to add BTN BTN - primary BTN -
block and let's do a margin top four
alright so if we save that and reload
let's see class list is not a function
what did I do here query selector oh I'm
a dummy class list equals that it's not
a function it's a property there we go
so now we have our nice button so now
what we'll do is add the rest of the
fields so we're gonna go back to
index.php and right above the form i'm
just gonna put in h2 with the class
let's say my - 4 that'll give us margin
on the top and bottom and then let's
also do a text center class and we'll
just say the name of the project product
which is intro to react course and we'll
put the price of $50 alright so if we
were to look at that there we go now for
the rest of the fields we're gonna go
into our form into the form row div
right here and let's add an input and
I'm gonna give it a class of form
control
okay we're also gonna give it a class of
mb3 margin-bottom three to move
everything down we're also gonna give it
that stripe element class to kind of
match the the credit input so stripe
element and then we also want to do
stripe element - - empty like that okay
and then I'm just gonna put a
placeholder so placeholder will be first
name so let's see what that looks like
all right so there's our first name
field now we want to do the same thing
for the other two fields so I'm going to
copy this down to two times and this
second one is gonna be the last name so
we'll say last name for the placeholder
whoops and let's see oh you know what I
forgot is the name attribute we
definitely need those because that's how
we retrieve the data in the backend so
let's say name first underscore name and
then the last name will be last on the
score name and let's see the final field
here we're gonna give a name of email
let's also make it a type of email and
we'll change the placeholder to email
or email address so let's take a look at
that and there we go so there's our
forum one thing I forgot is the stripe
API it doesn't need jQuery I believe so
we're gonna grab the jQuery CDN I'm just
gonna go ahead and paste that and I'm
just using the one from Google api's
jQuery three-two-one and then we should
be all set for our forum
now it's telling us that we can test our
stripe integration over HTTP which is
what we're doing obviously if you were
to deploy this to a remote host you
would need an SSL certificate you'd want
HTTPS okay so it's just telling us that
it's also telling giving us this message
saying that the use of the line height
property is discouraged which I find
weird because they actually included it
in this style right here so I guess if I
mean if we get rid of this that'll make
that warning go away but I think that's
weird that they that gives us that
warning yet they give us that in the
documentation but whatever it's fine so
that's gonna do it for the form and
basically the the entire front end so
now when we submit this it should go to
a file called charge dot PHP because
that's what we put as the action so
let's go ahead and create that
in our route here so we'll say charge
dot PHP and let's put in a PHP tag and
all I'm gonna do is echo submit it just
to make sure that this actually works
all right so let's put in a name
card number so if we put something that
isn't right it's gonna tell us let's put
in the correct one and submit and there
we go so we know it's it's submitting to
charge dot PHP so this is where we want
to start to use the stripe SDK and make
our charge so I'm gonna go to the the
github page for stripe - PHP is what
it's called and we're gonna use composer
to install it very simple we just need
to install it with this command and then
we just need to require it in our script
with this alright so if you don't have
composer if you're on Windows you can go
to get not get bootstrap you want to go
to get composer dot org and just
download it and install it okay it's a
GUI installer it's really easy and then
once you have that installed you'll be
able to use the composer command if
you're on Mac you might want to use
homebrew to install it if you're on
Linux you can use whatever package
manager okay I already have it installed
so I'm not going to go through that but
what we want to do is this so I'm going
to open up my terminal my vs code
integrated terminal here and we're gonna
run this command so it's gonna be
composer require and what is it so
stripe slash stripe dot peach was it
thought PHP - PHP alright
- PHP so we're going to run that
and what that'll do is create a composer
dot Jason file right here as you can see
okay and it should Creek yup and it
creates a vendor folder and now that's
installed so what we want to do now is
require it so we would just want to add
this line right here to our charge dot
PHP so I'm going to just add that there
and now we can use the stripe SDK for
PHP now let's see if this shows any
documentation yeah so we want to include
our server-side key now okay because now
we're on our server so we basically want
this here so we'll put that in and I'll
put links to the github page and all the
stuff that we're gonna look at within
this project but from here you want to
replace this with your server key so you
want to go to your dashboard API and
then reveal the test key token
and we want to grab that okay and put
that in here and then you have your
server key so now we want to do is get
the we want to get the form data that's
being submitted so to do that if you
have any experience with PHP probably
know that you can get it with the post
array because we're submitting it as a
post request so for instance to get our
first name field we can do post
first-name because that's what we gave
it as a name attribute so we want all
that stuff and we want the token which
we can get with post stripe token now
just to be safe I want to filter all of
I want to filter the entire post array I
want to sanitize it so that if people
put something that's harmful it'll
sanitize it as a string so let's go
ahead and do that
say sanitize post array so I'm gonna
create a new variable called just just
money sign post and then set that to the
PHP filter underscore var underscore
array function and then we just want to
pass in money sign underscore post
saying we want to filter that and we
want to sanitize it with filter
underscore sanitize underscore string I
spell that right yeah so sanitize string
and then what we'll do is create our
variables like first name and then set
it to post and you want to use just
money sign posts not underscore because
we set this to the filtered post array
so now we want to set that to two post
first name all right and then we're
gonna just copy that down three more
times let's do the last name and let's
do email oops and we want the stripe
token which is the most important thing
here so we'll call this just token all
right so that should get all the form
values now if we want to test this out
we could let's just echo out the token
all right so we'll go back to our form
and let's resubmit and there we go so
now we're getting a token that means
that the credit card we put in was valid
of course it was the the just the test
credit card but if we were in production
mode and we put in a real credit card
that worked then we would get a token
like this all right so now that we have
the token we want to create a customer
and when I say create a customer I mean
within stripe not within our database or
we're not doing our database until after
we're able to actually make it charge
okay so let's go ahead and do that let's
say create customer in stripe so we're
going to create a variable called
customer we're gonna set it to backslash
stripe back slash customer double colon
create and then we want to pass in an
array
and inside this array we just want to
put email and we can get this from the
email variable because we have that set
right here to whatever was sent in with
the form in addition to that we need to
assign the source which is going to be
the token okay so just like that that'll
create the customer but now we need to
charge the customer okay so to do that
we're going to create a variable called
charge we're going to set that equal to
back slash stripe back slash charge
double colon create and just like above
we're gonna pass in an array and we're
gonna put the amount so the amount is
gonna be $50 now with stripe there's we
just we do it like this we don't
actually put the decimal point but
that's what it is it's this is $50 okay
and then the currency that we want to
use which is going to be USD and let's
do a description this is this isn't
required but it's good because it'll
show up in your back-end what did what
did they actually buy so I'm going to
say intro to react course and then
finally the customer
that bought it is gonna be from that
customer variable and we want the ID all
right so that should charge the customer
now all I'm going to do after that's
done is just go ahead and print our
which will print out an array of charge
okay because we're gonna see what we get
back from this charge variable once we
charge the customer so let's save this
and I'm gonna go in my dashboard and you
see how I have some test stuff here
payments and customers I want to get rid
of that and it's very easy to do that
you just go to business settings data
and then delete test data so we want to
get rid of everything so anytime you
want to start from scratch get rid of
anything you just do that now if I go to
payments there's nothing there okay so
we're ready to try it out and this
should actually charge and add the
payment and the customer and all of that
okay so let's go ahead and try this so
let's say John Doe say J Doe at
gmail.com put in our card number and
submit hopefully it works okay so you
can see that this is what it gave us
back but before we look at this let's
look at our dashboard let's reload and
there it is our $50.00 charge for intro
to react we have our ID our customer
email the date and then if I go down to
customers we should see J Doe at Gmail
with with the customer ID it also gives
us the card the brand the last four
digits and the expiration date okay so
up to this point we're able to actually
charge a customer and if that's all you
wanted to do that's fine you could do
that but I want to take it a step
further and add it to our database so we
actually have some local data for our
charges for our customers and this is
all the stuff that you get back so
this is the transaction ID which we can
get with chart we could get it from
charge ID like that so we could get any
of these fields back so the ID the
amount amount refunded a lot of this
stuff we're not going to use but it is
available balance transaction the
created at the date the currency the
customer ID which we'll be using the
description which is the product let's
see what else the risk level which is
normal the seller message payment
complete receipt email so we can get the
email back the customer email what else
we didn't do an address or anything like
that
the zip code we can get that we can get
the last four or is it right here so we
can get the last four digits of the
credit card if we want the expiration
date expiration month and year status
which is succeeded so we're going to use
some of this stuff to insert it into our
database
after we charge the customer but for now
what I want to do is just redirect to a
success page because obviously if they
go through and they they purchased the
course we don't want this to be
displayed so what we'll do here is do a
redirect I'll say redirect to success so
in PHP we use the header function and in
here we say location and we want to go
to success PHP which will create and I
want to add some parameters here I want
to add the transaction ID as well as the
description of the product so that we
can use that in the displaymessage so to
put a parameter we want to put a
question mark and then I'm gonna use tid
for transaction ID and then we're just
going to concatenate with a dot and
we're gonna say charge
I D alright then we're going to
concatenate again back to a string and
we're gonna put another parameter so we
use an ampersand and we'll say product
equals and then concatenate on to that
charge and then we get that from
description okay as you can see up here
whereas it's right here description is
going to be intro to react course so we
want to pass those things along in the
URL so let's save it and then let's
create a success page so success dot PHP
and we're gonna want some head body tags
let's say right here the title we'll
just say thank you and then I'm gonna
grab the bootstrap link we don't need
like the style sheet here we don't need
these scripts or anything because it's
just a simple success page but we do
need bootstrap and then in the body
let's put a div with the class of
container and then let's just do Mt
margin top four okay and then here we'll
put an eight in h2 and we'll say thank
you for purchasing and then I'm gonna
put a PHP variable in here we're going
to echo out product and I'll create that
variable in a second and then under that
we'll put in HR and then let's put a
paragraph and we'll say your transaction
ID is and then we'll echo out a variable
called tid
okay then we'll put another paragraph
will say check your email for more info
and then I'll just gonna put another
paragraph with a go back button or go
back link so we'll do an a tag with a
class of BTN BTN light and let's do
margin top - okay and this is just going
to go to index dot PHP which is our
landing page and we'll say go back
alright now this will give us an error
because it doesn't know what product and
tid is so what we want to do is go up to
the top above the markup and put in our
PHP tags and when we want to get the
parameters from the URL because we're
gonna have it like tid equals something
product if we want to access those we
access them in the get array just like
we have a post array when we submit a
form with a post requests we can get get
variables so we first need to check for
those okay so we're gonna say if not
empty not empty we want to put an
exclamation here if not empty money sign
underscore get and we want to look for
tid and not empty product
okay so if both of those are not empty
then I want to filter the get array so
I'm going to say get equals and again
use filter var array and we're gonna
pass in the get array and we want to
sanitize it as a string or each value as
a string so filter underscore sanitize
string okay so now what I'll do is set
the tid variable equal to money sign get
tid and then we're gonna do the same
thing with the product alright and then
we will just want to do an else if those
two things aren't here then we just want
to redirect back to the index page okay
so let's see what's going on here I
forgot what did I do here this is wrong
this should be get product
like that all right is that right yeah
all right so it's just checking not
empty get tid not empty get product if
that's true it's gonna filter the get
array and then we're gonna set these
variables else it's gonna redirect so if
I were to just go to success dot php'
it's just going to redirect us it needs
those values so let's try this again
we'll say Jack Jack Bauer for you 24
fans and let's do Jack at yahoo.com
submit payment and there we go
thank you for purchasing the react
course gives us a transaction ID good
and then if we go to our stripe
dashboard and reload let's say customers
we should see Jack and if we go to
payments we should see his payment
awesome so I mean you could stop here
and and just have it like this but if
you want your own back-end your own
database with your own data then let's
go ahead and do that in the next video
