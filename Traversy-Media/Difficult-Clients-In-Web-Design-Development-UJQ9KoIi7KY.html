talk a little bit about dealing with
clients in the world of web design and
development now this is geared more
towards you guys that are either running
your own business or you're doing
freelancing work but it should also
apply to those of you that are working
for someone else but you also have to
deal with clients directly all right so
I've never really worked for a big
company but those of you that have been
following me for a while you know that
I've ran I ran my own business for
around five years or so I had a
commercial space I started with computer
repair but I ended up doing mostly web
development I worked with some local
clients but most of my clients were all
across the world my family through
Google or something like that
and at the time I was working mostly
with content management systems like
WordPress Joomla it allowed me to create
dynamic websites in a short amount of
time and also give the client a back-end
where they could go and edit their
content all right so I'm going to give
you some situations that you might run
into and at the same time give you some
pointers that may help you out and I
will warn you that I will be a little
negative and harsh because honestly
there's people that are just really
irritating but just know that the
majority of the clients are very helpful
respectable and fair I'm specifically
talking about those people who are very
difficult to work with or work for all
right so one of the biggest reasons that
I move to online teaching from doing
client work is because it was extremely
stressful working with difficult people
now some of this depends on you and how
you're able to handle it but for me I've
always had an issue dealing with people
in general I get social anxiety I can
have a chip on my shoulder sometimes so
it was really challenging for me now if
you're really good at communication and
you tend to enjoy talking to people
you're not going to have as much of a
problem as someone like me now it does
get easier as time goes on after you
learn some strategies and some of the
core principles to work by for your you
know for your business so I figured I'd
share some of those with you guys all
right so the first type of difficult
client we're going to talk about our
cheap clients and there's a lot of them
so getting people to realize what their
paying for is very difficult especially
when you have when they have no clue
what goes into it many clients are
relentless at just trying to have we
toggle you and save every penny they
possibly can all right and if you're a
freelancer just starting out you're
going to have people that are trying to
try to get you to build them a website
for free they'll tell you that it'll
give you the you know good experience
they'll give you a good reference I fell
for that in the beginning and unless
they're absolutely ecstatic about your
work they couldn't care less about
giving you a reference or helping you
out in that way one important thing to
do is to be firm and not let people take
advantage of you but also be open to a
little compromise you want to have
self-confidence but you don't want to
sell yourself short all right you don't
want to over price your services but you
also don't want to underprice if you
don't feel like you're being fulfilled
or you're not being paid what you're
what you should be getting paid you're
not going to have that ambition and that
drive to to build the product you know
in the best way
so some clients are cheap right up front
and I'll try haggling haggling you but
even worse some people will agree to a
price and then later on try and dissect
all of your services and work and the
time spent and they'll try to accuse you
of overcharging them or not not
fulfilling what you were supposed to all
right so you definitely want to create a
specific proposal with the exact work
that you're going to be doing and for
what price you're going to do it for all
right that way they can't try to swindle
you in and save a few bucks
also make sure you charge them a portion
upfront what I used to do is for
projects that were under let's say a
thousand dollars I charge them 50% up
front and then 50% at the end and if it
was higher than that higher than a
thousand I would do 1/3 at the beginning
a third at midpoint and then a third at
the end all right just to make sure that
or just make sure that whatever you do
you make it very clear verbally as well
as in writing all right so some clients
have absolutely no concept of time they
have no clue what goes into something
like a Ruby on Rails application or a
node.js application that you know they
want a Facebook clone in 30 days for 500
I'm not exaggerating I've actually been
asked that they also think that the
project is the only one that you're
working on and in reality you're
juggling ten others just like it wishing
that there was a hundred more hours in
each day all right I used to have people
emailing me asking when it'll be done
when I clearly gave them even I even
wrote it down you know gave them some
documentation with a timeline and it's
very difficult to get clients to read or
even comprehend details that you give
them they have their own timeline in
their head and they might also be or not
be respectful of your time in your
boundaries they'll call you even after
business hours or even on a Sunday or
Saturday some clients make the mistake
of thinking that freelancing means that
you offer 24/7 support so to handle
these types of people communication is
definitely key all right make sure you
establish these boundaries give them a
support email and tell them you know you
check it Monday through Friday from nine
to five or whatever it may be
so always provide a time estimation and
always make it longer than you plan ok
never shorter if you estimate a month
tell them six weeks not three just to
sound better because it'll it'll bite
you in the ass in the long run I've made
that mistake many times another
important thing is to provide them with
the number of revisions that you're
willing to do okay because because some
clients will just try to keep getting
more and more out of you not
understanding how long it actually takes
to revise a website or UI or some
functionality okay and then a lot of
clients have absolutely no clue what
they want and don't get me wrong there's
some that are really good with with
preparation with their business plan
they have a wireframe a logo those those
are the clients that are it's really
refreshing to to work with but some of
them you know they have no goals no
examples I've had people that didn't
even have a business name yet and I
would think it would be common sense to
at least establish a name and some kind
of services for your business before
contacting a web design company
okay now some will even ask you to help
with this stuff even though you don't
you don't include any kind of you know
business consultation services or
anything like that but they'll still try
to get that stuff out of you so be very
clear about what your services are all
right so some of the things that you
want to ask for when you're you know
when you establish initial contact with
a possible client and you're trying to
get stuff from them you want to ask for
examples of other websites that they
like in both style and functionality you
want a basic idea of how many pages what
color scheme they want things like that
and if they don't know tell them to come
up with some more information and then
give you a call back okay obviously you
know do that very politely so if you
take it upon yourself to create
everything for them you know and and
back into their every call there's a
huge chance that they'll hate it in the
end because they didn't give you enough
information to to figure this stuff out
alright and even though they made the
mistake of not giving you that
information they'll still try to blame
you for for it and not want to pay for
the services alright so make sure you
get as much as possible before you start
any project so another issue when
working with web development services is
registering domains and and also hosting
websites so some clients think that this
should all be included in the hundred
dollars they want to pay you for
building an entire site from scratch so
you have to be very clear on how you're
going to handle hosting now when I did
this I was actually a reseller through
Hostgator so I could set up their server
I could charge them a monthly fee and
all that if you want to do that that's
absolutely fine but just know that it's
a ton of work so you have to offer
support for down time setting up emails
and FTPS and all that crap you also have
to deal a lot with the whoever the
company is that you resell reselling
from I have no complaints about
Hostgator they were really awesome but
all in all I don't think it's worth it I
would suggest doing something else so
what I was just doing is actually
getting an affiliate account with some
kind of shared hosting and then also for
VPS is if you're doing
no js' and stuff like that you know
offer to set up everything for them you
know with their web development services
but make sure that you you make it clear
that hosting in domains are completely
separate from from your services okay so
give them you know if you want to create
the account for them you can do that and
then just give them the login and tell
them that they'll have to deal with the
hosting company separately or you could
have them pay you maybe a monthly price
for support for that kind of stuff just
make sure you're crystal-clear on your
policy so you may run into the situation
where everything is going good or at
least you think it is and you finally
finish the project and then the client
is nowhere to be found
they're not responding to your emails
that phone goes right to voicemail and
their final payment is due all right so
this is one of the reasons that I would
always suggest charging at least a
portion of the payment upfront so they
can't completely screw you and have you
do all that work for nothing if they
haven't made the final payment don't
send them the completed project and
don't put their site you know live on
the Internet
also if email and phone isn't working
try and contact them through other means
like social media maybe they have an
existing website that you can send a
contact form submission all right now
although it's really frustrating just
know that there is a chance that
something could be really wrong they
might have had a family emergency maybe
they had a kid that got hurt or sick so
you do want to be very respectful and
understanding all right now some of your
clients will vary in terms of what they
understand and what they don't so
high-tech and low-tech clients and
there's pros and cons to both
you know clients knowing a lot or
knowing absolutely nothing if they don't
know anything about what goes into
building a website or an application
it's very hard to establish pricing and
try to justify the cost that you're
giving them they might think that
building a quality site consists of
opening something like Wix and then
dragging and dropping a couple elements
into the site they might think that to
create let's say an iPhone app along
with their Android app it's just a flick
of a switch
so they might not see why your prices
are what they are and then for clients
that do know alive for clients that
maybe have even done some web
development themselves they sometimes
overstep and tell you what tools or
languages that you should be using and
they start to criticize parts of your
code I find the best clients to deal
with are the ones that understand the
basics of how a website is built but
they don't think they're smarter than
you are all right at least at that so
you're going to have clients that have
very unrealistic expectations they think
that their idea is going to is going to
you know make them the next Mark
Zuckerberg so it is a good idea to dream
big but they also have to understand
that creating an empire like Facebook is
not something that they're going to do
overnight now sometimes when the client
is pitching their dream to you or their
you know their view of what's going to
happen you may realize that it's already
been done in one way or another and it's
terribly difficult to let someone down
like that especially if they put a lot
of time or even money into the idea it's
hard to tell them that it's been done or
just plain sucks
you can try and pitch a tweaked version
of what they're looking for if possible
and but you really can't blame them when
I was starting out I had a new idea
every day some of them I put into action
I created a social network for DJ's a
web hosting review site a medical
directory and just endless ideas that I
had I didn't put too much thought into
them but I just kind of jumped in too
quick and some of them did make me a
couple bucks but some of them were a
complete waste of time but either way I
did learn from it all right I did learn
that you can't just have an idea you
need to really implement it in a
successful way so you have to have math
massive amounts of time to dedicate to
it nothing comes really easy so I would
try and share some of that with with my
clients in a heartfelt way all right so
let's recap some of the strategies and
principles that you can use when dealing
with difficult clients so the most
important thing to remember is that
communication is key if you don't have
the correct level of communication with
your clients your visions they're not
going to match up to theirs
and there's going to be issues and it's
going to be misunderstandings okay so I
have an in-depth or having an in-depth
consultation before you agree to
anything is very important and this
includes the work that's going to be
done the price the timeframe the design
the hosting and anything else you can
think of because there's a lot that goes
into it you also want to document
everything okay don't think that just
because you told someone something
they're going to remember documentation
gives you proof of what you said and
some examples of that would be pricing
contracts proposals for projects plans
hosting agreements anything that you can
think of just print it up put your logo
on it and give it to them inside of a
packet all right now if you're just
starting out and you're having some of
these issues don't get too discouraged
because it does get easier and it does
get better once you get into a groove
you'll be you'll be prepared for almost
every situation you'll establish basic
pricing timelines proposals all that
stuff and then you can just tweak them a
little bit from project to project all
right and it's really important to know
that if you if you have a client that's
really difficult and you feel like
you're getting nowhere with them you
don't have to take on that project even
if it has potential to make you a good
chunk of change
sometimes that amount it's not worth the
stress and the aggravation and the time
away from your family so don't be afraid
to turn people down alright you don't
have to be a jerk about it just say you
know I have too many projects right now
it's not something that I think that I
could deliver on 100% okay all right
