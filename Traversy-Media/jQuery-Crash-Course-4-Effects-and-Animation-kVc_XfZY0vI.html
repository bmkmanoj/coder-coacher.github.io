get into effects and animation in jQuery
now we're not going to create any
spectacular animations I just want to
introduce you to the fade fade out fade
in slide up slide down and then the
animate function okay and maybe a couple
other small things so we have our
starter interface here and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
couple buttons in the container so we'll
say button will give us an ID of BTN
fade out okay and then let's just copy
that paste into more this one's going to
be fade in and then this one's going to
be fake tog all right so we have our
buttons now we're also going to let's
see we're going to create a div we'll
put an H R here and then a div and we're
going to give this an ID of box and
inside the box we're going to say I'll
just put an h1 it says hello world and
then up in the style we're going to say
dot box or actually it's an ID so we're
going to say number sign box and let's
give it a background of dark gray color
will be white and let's see we're going
to set the width or I want the width to
we'll set the width to 500 okay
500 pixels and then the height I'm going
to set to 90 pixels
I'm going to set padding 240 pixels and
let's text the line to the center
alright so let's go ahead and load that
so now we have our buttons and we have
this element here which is a box with
the text hello world so what I want to
do first is take this fade-out button
and add an event to it so we're going to
say jQuery ID BTN fade out going to be a
click event when it's clicked it's going
to run this function and then what we're
going to do is take that box okay so it
has an ID of box and we're going to say
dot fade out okay so let's see what that
does
and it just nicely fades it right out
okay so if you want that to go fast you
can actually pass in a parameter here
called fast click it it goes fast if we
change this to slow and then it goes a
little slower now that's that sets some
pretty high limitations so instead of
doing fast or slow you can actually do
it in milliseconds so let's say 3,000
which would be 3 seconds click it and
you'll see it takes 3 seconds to fade
out now this also takes in a callback
function an optional function that can
do something when it's done alright so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take the button fade out so ID button
fade out and I'm going to change the
text
I'll change it to I will say it's gone
okay so reload click it and then when
it's done you'll see the text changes -
it's gone ok what that function is
optional so we have fade-out and then we
obviously I also have fade in so I'm
going to copy this here and we'll change
this to in change the actual function or
method to fade in and I'm going to get
rid of the second callback function we
don't need it
all right so we'll fade it out ok it's
gone click fade in and it comes back in
now we also have fade toggle which does
both so we'll go ahead and copy that and
let's say fade tahg which is going to
call fade toggle and we'll just change
this to one second okay so now if I
click that goes out click it again comes
back in and keep doing it alright so
those are the fade effects now we also
have slide up and slide down and slide
toggle so what I'm going to do is copy
the these all the buttons and let's
change this to button let me see I want
to change this to slide up
okay so button slide up this one will be
slide down
and this one will be slide tog okay and
then we're going to go down here and
let's just grab this
okay we'll change this to button slide
down and then this will be changed to
slide down
okay then I'll copy that
this one will be up this one will be cog
and toggle all right so let's reload
click slide up you can see it slides up
and disappears and slide down and slide
toggle alright now we can also stop it
in the middle of the effect if we want
so what I'm going to do is put another
button right here give it an ID of BTN
stop and then down here we're going to
say BTN stop and then we're going to
simply actually we need to do our click
okay and then we'll take that box and up
and I'm just gonna call dot stop all
right so now we'll go ahead and click
slide up stop and you'll see it stops
dead in its tracks and then we can
continue it alright so that is fade and
slide now let's get into animate all
right now what I'm going to do is create
another box let's see we're going to go
put an HR right here and then I'm going
to put a couple more buttons I need
three buttons so I'm gonna copy those
okay this first one will be I will just
call it move left
this one will be move right
this one will be move around alright and
then under that we're going to have
another div with a ID of box too okay
we're just going to add a little bit of
style up here to box two
so we're going to give it a background
of red give it a width of 100 pixels a
height of 100 pixels and we're also
going to set the position to be relative
all right and then let's save that okay
so there's our square and we're going to
go down into our script and we're going
to take that move right button so it has
an ID of move right and we're going to
set a click event okay and then in here
we're going to take blocks too and we're
going to apply the animate method okay
and then in here we're going to pass in
an object with some options so I want to
say left 500 all right now what this is
going to do is it's going to add this
CSS property left 500 now if you have to
make sure it's relative or that the top
right left
those those values won't work unless
it's position relative so what we're
saying is when we click it we want it to
be 500 from the left okay this is where
the left is we want it to go 500 from
the left which would be towards the
right so if we go ahead and reload and I
click move left nothing's happening
oh it's move right endure all right so
you can see that it moved right now we
want to be able to move it back so we'll
copy that we'll take the move left
button and we'll say left zero so now
move right move left and now I can move
that around just pretty cool now we can
add some other values here if we want
let's say we want to change the size of
the box as it moves to the left or to
the right so right here we'll say height
you can basically animate anything that
has either a numeric value or a string
that is light as numeric like so
something like 500 pixels which is what
we're going to have here it's a string
that will make it 300 pixels all right
and then we'll set the width also to 300
pixels okay we can also set the opacity
because that's numeric so we'll set that
to 0.5 all right now when it comes back
we want to bring that stuff back so
let's do height bring it back to 100
pixels and with the same thing and
opacity we'll set that to 1 so let's try
that close that and you can see it gets
bigger and it also gets more transparent
and then move left and it goes back to
how it was all right so that's animate
now we can also use a cue where we can
do multiple animations at once so what
we're going to do is grab that move
around button
okay don't click function and we're
going to we're going to put that box to
value into a variable because we're
using it multiple times so we don't want
to have to keep reaching into the dog so
set that to box two and then what we'll
do is say box dot animate and we'll pass
in let's say left 300
okay we'll copy that and we can keep
doing animates so that'll be left 300
this one will be let's do top 300 okay
first one is going to be over and then
we want top 300 so that's going to go
down then we want it to go back over so
for that one we'll set top 300 and left
zero all right and then the last one is
going to be left:0 top:0 okay back to
where it started so let's go ahead and
try that click the move around and it
goes around in a circle or square okay
so like I said I mean we're not going to
do any really extensive stuff with
animation I just want to show you how
these methods work and you can use that
to go and create your own whatever
slideshows or whatever you want to build
that uses animation alright so hopefully
you guys like this video in the next
video we're going to start to look at
some Ajax methods so that we can use
Ajax with jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
