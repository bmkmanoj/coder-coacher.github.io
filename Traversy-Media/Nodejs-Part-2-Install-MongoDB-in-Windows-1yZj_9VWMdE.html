MongoDB onto a Windows machine and we're
going to be using this within our node
application and what MongoDB is it's
it's a no SQL database which is quite
different from a traditional relational
database like MySQL or Postgres
it doesn't have tables it uses what's
called collections which are kind of
equivalent to a table in in a regular
SQL database but you don't have to hard
code the schema it's very fast very
scalable because of that because you
don't need to hard code things I like
you do with with traditional databases I
would definitely suggest coming to
MongoDB org and looking through the
documentation there's a lot more there
than I can teach you so I mean this here
is a good a good definition of what
MongoDB is so it's a document database
and like I said collections are sort of
equivalent to tables and documents are
kind of equivalent equivalent to a
column alright so they're basically JSON
objects they have name value pairs all
right um MongoDB is very
high-performance
embedding makes reads and writes very
fast high availability availability and
of course easy scalability alright
there's what's called sharding which
distributes collection data across
machines which we're not really going to
get into that this is kind of a
beginners tutorial - MongoDB
and the data mondal like i said it holds
a set of collections a collection holds
a set of documents all right and like I
said a document is a set of key value
pairs so enough on what it is let's get
it installed so I'm on Windows so I'm
going to go to downloads and click
Windows alright and it's going to give
us this zip file which I already have so
I'm not going to download it again I'm
going to go to that zip file and if we
open that up you'll have a folder like
this and you click in that and then
you'll see this bin folder with some
other readme files and such now there's
no windows installer like there is for
node so these are the actual files we
need to use so I'm going to go to my C
Drive and you can put these wherever you
want I'm just going to put them in the
root of my C Drive in a folder called
MongoDB so I'm going to open up that
folder and we're going to drag this
these files into it
now before we do anything we need to
create a couple folders for MongoDB the
first one is going to be our data folder
so we want to create a folder called
data and inside there we want to create
another folder called DB and this will
hold all of our database information a
lot of database data next one we want to
create is the log file and that's just
where all the logs will go for MongoDB
and these are not the default locations
the default for Windows I believe would
be right in the C Drive but I want them
in the MongoDB folder so we just need to
specify that when we when we access the
Mongo D program which is in the bin
folder so Mongo D and Mongo are the two
that we'll be using
so let's go ahead and open up a command
line inside of the bin folder we can
right-click and do git bash you can also
use your standard Windows command line
ah so what we want to do here is we want
to say Mongo D and as a few things we
need to do here um we need to manually
define where our data and log folders
are so the first thing we need to do is
say
directory / dB what / DB and we want to
say DB path and then the path to our DB
data folder now there's something really
important that you need to know if
you're using this get bash program
if you're using Windows command line the
standard command line that comes with
Windows you want to use back slashes all
right so you would say Mongo DB boards
backslash whatever if you're using this
git bash program you want to use forward
slashes this is the unix-style path and
when using this get batch program we're
pretty much using UNIX syntax so it's
very important that you use forward
slash in this program and because that
really stumped me for a whole day I
couldn't understand why it wasn't
connecting success successfully and it
was because they couldn't find the
folders because I used um back slashes
alright so now that we get that out of
the way we can say MongoDB let's see
there I go slash data / - be alright and
that is this folder here or this folder
so we want to do the same thing with the
log path so we'll say log path C let's
MongoDB and log and we want to define a
file so we're going to call this MongoDB
dot log and you can name this whatever
you want
okay it doesn't even have to have a log
extension you could use anything alright
so next thing we want to say is log a
pen so that we don't overwrite our logs
we just append them and then we're going
to say rest so that we can use rest
services and that's that's really it if
we click that all output going to our
log file that's good let's make sure
that it was created it was all right so
our logs will go here so basically it's
waiting for us to connect okay so let's
open up another command line we'll open
it in the bin folder
and we want to type in Mongo and now
we're connected okay we can now say show
DBS we should get local and we're
connected we could we can start creating
collections we can add data we can do
all that but before we do any of that
right now how we have it we have to
manually start this when we want to use
Mongo all right so if we get out of this
with ctrl C same here and then we say
Mongo again it's not going to connect we
get a connect failed so what we need to
do is install MongoDB as a Windows
service and that's very easy to do if we
just go and click the up arrow and we
want to run this again except we just
want to attack on install to the end of
it so what that did is created a service
for us
it says service can be started from the
command line using net start MongoDB so
let's go ahead and do that
all right so it started successfully and
you can see it's not wait it's not
waiting we can go ahead and keep typing
commands we don't even need this open
anymore
and to verify that it was added we can
go to the Windows Start menu and say
services and then click on this services
right here with the gear icon and scroll
down and you can see our services right
here MongoDB
it started it's going to start
automatically so that way we don't need
to do anything to start MongoDB we can
just connect so we're going to clear
this out and type in Mongo which will
connect to our MongoDB now we want to
create a database called kbase because
by default we're connecting to a
database called tests and we can do that
just by saying use kbase and it's as
easy as that to create a database
everything is just simplified in MongoDB
if you're used to using a relational SQL
database then this still just shall blow
your mind how easy it is to do things
all right so we switch to kbase now what
we want to do is we can say show
collections remember collections I'll
kind of like tables and all we have is
just system dot indexes which we don't
pay any attention to right now so to
create a collection we can say DB
create collection and we'll create a
collection called articles alright so if
we get that okay one that's good now if
we say show collections we can see that
we have an articles collection now we
can perform queries on this collection
we can insert update read and delete
entries or articles so let's create
let's um let's add something to it
okay so we'll say DB dot articles dot
insert all right so we can perform an
insert query like this all right so we
want to say title book title we'll just
say test type actually we'll see foo
all right so that's the title put a
comma and we'll create another field
which will be body and we can create
these on the fly we don't have to we
don't have to define them in any way we
can just create them as we go so body
just say this is a test body unexpected
token so DB articles dot insert I'm
sorry we have to wrap this in curly
braces
it's basically JSON well alright so we
get nothing back that's good so what we
can do now is say DB dot articles dot
find and that'll show us everything
that's it that was entered which is our
fou article and we can also format this
a little better if we say find and then
do dot pretty that gives it to us nice
and neat so let's let's add another
article
and of course this one will be called
Bar say this is another test body so
we'll do fine pretty and it gives us our
two entries now we can find specific
articles by a specific field if we want
to will say find actually we're going to
say find one and then inside here will
say title we want to find the article
with the title of fou I'm sorry we have
to I don't know why I'm forgetting to
wrap these in curly braces alright so
then it prints out that one entry which
as fou was the title alright so we've
done I'll create in read so let's go to
update so we can do this with DVD
articles dot update alright so inside
here the first parameter is going to be
what which which one we want to change
all right so we want to change title
whoever has a title of fou all right and
the next parameter we want to put a
comma and make sure you include these
curly braces the next thing we want to
do is set it we want to set so let's
rename it let's rename the title so
we'll just do our curly braces and we'll
say title
title is going to equal fubar alright
and then we have one last parameter so
we want to do a comma and inside our
curly braces we're going to say upset is
true and what this will do is if if it
can't find something with the title of
fubar then it's going to create a new
one
alright so that's what this what this
does here so let's run that we got
nothing back which is good and we'll
call find pretty and let's see
title fubar
i D title bar alright so that doesn't
look very pretty
uh-huh
all right so it looks like the body was
also removed when we did that so let's
go back here and put a comma here and
we'll say body
alright so we just added the body as
well okay we have to update that now we
don't have to follow a schema here our
articles have a title and a body and an
ID which is an object ID but we can add
let's add a new article probably easier
just to type but we'll say insert will
create another article with the title of
foo and then after the body let's put a
comma and let's say category and our
category will be web design and let's
show find pretty and you can see that
this article now has a title body and a
category so you can see how much freedom
this gives you you don't have to hard
code a title body category if you just
want to add a category to one entry all
right so that's what's great about
MongoDB and I'm not going to be a
MongoDB fanboy and say that you should
always use this because it's definitely
situations and different programs where
you would need it would be a much better
choice to use something like MySQL so
this isn't an end-all solution alright
so now that we've done create read and
update of course we need to do a delete
or remove so we'll say DB dot
see DVD articles dot remove and we'll
say we want to remove we're title is
equal to bar all right
and now the entry with the title of bar
is now gone all right so that should do
it
to recap we downloaded MongoDB we
installed it and defined our data and
log directories and then we installed it
as a service and we went in and created
a couple entries we did some basic crud
operations and that's that so we won't
be doing much more with MongoDB in the
command line we're going to use the
third party module Mongoose switch which
we installed in our node app and we'll
be dealing with the database through
there I don't know if we'll do that in
the next video because I kind of want to
get into routes a little bit hot and
just create some new routes for our
application but eventually we'll be
dealing with the database through
Express and through Mongoose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
