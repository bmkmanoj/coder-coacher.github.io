we're finally going to get into laravel
so I don't think I've ever had as many
requests for a single video as I've had
for this one and I do have some good
news for you which is that this is going
to be a series initially I wanted it to
be a crash course but I quickly came to
find out that to include all the parts
of laravel that I wanted to cover it's
not going to fit into an hour or even an
hour and a half and that's longer than I
normally like the crash courses to go
plus I know a lot of you guys prefer the
modular series format over the crash
courses so we're not just going to be
covering the fundamentals of laravel but
we'll also be building a project start
to finish so in this video we're going
to take a look at what we'll be building
and we're also going to talk a little
bit about laravel and some some of the
things that it can do so let's go ahead
and get started this video is sponsored
by dev Mountain if you're interested in
learning web development iOS or UX
design dev Mountain is a 12-week design
and development boot camp intended to
get you a full-time job in the industry
to learn more visit dev mountain comm or
click the link in the description below
alright so before I get into what we'll
be doing let's just talk a little bit
about what laravel is so laravel is an
open-source PHP framework and the
creators of laravel have said many times
that they aim to make the development
process pleasing without sacrificing
inequality so laravel is very elegant
and things just kind of seem to to work
together very nicely
not only is laravel popular but it's
also respected which is funny because
there's a lot of programmers that look
down on PHP and I've even had
subscribers straight up tell me they
hate PHP and it sucks and then later on
ask me what I'm going to do the lateral
course so it's almost like they don't
know or don't care that it is PHP and I
think the reason behind that is because
laravel really goes against that
unorganized spaghetti code stigma that
PHP has all right laravel uses the MVC
or Model View controller design pattern
we'll be talking about that throughout
this series but basically the model
deals with the database the view is the
user interface that displays in the
browser
and the controller handles requests
which come from either URLs or forms get
requests post requests deletes and so on
and we'll be covering this stuff
extensively throughout the series all
right so I've come to learn that most of
you don't like the ongoing series where
I release a video once every week or two
and honestly that method is kind of been
a pain in the ass for me as well so
we're going to do this all in one shot
I'm going to finish the series and then
I'll upload one video after another and
it may it may span over a couple days
but we're going to get through this
series before I start something else so
before we look at the project I just
want to go over what what the series
includes
so I'm going to briefly go over the
fundamentals and some slides and just
give you a better understanding of what
laravel can do before we get started and
then in the next video we'll install
composer which is a PHP dependency
manager and we'll install laravel with
that then we'll start on our application
which will basically be a website with a
blog system now I outline this
application in a certain way and that's
so that we can touch on all the main
points that we need to and still create
something from it so it'll be a full
crud application create read update and
delete will create routes controllers
models will deal with database
migrations and all of that all right
then we'll implement authentication so
that users can register and login
we'll add access control we'll add all
the foundation that goes into building
an application all right we're even
going to implement file uploading and
things like pagination so I'm going to
even try to deploy the app somewhere PHP
is usually easier to deploy than
something like nodejs or rails so that
shouldn't be too bad all right so like I
said this course will cover this series
will cover all the fundamentals of
laravel and get you started but if
you're still hungry for more after that
I would highly highly recommend getting
the ten project core so that just
created for our Onix what we talked
about in this youtube series covers
about the first three projects or so at
least the same type of material but
the course will go on to create seven
more projects and I try to make each one
different so for instance we'll deal
with file uploading and storage with the
photo gallery we will build a REST API
with a front-end we'll use the October
CMS in one project which is a production
laravel app will work with the Twitter
API
we'll use view Jas and the contact
manager will use postgrads in the
bookmark manager so I try to make every
project different so it's not the same
thing one after another and if you do go
on you do purchase the course please use
the affiliate link in the description or
go through traversing media I get a
fixed price for these courses and then
the only way that I profit after that is
by affiliate links so I would HIGHLY
appreciate that from you guys all right
and I'm going to be creating my own
udemy courses soon alright so now that
we get that out of the way let's talk
about what laravel actually does for us
alright so why would we choose to build
an application with laravel over just
building it straight up from scratch
there's actually too many reasons to
list so I listed the important ones
so laravel handles routes in an
extremely simple way you can simply
define what URL and what type of
requests that you want to handle now
most MVC PHP frameworks do this as well
such as you know such as code ignitor or
CakePHP but some of them some of the
routing files are really difficult when
dealing with expressions and dynamic
URLs and things like that
laravel makes everything very very
simple which makes it a great candidate
for restful api s laravel also adds a
security layer to your app so it
automatically escapes what it needs to
it implements cross-site protection with
forms and submitting to the database
among other things working with the
database is also incredibly easy laravel
is shipped with an awesome command-line
tool called artisan and lets us do
pretty incredible things with just
single command so one of those things is
to create database migrations now if
you've ever worked with Ruby on Rails or
some of the other frameworks
some pipes some of the Python frameworks
then you know how helpful migrations are
they let us do things like create and
edit tables and columns and set
constraints in the database and much
more now with something like code
ignitor we have to go in and manually do
this stuff either with the console and
SQL commands or something like PHP
myadmin alright laravel also uses the
blade template engine to display views
we can extend layouts we can use control
structures like loops and conditionals
right in the HTML alright so there's
also there's many different ways to
implement authentication but laravel
sets that up for us so it automatically
creates migrations to create the user
table and all we have to do is run a
simple artisan command to enable
everything okay to enable authentication
laravel can handle sessions the latest
version which is 5.4 that's the version
we'll be using it uses laravel mix to
compile assets if I believe 5.3 used
elixir we can easily use SAS which is a
CSS pre-compiled err that lets us use
things like variables and mix-ins
in our CSS alright so there's also a
core storage library to to do all types
of things with files to upload files and
manage them transfer them and so on
error handling is pretty easy to do
messaging things like that unit testing
although we won't be getting into that
collateral does ship with the ability to
run tests all right email configuration
for smtp if you wanted to have like
verification emails sent from your app
things like that and laravel also
handles cache pretty well so these are
just some of the things that some of the
benefits to using this framework so as
far as the environment goes our
development environment I'm going to be
using Windows and we're going to use
xampp which gives us an Apache server
PHP and MySQL on our local machine
everything we need to run laravel it's
completely cross-platform if you have a
Mac or you're using Linux you can use
xampp or
you can use something like lamp or MAMP
man pipe believe is only for mac or you
could just use the native lamp stack if
you're using something like a bun -
which is probably a better option if
you're using Linux but installing the IR
bill is also pretty easy we're going to
use composer which is a dependency
manager this is kind of like NPM if
you're an ojs developer we're going to
install that and then we're going to run
this simple command to create a new
laravel project all right now once we do
we install laravel everything that's
viewed in the browser is going to be put
into the public folder and what we want
to do is set up a virtual host with
apache to point to that folder because
we don't want to have to go and actually
go to slash public it's also a huge
security concern so you definitely want
to create a virtual host and I'll show
you exactly how to do that all right so
I mentioned that laravel has it comes
with artisan which is a command-line
interface and it's incredibly helpful
and easy to use some of the things that
it can do I have listed here but there's
a lot more it can create controllers and
models so we don't have to go and
actually create the files manually and
add the class and so on it can create
the database migration files and run
those migration files it can create
providers events jobs form requests etc
it can show us the available routes in
our application it can we can create
session commands we can run tinker which
is a nice little shell program to
interact with the database so if we want
to quickly insert something or select
some rows or something like that
tinker is a really nice tool for that
you can also create your own custom
commands ok so these are just some of
the things you can do so here are some
examples of artisan commands so what you
would do is PHP artisan and then the
command so list will actually show you
all of the available commands that you
have help if you want to do help and
then a command it will tell it give you
some information on that specific
command make is a really helpful command
that we
we can make different things such as a
controller so in this case we create a -
duze controller we can create models
with make model now models should be
singular and controller should be plural
alright now this - M right here what
this is doing is it's telling it that we
want to also create a migration for this
model because we want to add some field
had a table to the database okay and if
you wanted to create a migration
separately you could say make migration
and give it some kind of descriptive
name in this case add - duze - DB okay
so there's no mistake what this is what
this migration does and then if you want
to run the migration file you can just
do PHP artisan might migrate all right
and then if you want to run tinker and
you want to interact with the database
PHP artisan tinker will do that all
right so eloquent is another really
great feature that laravel uses it's an
ORM or an object relational mapper that
uses active record and it makes working
with models and working with the
database very very easy okay and if for
some reason you didn't want to use
eloquent you don't have to you can just
use the standard DB library and you can
just create raw SQL queries but this is
an example of how we can bring in a
model and save a resource in this case
it's it to do so use app to do is going
to bring the model in then we just
create a variable and we can set it to a
new to do then we can add fields in this
case we're adding a title of some to do
and then we can just call a save
function okay so this will do all the
insert for us we don't have to write
insert into and and all that stuff okay
so it's very eloquent all right so as I
said earlier laravel also uses the blade
template engine which in my opinion is
one of the easiest to use all right it's
very very simple it's also very powerful
we can use control structures like if
statements conditionals loops and so on
we can use PHP tags within the template
we template inheritance is also really
easy we can create views and then we can
extend layouts
what I mean by that is we'll have our
main layout with the HTML and head and
body tags and all that and then we can
just extend the view from that we can
also create custom components which
we're not going to get into in this in
this series so here's an example of a
layout in blade so you can see we have
HTML tags head tags body all that
everything that you want on every single
page and then we can put a title we can
put a dynamic title in here we can add
sections in this case there's a sidebar
section and then we have the main
content or the main view that's going to
yield right here in this yield content
so this is an example of a view that
would extend that layout so all we have
to do is say extends and then put in the
file name we can add this section for in
this case it's the title then we add the
sidebar section we can bring in the
parent which is the main layout sidebar
and then we can add to it if we want so
that this will only be displayed on this
view all right and then we have the main
content here all right so that's going
to be it for the presentation now we're
going to jump in and take a look at the
application that we'll be building all
right guys so this is the application
will be building now we're going to have
two main sections one is going to be the
pages section we're going to have a
pages controller and that's going to
take care of things like the index page
which you're looking at now the above
page the services page and so on so
that's what we'll start with and that's
that's much simpler than getting into
you know the crud functionality so once
we do that we're going to get into the
blog okay so we're going to create a
post controller and we're going to be
able to create read update and delete
posts okay so this is the index page
which will list the posts out if we
click on one that will take us to you
know that individual post and then once
we get the crud functionality working
we're going to then move on to two
authentication all right so we're going
to be able to register let's go ahead
and actually I already have an account
with my name let's let's say Steve Smith
and the email address we'll just say
test
at test comm and then the password I
think that's right all right so now that
that went ahead and registered us and
then it logs you in and you can see up
here we have Steve Smith okay now notice
that there's no blog post on our
dashboard that's because only the posts
that we create are going to show up on
the dashboard so if we go ahead and
create a post let's say blog post for
and we'll just put something in here and
I will just say this is my blog post and
we can upload an image which I don't
think I have any where are they right
here actually yeah laravel images so I'm
going to upload this Keystone image here
these are just screenshots from some of
my videos so we'll grab that will submit
and now you can see we get a flash
message up here post created
there's our post right there you can say
it's written it gives us the date gives
us the user okay we're going to create a
relationship between the users and the
post okay now if we click on that notice
now we have the edit and delete because
we created this post so we can edit and
delete it and if we go over here we can
go to the dashboard and that will show
all the posts we created okay so we can
easily edit it we can easily delete it
okay it gives us a little confirmation
he'll say okay and now the post is
deleted now although it looks very
simple on the surface there's a lot
we're going to get into we're going to
cover all the fundamentals of laravel so
hopefully you guys really enjoy this
series and I will see you in the next
