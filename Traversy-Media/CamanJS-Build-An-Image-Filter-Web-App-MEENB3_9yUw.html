hey what's going on guys in this project
we're gonna build a web application that
allows us to add filters to an image and
add effects and then we can download the
image afterwards and we're gonna be able
to do this because we're using the cam
and Jas library which is used to
manipulate images and it's very easy to
use you can see the syntax here all we
really have to do is say caman pass in
the image pass in a callback and then we
can change the brightness the contrast
and a lot of other things and we can
pass in certain values depending on you
know how much we want to change it we
can also pass in negative values as well
so this will be this this will be what
allows us to actually add the filters
and stuff but obviously we're gonna be
doing a lot more because we have to add
event listeners for our elements we'll
be building this interface with
bootstrap will be using HTML canvas to
display our image so quite a bit will go
into this little application so let's do
a quick demo I'm just gonna click browse
and select an image and if I go when I
click the plus sign for brightness I can
keep clicking it it'll keep getting
brighter if I want it to go back down
I can click the minus same thing with
contrast saturation vibrance and then if
I want to remove the filters I can click
this button here alright and if I want
to add an effect like let's say Sin City
I can remove it nostalgia get some weird
names for these effects what else cross
process and we can we can mix the
filters with the effects as well so
pretty cool now let's say that I was
happy with this this is what I wanted I
could go ahead and click download image
and what will happen is it'll download
as the name and then - edited
dot jpg that's how we're gonna set it up
and we can go ahead and save it and if I
go to show and folder you can see
there's the edited image all right so
that's what we'll be building guys
hopefully you enjoy it and let's get
started all right so we're gonna start
it now if you want to follow along you
only need to create three files so I
have a folder called online image filter
with an index.html a mange a s and a
style dot CSS and they're all completely
empty okay so we're gonna be starting
from scratch as usual so let's start off
with the HTML and I'm using BS code so I
can use Emmet by doing exclamation tab
and that'll give us a basic boilerplate
I'm just gonna close the sidebar for now
and let's change the title will just say
online image filter you can call it
something different if you want and then
we're gonna link our stylesheet so let's
put in style dot CSS and then we're also
using bootstrap but I'm gonna use a
customized version from boots watch comm
and the version I'm gonna use is the
Flatley of course you can choose
whatever you want but I'm gonna click
download and then just grab the the URL
right here okay and we'll put that right
up here in a link tag alright so that
takes care of the head area now we're
gonna start in the body so let's add a
navbar and it's not gonna have any links
or anything it's gonna be very very
simple so let's say nav I'm using Emmet
so I'm gonna add a class of navbar a
class of nav bar - dark BG - info and
let's add a class of md5 which is a
margin-bottom class to push things down
and then I'm just going to throw a
container in here and inside here we'll
have our a tag with the class of navbar
brand and for the text I'm just gonna
say online image filter alright so we'll
save that now you can open this just
with the HTML file or you can if you're
using vs code you can use live server
which is what I'm doing I have an
extension here
called live server which allows us to
have auto reload and stuff like that so
I can just do right click open with live
server and that will open alright so you
can see we have our navbar it looks a
little different because we're using
boots watch that's what I wanted I like
using this once in a while because it
kind of gives you a different look than
the standard bootstrap style
all right so under the navbar we're
gonna throw in let's see let's go under
nav and let's throw in a container and
in the container we're gonna have a row
and in the row we're gonna have a ten
column div so we're gonna do called
medium ten and then I'm also going to
add a class of M - Auto to push it to
the middle
okay margin auto and then in here the
first thing we want is our file upload
so with bootstrap we want to put a class
called custom custom file
yeah just custom file I'm also gonna do
an MB 3 which is margin bottom 3 and
then in here we want two things who want
an input with a class of custom - file
input it's going to be a type of file
and then we want an ID here as well for
us to use in our JavaScript and we're
gonna call this upload - file all right
underneath that we want to label we're
gonna give this a class of custom - file
- label and the for attribute will be
upload - file all right and then in the
text will just say choose image so let's
save that and there's our image upload
field all right now under underneath
that under this div right here of custom
file we're going to put our canvas so we
want a canvas element with the ID of
canvas and if I save that we're not
going to see it because we need to
actually add a little bit of CSS so
we're gonna go to our style dot CSS and
put in our canvas ID here and let's give
it a margin
I'm gonna give it a margin Otto a
background and the color is gonna be EC
three times which is a light gray and
then we're gonna do a width of 100% oops
not eight hundred percent or 100 dollars
and there we go so now we can see the
outline of our canvas alright so back to
our HTML now we're going to go under the
canvas and let's let's put a heading in
here I'm going to put an h4 with the
class of text center to put it in the
middle and let's also do a class of my -
three my just means margin on the top
and bottom and we're just going to say
filters all right under that we're gonna
have a row and this row will have a
class of text Center and let's also do a
class of my for margin on the top and
bottom and then inside here what we're
gonna have is three I'm sorry for three
column divs so we want call MD three and
then each one of these will have one of
the buttons so we'll have the brightness
the contrast and so on now it's not
going to be just a button these were
these are going to be button groups
because we have the the - which is a
button itself the middle which is the
label and then the the right which will
be the plus sign button so let's create
a button group with BTN - group and
let's make it small by saying BTN -
group - SM okay and then in here we want
our three buttons so this one will have
a class of filter - BTN okay all the all
the filters and effects they're gonna
have this filter button class that's
what we're going to use to grab on to in
the JavaScript and then they also need a
special class so we know what it
actually does so this is going to be
brightness - remove in addition to that
we want the bootstrap button class and
then the bootstrap button color class
which is button or BTN - in
okay and then we're just gonna put a
minus sign in there and then the next
will be a button with the class of BTN
BTN secondary which will make it gray
and then I'm also gonna give it a class
of BTN disabled that's not a bootstrap
class but I'll show you why I'm in a
second and then we're just gonna say
brightness okay and then the last button
in the group is also going to have a
class of filter - BTN and then it's
going to have a class of brightness -
add okay the other one was brightness
remove this is add and let's do BTN and
BTN info and we'll put a plus sign in
here so let's save that and that's what
it should look like now the middle you
can see it's it looks like you can click
here and I don't want that so first
thing we'll do is disable the second
button by putting disabled like that
okay but we still have an issue with the
color it kind of still looks like you
can click it so in our style dot CSS I'm
just gonna add BTN disabled oops
BTN disabled and we want to set the
color to always be white and let's make
that important and save or is it
disabled yeah
there we go so now it doesn't look like
I can click on it or I can't I can't
click on it
but we can on the sides here alright now
the other three buttons are going to be
just like this they're just gonna have
different different names and classes
and stuff so I'm gonna copy the entire
call md3 and we're gonna put three more
in so one two three
okay so we have brightness the second
one is going to be contrast and then
what we want to do is change these two
classes brightness remove and brightness
add should now be contrast remove and
contrast add so if I hover over this or
if I highlight this and I
like control-d once it'll select the
next brightness and then we can change
it change them both to contrast at the
same time all right we're going to do
the same thing here with saturation so
we'll go ahead and grab that control D
once saturation and then this will be
vibrance there we go
save and there looks good so now we need
to add our effects so what we want to do
is go under the row the row that holds
these these four columns right here so
it starts here and it ends here and I'll
just put a little comment in here saying
this is the end of the row
and then we're going to create actually
we're gonna need another heading so I'm
just going to copy the one we did up
here and we'll put that here and we'll
change this to effects okay and then
what we'll do is put in another row and
see this row I'm also going to give a
class of MV margin bottom three and
these these are going to be three
columns as well so call em D 3 except
it's not going to be button groups now
they're just gonna be single buttons
okay so let's do button and it'll have a
class again of filter - BTN and then we
want a class of vintage because that's
gonna be this effect - add ok and then
just our bootstrap classes which is BTN
BTN - dark and BTN - block and we'll say
vintage
and if I save it it'll look like that
all right now what I'll do is copy this
column d3 and we want three more one two
three and we basically just want to
change the effect in the class so the
second one is going to be Lomo and we
want to change this vintage add right
here to Lomo add alright this one here
is going to be clarity so we'll make
sure we change the class and let's see
the last one is going to be CIN City
so we'll change the class here now
there's no remove because the effects
we're not going to be able to have a
button to remove the single effect we'll
have to use the the remove filters
button for that all right so let's save
that and then what we'll do is we need
another row of effects so I'm gonna copy
this row let's put a comment here okay
so we'll just grab this and paste that
in and then we just have another few
effects here this is going to be cross
process
I know these are really weird effect
names so change this right here to cross
process I'm not putting any capitals in
my classes let's see this next one is
going to be pinhole pinhole and then we
have nostalgia
and we have what's the last one
her majesty which is really weird so
we'll change this here to her majesty
all right let's save and there we go
there's our effects now we have one more
row to do and that's gonna be the the
download button and the remove filters
button so this is actually gonna be a
we're gonna have two six column divs
here so side by side so column d6 let's
put a button in here I'm gonna give this
an ID of download BTN and class of BTN
BTN primary and let's do BTN block okay
and this is gonna say download image
okay and then we'll just copy the column
d6 which is this paste that in right
underneath and then this is going to be
the the remove filters so we want to
change the ID to let's call it revert
button and let's change button primary
to button danger to make it read and
save all right so that looks good
one thing I'm going to do is just add to
the row my 5 just to give it some space
on the top and bottom and that's it
that's that's our interface now two
things we have to add down here the
script we need to add the the caiman j/s
script and also our main dot j/s script
so caiman j s we can get from cloud fair
I want to use a CDN so this right here
we want the full minified version so I'm
gonna say copy script tag and we'll
throw that in right here
and then we'll also put in our own
script of mange a s and that's it
alright that's it for the HTML at least
so now we're gonna hop over to our
JavaScript so let's go into the main J's
file and close that up so what we're
gonna start off with here is just
defining a bunch of variables so we're
going to be using canvas so let's define
our canvas so we want document dots
we'll use get element by ID remember we
gave the canvas an ID of canvas and then
we want the context of the canvas so
we'll create a variable called CTX set
that to canvas dot get context and I
plan on look I plan on doing a crash
course on HTML canvas soon we just want
to pass in here to D we're not doing too
much canvas stuff here anyways all we're
doing is placing an image in it all
right so let's see we're gonna create a
variable called image and set this to
new image all right now this is gonna be
replaced later that's why I'm using let
okay if you use Const you can't redefine
anything same thing with the file name
I'm going to set this to just nothing
right now
oops just to us an empty string all
right and then let's grab some of the
elements we need like the download
button so we'll use document dot get
element by ID we gave it an ID of
download - BTN and let's see let's
actually copy this down twice because we
also need the upload file
so upload file and that had an ID oops
that had an idea of upload - file
I believe let me just double-check that
so we're looking at our upload yeah
right here upload file and then the last
one we need here is the revert button
which we gave an ID of revert button all
right now initially when I was gonna do
that when I when I was gonna put this
together I was gonna add an event
listener or for every single button here
which would have been bad it would I
guess it would have been bad practice
because we would have we've had we would
have to put every single button into a
variable and then call dot add event
listener on every single one but what
we're gonna do is we're gonna call out
event listener on the document itself
and we're gonna use event delegation to
basically target what we want okay and
then we're gonna have a bunch of else if
statements or if-else statements and
look and we'll look at this here these
classes like contrast remove contrasts
add and based on which class it is
that's that's what's going to decide
which came in method we call okay so
let's do that actually you know what
before we do that let's do the upload
just so we can get the image in here
because we want to be able to select an
image and have it display in the canvas
that's not happening yet okay so let's
do that first so what I'll do is I'll
put it to do here we'll say to do
filters okay and then let's do upload
file now we have our upload file
variable and then we want to call an
event listener on that want to listen
for a change
and we'll just use an arrow function
here all right we'll pass in our event
and in here we want to let's say get
file so I'm gonna create a variable
called file and set that to document dot
get oops document dot get element by ID
and pass in here upload - file and
basically we're gonna have an array
called files and we want the first
element in that array that'll give us
the image so we want to put a 0 in there
all right that'll give us our file now
what we want to do is initialize the
file reader API
okay so if you've never used that before
you might want to look on the MDN Docs
at it and we're basically gonna use this
to get the file and read it as a data
URL and then we're going to insert it
into our canvas all right so let's anit
that i'll say a knit file reader and
we're gonna create a variable called
reader set that to new file reader like
that then we want to check for the file
so if file then
let's set the filename so we're gonna
say file name remember that variable we
created up here it's set to nothing set
to an empty string we're now going to
set it equal to file dot name because we
have that accessible to us now
then what we want to do is read the data
as a URL we're going to do that using
reader dot read read as data URL and
then just pass in the file okay now once
we do that we want to add the image to
the canvas so we're going to say reader
and we're gonna call an event listener
or add an event listener to the reader
and say when it loads then we want to do
a couple things here so first we want to
basically create the image so we can
take our image variable and we're gonna
say equals new image and then let's set
the source of that image so we'll say
image dot source and we can set that now
to the reader dot result okay because we
have it as a URL inside the reader and
now we want to set the image source to
that and then what we'll do is we'll say
on image load add to canvas so we can
say image dot onload equals a function
and in this function will say canvas
okay remember we define canvas way up
above and we're going to set the width
of the canvas to the width of the image
because we can get that same thing with
the height
I can't smell height okay next thing we
want to do is actually draw the image on
the canvas and we can do that using the
context and then we can use draw image
okay draw image takes in a couple of
things it takes in the image itself it's
going to take in where we want it to
start so we're gonna do 0 0 and then it
takes in the width which will be image
dot width and it takes in the height
which will be image dot height okay and
then the last thing we want to do is
take the canvas and we want to remove an
attribute let's say remove attribute
who needs jQuery remove attribute and
the attribute we want to remove is data
a caman - idea I'm not exactly sure why
we do this but it's I don't know it's
instructed to so I think that's pretty
much it but we just want to pass in
false right here and that do what I
believe
actually I don't know if that looks
right hold on yeah that's right so let's
save it now you'll see when I save
things changed up a little bit I mean
the code didn't change is just the
positioning it's because I'm using the
prettier extension it just kind of
cleans up your code a little bit on save
that's how I like I have it set up all
right so let's try the upload so I'm
gonna go back and I'm gonna browse and
grab this image here and there we go so
now it gets uploaded it gets put on to
the canvas alright good so now that that
is is happening now we can work on the
filters so let's go here let's say add
filters and effects okay so like I said
I'm gonna be using event delegation here
instead of putting an event listener on
every single button which which I don't
think is is the best practice so let's
say document dot add event listener it
doesn't have to be the document it can
be any parent of these buttons as long
as they're all inside whatever you put
here but I'm just going to use the
document and I'm gonna say click OK we
want to pass in our event parameter here
and then what we want to do is target
the any anything that has filter button
on it this class here because all of
these do both the plus and minus and the
effects so the way that we can do that
and there's a lot of different ways that
you could do this here but this is just
what I'm doing I'm gonna say e dot
target so whatever is clicked dot class
list okay it's gonna look at whatever
whatever classes the element we click
has and we want to see if it contains
the class of filter - BTN okay we want
to see if it contains that if it does
let's just do a test and we'll do a
console.log
of whatever one two three so if I go
ahead and open up my console here let's
put this on the bottom and I go down and
I click the plot this plus or this plus
or any of these you'll see that it's
actually firing that off if I click
download or remove that's that's not
because those don't have the class of
filter button all right now what we want
to do is check for the individual filter
classes like brightness add or
brightness remove things like that so
this is going to get kind of long
because there's a lot of different
buttons but we're gonna do it in the
same way by using if a dot target dot
class list dot contains and will pass in
here let's do brightness - add so if
that is clicked then we want to call
caman remember we saw this in the
documentation it takes in the canvas
element which is an ID of canvas it
takes in the image which is going to be
in the image variable and then a
function okay don't use an arrow
function here because it won't work we
need to say this dot brightness and then
we can increment it however we want I'm
gonna use five you could do ten or
fifteen or twenty or anything but we're
gonna do five and then we just want to
call dot render okay so that will
increase the brightness by five so we
can actually test out the brightness add
so let's upload the image and let's
click the plus sign here and there we go
now it's not going to work
if I go down or any none of these other
ones are gonna work because we haven't
added them yet but we're basically gonna
do the same thing all right so let's go
down here and let's say else if and
basically we're gonna just going to
check for the next class
whoops hold on a second
else if e dot targets thought classless
dot contains and now we're looking for
brightness or move so if it contains
that then what do we want to do we want
to do caman or came in no no and canvas
image function and then we'll call this
dot brightness dot render except with
this time we're gonna pass in negative
five instead of five okay so let's save
that we'll try that out so we'll make it
brighter and then we'll click the minus
and it gets darker and we can keep
making the darker awesome so now we just
need to do this for the rest of these so
let's just copy the elsif right here so
from the else down to this curly brace
by the way I'm using a vs code extension
called bracket colorizer
which is very handy in situations like
this when you have a hell of a lot of
curly braces
it matches them by color and it's it's
really handy so I would recommend that
but let's copy that paste that in and
next one we'll look for is contrast it's
a contrast ad and then down here all we
want to do is change this dot contrast
to five oops like that
all right I'm actually going to make
this bigger okay so now I'll paste in
else--if again this time we'll do
contrast remove I'm just going to do
ctrl D once to select the next
brightness and change that to contrast
that'll be negative five because it's a
remove all right and then I'm just gonna
paste in a bunch and then we'll go back
up so we have brightness add brightness
remove contrast add contrast remove now
we want what's the next one saturation
so what I'll do is control D actually we
can control the again and again because
both of these will be set all of these
will be saturation except this one will
be saturation ad and we want to take
away the negative here
all right so saturation add saturation
remove all right next we have vibrance
so I'll do control D one two three
vibrance okay this one will be vibrance
ad and that'll be positive five all
right
now that that's it for the filters now
we have the effects so next one is
vintage ad so I'm gonna change this to
vintage - ad change this to this dot
vintage now the effects aren't gonna
take a number it's just gonna be this
dot vintage dot render okay and then
this one here the next one is gonna be
Lomo oops
so we'll change this start
Lomo get rid of that next one is gonna
be clarity I know this is tedious but
trust me it's better than not using the
event delegation and adding an event
listener for every single button and if
you guys have a shorter way of doing it
be my guest to leave a solution alright
so we have a few more so I'm gonna copy
this last else--if okay let's do pasting
that just a couple more
so after clarity I'm sorry this should
be Lomo add clarity add and then the
next one is Sin City add okay you also
want to make sure you change this and
it's gonna be camel case here this dots
in Sin City this next one is going to be
cross process - add and this is going to
be this dot cross process camel case
okay the next one is pin hole add
and this start in hole next one is
nostalgia we're almost there
what is it nostalgia - ad and let's see
the last one is Her Majesty - ad and
then this dot Her Majesty all right so
let's save that and let's try it out
okay so we'll make sure that we get no
errors and that these works I'm gonna
open up my console I'm gonna upload an
image ok let's try our filters
brightness we already know that works
contrast works we can make it higher or
lower saturation works vibrance works
all right we didn't add our remove
filters yet we probably should have but
that's fine let's just reload so now for
the effects we have vintage Lomo and
they're gonna just pile on top of each
other it's gonna look kind of weird
since city
as long as we get no errors it should be
working there we go all right so it
looks like everything's working as far
as the effects and the filters go now
what we're gonna do is add the remove
filters which is really easy so we'll go
right below what we just did and let's
say revert filters and we have a
variable called revert button we'll add
an event listener listen for a click
okay and in here what we'll do is we're
just going to do
camon canvas you can see the syntax for
this is very easy image function and
then we just simply want to call this
dot revert all right we'll save that
let's try it so now if I add some
effects here and I click remove filters
it goes back to normal good all right so
we're getting there guys the last thing
we have to do is the download okay we
want to be able to we don't want to just
mess with the image and that's it just
for the hell of it we want to be able to
download it so let's go down to the
bottom and we're first going to have a
download event so we have a download
button right yeah download button I want
to listen for a click
okay and in here we're going to first of
all get the file extension because
remember we're changing the name we want
it to be the original name - edited dot
jpg so that's that's the logic that
we're doing right here so let's say
Const file extension extension clicking
spell and we're gonna set that to the
file name which is a variable we defined
at the top and we filled when we
uploaded the image which was right here
okay so we want to take that file name
and we want to call dot slice okay
basically want to take stuff off the end
we want to do negative four because we
want to take off dot jpg or dot PNG and
then that'll leave us that'll give us
the the file extension okay so now I'm
just gonna initialize a new file name
variable so we'll say let new file name
and then we're just going to do a check
for the type of file make sure that it's
an image so let's say check or just
check the image type okay so we'll say
if file extension is equal to dot jpg or
file extension
is equal to dot PNG okay if that's true
then let's set that new file name that
we initialized let's set it equal to the
file name and we're gonna call dot
substring yeah substring because what we
want to do here is take off the file
name has the extension still right so we
want to take it off so we're going to
use substring and we're going to put in
a 0 here and then we're gonna do file
name dot length minus 4 okay so that's
gonna basically rip the extension off of
the file name and then what we want to
do is add to that the string of edited
dot jpg okay so hopefully that makes
sense we're taking the file name which
has the extension ripping the extension
off and then adding this should be -
edited dot jpg all right now
the next thing we want to do is actually
we're gonna create a separate function
for the the actual download because
right now we're just we just basically
formatted the name so let's say call
download
I hope all these comments are too
annoying I'm just trying to explain what
I'm doing
so we'll say download that's gonna take
in the canvas because basically we're
just taking it off the canvas and then
we want the new file name all right so
let's create our download function
which takes in canvas and filename and
what we want to do here is we want to
first initialize an event so we're gonna
say let e okay and then we want to
create a link okay we can use this
create element JavaScript method so
we're gonna say Const link equals
document dot create element which we've
used quite a bit in my modern JavaScript
course if you want to check that out on
you to me so we want to create a link
which is an a tag and then let's set
some props or properties I should say
we're gonna say link dot download and we
want to set that to canvas which has a
method called two data URL okay and then
that takes in the type the image type
which is going to be image or the mime
type which is gonna be image slash JPEG
and then we also want to pass in 0.8 I'm
not exactly sure what that is I want to
say opacity I don't really don't know
what that is really and then we're gonna
take the link and say href equals canvas
oh you know what I screwed up I screwed
up this is a trap that's a trap this
this should be linked dot download and
that's just equal to the file name
that's passed into the function sorry
about that
alright so now we want to create a new
Mouse event by saying e which is the
variable we initialized new Mouse event
which will be a click and then finally
we just want to dispatch that event
so we'll say link dot dispatch event and
pass in heat all right so that should
grab it from the canvas and that should
let us download it with the new file
name so let's save it and let's browse
we'll change it up alright so that looks
different and then let's click download
which isn't working all right let's see
I mess something up here to data you
this this should actually be all
capitals URL let's try it again I'll
just add a filter let's do pinhole and
download there we go
and I actually already did this earlier
so I'm gonna delete that and redownload
and look at check the name out so it's
the the original name is amazing natural
photo now it's amazing natural photo -
edited because of the logic that we did
up here alright so let's save that and
let's go ahead and open that in the
folder and there it is alright so we now
have an application where we can upload
an image and view it we can add filters
and effects and then we can redownload
it and get that that edited
all right so that's it guys hopefully
