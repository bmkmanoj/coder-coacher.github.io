version 5 has been released and in this
video we're gonna talk about some of the
new features and optimizations that have
been added in this new version alright
now first off I want to say that
technically we're not supposed to be
referencing it as angular 4 or angular 5
it's just angular just like you wouldn't
specify the version number for react or
view j/s or any other framework I know
the change from angularjs to angular
angular 2 kind of traumatized us all by
putting out a completely different
framework but it's not like that for
future releases so everything you know
about angular 2 when angular 4 will
serve you in version 5 6 and so on ok so
as with angular 2 too for most of the
changes are actually under the hood
they don't really affect the syntax and
how we write our applications if we go
and we install angular 5 right now
you're you'll see that there's there's
not really any changes in the core app
files google has stated that the main
theme for this update is to make angular
faster smaller and easier ok so this is
going to be an overview of some of the
changes and I will put a link in the in
the description for the official blog
post from angular dot IO alright so
let's start off by talking about package
updates now the CLI angular CLI version
1.5 now we'll install angular 5.0 point
0 by default alright
typescript has been updated from version
2.3 to version 2.4 and reactive
extensions from version 5.4 25.5 alright
I'm not sure of all the different you
know functionality changes in those two
separate packages you might have to go
look at the change log to look at those
separately but just know that those
those are the only other two core
packages that have been updated all
right so version 5 will include the
build optimizer for production builds
created with angular CLI this is a tool
that includes it's included from for
making your bundle smaller
basically works by doing two different
things it makes parts of your
application PR removing parts of the app
that aren't needed and then it also
removes the decorators from the
applications runtime code okay because
they're used by the compiler and they're
not actually needed at runtime this in
turn will create allow you to create
smaller production bundles and it'll
speed up your application alright so you
know as I said the main focus of this
update is speed and optimization all
right another optimization update is
with version 5 the äôt or the ahead of
time compiler has been optimized to be
much faster in version 5 than it was in
version 4 and it's also going to be on
by default ok before you had to specify
the - - äôt flag if you wanted to use
the ahead of time compiler but now it's
gonna be default when you run ng build
now basically the äôt converts your
angular and typescript into efficient
JavaScript code during the phase before
the browser downloads it and runs it
this is different than the JIT or
just-in-time compiler which compiles
your app in the browser at runtime and
that's what we've been using you know up
until now now using äôt gives you
faster rendering fewer asynchronous
requests smaller download sizes it also
detects template errors earlier so
there's a lot of benefits to it they're
really focused on making angular faster
in development and in production alright
we also have watch mode which will only
compile what's necessary we can specify
this with ng C - - watch there's also a
diagnostic flag for checking how much
compile time was spent in watch mode
watch mode is expected to be on by
default in the future but if you want to
use it now you have to use this - -
watch alright so progressive web apps
now one of the the biggest goals for
angular you know from now on is to make
it is to make it easier to create
progressive web apps with the framework
this includes a flawless app like user
experience regardless of the browser or
the
Factor etc now this is something that
hasn't been perfected but it's something
they're definitely aiming for with
version 5 and so on
you know version 5 and on one of the
Google engineering directors said that
they're trying to find the right set of
defaults so that a progressive web app
would be the default option for
developers when creating a an angular
application so they're working on
improving the angular serviceworker
package which is still in beta i believe
it offers features like caching static
assets by default caching external
resources there's even support for push
notifications so this all makes for
better support for creating progressive
web apps with angular alright so there's
also a new HTTP client basically it's
smaller faster easier to use the angular
HTTP library is getting deprecated so
you know how we've been doing you know
import HTTP client from angular slash
HTTP that's going to be deprecated and
we're going to be using this from
angular slash common slash HTTP okay you
can still use the other one but just
know that it is getting deprecated it
will be it will be gone in the future
but it does work right now all right and
you can also remove the map res to res
dot JSON calls these are no longer
needed with the new HTTP client so
that's something you may want to check
out also angular form validation there's
been some updates now this is another
thing people were complaining about with
angular 4 especially with template
driven forms in my course in my angular
4 front-to-back course your validations
would basically run on every input blur
event so you click on the field you know
you don't have enough characters or
whatever you don't fill anything in and
then you click out which causes a blur
event and then you get the error and
you'll get this on every field well now
you can have it happen on your
submission ok on submit if you
you can specify in the form tag ng form
options and you can say updated on
submit okay so that the validations run
when the forms submitted or you can of
course keep it as you know when you when
you cause a blur event on each
individual input by using ng model
options and then update on blur alright
so I think that that's a pretty good
update as far as you know functionality
there's not many updates in terms of
syntax and functionality but I think
this is a good one
and of course you can also do this with
reactive forms I didn't include that
syntax but you can go to the blog post
and it'll show you that alright another
big change is with pipes so purr pipes
are alike template filters there's core
pipes and then you can also create your
own custom pipes
now they've internationalized the number
the date and the currency pipes to
increase standardization and eliminate
the need for polyfills if you if you're
in other countries before version 5 they
relied on the browser to provide you
know number date and currency formatting
now they'll use their own implementation
so the old pipes module is going to be
deprecated but you can still use it by
importing this this deprecated I 18 and
pipes module and you can still use that
for now all right
I actually welcome this change because
we were having some issues with with
people in my course dealing with the
pipe with the currency pipes and the
date pipes and stuff like that
alright so version 5 also added new
lifecycle events for the router a life
cycle event or hook allows you to
specify a certain point in the loading
of your components we can now do this
with the router so we can do things like
show spinners on specific router outlets
when a child component is loading or we
can measure performance of router guards
like authentication guards things like
that these are all the hooks that you
can use so I have them all listed here
you can find them in the official blog
post as well another thing that may be
noteworthy about the router
is that it's now possible to reload the
page when the router gets a request to
navigate to the same URL this was
ignored before and in we couldn't really
create a true refresh button in our
application so now we have the option
where we can specify in the ng module we
can specify on same URL navigation which
can be set to either reload or ignore
okay ignore is the default but we can
now set it to reload all right so see
rxjs reactive extensions 5.5 imports so
before if we wanted to use the map
operator or the filter operator we would
have to import it like this well this
has now been updated and we can now do
this instead so you can see we can use
destructuring we can just say import map
filter whatever other operators from our
XJS operators all right so not really
you know a huge change or a huge
optimisation but it definitely does make
the code look a little cleaner alright
so there's also been some improvements
when it comes to angular Universal
angular Universal provides server-side
rendering of angular applications and
can boost performance in version 5 it's
now easier to share application state
between the server and the client
there's a new module in version 5 called
server transfer state module which
basically optimizes fetching data over
HTTP for example by transferring state
from the server you don't have to make a
second HTTP request once the app makes
it to the client okay I don't believe
that there's any documentation yet for
this so I don't know too much about it
but I do know that this is part of the
update angular Universal is also now
offering more support for the Dom using
something called Domino so you know more
Dom manipulation within server-side
contexts will be possible all right so
if you're using angular Universal you
may have some some nice some nice
changes there all right so some other
changes and optimizations obviously you
know bug fixes that's
you know various bug fixes with all
updates you can now choose to preserve
your whitespace or not in your templates
in the past you know tabs new lines
spaces all that stuff in your templates
have been recreated and included in your
build by the compiler but you can now
choose whether or not you want to
preserve that whitespace and you can do
that right in the component decorator or
you can edit your type scraped type
script config file which currently
defaults to true okay so you can change
that from true to false if you want and
preserve that whitespace you can also
use export as now to to add multiple
names for your components and your
directives you can also choose to bypass
zones entirely which can boost your
performance zones are sort of an
execution context that allows us to hook
into asynchronous tasks if you don't
need or want to use zones you can now
bypass them by adding this this ng zone
noop object here inside of your your
main your bootstrap module method call
within the main TS file all right so
just some other small changes in
optimizations from version four alright
so as you can see there's really not
much in terms of everyday development
you shouldn't have any horrible braking
changes if you in your angular 4 app if
you update at angular 5 if you do update
an existing app just be sure to update
typescript 22.4 the only real issue you
may have in a standard angular app after
updating is with pipes if you use pipes
specifically the the date and the
currency pipes you also may want to
start using the new HTTP client as well
other than that most of the changes have
to do with you know optimization and
speed under the hood that don't really
have anything to do with our develop our
you know syntax and the way that we code
and things like that alright so if
there's any changes that I did miss and
