month and a half ago I created a series
called view Jas and fire store build and
deploy and we built an employee manager
which is basically a crud application
that uses the fire store platform that
that is part of firebase and I've got a
lot of requests from viewers and from
patrons asking to implement
authentication for this application and
I know I mean it's not a huge you know
hugely popular series but I really want
to fulfill those requests especially
from the patrons so we're gonna do a
video where we take the app that we
built and implement view j/s and
firebase authentication so that we can
login and register now
there's a couple ways that you can watch
this video you can just watch it and see
how its implemented you can start from
the very beginning with with part one of
the series and go through that if you
haven't already or you can just do what
I'm gonna do in this video and just pull
from the repository and get the current
application and then just add the
authentication to it okay so if we look
in my firebase back-end here you can see
I have two users created I'm going to
use this brad at gmail.com this is the
apple if the application will be
building this is after we add the lot
the authentication you can see we have a
register and login link and then I'm
just going to go ahead and log in as
that brad at gmail.com user
and it's just gonna say you're logged in
as Brad gmail.com and now it's gonna
redirect us to the dashboard okay so
this is the stuff we built throughout
the series we have the list of employees
and their their department we can view
each one we can delete them we can we
can also edit them if we go down to this
edit icon here we can add them if we hit
this plus icon so it's just a crud
application but we're gonna implement
authentication you can see we have the
logged in users email up here and we
also have a logout link and if I try to
go to slash login while I'm already
logged in it'll redirect us back to the
dashboard same thing if you know if I
try to go to the dashboard while I'm not
logged in it'll redirect us to the login
page okay so it'll show you how to
implement authentication how to create
routing guards and view j/s so if you're
interested in view I'd highly recommend
watching it and following along so let's
go ahead and get started all right guys
so the first thing we're gonna do is
create our firebase I already have the
dev one here but I want to start from
absolute scratch so you can follow along
so if you already did this and you are
and you still have the application on
your machine then just use that but if
not and you're starting from scratch
let's go ahead and create a new project
and just gonna call this M manager and
we'll create this looks like firebase
added this nice little spin preloader
thing to their UI seems slower though so
let's click continue now we have our
back-end so from here what we're gonna
do first of all is go to authentication
and you actually have to enable
authentication so if we say set up
sign-in method we want the email and
password method so I'm going to click
the little pencil icon and just enable
this okay that way we will be able to
sign up and log in with emails and
passwords next thing I'm going to do is
just create a couple entries in our
database and create our collection so
we're using cloud fire store
and again if you have the application
already you already went through the
series you don't have to do this alright
we're gonna go ahead and start in test
mode and enable ok we'll just add a
couple records as well all right so
let's go and add a collection and we're
gonna call this employees and we're
gonna have an employee number or an
armed sorry an employee ID employee
underscore ID which is gonna be a string
and let's say zero zero one okay we'll
add another field this will be the name
I'll say John Doe let's add another
field this will be the department and
we'll say IT we'll add one more field of
position and this will be lets say
server admin ok so we have a collection
now called employees and we have one one
record who is the John Doe employee so
let's add one more I'm going to click
add document and add one more employee
so this will be lets say employee ID
employee ID will be zero zero two and
let's say name we'll say Mary Williams
and it's add another field will say
departments and department will be
sales and position I'll say Sales
Manager all right so let's add her and
now we should have two users or two
employees all right so our back-end our
firebase back-end is all set so now what
we want to do is grab the application of
course if you haven't already built it
and still have it on your machine this
is the git repository for it it's view
fire store employee manager and I could
just clone it with the git but I'm just
going to download it
just download the zip file to my desktop
okay and then we'll just go ahead and
open that up and let's extract the
folder from it and we'll use that as our
application folder so now what I'm going
to do is open this with vs code of
course you can use whatever a text
editor you want and we have all the
files over here now we're gonna have to
run npm install to install all the
dependencies so what i'm gonna do is
open up my integrated terminal here of
course you can use whatever terminal you
want i'm also using git bash and i'm
gonna just run npm install alright so
that's all set now what we want to do is
just run the dev server so we'll say npm
run dev and it should start up on port I
believe it's 8080 yep so we'll go and
open up a browser and let's go to local
host and port 8080 okay so if you don't
already have your application set up
you're gonna see this you're not gonna
see your employees because we haven't
connected our database our firestore to
the application so to do that we're
gonna go back to our firebase and just
go to our project overview and click on
this icon here add firebase to your web
app and we just want to grab everything
that's within this config object so
we'll just copy all of that and then
we'll go back to this code or whatever
you're using and then we're gonna go
into source and components and I put
everything in this firebase config J's
file so I'm just going to replace this
because this is the old information that
database doesn't exist anymore so I'm
going to paste all that stuff in and
save and now if we go back to our
application you can see there's john doe
and mary williams alright so we have our
our application up to the point that
that we had it in the end of the series
so just to test it out we'll create a
new a new employee let's say Sam Smith
Department IT and we'll say developer ok
we'll go ahead and submit and there we
go alright so everything's working now
we're gonna move on to the
authentication so the first thing I'm
gonna do is create a login and a
register component cave UJS is component
base just like every other framework and
we're gonna create those so in the
components folder let's create a new
file called logon dot view alright now
we're gonna put our template in here and
you guys know I hate copying and pasting
but this is just pure mock-up here so
I'm gonna paste in the login form the
materialized CSS login form we'll just
go over it real quick so we have a div
with a class of container to keep
everything in the middle we have a row
we're using the grid system it's going
to be stacked it's going to be 1212
column div on mobile devices on small
screens and it's gonna be 8 columns on
medium screens and higher with an offset
of 2 so it'll be pushed into the middle
and then we just have a div it's a card
panel I also gave it a class of login
and it's going to be green with white
text and center then we just have our h3
we have a form with two fields email and
password I'm using the materialized
icons which I think we still need to add
to the index.html in order to use but
we'll just have the little icons as well
and then a simple button with some
materialized classes to make it grey and
lighten with black text alright so I
just didn't want to go through and type
all that in now for the script of our
module let's put in our script tags so
we're gonna say export default and let's
give it a name name of login and then
we're gonna do data
which will be a function and we want to
return for now I'm just going to return
nothing we're gonna add more to this
later I just want to get it displayed so
let's save this and now what we'll do is
go into our router so we want to go into
the router folder and then index J s and
I'm gonna go right below the home right
here
and create a new route okay actually we
have to bring in the component first so
let's say import log in from and then we
want to do at slash components slash
login ok and I just want to add
semi-colons here I'm using prettier so
when I save it'll automatically add
semi-colons and then for the route let's
finish this we'll say path path is going
to be slash login and the name is gonna
be login and the component is gonna be
login ok actually the name will be a
lowercase L so that's that let's save it
and let's see what happens if we go to
our login route let's see so let's open
up our console see what's going on route
config component for path logging cannot
be a string ID using actual component
instead what did I do
login cannot oh I put quotes around this
alright let's try that whoops wrong
thing ok so let's try and go to slash
login and there we go now the icon isn't
showing up because we need to include
the material icon script so I'm going to
search for material icons CDN and it
should be on this page somewhere
right here so we'll grab this link and
go back to vs code and let's go to our
index.html that's in the root and I'm
just going to put this right below the
materialized CSS include and save that
and now we should be able to if I reload
nope why isn't it showing oh there we go
all right um let's see now these labels
those should be white so I think I
forgot something if we go back into the
template you had a label right here we
won't just want to add the class of
white text same thing here okay and that
should you know what let me close this
other browser okay
so now we have our login form now we
might as well create the register form
it's gonna be pretty much the same thing
just gray so what we can do is just copy
we'll just copy everything here and
create a new component file called
register dot view and we'll paste that
in and we'll change the h3 to register
and let's also change and say we'll
change this from green to gray and let's
do a lighten dash for okay and we also
want black text
and we want to get rid of this white
text on the label now and we'll also
change this to register let's go down to
our script tag let's change the name
here to register and save and then we're
gonna add the route just like we did for
the login so we'll just take this and
copy it down and let's change this to
slash register this will be register and
the component which we need to bring in
will be register all right so let's go
up top here and we'll go ahead and just
copy this down and we'll bring in
register sorry about that
let me put this on vibrate alright so
this will be from components slash
register so now that route should work
as well hopefully so let's try it out if
we go to slash register there we go
alright now let's add these is
navigation links so we're gonna go to
our navbar component which is right here
and we need to add a bunch of stuff to
this so under the let's see we'll go
right under the router link here and
we're gonna have a ul with the class of
right because we want our links to go to
the right and we want some list items
and inside these list items we're gonna
have some links but remember we need to
use the router link
okay so we'll say router - link and this
one is going to be to the dashboard so
we're gonna give it a two attribute and
it's gonna go to just slash and we'll
say dashboard alright and then we'll
copy down let's do yeah we'll do two
more so this one will be login
and it'll go to /login and this one will
be register all right so let's save that
see if they'll show up okay so now we
can switch between login and register
good and we can see the dashboard but
don't worry about that we just want to
get the actual login and sign up
functionality done first and then we'll
hide the dashboard and all that all
right so now what we need to do is go
into let's do the register first okay so
we'll go into our register component
that we just created and we're gonna go
down to where our script is and first
thing we want to do here is right above
the export default we want to import
firebase so that we can use it so we're
gonna say in for import firebase from
firebase okay and then for our data
we're gonna have an email and a password
property so we're gonna say email just
set that to nothing by default same
thing with password and then underneath
the data we want to put a comma and we
want to put methods okay so we're gonna
have a register method so that'll be
function and I'm gonna pass in an event
parameter here and then let's just do a
dots prevent default
and what we want to do here let's
actually just do a console.log for now
so I'll say console.log register alright
now in order to call this we want to go
up to our button and we want to add in a
V on directive so let's say V - on so we
want to say on click we want to call
register and we also want to bind the
this email and password to these input
fields so we're gonna use V model for
that so on the input field for email
it's do V - model and email and if you
watch the series this should be nothing
new and then same thing with the
password so V - model password okay and
that should do it now we should be able
to actually submit to this register
method so let's save that let's go back
to Chrome and go to register and we
could just put whatever in here and
register and you can see down here we're
logging register alright so now what we
want to do is implement firebase so
we'll get rid of the console log and
what we want to do is call firebase dot
or dot and then we want this create
let's see does it pop up for us yeah
create user with email and password
that's a very long function name and
then we want to pass in this dot email
which is our email property and this dot
password which is our password ok that's
going to return a promise so we want to
do a dot then and inside here it'll give
us a user I'm just going to use an arrow
function here and then once it gives us
the user back I'm just gonna do a simple
alert and we'll put some back ticks in
here and we'll just say account
created four and then we'll put in our
variable we can use we can take that
user object and we can use email so user
dot email okay once we do that we just
want to read it we want to basically
reload the page well actually you know
what you'll see why why we have to just
reload later but for now I'm just gonna
I'm just gonna redirect okay so I'm
gonna say this dot router dot push and
let's go to the let's go to the homepage
so slash or the dashboard alright and
then if there's an error we can we can
go ahead and actually want to go
underneath I want to go right here put a
comma and say error so if there's an
error we will alert the error message
like that alright and I think that that
should do it so let's save and I'm using
prettier so when I save some things will
get changed up sometimes it's not what I
want but for the most part it's it's a
pretty great extension so let's try this
out let's go to register and let's put
something in here so I'll do Brad let's
do Brad at yahoo.com not a real email
address and then I'll just put a pass or
it in and register account created for
Brad at Yahoo and ok and we get
redirected so what it did is it created
an account and it actually logged us in
now if I go to my firebase backend then
I go to authentication you'll see right
here Brad a yahoo.com so it's that easy
to to register all the stuff that we
just did creating the form and all that
that that's all for the UI but the
actual registration is this right here
so pretty simple
but I like to do things you know from
from beginning to end so I didn't want
to just show you guys this I want to
actually do a practical project alright
so now let's do the login so what we'll
do is let's go to our login dot view
file and we can actually copy what we
didn't register cuz it's very very
similar so let's see let's grab data and
the methods which end right here so I'll
copy that and put that in the login I'll
just replace this data right here and
paste all that in and again we're gonna
have our email and password and we need
to go up above and do the same stuff so
for the button we want AV on click so V
on click equals and it's going to be a
function called login and then we also
want to bind our pass our email and
password so we want to go to the input
and do a V model equals password and for
the email the model equals email okay
and then down here let's change the name
of the method to login and instead of
all we need to bring in firebase as well
okay so instead of calling off dot
create user with email and password we
want to call off dot sign-in or is it
sign-in with email and password and then
again pass in the email and password
gives us a promise gives us the user
we're gonna say instead of account
created we'll say you are logged in as
and then that user okay and then we'll
just push to the dashboard so that
should work so we'll save that and if we
go back let's go to login now let's see
what happens if I just try to log in so
we're gonna get the message directly
from firebase so it just says the email
address is badly formatted if I were to
put something in here that doesn't exist
in firebase like test to test com the
password is invalid or the user does not
have a password okay if I were to put
something that exists like Brad at
yahoo.com but have a wrong password will
get the password is invalid same thing
but let's let's do the correct password
and it says you are logged in as Brad at
Yahoo okay so we are in fact logged in
so now what I want to do is create a log
out button so let's go back to vs code
and let's go to our nav bar and let's
see up here let's go under the register
and create an Li and then we're actually
gonna put a button in here so I'm going
to say button I'm gonna give it a class
of BTN and black and we'll just say
login
I'm sorry log out
and we want to add aviÃ³n directive here
in the button so V on click is gonna
equal a method called logout alright now
we have to go down here and create all
of our stuff our script tags and we need
to bring in firebase alright and what we
want to do is export Explorer default
and let's say name navbar basically
before it was just a dumb component and
had no functionality or anything it was
just a display but now it's gonna have
some functionality so for the data we
want to say return and there's gonna be
two pieces of data one is is logged in
because we want to be able to hide
certain navigation items based on if
we're logged in or not so we'll set that
to false to start with and then we also
want current user and we'll set that to
false okay
and then what we want to do is create
our logout method so I'm going to go
under the data and say methods so we'll
do methods and we'll have logout okay so
to logout we're gonna take our firebase
object and we're gonna call dot off and
then we're gonna do dot sign out and
then that'll give us a promise so we
need to do dot then and inside here I'm
just gonna use an arrow function and
let's say this dot router dot push and
we'll go to our login so slash login
alright so let's try that we'll save and
let's see all right so if I reload if we
logout it should take us back to login
now we can still go to dashboard and
everything we need to create a guard so
that we can't do that so that we can
only go to the dashboard and any other
page really if we're logged in so let's
go ahead and implement that so to do
that we're going to go to our router
which is the router folder and XJS and
we want to import firebase here
all right and then any routes that we
want to protect we want to add a meta
object to so for the home let's say meta
and we're gonna say it requires off and
we're gonna set that to true okay
anything that we want to protect where
you have to be authenticated we want to
add this too so let's copy this let's
also add it to new employee view
employee and edit employee okay so we
want that for all of those now I also
don't want you to be able to go to login
or register if you're a guest or if
you're not logged in so what i'm gonna
do is i'm also gonna paste it in paste
meta in here but i'm gonna change this
to requires guests okay so we'll do that
here as well so requires guests
okay now that alone isn't gonna do
anything we need to actually create our
guard so let's go down here we'll say
now guards so the way that this is set
up we're saying export default new
router and we don't actually want to do
that now because we need to add a method
or use the before each method of the
router so we need to put router into a
variable so instead of exporting it here
what we'll do is we'll say let's router
equals and then the new router and so on
so that way we can go down here and we
can use that router variable and we can
now call dot before each okay now before
each takes in a few things I'm gonna use
whips I'm gonna use an arrow function so
it takes in two from and next okay so
will use an arrow here and then
basically we want to
for required off-guard so to do that we
can say if and we can say if - we can
take that to object which is right here
and it has a method called matched so -
dot matched dot sum and then this gives
us a record so record and I'm going to
use an arrow function here and then
we're gonna say record dot meta dot and
then whatever the guard was which is
requires off yeah we want requires off
okay so if this is true that means that
the route requires authentication so now
we want to check to see if we're
actually logged in to firebase okay so
we're gonna say check if in this case if
not logged in so we can do that by
saying if not and then use our firebase
object so firebase dot off dot current
user okay it's as easy as that to get
your user from firebase firebase doth
current user we're saying if not okay
and if it's not then we want to go to
the login page and we're gonna do that
by calling next okay so right here we
have this next to call but we want to
pass in an object with a path that we
want to redirect to which will be slash
login all right and then we're also
going to add a query here which is an
object and we're gonna say redirect
to dot the full path okay so that what
will happen is if we're not logged in
it'll redirect us to the login okay and
then we want an else to this right here
else meaning that we are logged in then
all we have to do is proceed to the
route by calling next okay so that's it
now the next thing I want to do is test
for the requires guests and that's gonna
be the opposite it's gonna it's going to
redirect us if we are logged in okay
because we don't want to go to the
register or login page so we're gonna do
an else if right at the end of this so
else if and then we can basically just
let's grab that and paste that and
except we're going to change it now to
requires guests like that
so if it requires guests then let's see
we can actually copy what we put in here
yeah we can copy that and paste that in
except now we're going to check to see
if the user is logged in so check if
logged in and we'll remove the
exclamation so if they're logged in then
we want to redirect them to the
dashboard to slash okay else then
proceed to the route now if there is no
requires auth or requires guests we want
to call next
so after this else if right here which
ends right here we'll just put a simple
else and we'll just say we'll just grab
this right here and say proceed to the
route okay so hopefully that makes sense
I don't know why this comment is down
here
so just to reiterate if it's gonna check
for requires off if the route has
requires off attach to it it's going to
make sure we're logged in if it's not
then it'll redirect us to the login page
if it has requires guests and we're
logged in and we try to go to that which
is login or register it'll redirect us
to the dashboard if it doesn't have
either one then it'll just proceed to
the road
so hopefully that that makes sense now
the last thing we need to do is actually
export the router ok because remember we
change the export above to just
assigning it to a variable so now we
want to explore it default router like
that ok so hopefully that works so now
let's go to our application and let's
see if we go to dashboard so we're not
logged in right now I go to dashboard
let's try to go to it manually we can't
now let's login ok so we're logged in ok
and now we're in the dashboard so it
seems to be working and we should be
able to go to all of our other routes as
well because we are logged in ok if I
log out and I try to go back I'll just
click on it here it doesn't let us if I
try to go to slash new which is the new
add new employee page I can't do that
either so everything is now restricted
now let's try if we are logged in
what is it Yahoo
let's make sure that we can't go to the
login page okay so if I say slash login
we can't do it if I say slash register
can't do it alright now we do have
another problem here if I were to now
we're logged in if I were to reload it
actually does take us to the login page
because it's not checking for the user
before it loads so we actually have to
go into our main J's file which is right
here okay where it's actually
initializing view and we have to check
for the user or not check for the user
but check to see if the authentication
state has changed so we're gonna do a
couple things we're gonna bring in
firebase I know this this is kind of a
lot to do but it's it's necessary to get
the functionality that we want so we
want to bring in firebase now you also
need your firebase config or
initialization I should say which is in
this firebase init file okay this is
where we initialize the app so we're
also going to bring in that file so
let's do imports and it's in the
components folder and then it's firebase
and knit okay so now what we're gonna do
is basically wrap this in the on off
state changed firebase method so let's
do it let's just do this up top first so
we're gonna say let app we're going to
initialize the variable called app and
then we're gonna say firebase dot and
we're gonna call on auth state changed
okay and then we're gonna pass in a
function I'm just going to use an arrow
it takes a user
okay so we'll go like that and then
we're gonna check to see if not app so
we're gonna say if not app then we want
to set that app variable to our view
initialization so this right here so
what I'll do is just copy or I'll just
cut this actually we can get rid of this
so I'm going to cut that and put that in
this app variable now okay and then I
think that that should work so let's
save and then let's go back to our
application and let's say we're logged
in right so if I reload now you see it
doesn't go back to the login screen
we're still in the the dashboard which
is what we want if we go to another page
and reload we stay in that page so that
fixed that alright guys so we're almost
there now what last thing we need to do
I'm pretty sure it's the last thing we
need to fix our navigation we're logged
in right now so there's no sense in
having login and register and if I log
out we don't want logout and dashboard
okay that doesn't make much sense so
let's fix that so what we'll do is go to
our nav bar which is right here and
let's see remember we have the is is
logged in and current user what we want
to do now is call the created method our
created function which will run right
when the component is created so in here
I want to test to see if we're logged in
so we can do that we brought in firebase
already right here so we can say if
firebase a firebase dot off dot current
user
that means we're logged in so if that's
true then let's say this dot is logged
in this property right here let's set
that to true
okay let's also set this dot current
user equal to firebase dot off dot
current user but we only want the email
this will give us the entire object I
just want the email and we'll put it in
there okay now what we can do is we can
go up above to our lengths and we can
add a directive so for the dashboard
we'll say V if you'll say V if is logged
in okay then show that link this is the
login link here so we'll say V if oops V
- if is not logged in so exclamation is
logged in then we want to show that
login link same with the register so is
not is logged in and then the logout
obviously we want to show that if we're
logged in so that'll be is logged in
okay so let's save that and if we go
back you'll see now the logout link and
the dashboard is it's hidden now if I
log in
okay now notice that the navbar did not
change because what happened is the
navbar didn't rerender if I reload it we
see it it works but it's it doesn't
rerender right when we login and that's
remember I said that later on I'm not
gonna want to just push to or to
redirect I'm gonna want to reload
everything so whoops so what I want to
do is go to our login component we're
gonna do this in a couple places
actually and see where we did the push
that is not gonna rerender the navbar so
what I want to do is I want to change
this to this dot router dot go and you
guys might have a better solution to
this or just to anything else and feel
free to let me know but this is just the
one that what I what I found worked so
if we say this dot router dot go and
then pass in a path of this oops this
dot router dot path that will actually
reload everything rerender everything
including the navbar so what I'll do is
copy this and save and we want to do the
same thing in a couple other places one
of those places is the register okay
because we want that the navbar to
re-render there as well so we'll paste
that in here and then we also want to do
it let's see let's go to our navbar
component and right here when we log out
we also want to do that save that and I
think that's it trying to think of all
trying to think of all the situations we
have log in register log out I think
that should do it so let's log out all
right so now the correct links are
showing if I log in now
that's Yahoo okay and there we go so now
we have the correct links right away we
don't have to reload the page all right
same thing if we log out there we go if
we sign up let's do test at test comm
and register and there we go so now
we're logged in one thing I did forget
to do is the email address I want to
show that up here so let's go back to
our navbar component and all we have to
do is create a new list item so we'll go
see where let's let's do it at the top
yeah we'll do it right above the
dashboard link right here and we're
gonna do for this list item a V if so
this is is logged in so if if we're
logged in then let's see we're just
going to put a span here with the class
of email and the class of black text and
then inside here we can simply put
current user okay and that current user
is cut is this property which is getting
filled here with whatever the current
logged in user is now I just want to add
a little padding to the right so
remember I gave it the class of email so
what I'm gonna do is put a style tag in
here and we can say scoped and let's say
dot email padding right let's do 10
pixels and save let's take a look and
there we go so we're logged in as test
at test comm okay if I were to log out
and go as Brad
then that's what shows up there alright
guys so we have successfully added
authentication to this app I know this
was kind of a long video hopefully stuck
with me through it and I will wait to
push this to the github repository so
that you guys can actually get the you
know the old version of the app without
the login and then you can go in and
follow along and you can add it yourself
