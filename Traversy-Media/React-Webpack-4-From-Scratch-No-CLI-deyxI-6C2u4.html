hey what's going on guys so a lot of you
know that I've been working with the
react framework lately and I'm almost
done with a full stack application for
my myrn course which is MongoDB Express
to react and nodejs and of course we'll
be using Redux and it should be released
within 2 or 3 weeks give or take I am
moving so it's it's delayed things a
little bit but it will be a small social
network it'll be full stack will be
using JWT authentication so it'll be a
pretty in-depth course probably my most
in-depth and it will be just one
application because it's a good-sized
application but anyways aside from that
I had a request from one of my patrons
named Vita and he said if it's possible
could you make a short video from
scratch about how to create a react app
and web pack or parcel without using
create react app and if those of you
that don't know create react app is a
CLI where it just kind of just sets up
your whole boilerplate for your react
application with one command so he goes
on to say I know that create react app
is very useful but in my opinion is it's
created a lot of things that I don't
know why and how they work
I tried googling it found some articles
on medium some are very useful but I'm
still having problems creating the app
alright so I always like to answer my
patrons and fulfill their requests if if
they're doable and it's something that's
you know not gonna take me forever so in
this video what we're gonna do is create
a react application from scratch we're
going to be using webpack 4 which is the
latest version there's some changes with
the config file and so on so we're gonna
do that we're going to create a script
to run a dev server
using webpack dev server it'll have hot
reload we'll also create a build script
so that we can quickly build out our
application for deployment basically all
the really useful stuff that the CLI
gives us but we'll be doing it from
scratch ok I'll be I'll also be pushing
it to github so that if you want you can
use that instead of create react app and
you can customize it and do whatever you
want with it alright so hopefully you
guys enjoy this video let's get started
alright guys so I have vyas code open
here I have a completely blank folder
called react web pack starter so that's
what I'm gonna call it and I will push
it to github under that name so I'm
gonna be using my vyas code integrated
terminal to do everything here and we're
gonna need to install quite a few things
and I'm gonna go over everything that we
need to install the first thing we want
to do is run NPM in it and create a
package dot JSON file
alright so go just go through this
description I'm just gonna say
boilerplate for react apps and just
enter through the rest of this I'll put
my name you can put yours if you want
this is completely open source we'll
give it an MIT license and that will
create our package dot JSON file alright
so what do we want to install next now
react actually has two parts
okay it has react which is the main
library and then it has react Dom now
prior to I believe it was 0.14 it was
all included in the react library but
now that react is used in many other
environments that don't include the
document object model react itself has
nothing to do with browsers or the Dom
and web apps that's the job of the react
Dom library which is why we need both
for a web app hopefully that makes sense
so let's go ahead and install both of
those so we want to install react and we
want to install react - Dom
and those will get added to our
dependencies right here all right so I'm
gonna clear this out now everything else
that we're going to be installing is
going to be a dev dependency okay react
and react on there they're the only
dependencies we actually need for
production so next thing we want is web
pack now the reason we need web pack is
because all of our react code our
components everything has to be compiled
and bundled into one javascript file and
that's where web pack comes in that's
what web pack does it bundles your
assets together and it doesn't even it
doesn't have anything to do with react
you can use it with react or without and
then we also want to install a dev
server to work with and there's
something called web pack dev server
that works really well that includes
live reload and stuff like that so let's
get those two things installed now these
are dev dependencies so we're gonna say
- - save - dev or you can do - capital D
and then we want to install web pack web
pack - dev server and then one other
thing I want to install is the web pack
- CLI which allows you to run web pack
commands and we're actually gonna use
this for our build script
alright so let's install those things
alright so now that those are installed
the last I guess bundle of things that
we need to install have to do with
babble so babble we need because react
uses es6 classes import stuff like that
so we need to transpile that code down
to browser friendly code depending on
which browsers being used so we need
babel along with two plugins or presets
one is actually called babel preset
react and then the other one is called
babel preset env which takes the place
of babel preset es2015 which is what we
used to use because what the env preset
does is it doesn't only compile es6 but
also later versions and it can actually
look at what browser
being used and then and then go compile
what whatever needs to be compiled for
that browser so it's it's a much more
intelligent plug-in or preset okay we
also need a loader about the babel
loader because we need to be able to
compile JSX which is basically what
react uses for templating and then we're
also going to be using something called
the HTML web pack plugin which will
generate our our build HTML file alright
so let's go ahead and get that stuff
installed so we're gonna say - - save -
dev and we want quite a few things here
we want Babel core which is the core
transpiler we want babble - loader we
want the two presets so that would be
babble - preset - E&amp;amp;V to compile es6 and
beyond we also want babble - preset -
react and finally we want the HTML - web
pack - plugin ok and I know it seems
like a lot but once you get this stuff
installed it's it's it's really easy and
obviously if you pull if you clone this
from the git repository all you have to
do is run npm install and all this stuff
will get setup for you alright so now we
have everything we need installed to
setup a react application so let's go
ahead and let's see should we add our
scripts now let's setup our web pack
config first so whenever you use webpack
you need to have a config file okay so
that is going to be called ok it's gonna
be in the root and it's gonna be called
web pack web pack dot config
dot J s okay so there's a few things we
need to do here all we need to bring in
is we're gonna bring in the path module
which is just a core nodejs module just
to manipulate file paths and stuff like
that and then we also want to bring in
that plugin that we installed that HTML
web pack plugin so I'm gonna say HTML
web pack plug-in set that to require
HTML - web pack - plug-in alright those
are the only two things we need to bring
in then we want to export so we want to
say module dot exports we're using the
common j/s syntax and we want to specify
an entry file ok so the entry is
basically our react entry file and it's
going to be inside of a source folder
because sources where we want to put all
of our react stuff and we're gonna have
index dot JSON inside here we'll create
a file called index dot JSP
our entry file next thing is we need the
output alright so the output is where we
want our compiled code to go which is
going to be just one JavaScript file
it's going to be a bundled file so we
need to specify two things a path so for
this I'm just gonna do path dot join
we're gonna use that path module that I
brought in and we want to join let's say
the current directory and then let's put
it in a folder called dist like that
all right so what's again what's
happening is our entry file the index J
s is going to be compiled and this can
include imported components and
basically our entire react structure
will go in here and then it'll get
compiled into a file in this dist:4 door
now we have to specify that file name so
we're gonna say file name and we're
gonna call this index underscore bundle
dot J s whoops bundle dot J s and you
can call this anything you want really
so that's it for this part now we're
gonna put a comma under the output and
then here is where we want to specify
our loader and it's going to go inside
of a module object and then in here we
want a rules object
I'm sorry rules is actually an array but
in this array we want to put an object
okay we're gonna say test and then this
takes a regular expression basically we
want to look for anything that is dot J
s any and then a money sign so basically
it'll look at J s files or in j sx files
and that's the stuff that we basically
want babble to compile so we want to
exclude we want to make sure we exclude
the node modules folder so this takes in
a regular expression and we're just
gonna put a literal of node underscore
modules that way you know nothing
nothing happens to any files inside that
folder and then we just want to say we
want to use the loader of babel loader
okay and that's it
now in order to use this HTML web pack
plugin and again I don't know if I if I
clearly explained what that does but
basically it creates our index.html file
for us in fact let me bring that up here
just so you guys know what this is
let's see web pack
plug-in spelt plug-in wrong that's fine
now it's this isn't necessarily just for
react if we go down here let's see what
it actually is plug-in that that
simplifies creation of HTML files to
serve your bundles okay so we could
manually create the the HTML file in the
dist folder but I don't even want to
have to create the dist folder I want to
just run the build command and have the
dist folder be created with the
index.html file so that's what why we're
using this so we already did this stuff
the entry the output now we have to
specify it as a plug-in now I do want to
have a template okay if we go if if we
just do this it'll generate the entire
HTML for us I want to have kind of a
temp that we can use in case we wanted
to bring in a script or something like
that and there are ways to do that
without using a template that you can
see there's a lot of different options
but it's it's easy enough all you have
to do is just create a an HTML file and
include it as a template okay inside of
an object basically inside these options
okay so let's do that I'm gonna create
my template inside the source of course
so index start HTML any files that you
are going to edit for your react
application are going to be in here and
then all I'm gonna do is put in a
boilerplate we can put in a title here
we'll just say my react app and then the
way that react works is react Dom will
look for a specific element to insert
all your react stuff so we're just going
to have an ID a div with the idea of app
and that's where it's going to be
inserted okay now we don't even have to
worry about including the bundle file in
here inside of a script tag the HTML
plug-in the web pack plugin will do that
for us so this is all we need here
literally so we'll save this and then
we'll go back to our web pack config and
we'll go down
let's see we want to go under this and
then just specify plugins which is an
array and we're going to say new HTML
web pack plug-in okay and we could just
do this and it'll create just an HTML
file from scratch but we want to use our
template so we're gonna specify in here
an object of options and we just want
one value of template and we're going to
specify that we want that to be in our
source folder and index dot HTML just
like that so it'll look at that file as
our template okay and that's it that's
all we need for our configuration so we
can now save this file and then one
other thing I forgot to do in order to
use the presets okay remember we
installed the the env preset to compile
es6 and so on and the react preset we
need to create a file in the root not in
the source but in the root called dot
babel RC okay and all this is is going
to be an object where we specify presets
okay a JSON object and we specify
presets which is going to be an array of
the presets we want to use which is env
we don't need babble - env or anything
like that just env and react oops okay
and it'll know to use those presets so
let's save that and that's all we have
to do to that file okay so we're just
about there now let's just add a little
bit of react code so in the index J s
what we're gonna do is import react from
okay and we're using import now because
remember we're using babel which
compiles es6 and that's what this is
this is es6 modules syntax so we can use
this now so we're gonna say import react
from react let's also do import react
Dom from react - Dom all right now we
could create a compare a pony in here
but I'm going actually gonna put that in
a different file so we're gonna say
import app from and then we're gonna
have a folder called components and a
component called app all right now we
need one more line and that's just to
call react Dom dot render and this takes
in two things it's gonna take in what we
want to render is the the main app
component which of course is the app
component we're bringing in and then a
placeholder or wherever we want it to
output which is going to be that active
so we're going to say document dot get
element by D and we want the ID of app
okay because if we look at our
index.html that's where we want it to
output so let's say we'll go back to
index J ass and save that and now we
just need to create our components
folder and we need to create our main
app dot J s file since the since it's a
component
I give it an uppercase first letter here
and for the app component this could be
either a functional or or a class
component but we're just going to do a
class so we're going to say import react
and component from react like to put
spaces here all right and then we'll
create our class app and that has to
extends component and we'll just put in
a render okay this is just regular react
stuff and we'll render a div
and we'll just say we'll put an h1 in
here and we'll see my react app and then
we just need to export it so export
default app and that's it
alright so our structure is done now we
just need to add the two scripts to the
package dot Jason one is to run the web
pack dev server one is to actually build
it out into the distal der so under
scripts we can get rid of tests let's
replace it with start so this will be to
run the dev server and it's gonna be web
pack - dev - server and we're gonna say
we want the mode to be development and
we want to do - - open so that it opens
automatically when we run the command
and we also want hot reloading so when
we save something at Auto reloads so
that's our server and then we want to be
able to build so we'll have a command
called build and then here we're just
going to use the web pack mod web pack
CLI actually allows us to run web pack
and then we just want to specify the
mode is going to be production ok and
that's just gonna basically bring
everything out into our dist:4 it'll
create the folder itself as well so
hopefully I did everything correctly and
it should be able to work so what I'm
gonna do now is just run NPM start you
may have an issue may have an error but
we'll fix it okay so looks like
nothing's being displayed so let's open
up our console nothing was returned from
render this usually means a return
statement was missing which I think it
is and it is you guys probably noticed
that a while ago so we have to actually
return this
and let's save that and we get compiled
successfully let's go back and there it
is my react app okay and just to show
you if I were to let's see let's snap
this over and where are we just sit yeah
so if I were to let's close this up if I
were to change something and like app J
s let's take a what's oh this is the
wrong damn it that's the wrong window
alright so if I were to add an
exclamation mark here and save there it
is so we got hot reloading we have all
the important stuff that create react
app gives us we have except we don't
have the extra junk that we don't need
so if you want to just clone this and
use this to start off your applications
that's fine let's see last thing I want
to show you is to how we can actually
build out and compile the application so
I'm going to stop the dev server with
ctrl C and we're gonna run NPM run build
and what that does is it's going to
create a dist folder it should pop up
over here so here it is and it created
our index bundle J s which is everything
so if we create ten components in our
source in our components it'll all be
compiled into this one file okay and
then if we look at the index.html this
is created because we use that HTML web
pack plug-in and basically it's just
it's our template that we used plus its
it insert it inserted the script right
here which is our bundle file so if I
were to now go and just open this file
up so let's go into see react web pack
starter dist and let's just open up
index.html there we go so we could just
throw this up
on any web server okay so that I think
that's gonna be it guys hopefully you
enjoyed this in and it was explained
clearly like I said I will have the
github repo in the description so if you
want to use this if you want to study it
more if you want to add on to it maybe
you want to add some extra web pack
plugins and you know just use it to
build a react app you can add Redux to
it whatever you want so thanks for
