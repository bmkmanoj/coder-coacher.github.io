creating an ember j/s application
alright so this is going to be a front
to back very simple task manager'
application and although it's really
simple we're going to touch on a lot of
the fundamentals of ember things that
you need to know to build a successful
web app alright so this is ember joyous
calm and if you've worked with ember
before and you've been to this website
they used to have a button here to
download the starter kit alright there's
no more starter kit what it is now it's
a CLI tool that you can install and you
can generate your application from there
so that's what we'll be doing now in
order to do this in order to use ember
now you need to have no js' installed
alright so you just want to go to
node.js org and go ahead and download
and install it whether you're on Windows
like I am or Linux or Mac just go ahead
and get that installed and if you have
node installed that means you have NPM
installed as well alright so I already
have it so I'm not going to go through
that now as far as data and a database
we're going to be using firebase which
is a cloud platform that will allow us
to use a database for free development
databases are free so go ahead and sign
up and once you sign up and log in
you'll have an interface like this
alright and you just want to create a
new app or new database alright and
we're going to call this M tasks now you
won't be able to use this as your url so
just put you know whatever you'd like so
I'm going to go ahead and create app and
there it is so that's all we have to do
for now if we click manage app that's
just going to take us to the interface
you can see it's null because we don't
have any data yet but that's that's all
we have to do to set that up so I will
just leave that now I'd also suggest
that you use this Ember inspector tool
it's a plugin for Chrome and I believe
there's one for Firefox as well
and yeah you should definitely install
that because it'll give you a lot of
information that you're not going to be
able to see using just standard console
all right so go ahead and get that I
already have it installed all right now
to get this thing up and going you're
going to have to install the ember CLI
so you want to just type that in in your
command line whether you're using
Windows or Linux or Mac terminal
whatever you're using just go ahead and
enter that as long as you have node and
NPM installed and that could take a
couple minutes now I'm going to be
pausing the video when we do things like
this just so we're not sitting here
doing nothing so don't don't go crazy if
yours takes five minutes and it seems
like mine takes a second alright so that
took about four or five minutes now what
we're going to want to do is create our
app so I'm just going to create a write
my C Drive and it's going to create the
actual application folder for you so to
do that we'll say ember new and then the
name of your app and we call it M tasks
okay and that might take a minute or two
as well all right so our app should be
created we should be able to see D into
M tasks all right and let's go ahead and
run ember serve or ember server you can
also use all right now the default port
for ever is 4200 so we're going to go to
localhost for 200
and there it is okay so this is the
default landing page that they give you
there's no there's not really a sample
app or boilerplate code it's just it's
just blank and allows you to just kind
of go from there
all right now one thing you might notice
is that this this little loading icon up
here is still going now I don't know if
it's with my system or what but this is
this always happens when I initially
install ember and live reload is enabled
all right so live reload supposedly
you'd edit your code save it and your
browser will automatically reload but
whenever I have it on it just seems to
do this so I always shut it off so I'm
going to show you how to do that all
right first of all excuse me I'm going
to bring my project into sublime sublime
text
okay so I think what I put it in my C
Drive
let's see
here it is em tasks
all right now to shut off live reload we
want to go to the config file ember -
see ember CLI I'm just going to put a
comma right here and I'm going to stay
live reload set that to false all right
we'll save that and then if we restart
control-c yes let's restart it
all right
so that should stop alright there we go
alright so now we're all set now if we
look at the file structure the app
folder is where basically where we'll be
working okay the whole MVC structure is
in here we have components controllers
helpers models routes styles and
templates alright if we look at router
j/s this is the main route file this is
where we can create our different routes
but rather than just typing it in
manually we can actually use the ember
CLI generator which is nice and we can
generate routes we can generate
controllers models templates pretty much
anything components all right so what I
want to do is create a route for tasks
all right so I'm going to go back to the
command line and stop the server and
we're going to say ember G route and
tasks
all right and now if we go back and we
go into where as it routes you'll see we
have this task CAS also if we look in
router G is it did this for us okay so
this is this dot route and then tasks
and it also should have created a
template so templates and you'll see we
have tasks dot HPS now a DHBs stands for
handlebars handlebars is a template
engine and it's the default template
engine that ember uses and I really like
it I think it's really powerful and
really easy to use most of your
variables are going to just use the
syntax here so we have that now if we go
to localhost 4200 actually we need to
start the server
okay and we want to go to slash tasks
all right so we're not going to have
anything here by default this welcome to
ember this is going to show on every
single page on every route because we
have it in our layout folder our layout
file which is under templates and then
application HBS okay every template and
route that we create is going to show up
through here and anything else is going
to be on every page all right so this
will be on every page so let's go ahead
and get rid of that and then we'll save
that and then we're going to go to task
template and get rid of that and let's
just let's put an h1 and save it
and now we get tasks now we're going to
also want to route to be able to add
tasks alright so I want that to be tasks
/nu alright so to create that let's go
ahead and stop the server and we can do
it the same way we're going to say ember
G route and then we're going to say
tasks slash new
okay so now if we go back and look in
our let's look in routes now we have a
folder named tasks and in that we have a
new dot j s same thing in the templates
we have a folder tasks and then we have
new dot HPS so let's go ahead and open
that new HPS and for now let's just say
just so we know we'll just like new
tasks save that and if we reload god
actually we need to start to serve a
backup
okay so notice that we're still seeing
the tasks heading and that's absolutely
normal that's actually what we want
we're not seeing new tasks because we
need to include inside the task template
we need to include where we want that to
to show up all right and we're going to
use outlet for that and actually want it
to show up above the heading alright so
we'll say outlet okay we'll save that
and now we see you can see that our
create our I'm sorry our new template is
now embedded in the tasks template
alright if we go back to just tasks take
take off the new then we're going to
we're not going to see that new task
template now what we're going to want to
put there in the new say slash new is a
form alright and ultimately we want to
be able to add a task it will get saved
to our firebase and then it will
automatically be it'll show down here
that's what we want but before we get
into that I want to make this look a
little better and use bootstrap all
right so to install bootstrap let's go
ahead and stop the server we can use
Bower if you don't know what Bauer is it
is a package manager that works very
very much like NPM except it's for the
front end it's for the client side so
things like jQuery bootstrap you know
front-end tools that you want to use so
what we're going to do here is say bower
install or bootstrap
all right so that installed bootstrap
now before we can use it we need to
include it in our application and the
place we want to do that is actually in
the going to go in the root directory we
want to go to ember - CLI - Build
J s and we want to use this app import
so what I'm going to do is just delete
all these comments and we're going to
say app dot import and the location
which is going to be in bower components
slash bootstrap slash dist slash CSS
slash bootstrap dot CSS all right I'm
pretty sure that's it I'm just kind of
going off the top of my head but that
looks right so let's save it and let's
go ahead and run the server again
all right and if we reload
it should change the font alright so you
see the font and the padding has changed
so bootstrap is now included now let's
get kind of a kind of a base template
down so I'm going to go to get bootstrap
and we're going to go to getting started
and there should be some sample
templates down here right here what I
want is the starter template so if we
click on that it's going to open it and
we want to do a control u so we can get
the source code and we're going to take
from this nav tag down to the ending
container okay so we're going to copy
that
and we want to go into templates and
then application HBS because everything
we put in here is going to be on every
page and we're going to want the
navigation on every page so for now
let's just paste that in and I'm just
going to make this a little wider so
we're gonna have to change a couple
things here first thing I'm we have this
navbar fixed top class I'm going to get
rid of that and then I'm going to change
navbar inverse into navbar default all
right and then if we go down a little
bit
project name we're going to take that
change it to M tasks and let's see for
the menu here for now I'm just going to
get rid of all the Li tags we'll get to
that after and then down here we want to
keep the container div but we can get
rid of this starter template div and
everything in that alright and then
we're simply just going to use the grid
system and I'm going to create a row
all right and then in that we're going
to create our column this is going to be
a twelve column div and we're just going
to take this outlet and put it right in
there so now every template that's
rendered is going to be in here all
right we'll have all this around it so
let's save that and let's go back to M
tasks and reload and now we have our
template okay so things look a little
better so to add our links up here we're
going to want just a home and a new task
button or link so let's go back to this
ul and we'll put in our allies and we're
going to use the link helper for this
alright so we're going to use this
double curly brace syntax and we're
going to say link to and then the ending
tag whoops the ending tag will be slash
linked to alright so we want a link to
the tasks route and the text will say
home alright and then we'll copy that
paste that in and this one's going to be
tasks new and let's change this to blue
tasks alright so now we can reload now
we should be able to toggle through
these pages okay so we click that the
new task will show now this is going to
we want that to be a form okay when we
click new tasks so let's go to the new
template and just to save time I'm going
to paste that form in alright so this is
a bootstrap formatted form see we have
our form groups around each field little
label and then here we're using embers
input helper okay just like the link
helper we're going to use the double
curly braces input and then we can put
in whatever we would for our regular
input HTML tag so the type is text we'll
give it a class of form control and the
value is really important that's how
that's how the controller is going to
know what field is what so we're going
to set value to title with no quotes
same thing here this is going to be the
date so we have a type of date and we're
saying value date down here is the
description we're using it excuse me a
text area and the value is going to be
description as well alright then we have
a button so let's go ahead and save that
make sure that that shows up
okay so there's our form and it only
shows up when we click new task alright
so now what we're going to need is we
need a way to submit this alright and
we're going to do that through an action
so what we're going to do is go down to
the button here and we're going to add
right here double curly brace and say
action and we'll call it add task and
then we need our closing curly braces
all right so this is going to go to an
ADD task function or method all right
now this we can actually have in either
the controller or right in the route so
we want to put it in the controller so
let's save that and right now if we look
in controllers we don't have any so
we're going to go ahead and generate
those okay so just like we did with
routes we can say m bar g controller and
then let's do tasks
okay controllers should be plural and
then we're also going to do control our
tasks /nu okay so now if we go ahead and
look we have tasks and we have tasks and
new now since this is in the new route
where we're calling this action then the
new controller is where we want to catch
it right and to get it you can just say
actions and then this is going to be an
object that specifies all of the actions
so that one is called add tasks and
that's going to be function and just to
check things out we're going to have to
put our fields inside variables so let's
save our title and that's going to be
equal to this this dots
get and then whatever that value was
which is titled alright and then just to
test let's just do an alert and we're
going to want to alert the title so
reload whoops we're going to run the
server I'll probably do that about 25
more times
all right so let's reload
okay so you see up here J s hint is
giving us an error this is not defined
and apparently I think I'm in PHP so we
want to get rid of that dollar sign all
right so let's reload and now let's just
say test for the title and we're using
bootstraps so it gives us this
nice-looking date finder and then we'll
just say test description and submit and
now we're getting tests because we were
alerting out the title so now what we
want to do is grab the other fields as
well so let's copy that okay and we're
going to get the description
this one's going to be the date
okay so now we have those now we need to
create a new task with all these fields
so we'll say create new task so we'll
create a variable called new task and
set it to this dot store dot create
record alright and actually you know
what before we do this we haven't gotten
into the model or the database yet so
I'm going to just hold off with this so
in the next video in the next part we're
going to create the model and we're also
going to install something called ember
fire which will give us an adapter to
allow us to connect to firebase alright
so I will see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
