talking about getting post so when you
submit a form to a server to a PHP page
you can send data using the get method
or the post method and there's a couple
differences with both of these so the
get method you're actually sending the
data through the URL and you don't have
to use a form for this you could just
add query strings to your URLs and you
can send it that way
but doing this is very insecure because
you're sending the data right in the URL
all right now with a post request it's
safer because it's sent in the HTTP
header and you can use HTTPS to really
secure that data and obviously that's
what's used with credit cards forms and
things like that all right so what I'm
going to do here is let's uh let's
create a new file in our PHP sandbox and
I'm just going to call this get
underscore post dot PHP alright and what
I'm going to do is just add in some HTML
have that over okay and we'll just say
my website and then I'm going to paste
in a form here just a very simple HTML
form you guys I'm sure you guys have
dealt with these we just have a div here
with a label and input with the type of
text now this name attribute is very
important because that's the that's the
attribute that we can hook on to from
the server and get this whatever data is
submitted
so you want to make sure you have the
name in this case its name and then down
here we have the name email and then we
have a submit button alright now this
form in order to process it we have to
add two things okay so we have to add
one if you keep doing that that's really
strange I'm going to do a method and
that's where we define get or post or
it's not off of to get and then in
action
which is the page that we're going to
submit to in this case we're going to
submit to this file which is get
underscore post dot PHP all right so
we're going to submit to this but you
could submit to any files and sometimes
you'll see process dot PHP or something
like that
all right now let's go up here above all
the HTML and open up some PHP tags and
what we'll do is let's say echo get and
let's say we want to get the name ok now
if I save this and we load this up I
can't talk and type localhost / PHP
sandbox and with post underscore get our
they get close here close dot PHP okay
so we get this error because we haven't
submitted the form yet so we haven't
sent this data so it doesn't know what
the hell we're talking about with this
index name all right so what we have to
do is check to see if that exists so if
we say if so if we say if and if we were
to just do this like you may think that
might work but if we reload we still get
the error what we have to do is wrap
this in a PHP function called is set
which will check to see if that value is
set so now if we reload we won't get the
error okay and when we submit it that
will be set and it will echo it out so
let's go ahead and just put in a name
here and submit and you'll see that
it'll output that on the screen okay and
you can do whatever you want with that
data and obviously if you wanted to
email you would just go like that and
then if we do is they brad at gmail.com
and we get the email now we fill out
these values we can also do a print R
which we've done before in this series
and that will basically print out the
array
so let's just print out get alright so
if we stood that name and email you'll
see that we have an array with the index
of name and then the value of Brad and
then the index of email with the value
of Brad at gmail.com now when you're
working with any kind of user data you
have security issues and one of them
with with PHP is a cross-site scripting
attacks or XSS attacks and how that
works is a hacker will go to your web
page that has a form on it and they'll
try to insert some crazy script to mess
things up on your in your in your
application so let me just give you an
example if we were to just echo out get
email like this actually let's do get
name okay and we go over here and let me
just clear this out and someone goes and
they put in a script tag like that and
they put some harmful code in here I'm
just going to do an alert one but let's
say that's some harmful code and they
submit it now if we look at our source
code with control you look at that we
have a script right in our HTML now
Chrome actually has some built-in
features to prevent this if we hit f12
and actually on this page we hit f12
you'll see right here the XSS auditor
refused to execute a script okay so we
do have some built-in protection but
that's not always the case okay now to
prevent this from working we can use a
function called HTML entities and what
that does is it takes basically takes
the power out of the HTML tags of the
opening and closing brackets so let me
show you if we were to echo out HTML
entities and wrap that value
and save that and then we'll go back
clear this out and try that again
we'll put in our script alert 1 and
submit and now you'll see that it just
outputs on the screen if we look at the
source code
it turns the HTML brackets into these
entities that are harmless they just
print it out on the screen okay so
that's a really important function when
it comes to security in PHP when you're
dealing with content that a user can can
submit to the server and what you would
probably want to do is create a variable
for this such as name equals and then
set it to that and then you know echo
out your variable all right so that's
get now if you don't want to send data
through the in habit be visible in the
URL like this then you want to use post
instead of get so let's just comment
these out here and instead of I'm just
going to copy this instead of saying
it's get let's do this post name and
we'll go ahead and uncomment that and
change that to post and then we'll echo
out name all right now to make a post
request we need to go ahead and change
this method to post all right so let's
save that and clear all this crap out of
the URL and Brad and submit and we get
Brad notice that there's nothing in the
URL that's because the data was sent
through the headers not through the URL
so this is a much more secure way to
send data all right and then you can
take it take it up a notch and use HTTP
and really encrypt that data all right
and just like with the get request we
can print out the post array as well
okay so if we go ahead and reload
resubmit the form you'll see that it
prints out that'll right now there is a
third way we can get this data and
that's by using request so I'm going to
copy this and paste that in and we'll
change this to request and change this
and this all right so let's go echo name
and just going to you know what I'll do
is I'm calling all this and then I'm
just going to comment both of these if
statement though okay so let's see what
happens if we go ahead and reload okay
with the form submitted and we still get
this array this is echoing out the
request variable right here and if we
want to get rid of that and just echo
out the name we'll get Brad all right
now this is going to work whether this
value is post or get okay so if we
change this to get and reload and submit
the form we still get Brad all right
let's try and do it this way okay so we
get Brad and you'll see that it's up
here because it is still we're making a
get request but we'll rate we're able to
retrieve it using this request
superglobal all right now this isn't
used very much you want to stick with to
get in post but this is an alternate way
of doing it
okay so let me comment that out and then
there's one more super global value that
I want to show you and that is with the
server I know we went over server but we
didn't go over this and that's the query
string value let's say query underscore
strength and let's see what that gives
us if we go and submit this form okay it
gives us the the entire string gives us
the value here nits are they I'm sorry
the key which is name and then the value
and then the ampersand and the next
value the next key value pair and so on
okay so that's query string excuse me I
lose my voice so that's pretty much it
oh one more thing I want to mention is
that we can send along query strings in
the URL itself without using a form so
for instance let's do a list item and
let's say we want this to go to this
file which is get post dot PHP and then
let's add a question mark and we'll say
name equals Brad all right and then
let's copy this it'll put another one
and we'll change this to Steve okay and
let's go up here and I want to uncomment
this if statement
and just call me that out so basically
when we click this URL is going to we're
going to be able to fetch that name like
we have been and we're going to set the
name variable and then down here let's
do something like I'll just use double
quotes it'll say name profile
alright so if we reload you'll see if I
click on either one of these actually we
can wrap this in an h1 make it a little
more realistic okay so now we can get
Brad into these profiles going by the
name value in the URL alright guys so
that's going to be it for getting post
and we'll be working with these quite a
bit as we move through this series all
right so hopefully you guys are enjoying
this series we've still got a lot more
to come I may be only releasing one
every couple days or so because I'm
really slammed right now for my courses
from edge' wanax so try to hang in there
and thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
