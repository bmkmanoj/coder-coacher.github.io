you how to very quickly create a
back-end restful api alright so we're
gonna be using sales sales is an MVC
framework that runs on top of node.js
alright so you're gonna need nodejs
node.js org and go ahead and click the
install and if you lose using linux or
mac of course you can use your package
managers to install it and as for a
command-line tool you're going to need
some kind of shell I'm gonna use the
tool that comes with a get the get bash
tool and you can get it here if you want
if you're on Windows go ahead and just
download it and install it alright so
let's go and create a new folder go
write my c drive and create a projects
folder and i want to open a command line
to that folder if you install the get
program you should have this get bash
option alright now we're gonna need to
install sales and again you have to have
node node an NPM so i'm gonna say npm
install sales
oh sorry install g sales okay so the G
is for global that means that you'll be
able to access it from anywhere on your
system alright so you don't want to
forget that and this will take probably
about a minute
I'm gonna pause it and I'll be back when
it's done alright so sales is now
installed so let's go ahead and create a
new project and you can do that with
sales new and then the name of the
project I'm going to call this client
API alright now what this is going to be
is it's going to be an API for a client
management application so it'll store
the clients name email address things
like that I'm not going to build the
applicate the actual application around
the API at least not in this video I
might do that later on but I just want
to show you how to get a restful api up
and running that we can actually make
requests to alright so let's go into
that client API folder and you can see
that we have our application structure
here and we could probably look at look
at it through Explorer but a little bit
easier and basically all the backend
stuff goes in this API folder the
controllers models you can write your
own policies responses services all
right so all the stuff all the API stuff
will go in there so now what we want to
do is create our clients API so inside
of command line
let's do sales generate API and then
clients or whatever the resource name is
okay so you can see it says created a
new API and if we go in API controllers
you'll see we have a client's controller
all right and if I open that up it's
gonna basically a blank page it has the
module exports so that we can access it
elsewhere and then it also created a
model for us
okay the model just has a blank
attributes object alright so just with
that with that one line to generate an
API we have it available to us all right
so let's start the application okay so
to do that you want to say sales lyft
can't type today and it's gonna go ahead
and show you this message because we
created a model and it's just asking how
you want to handle database migrations
so let's just choose number two for now
which is alter and I'll show you how to
get rid of that too okay so now we're
running in a development environment on
port 1 3 3 7 all right so we should be
able to go to localhost
1 3 3 7 and this is the landing page
that they give you it's just basically
some information and some links to some
of the documentation all right but we
are up and running to access the API we
just want to say slash clients and you
should see just empty brackets here all
right so this is in fact working it's
serving up our clients we just don't
have any all right so we need to add
some and there's a really cool way to
add to your API or make requests right
through your browser and it's called
blueprints and that enables you to do
things like slash create
and let's say first name equals John and
last name equals dou and email say
equals J Doe at gmail.com all right now
we just made a post request to our API
and now we have a client if we want to
add another one let me just change these
around let's say Mike last name Smith
and then we'll go ahead and change the
email alright now we have another client
now if we go back to just slash clients
you can see we now have John and Mike as
a client and we have the stuff we
entered and then we also have these
other fields we have an ID which was
created for us we have a creative that
date and then an update of that date all
right and just to show you we can make
requests from other places let's go
ahead and open up postman which is a
Chrome extension that allows you to make
all kinds of HTTP requests all right I
already have the URL in here so let's
start with actually let me delete these
I already did these let's make a get
request ok so just want to send
and there you can see our two clients
and we can also make a post so I'll say
post and again this is just data I had
in here from before you should just have
something like this alright so let's go
ahead and add a whoops go to Durst we
want a first name okay let's just say
Tom last name
we'll say I don't know Johnson and email
I will say Tom at gmail.com all right so
let's go ahead and make that post
request and you can see down here it
gives us back what we entered in
addition it gives us the the other
fields that it creates and then if we go
back to the browser and reload clients
we now have Tom added all right so you
can see we can make requests from
anywhere we can even delete all right so
let's go back whoops
let's go and change this to delete and
we want to include the clients ID so
let's see
Tom's already in there let's get his ID
3 okay so let's just put in ID is 3 and
then let's change it to post and send
alright now if we go back to the browser
oh wait what did I do
I didn't want to do that I didn't mean
to do that I wanted to do a delete so
change that to the lead ok make sure the
IDS there and send alright so now
they're both gone because they both have
the same ID all right so that's all I
wanted to do in this video I will
probably make another couple videos on
sales and maybe even use this API and
add to it build an application around it
so be on the lookout for that and thank
you for watching I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
