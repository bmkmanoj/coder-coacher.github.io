start with the showcase area which is
going to go directly under the nav bar
alright and you can see the content is
smushed under there and that's because
that doesn't belong there if you look at
this you can see that the Showcase is
supposed to go behind it okay so we're
going to do that next
and the Showcase is a section so I'm
going to go two sections SCSS alright
and let's just say sections
and what we want is section showcase
okay so for this we're going to set a
height now I'm going to make this a
variable okay so I'm going to make this
a variable called showcase height and
then for the background say background
um URL
no repeat top-center
now the URL I'm actually going to make a
variable as well all right so I'm going
to say dot dot because we want to go
back one and then actually you know what
we'll only have the image now we'll have
the path included as well so we'll say
slash and then showcase image think
that'll work
and then in variables
showcase height which is going to be 400
pixels showcase image is gonna be IMG /
I think it's showcase dot JPEG let me
check
yeah
so let's see if that works
whoa
okay so we're getting some kind of error
here uh
expected selector or at rule was jpg
maybe I need quotes around this
no you can see that there is an error
here as well what it's behind the nav
bar
- in showcase
you know I'm going to do is
get rid of that and just have showcase
image in there I don't think we can mix
like that
so in variables I'm just going to change
this to the full path and that should
work I think
okay we're not getting an error but I
don't see the image
showcase
oh we just have the class showcase we
get to change that so we have to go into
our index.html page and towards its
section
we have class showcase there should be
section showcase
alright so there's the image alright so
that looks good we need to work with
this content now that's inside of it and
if you remember that has a div class a
class of showcase content so section
showcase I'm just going to do some
nesting here showcase content and do
padding 90
fifteen and we want to text the line to
the center
all right
the h1 here I want to be the primary
color
so I'll just say each one
I'm very color
all right and
I gotta save it
all right so it looks good let's move it
down a little more
so padding let's try 110
all right that looks good all right so
we have the the top part of our homepage
done now we're going to do this section
here which has the input all right so
first of all we're going to create the
section light actually know what we'll
create all the main section color
classes so we have primary and actually
you know what we need to set a default
padding for our sections so I'm going to
do that up at the top
okay just all section tags themselves I
want to have 30 pixels padding on the
top and bottom
all right and then
section primary is going to have a
background actually I'm going to do a
mix in include
my background
let's see in color
actually my primary color
all right and then in mix-ins
copy this
color
use me and then background
we'll be whatever is passed in
and I also if the if the background is
primary section I'm sorry primary
secondary or dark then I want to have a
white text I want a white text if it's
the light color obviously we don't want
white text so let's do a little
conditional here and we'll say if color
is equal to
primary color
then the text will be white
secondary
actually know what this is we don't we
can shorten this up by saying if the
color is light color
then we want the color to be let's say
dark gray and then we'll just say else
color
we'll be white
okay so now in the sections include add
background primary color
okay so the reason I did that is
basically now we don't have to have the
text color as well we can just add the
background and the text color will
change and this one will section
secondary okay that'll take the
secondary color
light
and then dark
all right
okay so now what happened was we added
the color for the background for section
light and also we added padding on the
top and bottom for all sections so now
you can see that they're all spaced out
much better all right so we're getting
there and just you can see just by that
little amount of CSS we have totally
changed this from a mess into a good
looking template all right so now we
want to work on this search area and I
wasn't going to but I'm actually going
to create inside of modules I'm going to
create a form a forms a CSS file
because I forgot that that search-form
is going to have quite a bit of styling
so forms and then you just want to make
sure that you include it in your mane
all right
so search box
so as a class of search
and we're going to set the width to 100%
we want it to take up the whole width of
its column and then the h3 actually we
don't we want to do it
the Sasse way
instead of margin top-20 and a padding
top to zero
okay it doesn't look any different yet
alright now we want to do the input so
we should be able to say input and then
using css3 we can actually focus on a
certain type which is going to be search
that's the type we used and we'll set
water to zero
okay height is going to be fifty pixels
width width we're going to do 80%
because this template is responsive so I
want it to we're going to use a lot of
flexible widths so water will be two
pixels solid and will be the primary
color and then font size see it's quite
a bit of styling here 18 pixels
and we'll do padding-left 10 pixels and
padding-bottom
5 pixels so let's check that out all
right that looks good now we need to do
the button
okay button we want to set border to
zero we want to set background to none
padding to zero and we want a vertical
align to the top and then just set a
margin left of negative four pixels and
that's so it does it looks like it's all
one unit so you want to get rid of this
space okay so that looks good
all right so moving along now we're
going to do this section with the three
blocks
um
now this is where we need to look at
margin and padding because if we look at
the finished template this section with
the three blocks in this one with the
four blocks don't have a background so
it looks a little funny because they're
they're spaced far apart you know so
what we want to do actually that doesn't
look you know what let's come back to
that let's do the blocks themselves
first and then we'll take a look at the
sections all right because we know the
sections aren't going to have a
background they're going to be white so
let's go to modules blocks
so we're going to have a core block
style and that's going to have padding
of 15 pixels and also a margin on the
bottom of 15 pixels okay block h3
margin-top zero padding-top zero
all right then block primary and this is
where I'm going to use another feature
I'm going to use the extend feature okay
so we're going to say at extend block
all right so what this is going to do is
take all the properties from block and
add it to block primary all right and
then we'll just include our mix in for
the background
okay so let's save that
and there's our primary blocks
okay so we'll do secondary light and
dark
and you can see how much cleaner this is
then if you were to use just regular CSS
it's cleaner and it's much more
manageable
all right so let's see that
okay so there's our blocks
so next one I want to do is block Center
okay so for this we're just going to
align the center and we're going to add
an important tag on this as well all
right
now if we look at the homepage you can
see what I was talking about is that
this section in this section they have
the padding okay but there's no
background color to kind of take the
place of one of the sections padding if
that makes sense basically this is too
wide all right so what I want to do is
create some classes to deal with things
like that so I'm going to go to my
normalize file or is it base normalize
and I'm going to add a class called No
no pad top alright basically I'm just
going to set padding top to zero all
right and then go to my index page and
find
the four column so I want this here I
want this section and I'm going to add a
class I'm going to add that class called
no pad top okay and then if we reload it
moves it up alright so there's a million
different ways that you can deal with
things like that that's just what I like
to do we'll probably add some more of
those kinds of classes just to deal with
spacing issues all right so let's go
down here and we need to take care of
this this image is way too big
now for the image there's no great place
to put this in this kind of structure so
I'm just going to put it in my base file
alright so has a class of devices
I'm sorry device image actually it
should be
the other way around image dot device
and I'm going to set the width to a
hundred percent that's going to be a
hundred percent of its container okay
because it's contained in a six column
div so it's shrunk instead of popping
out of it okay so for this this list
item I'm going to do my list CSS inside
of my typography file so
all right
so lists we want you l thought feature
actually we want you l dot list I'm
going to give it a margin bottom of 30
pixels
actually we don't need the UL
all right and then list feature I'm
going to extend list all right and we'll
set margin to 0 padding:0 and with I'm
going to set to 80%
okay so now we want the Li tags of list
feature and to set the line height line
height 22.2 am
instead of border bottom two
gray one pixel actually you know what we
can use our mixin
at border and the border is going to be
one pixel whoops one pixel the color and
the position will be bottom
okay now I want I don't want the last
list item to have a border on the bottom
so I'm going to use a pseudo class
called last child okay so we can say Li
last child border:0
okay
see what else do I need here okay so for
the span the list has a span of wrapped
around the text and actually you know
what we need to do these icons the
sizing of these so let's actually pause
on the on the lists and go to the icons
and I think I'm going to do that in the
next video because I'm running out of
time
alright so we'll do the icons come back
to the list and then we'll move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
