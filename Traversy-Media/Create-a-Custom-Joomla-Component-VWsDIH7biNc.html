tutorial and in this video what we're
going to do is quickly create a custom
Joomla component using this fantastic
software that I stumbled upon called
component creator and it's at not web
designed.com slash Joomla component
creator and they're not paying me or
anything like that this is just
something that I had stumbled upon maybe
about a month and a half ago that I used
in and I've just used ever since when I
have to create a custom Joomla component
what it does is if you've ever dealt
with custom Joomla components then you
know there's just a ton of programming
and it's just a ton of naming
conventions and just a whole bunch of
things you need to do before you
actually focus on the functionality of
your component and this eliminates that
by doing all that that base work for you
so you can basically just create a base
and then you can just focus on the
functionality for that component and I'm
just going to show you how to we're
going to actually create a projects
component that will be kind of a project
portfolio but I'm not going to get into
design or anything like that I just want
you guys to see the functionality of it
and you can clearly see the
possibilities and it will really speed
up your your component development so I
should mention that it's free as long as
you want to use just one database table
if you want multiple database tables and
multiple views then you need to upgrade
to a paid account which is
about 30 30-something USD for one month
you can also pay a cheaper price if you
want to subscribe to three months and
then one year it's really worth it
though guys it really is if you if you
build custom Joomla components then this
is just a fantastic time-saver
so after you register for whatever plan
you're going to use you just log in and
you can see I have three components here
already we just want to click on add
component and this page is basically
your template details
dictate all basically our component
details XML file so we want to name it
we'll just name it projects I had
actually already created this I'm going
to go through the process again so in
the display name we'll just have as
projects and we'll say this component
let's you fill and display projects and
you can give it a version number I'm
going to keep it at the 1.0 default and
you can choose if you want joomla 2.5 or
3.0 i'm just going to keep 2.5 and then
you can add your own your copyrights and
your author information here so just by
filling out that the couple fields there
we have actually created a full
installable joomla component so you can
see that it's it's it's a real
time-saver alright so what we want to do
now is we want to add a database table
to this component to hold all our
projects so we want to name it I'm just
going to name it projects projects and
like I said if you want to have multiple
tables then you have to upgrade to the
premium account and we want to add a
list view in the administrator yes we
want to do that
that'll be plural and then the form will
be project it'll be single
because we'll be editing a single
project project so this is just the you
know when you log in to joomla's admin
area and you click on components and
then component and it lists all the data
you have for that component that's the
list view and then we'll click on one of
the projects and we'll take us to this
view to the singular view front-end we
do want to add a view to the front-end
we want to list out a list view and we
want to be able to link to the details
page for that particular project we
don't want front-end editing you can
also integrate joomla's ACL access
control but we're just going to leave
that for now
so let's create that table all right so
the table was created and by default
they give us these fields an ID
obviously is the primary key ordering
the state if it's published or
unpublished checked out info in case
someone else was working on the
component at the same time and also the
created by so we want to add some fields
the first field I want to add is the
name every project will have a name and
this is really cool too because you can
actually you don't just have the
standard form fields like text and
select list you also have the media
manager which will allow you to upload
images with the media manager you have
the users which will be a selection of
Joomla site users like at the Joomla
category system which we're going to do
next we want to integrate that as well
so this is just going to be a text field
we will just say enter actually we'll
say the project's name we can have a
default value if we want we're not going
to do that we do want it to show this on
the form view and we want it required so
every project should have a name we also
want to show it on the list view keep it
the label will be name as well and let's
include in in text based searches so
people can actually use the core Joomla
search to find out Pro projects so that
looks good
so we can click Add field alright so now
we have a name for our project next I
want to add I want to I want to
integrate the Joomla category system so
let's do that we'll add a field and we
want to choose Joomla category and we'll
call this he's a table name so we should
keep them lowercase
I'm sorry we want the category of the
project we want this on forum view let's
not make it required we want it on list
view we want to filter it as well so
people can filter by category and that
should do it
so we have a name category I actually
want to have a Media Manager field for
the image so media manager will just say
main image
now directory we have to choose where we
want the media manager to open and you
can see it says it'll be relative to the
images folder so let's just have a
folder called projects in the images
folder show on form view yeah we'll just
keep it and we don't want to show it on
ListView and we don't want it to be
searchable so that should do it for that
so name category main image now the last
field I want to add is going to be a
description and that'll be a text area
and we'll keep that
all right so that looks good that's fine
so we have four custom fields name
category main image and description I
think that looks good
so that should do it like I said if you
you could add more tables if you have a
premium account you can also add empty
views if you want that I'm connected to
any kind of database table and you can
also import SQL if you want so let's
build the component and save it it saves
as a package zip file ready to install
and you can see just from this you know
the couple filled forms we filled in we
have created all these files and like I
said if you know about developing custom
components these files are just a pain
in the ass to create so it saves us a
ton of work now this is just a standard
joomla 2.5 installation on my localhost
so what we want to do is go to the
backend and we can actually just install
that component
so we see it was installed successfully
it has our description now if we go to
components you can see we have a
projects folder link and we have
projects and project categories so first
let's create a category let's just say
design projects you can select a
different user if you want it to be
created by a different user and then
just like the other standard default
information so we'll save that and now
let's go to projects and create a new
project we'll just call this sample
project
and we'll keep it in the design projects
category and we can actually add an
image and I'm just going to get an image
real quick we go to Google will just say
sample logo and we'll just grab this
I'm not sure about resizing we should be
able to resize it but I'm just going to
do it real quick locally
all right so I just open it in Photoshop
this is all optional however you want to
do this I'm just going to resize this
too let's do 250 all right I'll save
that well
all right so let's go back and let's
upload that
feech they choose file upload
insert
all right so we have our logo this
little let's just get some sample
content sample text
and that'll do it
okay if we say that now you can see we
have the project name I actually should
have had the name first but whatever
that's fine so we'll have a list of all
our projects here we can easily edit and
save so that's really it to the back end
let's create one more actually well just
we won't have an image for this one
let's just see what we have
I actually have some screenshots of rail
projects so let's actually do that
some content
so I'm actually going to go to the first
one and grab a screenshot like these are
actual projects
all right so we have two projects and
now what we want to do is link it to the
front end so we do that by going to I'm
going to add it to the top menu so you
can see we have these nice views here we
can choose from and we're going to
choose projects and let's just name it
our projects
okay save and close' we go to our front
end and click on our projects sample
project one two and you can see we have
all these now this is just the default
view that they give you they just
include all the fields in the main image
is just is really just the title of the
image so what you would want to do is
edit the view and add this into a into a
image tag so that it would show up so
that's how you would get that kind of
that the list view you can also create a
single view of a single project and you
can choose the ie D we have two projects
so you can choose the ID we want and
let's see how about
you might want to do like a featured
project
so if we reload featured project would
take us right to that project if I
actually will show you how we can edit
this a little so if you are using a live
site you probably want to log into your
site through FTP or SSH this is actually
on my localhost so I can just use the
Windows Explorer if I go to htdocs
joomla components and we want our comm
projects and we can edit the views we
have the project in the projects view
we're going to edit the project so we
want to go to the default dot PHP file
and this is where all this info is
coming from and this component even adds
language files and adds these you know
these constants that you can use so the
first thing I want to do here is
probably get rid of the ID the order I
mean there's no reason you would want to
show this stuff really so let's get rid
of those we'll get rid of the ID
and we'll get rid of the ordering the
state checked out all that stuff
created by yeah I get rid of all that
stuff and now if we save this and we
reload that stuff's gone so let's take
the project name we don't want this here
this name so we can get rid of the label
and the label is what's being used this
is being pulled from the language file
so I'm just going to get rid of that and
let's make this let's actually take this
out of the unordered list
and let's put it up here and let's put
it in an h3 tag save reload okay so now
we have just a heading the project name
let's see what else
category we don't want that label either
we actually don't want any labels so I'm
just going to take away all this all
these labels
all right I'm going to take the category
I'm going to take that out as well out
of the list and put it right here let's
just say published in and then the
category name and let's also let's
actually get rid of all just get rid of
the list altogether so all the Li and ul
tags get rid of all that make it much
simpler cleaner
so the image alright the image I
actually want to wrap in a div and I
want to flow it to the right
save with 300 pixels at margin of 10
pixels okay so we have the div let's
close the div
and right now all it's doing is
outputting the text of the image name
what we want to do is we want to put
that in an image tag
well sorry
I want the description to be floated
what I want is the description to be
floated to the left and then have the
image on the right so let's make our
image tag want to do image SRC and then
have the path in that and then we can
add let's say you can add an alt
alternative text would be we can
actually make that the project name
all right so that's the image div let's
wrap the description also float to the
left and we'll say with c5
let's say 350 right same margin of ten
pixels right
all we can Act let's let's actually get
rid of this div items filled
and that
all right
let's see what that looks like save it
all right so now you can see we have the
full size of the image and we don't want
that so let's just add a width to the
image will say width will be 3 250 250
pixels actually with this we just need
250 save and reload all right I actually
want to put the category at the bottom
so since we have to float elements that
are floating you need to have a we need
to clear it out so do a div style clear
both
yeah it's clear bold
close the div
all right so that looks good yeah so now
if we go to our projects and this is the
other one so you can see you can do a
lot and it's pretty easy to do I mean
all I really need to do this is some
HTML knowledge and if you guys want you
can just keep going and you can add some
more fields pretty easily you can always
go back to the component creator and I'm
add to it and save it and just reinstall
it in the extension manager and it will
just overwrite overwrite the files so I
mean you can add a photo gallery new
field maybe integrate some jQuery and
JavaScript and have the images open up
in a lightbox there's just a lot of
possibilities a lot of things you can do
so I just want to share this with you
and please subscribe if you can and I'll
see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
