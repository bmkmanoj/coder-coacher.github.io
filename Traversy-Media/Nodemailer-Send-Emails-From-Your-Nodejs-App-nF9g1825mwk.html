weeks ago I created a video on creating
a responsive contact form using we used
a little bit of grid CSS and it was just
the front end it was just the UI and I
had a bunch of requests asking to
actually hook up a back end so that the
form would actually work so we went with
firebase that seemed to be the consensus
we said that we created another video
where we took the form and made it so
that we could submit and the fields
would go to a database in Google's
firebase so what I want to do now is I
want to take that same form and I want
to create a simple nodejs and Express
application and implement node mailer
which is a mailing module for nodejs and
we're gonna use that we're gonna make it
so that we can you know fill the forms
and send it and it'll go to a specific
email address that you specify in the
application all right so that's what
we're gonna be doing this video guys
hopefully you enjoy it and let's get
started so if you guys really enjoy my
content you feel like you really get
something out of it consider becoming a
patron to push me to keep bringing you
high-quality educational videos showing
your support with even $1.00 means the
world we have different perks and tiers
including a $2 tier that'll give you
every udemy course that I release
absolutely free to learn more check out
patreon.com/scishow node mailer once we
install it we need to call this create
transport function pass in a
configuration object with our email SMTP
information now as far as SMTP you can
use Gmail if you want but you may have
some issues in fact if we go to usage
and then using Gmail it'll tell you that
it's by no means a preferable solution
unless you're using oauth2
authentication Gmail has a concept of
less secure apps and that's what your
application will be considered
if you just straight up use the Gmail
SMTP without this Roth authentication
but just a test and stuff it's it's
absolutely fine but you don't want to do
it with with a production application
now what I'm gonna be doing is just
using my shared hosting account well
what's not actually shared but it's a
it's a it is a shared hosting account on
my VPS but if you signed up for a shared
hosting account you you should have in
that SMTP server that you can use with
your emails all right so I use in motion
hosting for my services I'm actually
going to be doing a web hosting series
on YouTube showing you how to upload
your website how to create the account
how to create email accounts all that
stuff and we're gonna be using in motion
for that as well
but you'll see that down here I have an
email called
test at traversée mediacom so I'm going
to use that as my email account to send
from and there's a support page right
here just showing us what to use as far
as parameters for the port so SMTP port
is 587 the server name is going to be
mail dot whatever your domain is so mine
will be traversing Mediacom and so on
but what I'm gonna do is you I'm gonna
have to put in my email address and
password so I'm gonna delete that test
account after this video just you know
so you guys aren't sending shit from
from my email address but yeah that's
what we'll be doing so let's go ahead
and let's set up our note application so
I have an empty folder here called node
contact form now the only thing you do
need installed on your computer
obviously is no js' if you don't have
that go to node.js dot org and download
and install it okay so I'm gonna open up
my terminal I'm using the integrated
terminal with vs code I also have git
bash integrated with that terminal if
you want to do that you can simply go to
your preferences settings and you can
add in this setting right here terminal
integrated shell windows and just point
to your wherever your git bash is
located and you can download and install
git bash from git - SCM comm
all right so let's go ahead and just run
NPM NIT to initialize our package dot
JSON file it's gonna ask us some
questions so node contact form is fine
for the application name version that's
good description will just say sample
app using node mailer entry point I like
to use app dot J s and go through that
author feel free to put your own name
license I'm just gonna say MIT is this
okay yes it is
alright so now what we want to do is we
need to install some dependencies for
our applications so we're going to be
using Express since we're using a form
that's going to be submitted as a post
request we need to install body parser
so that we can get the information from
the form we also need a template engine
so we're gonna use express handlebars
and then of course we need node mailers
so let's say npm install - - Save
Express body
- parser Express - handlebars and node
mailer all right so we'll get those
things installed and those should get
saved to our package dot JSON file there
they are and now we'll do is create our
App J's file all right so we got a pas
I'm also going to install the well I
already have installed I'm going to show
you how to install something called node
Mon which will continuously watch your
applications so you don't have to keep
restarting the server every time you
make a change so you probably want to
install that globally and you can do
that with NPM install - g4 global and
then node Mon alright so just go ahead
and run that
alright so in our app j/s file first
thing we need to do is just bring in all
of our stuff all of our dependencies so
let's create a variable called Express
and we're gonna set that to require
Express ok we also want to bring in our
body parser so we're gonna say body
we're gonna use camel case here well why
did that happen
hmm node mod gave me a permission error
but that's fine I already have it
installed anyways alright so anyway body
parser we want to use camel case here
and then we're gonna say require and the
actual module is body
- parser our body - parser alright and
then we want to bring in our template
engine which is Express handlebars so
we're gonna call this exp HBS and set it
to require and it's gonna be Express
- handlebars alright and then finally we
want to bring a node mailer so that'll
be require node mailer
so we're just bringing in the
dependencies that we installed next
thing we're gonna do is initialize our
app variable so let's say Const app and
we're just gonna set it to Express just
like that alright then we're gonna
create a route so we can say app get and
this is gonna be just 4/4 though for the
index page we're just gonna have this
one route and let's put in an arrow
function here or you could just put in a
standard function callback function and
this is gonna have a request and
response parameter and for now we're
just gonna say res dot send which will
just send something to the browser and
we'll just say hello
alright now to listen on a port we're
going to say app dot
listen okay
port number will say 3000 and can also
take a call back I'm just gonna put in
an arrow function here and let's just
say console dot log and we'll just say
server started all right so now we
should be able to run it let's go ahead
and save and let's say node app dot J s
and we get server started so if we go
over here we go to localhost port 3000
we get hello because that's what this
route is doing it's just sending out
hello all right so let's see what do we
want to do next we have a bunch of
middleware to set up middlewares is
basically just like kind of like
configuration settings so let's the body
parser has its own middleware let's set
up the app engine first
I'm sorry the view engine so for that
we're gonna go right above our route
it's a view engine setup okay we're
using handlebars so we need to do app
engine and it's gonna be handlebars okay
and then we're also going to pass in exp
hvs and some parentheses and then we
need one more line we're going to do app
dot set okay so we want to say we want
to set the view engine and we want to
set it to handlebars all right so now
let's add the body parser middleware so
for that you know what I'm gonna do is
just go to the body parser documentation
so we'll just search for body parser
and github page right here and we just
want to lines which are these right here
so I'm gonna copy that
let's paste that in we don't need the
comments so we just need these two lines
right here all right I like to use
semicolons let's see what else we need I
think that's it actually for middleware
oh we need to set up our public folder
so with with with nodejs and express if
you want a public folder which is
actually where we're gonna put our our
CSS file we need to set that up so let's
create a folder called public okay so
any assets you have any images or CSS
files any client-side JavaScript things
like that will go in public all right
will actually have a folder in here
called CSS and that's where our form CSS
will go but we need to let Express know
that that's the folder we want to use so
we'll say public or mostly static it's
actually called a static folder so for
that we need to say app dot use and
we're gonna say slash public okay and
then we need to say express dot static
all right now when you actually need to
bring in one more module which is a core
module that's why we didn't have to
install it and that's the path module
and that's just to deal with file paths
so I'm gonna say require path alright
and then let's go back into the express
dot static method and we're just gonna
pass in path join and we're gonna say
two parameters here one's gonna be
double underscore dur name which just
basically represents the current
directory and then public okay so we're
just defining our static folder as this
public folder so it knows where where to
look and what to treat as as the static
folder alright so let's go ahead and
save that now I'm gonna stop this server
with ctrl C and I'm gonna restart it
with node Mon since we have that
installed and that will constantly watch
it you can see it's watching it and
anytime we update it it will you know
it'll update so if we go over here and
reload we're still gonna just see hello
so now what we want to do is we want to
create our view for our form so let's go
into our directory over here into the
root and create a folder called views
and inside views we're gonna have one
view and I'm gonna call it contact dot
handlebars okay it's gonna have a
handlebars extension by default and this
is where we put our form now just to
test it out first let's just say contact
and save and then we'll go back to our
app J s and for our home route instead
of just res dot send hello we're gonna
say res dot render and we want to render
the contact form or the contact view and
save reload and we get contact all right
so now we need our form now the link is
in the description for the zip file
which will include the index page let me
just see if I have it somewhere on my
let's see I think it's in my downloads
it's here it is so you'll have a link to
a zip file and this is what will be in
it responsive form with the index.html
and the style dot CSS so let's go ahead
and bring those let's see how do I want
to do this I'm just gonna bring out the
responsive form folder
hello with hell let go what is happening
I have six monitors so it might got lost
somewhere where the hell is it well
there it is
alright so let's open that up and let's
open up our project folder as well which
is in let's see projects node contact
form so those files that he just
downloaded we're gonna put the style.css
into public and then CSS okay just bring
that over and then the index.html I'm
just gonna open that
let's see I'll open it with sublime and
we're just gonna grab everything in it
okay so we're gonna just grab everything
and we're gonna put that into let's go
back to visual studio code and we're
gonna put that into contact dot
handlebars
all right so we'll paste all that in
just like that and let's save all right
so we'll go over here and reload and
we're gonna get the all the markup but
there's no CSS because we need to fix
the link okay because right now it's
just pointing to style dot CSS what we
want to do is we want to point to public
CSS style dot CSS so let's go ahead and
do that
public slash CSS slash and we'll save
and reload and there we go so now we
have our form okay and it is a
responsive form so I'm gonna make it
very small now there is a couple things
we need to do just make this smaller
there's a couple things we need to do
for this form to actually work with
nodejs so one thing we need to do is go
to the form tag and we need to add in an
action and a method okay so the method
is gonna be post it's going to be a post
request and then the action is going to
be a route that we're going to create
which is going to be slash
send okay I think that's what I used
actually we don't need to slash it'll
just be send and then down here we just
have just a write a button with no
attributes we're just we're gonna add
the type of submit so this is actually a
submit button alright and I think that's
really all we need to do well one other
thing we're gonna add in a variable for
like a message that says email sent or
whatever so we'll put that right under
the h3 and handlebars we use the double
curly braces and we'll just say MSG
alright so let's go ahead and save that
and reload and everything should still
work fine by the way that animation that
you see is coming from animate CSS we
just brought it in with a CDN and we
added this animated class and this
bouncing left that's what that is
in case you didn't watch the the initial
video and like I said you can use your
own form you don't have to use this one
that we created but you know whatever so
let's now go into our app j/s and let's
create a post route for the submission
okay so we'll say app post and it's
gonna be to send we'll put an arrow
function here and this needs a
requesting or response and then just to
test it out let's say conch
yeah console dot log and let's actually
let's get the form field so we'll say
request dot body
alright we're able to do that because we
set up our body parser so let's save and
let's just make this bigger our terminal
here because the console log is gonna
show down here because it's on the
server it's not on the client so let's
go ahead and try it out we'll put it in
and say John company you'll say 1 2 3
design email address just put my email
address phone number we'll just put
all-fours message we'll say hello and
let's send and there it is so it's
logging all those
all those fields so alright good so now
that we know that that works we need to
implement node mailer now before we do
that I just want to create a string an
output string that is actually going to
be in the body of the email and that
should include all of these fields
because we need to know what the user
put in here so let's create a variable
called output and we're gonna set that
I'm actually going to use an es6
template string so I'm going to use
backticks here take note that these are
back ticks not single quotes alright and
then what we'll do is just create our
HTML so let's put a paragraph and we're
gonna say you have a new contact request
and we'll put a ul now let's put a h3
and we'll say contact details ok and
let's see under the h3 I'm gonna put a
ul I use Emmet here I'm not sure oh yeah
I know yeah I can all right so let's see
Li let's say name now in in the template
string if you guys don't know if you
want to include a variable it needs to
be in money sign and then curly braces
so we want to get the name now remember
we can get the info with request dot
body and we just want the name so we'll
say dot name alright and then we're
gonna go ahead and just put this in a
couple more times this is going to be
the company so let's change that say
company then we'll have the what else
email
then we'll have the phone number okay
make sure that all of these match the
name attribute in the form so name
company email phone and message all
right now the message I'm actually gonna
put down here I'm going to put another
h3 and just say message and then we'll
put our variable say request body dot
message and actually let's put that in a
paragraph all right so that's our output
now for node mailer we can just go let's
see let me just open up the dole mail or
site and this is basically all we need
now we don't need this create test
account thing right here we don't need
to wrap our stuff in that we just want
everything that's inside of there so
this from here to here and we're gonna
copy alright and then let's go ahead and
put that stuff in right under the output
okay so we'll just do that alright and
then let's see we have let transporter
equals node mailer dot create transport
and this is where we put our credentials
for our server so like I said I'm using
my traversing media account so my host
is gonna be mail dot traversing Mediacom
the port is 587 secure I'm not using SSL
so that's gonna stay false and then for
the user that's gonna be the entitle
email address so it's gonna be what am I
using test at Travis C media.com
and that should actually be in quotes
all right and then for the password
should also be in quotes is one two
three ABC and I'm deleting this account
right after so don't bother trying and
down here we have our mail options so
the from who do we want this from so
let's go ahead and put in I'll just put
in my name actually let's put in let's
say node say node mail or contact and
then for the address the email address
should be whatever you have here so
we'll go ahead and put that in and then
to is who you want the email sent to and
you can have more than one so you can
have a list of receivers I'm gonna put
in one of my gmail accounts so let's say
I'm gonna put tech guy info at gmail.com
and then for the subject let's just say
node contact request and then plain text
I'm not gonna worry about that the HTML
is gonna be the output string that we
created up here okay so we're gonna just
replace this with the output variable
like that all right and if you want to
create one for plain text you can do
that as well but I'm not gonna go
through that so let's see send mail it's
this is this is fine let's get rid of
the comments here we don't need that
this is basically if there was an error
if something goes wrong it's going to
show us in the console if there's not
then it's just gonna say message sent
but then we have to figure out what we
want to do once the form is submitted so
we can redirect or whatever what we're
going to do is we're going to re-render
the contact form with a message okay
remember we have this message right here
this msg so we can pass something in
that'll display there so let's say res
dot render dot naught dot parentheses
and we want to render contact and then
we just want to pass in an object with
MSG value and we'll just say email has
been sent
just like that and that should do it
let's save okay make sure oh this should
be mail not main so mail dot traversing
media and again a few I mean if you're
using Gmail I believe it's
mail.google.com or something like that
you'll have to look it up you just need
some kind of SMTP server alright so
let's go ahead and save this and then
we'll try it out I'm just gonna reload
this let's see let's put something in
here let's say John Doe company one two
three design email address we'll just
say test to test comm phone number we'll
just do all fours and we'll say hello
from node app and submit okay looks like
let's see down here oh one thing I
forgot something I forgot something let
me just reload this if you are not on
the actual if you're trying it from your
localhost like we are right now it's
we're not actually you know on this
domain name we have to add one more
parameter in here so let's say yeah so
we have to put a comma right here and
we're gonna say TLS set that to an
object and we need to say reject
unauthorized or reject
unauthorized and we want to set that to
false okay because it's rejecting us
because we're actually doing it from our
local host we're not doing it from the
actual domain so we need to set that and
that should fix this error down here so
let's save let's go back over here and
let's try it again
hello from node app submit cross our
fingers and email has been sent so let's
look down here and we get message sent
and it gives us the ID all right our the
message and the message ID so now for
the moment of truth I'm just gonna go to
my gmail account here let me just open
it I'm gonna open it up over here first
and there it is bring it over node mail
a contact okay subject is node contact
request and you'll see if I hover over
this look at the email address it's
coming from test at at traversée
Mediacom if we click on it you have a
new contact request John Doe for the
name the company the email the phone and
hello from node app so we are now
sending an email from our contact form
through our nodejs app and it didn't
even go into the spam even though it's
from our local host and all that stuff
it didn't even go into spam so that's it
