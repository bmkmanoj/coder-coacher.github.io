front-to-back video in this video we're
going to be looking at the ternary
operator as well as shorthand if
statements and shorthand loops so we're
going to do is create a new file in our
PHP sandbox and save it and shorthand
dot PHP right and go ahead and throw in
up teach P tags and we're going to set a
variable here called login and we're
going to put that to true okay so
normally if if you were to use it just a
regular if statement we could say if
logged in and then we want to echo out
you are logged in and then we could put
an else statement run else and we could
say echo you are not logged in okay and
let's just run that sandbox slash and
see what they call it shorthand dot PHP
okay so we get you are logged in if I
change it to false we get you are not
logged in now we can actually save
ourselves what is this one two three
four five lines so we can save ourselves
four lines and put this all in one line
in a single state okay so what we can do
is we can say echo and then in these
parentheses we can put the condition so
let's say login and then we can use the
ternary ternary operator and that is a
question mark and then what goes here is
what we want to happen if that statement
is true and then we can put a colon and
then what we want to happen if that's
not true okay so we want to echo this
out if it's true and this if it's not
okay so this one line will do the same
exact thing that this five lines does so
let's go ahead and just comment this out
and let's go ahead and run that and we
get you are not logged in we change this
to true and we run that we get you are
logged in now in this case we're echoing
it but we can also do things like assign
variables based on our condition
so let's say we want to set is
registered and we want to only set it we
want to set it to true if logged in is
true so we could just put in our
condition which is logged in this could
just as well be like that
and it could be any condition and then
we want to set it to true if that's true
and false if it's false okay and then
let's just echo it is registered and we
should get a one okay if we set this to
false and reload then it's going to give
us this is also false now now we can
also nest be statements okay so I'm
going to use an example that I got from
a blog post we're going to say that this
is a game and we're going to set the age
of the person to 20 and set their score
I'll set their score equal to 15 okay
and then we're going to do a nested
ternary so let's echo out your score is
and depending on the age and the score
we're going to say it's either average
or exceptional okay so let's just
concatenate right here and we're going
to say score is greater than 10 and then
we do our question mark and then
whatever we want to do if that's true
and then the colon and whatever we want
to do if it's false so we're going to
nest another statement into these so if
it's greater than 10 then we're going to
say all rightful it's the age is greater
than 10
then we're going to make this average if
they're under 10 we're going to make
this exceptional okay so that's the
first nested statement then on this side
we're going to again look at the age and
we're going to say if the age is greater
than 10 then those two and there then we
want to say average
I'm sorry not average horrible and then
this would be average okay so let's go
ahead and save that and we get your
scores average
so to reiterate we're saying if the
score is greater than 10 then we're
going to check for the age if that's
greater than 10 then it's going to be
average if the person is under 10 that's
going to be exceptional okay so that's
the first part and then here we're
saying if the score is less than 10 and
the age is greater than 10 it's horrible
if it's under 10 then it's average okay
so if we change let's keep the age of 20
and we'll change the score to 5 and
reload and we get your scores horrible
if we change the age to under 10 then
it's going to be average and if the
score is over 10 and the age is under 10
we're going to get exceptional okay so
that's just an example of a nested
shorthand statement like that all right
so I'm going to just comment all this
out okay and then we're going to look at
an alternative syntax for conditionals
and loops and pretty much anything else
so this is just close our PHP so this is
usually what you would use if you're
embedding your statements and stuff
inside of HTML so let's put a div here
and I'm going to give you an example the
regular way first so let's say we want
to say if
log in and what we would have to do here
is either echo out the HTML but we don't
want to do that so we would have to do
it this way PHP closed we have to close
it and go like that and here we just
want to make them l we don't want any
PHP well say welcome user
okay so let's save that and let's set
this to true okay we get welcome user
now if we wanted to do an LS we'd have
to go in here and do this open it and
totally here we have to do close it and
I'll put an h1 and we'll just say
welcome guest okay so that's going to
work if we change this to false save it
we get welcome guest now I don't know
about you but I don't like how this
looks with the opening and then we have
to close it down here with new PHP tags
there's a better looking way to do this
and it's not going to really save you
lines but it's going to look a lot
better so let's say we have our div and
we want to do PHP if and then what we
can do is we can use a colon you can go
like that okay and then say logged in
and then when we want to end it we can
simply do end if like that and then we
can have our welcome user alright so if
we save that and reload it changes to
true and reload and we get welcome user
if we wanted to do an else here you
could just do PHP else and a colon and
then we can put our welcome guest
okay so now we get to welcome users and
we should get to welcome guests now
you're not limited to just if statements
here you can use loops so for instance
let's create a simple array the array
equals we'll just put numbers in here
and then down here let's do a div and
we'll say PHP for each and in here we'll
say for each array as Val and then down
here we can just do end for each okay
and let's just HP echo Val save that and
you can see we're looping through that
array okay you can also do this with
loops and I'm just going to paste it in
because this is getting kind of long C
we're using a for loop and we're just
going to echo out the iteration so
reload and we get zero through nine okay
because the condition is if it's less
than ten so just some some different
ways to write your code if you're using
PHP templates this is a much nicer way
than doing it like this okay doesn't
save you line get the same number of
lines but it looks a lot neither alright
so that's it for the shorthand and
alternative syntax for conditionals in
the next video we're going to take a
look at filters and validation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
