eight or nine it's taking a little
longer than I expected just because we
pretty much did the HTML line-by-line so
anyway we have the home page done at
least the desktop version we'll move on
to the responsive stuff later so what I
want to do now is move on to the other
pages okay so we have our about page all
right and the first thing that you
notice is that this search bar is behind
the navigation so we need to deal with
that so if we open up
let's close the index file and open up
the above alright so we have our header
with the navigation and we have section
light which is what's giving it this
light blue color and I also put a class
of top inner and I'm using that class to
push everything down so let's go to
I'm actually gonna put this in my
normalize file so inside base normalize
top inner right basically I'm just going
to add some padding all right so for the
top we'll do 90 pixels and the bottom I
want 30 pixels and that should take care
of that all right so that's good
next we have our main content and a
sidebar actually you know what no first
we have this slogan area which should
have a section primary so let me just
check that out okay section primary a we
haven't created that yet so let's open
up our sections sass file
okay so we have all our regular primary
secondary what we're gonna do is say
what are we doing section primary a and
what I'm gonna do here is extend section
primary class section primary all right
and the only thing I'm going to do here
is just add a border to the top so I'm
going to use our mix in say include add
border alright and the border is gonna
be four pixels the color is going to be
secondary and we wanted on the top
whoa
okay what did I do include
include add border
Oh secondary color
and there we go so now we can use
section primary a on any of our sections
it'll give us the blue background and
it'll also give us this green top border
and we can make as many as we want here
all right so we could say section
primary B and just change it to a bottom
border all right and when I build
templates I usually have a bunch of
these so that the user can change the
look of it of each section all right so
that's good next we have this carousel I
want to do a little bit of styling to
that alright so that is going to be
inside of the components all right so I
believe it's a it's a class of carousel
when you just check
yeah we have a class of carousel and
slide
so I'm going to add a margin to the
bottom and then the image I want to give
it a border so image adding three pixels
and then let's go ahead and add a border
one pixel light gray
okay what I do include add border
Oh bhaijan bottom I want 20 pixels
okay so looks good
the above text that looks good let's see
actually you know what let's let's add a
heading class or a couple of them where
we can change this and the text in the
border to a color so the back in
typography under headings
okay so heading primary is going to give
us the color
let's go ahead and add a heading primary
a class and extend we'll go ahead and
extend heading primary and then just add
excuse the mix in
clewd
oh wait I start what I want we want to
include
and let's make this two pixels color
will be primary color and I want this on
the bottom and then if we go to our bout
page
right here
class I'm just gonna add to it
heading primary a
all right
so that looks good and we can actually
rally
you can do this for the other one the
other colors as well
so you can see how organized this is if
you need to change a button style or add
a button style or blocks or whatever you
know just where to go to find that and
that's what's great about using
something like sass
okay we'll do dark
extend
dark and this should be extent heading
light
all right so now we have those we have a
new set of headings all right so this
list here is going to be the featured
list all right so let's see where are we
about and we want to find right here we
have our list feature
and you just check our index
file because we have that list feature
there as well
which is right here we want to change
I want it to look like the one in the
homepage I think we just need to add
these two classes
all right
I'm just going to add a line break to
push the tab module down a little bit
I'm sorry not the tab the accordion all
right
so if you remember we wrapped some of
these words in a class called e/m
primary the who what and why so we want
to go to typography and let's see
emphasis text much sure if that's how
you spell emphasis but it's fine
so AM primary we're just gonna say color
primary color and then we'll add our
other ones as well
so what I'm doing is I'm not actually
gonna use like e/m dark or PM light but
I'm giving I put it there just in case
you know I want to customize it later or
if this is a job for clients so they can
change it if they want so I'm not
necessarily going to use all of these
classes that I'm creating okay and there
you go
so that looks good all right so this
looks a mess all right basically we need
to we need to make these images smaller
so we need to go to our block file so
modules blocks all right and we have
this wrapped let's see where are we
okay so we have block light which gives
it the background blocks Center and
blocking image all right I think we did
lock Center yeah we did you can see how
it's all centered so block image is what
we need to do so we just want to set the
width to a hundred percent and that
should fix that image issue
or not
oh we want to do block image image
all right and we also want a border so
let's go ahead and add another class
called bloc border
all right and we'll say include ad
border one pixel and for the color I'm
just going to do a light gray and stream
i doing hall
all right we need to add that class to
those blocks
save
all right that looks good and let's just
put a heading above here it says meet
our team so the section I'm going to put
it right under the row class and we'll
give this a class of page header and
let's also do heading I will do the
heading secondary a
save
all right there we go
so the testimonial is that wrapped all
right so we need to add a class to that
and I'm gonna add class section primary
B
and we didn't do that yet did we because
I want the blue background with a bottom
border I thought we did that let me
check so section section primary be
include add border oh I didn't save that
there we go
all right
Oh for these blocks here we have to make
them like we did on the home page
primary f4 I think we had F a 6f a six
and it's an F eight water let me just
check the index file
so index
where are we
yeah we had FA 6f8 water
all right so that is our boat page looks
good
so services alright good a couple things
to do here this looks good this copy
let's just change the heading to a
primary a and then this tab we want to
be primary we want the the active tab
and that's content to have a blue
background all right so let's close up
the about page and open up services
all right and go to
our heading right here you know I'm just
gonna add heading primary a okay and
then the tabs we already have tab
primary so we just need to create that
and I'm going to put that inside of the
components file
all right so tab primary
we want to add a background so include
add background primary color and I think
there's some of the other classes we
need to include shoot actually you know
what we don't want to do that we want
just the active tab so let me just check
out this HTML
all right so Li active
what I want to do is I need all these
classes here so I'm gonna copy these
all right and then we just want to add
tab primary in front of these in front
of that this one
and
right here
and let's just try that
okay so we have the tab the active tab
is blue we want this content
so tab pain
so let's add a class to this tab primary
tabbed pane
all right so that looks good now I want
to just edit the actual tab pain class
itself and give some padding and also
border radius so up here tab pain will
say padding 20 pixels by 10 pixels we
want to add the background actually no I
might want to do that we want the border
radius
five pixels and then just add a margin
bottom alright
okay so that looks good
okay so this I'm just going to keep the
default styling for the for the
accordion so the quick quote
okay so let's find that
which is right here
so we have a block primary head all
right I actually want to change this
into block primary a and let me just
make sure we don't already have that
class
actually you know what I don't want to
do that we'll keep the head because did
that the background color isn't going to
be primary so we can't really extend it
so we'll just keep it as is and we'll
create this class inside blocks so we
want lock primary head
and basically we don't want to style the
actual that class we want the block
content actually we want the heading we
want to style the heading and then the
block content because if you remember if
we look at it if we look at the HTML we
have a 8 heading and then a block
content all right so for this for the
heading I want to do some padding
and a background of primary color
and a margin of 0 and font size we'll do
18 pixels alright let's take a look
all right so
we'll take care of that after that
spacing issue so the block content I
want a border of one pixels primary
color all
and you'll see padding 10 pixels
let's try adding some padding on the
title here on the bottom so h3 top right
bottom
actually we'll make it 15
all right there we go
so this we need to take care of this
what we do so we gave these each one of
these a class of block icon all right so
we need to create that class inside of
blocks
so block icon
actually block icon itself isn't going
to have any styling we want to do the h3
actually you know what these I want to
nest so what I want to do is say block
primary head h3 and then this I'm just
going to grab this and nest it inside of
here and let's just make sure that that
still looks right
which it does not
oh the h3 doesn't have an ending curly
brace
all right so there we go so back to the
block icon so we want to style the
heading I just want to give it a padding
in the margin of zero
and we have icon content and icon
alright so I'll just show you real quick
so we have the block icon class and then
in it we have a class of icon and then a
class of icon content and we just want
to float icon to the left an icon
content will be to the right
so icon float left and we're gonna set
the width to 20% and give it a margin
top of 10 pixels icon content
we're also going to float:left
and it'll have a width of 70% all right
and now we just need to add the size
classes to this and these down here so
services okay right now we have FA 3
let's try a face 6
all right so that that's good enough
so we just want to change all these to a
six
and then down here at the four column
divs we're going to change those to a
six and also add a fade border
okay
looks good
so we have the above actually we want to
make sure that the correct menu item is
highlighted so unserviceable take class
active off of the homepage
put it on services and then same thing
with about
all right
so we're just we're almost there okay so
next we're gonna do the blog and the
contact page and we should be all set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
