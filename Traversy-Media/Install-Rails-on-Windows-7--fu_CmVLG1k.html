show you how to install ruby on rails
onto a windows seven blocks most rails
developers use some distribution of
linux when they're developing rails
applications but more and more with
seeing development done on Windows
machines especially with this this rails
installer program which is what we'll be
using so the first thing you want to do
is go to you want to go to rails
installer calm and it's changed a little
since the last time I was here but all
you want to do here is scroll down and
you want to download ruby version 1.9
you can see we also have 1.8 available
and this is what's included in the
package it's more than just Ruby on
Rails it includes ruby rails bundler I
get so we can use get on our windows
machine sqlite database and a couple
other things so we want to click on
windows ruby 1.9 and download i actually
already downloaded it so i'm going to
cancel it and we're going to run that
it's just like installing any other
window software just agree to the
licensing you can install it what you
want and I'd suggest that you keep
installed get checked as well as the
executables option
alright so we want to leave this checked
this configure i get an ssh so we want
to click finish and now it's going to
ask for your name and it will also ask
for your email address
okay so what it's doing now is showing
us our ssh keys and this is we could use
this key if we want to use github or
Heroku or something like that some kind
of version control system I'm not going
to go into that in this particular video
but i will make one in a very near
future so we have we actually have ruby
on rails installed on our machine now we
can say rails vee gives us the version
which is three point two point one three
and we could do Ruby be as well we got
version 1.9 and that's the latest
version so everything's all set we can
actually generate a sample app and to
create an app all you need to do is do
rails and then name your app i'll just
say sample I'm sorry its rails new rails
new sample and what it does is it
generated its generating all these files
for us which is pretty much a framework
for our App all the basic files that it
needs to run so if we go to our computer
and C Drive and we can see the sights
folder this is where our apps are going
to be hosted and you can see the sample
these are all the folders that were
generated when I just did rails new
sample so a simple three word command
generated an entire MVC structure you
can see if we go in our app directory we
have controllers models views this is
where we will create all of all of our
MVC structure so we can actually test
this out rails that actually comes with
a server called web brick and to stop
the server you can either do real server
or you can just do rails s and that will
start up the server I'm sorry you have
to be in the apps directory so we want
to go to
2cd sample and then do rails s
alright so it started up the server and
your firewall might pop up like this i'm
just going to allow access and put this
off to the side this server is running
if you want to stop it you can press
ctrl c we can actually go and check out
our page our appt at localhost colon
3000 you can see you have a welcome
aboard splash page this is actually our
app obviously we're going to go we would
go in and change it and create a real
home page but you can see everything's
up and running we did that in a matter
of minutes so really easy to install
ruby on rails on a Windows machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
