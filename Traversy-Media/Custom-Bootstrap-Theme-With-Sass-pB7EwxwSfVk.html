build a custom bootstrap theme and we're
going to be using sass which is a CSS
pre-compiled err alright now this is a
project based video so I'm not going to
go too much into you know tutorial
content and really explaining the syntax
and methodology and all that if you
follow along it's really it's actually
really easy we will be using quite a few
different technologies but just very
simple stuff so this is what we'll be
building this is a bootstrap template
and the idea is that we're using sass so
that we can have variables where we can
just simply change a color change of
value in this in the sass file and
everything all the main colors will
change we can easily change font sizes
just makes things very very customizable
alright so we just have a nav bar with
some icons up here some links a main
showcase area with a stock photo in the
background we have this area here with
some icons from font awesome right here
we have an image and then we have a
bootstrap accordion menu then we have
newsletter subscribe form down here and
a footer very simple footer alright the
inner pages are really simple as well we
just have a title bar with the page name
we have a panel with some content and
then a list group over here alright and
I kept the email form on every page
services same thing we just have a panel
with some wells with some different
services and then a very simple contact
form alright so it's not the the
greatest template in the world but it's
something to build and I think it looks
pretty decent alright so this is the SAS
web sites a slang com shows us pretty
much everything that it offers variables
you can see here we're setting a primary
color using a hexadecimal value and then
we can use that in our in our styles
okay right here you can see that
variables need to start with a dollar
sign
we can also nest styles so you can see
we have an Ave here and then we can add
you ELLs or whatever we want to style
inside of that nav all right so we can
essentially structure the CSS just like
our HTML partials we can include
partials we can import other sass files
you can see that they use a s CSS
extension mix-ins which are like
functions we can extend and inherit
classes and we can use operators and you
can even have if statements and things
like that but we're not going to get too
deep into it now
sass has to be compiled into regular CSS
so that you can use it in your in your
theme or in your website and there's a
lot of different ways to do that you can
do it simply through the command line if
you want but we're going to use a GUI
tool called koala which is very simple
you basically just got to tell it where
to look for the sass file and it'll
compile it for you automatically as long
as it's running so that's one thing we
need to install and then we also want to
install node J s because we're going to
use a couple things from from the npm
from node package modules including
bower which is a client-side package
manager so we'll use bower to install
bootstrap and font awesome all right so
I already have no js' installed if you
don't just go ahead and download it and
install it I don't have koala installed
so I'm going to just go ahead and
download that okay go ahead and click
the download and let's save this into
downloads it's a really small program
alright so just run that and install it
okay let's just click next and next
close that up
all right so that's all set we can keep
that checked and click finish and it
will launch koala for us all right now
we're not going to touch it yet we're
going to go ahead and create a folder to
build the theme in I'm going to go into
my C Drive and then let's see projects
and I'm going to create a folder and
just going to call this biz Lite
underscore theme all right now in here
we want to set up bootstrap right now
you could just download it from get
bootstrap if you want but more I guess
modern way to do it is to use something
like Bower which is a package manager so
I'm going to go ahead and open up a
command line and windows and if you want
to use PowerShell or if you're using a
Mac or Linux you can use your terminal
but we're going to go ahead and CD into
our projects folder so projects and what
did I call it is I call it this light
beam all right so you should have no js'
installed which will give you NPM and
then you want to install Bower so we
want to say NPM install - gee which
means you want to install it globally so
that you can access it from anywhere all
right and then we want to save our
alright so now we have Bower installed
we can install bootstrap sass so we want
to say Bower install boot strap - sass
and then we want to add dash - save and
what that's going to do is it's going to
create a folder called Bower components
and if we look in there we have our
bootstrap SAS folder which has
everything we need for bootstrap it also
installs jQuery because in order to use
the bootstrap JavaScript you need to
have jQuery so it handles that
dependency
for you which is really nice so we don't
have to worry about installing jQuery
separately so now what we want to do is
go back outside of the bower components
right in the theme folder and we're
going to create a folder called sass
which is where all of our s CSS files
will go and then also a folder called
style sheets which is where the compiled
CSS will go that we actually use that we
include in our index.html file all right
now inside the sass folder we're going
to create a file and we're going to call
this app dot s CSS this is basically
where we want to connect all of our sass
files together where we want to import
them now I'm going to open up my editor
and I'm using Adam which I would
recommend it's free it's really nice has
a lot of features it's nice and clean
we're going to add that folder to our
project okay so I'm going to just open
up the Biz light theme okay now if we
look in bower components and then
bootstraps ass and then assets you'll
see we have the style sheets if we look
inside there we have this main bootstrap
underscore bootstrap dot F CSS and
basically what this does is it imports
all the different features of bootstrap
because each feature has its own S CSS
file if we look in this folder here
you'll see alert badges carousel nav bar
they all have their own s CSS file and
then that main bootstrap file connects
them all so what we want to do is import
that main bootstrap file into our app
dot s CSS files so let's do that so
let's see right here we want to we want
to do import
and we want to go dot dot slash and then
into bower components slash bootstrap -
SAS slash assets slash stylesheets slash
goats trap all right and notice I don't
need the underscore because when you
have an underscore that's basically you
want to use it as a partial and you
don't need to include it here all right
now there's also if we look in that
style sheets there's a bootstrap compass
file as well now cut we're not using
compass which is a CSS authoring
framework we're not using that but I do
want to include that file so I'm going
to copy this and we'll paste that in and
right here we just want to say bootstrap
- compass alright so let's go ahead and
save that now right now we're not
getting this isn't compiling because we
haven't added the project to koala so
we're going to do that now
so in koala we're going to click the
plus sign and we're going to navigate to
our projects folder and our is it biz
light theme and then sass and then click
OK alright now if we click on that
you'll see that it's checked to auto
compiles so that's that's good that's
what we want and it should have compiled
so let's take a look if we look in CSS
in the CSS folder we now have app dot
CSS and if we take a look at that you'll
see that includes bootstrap includes
everything alright it's actually a
pretty big file ok so it includes all of
that if we look in here everything
that's in all of these fold these files
right here it includes alright so that's
good that's what we want so now we want
to do is create an index.html in our
route let's say new file index dot HTM
and we'll just add some basic HTML here
actually know what we'll do is we'll
copy some code from the get bootstrap
website so let's go to get bootstrap and
getting started and then examples and
you can see we have this starter
template I'm going to click on that and
then do a control you all right and then
we'll just copy everything that's here
and we'll paste it in our h2 index.html
alright now we can get rid of a lot of
this stuff let's get rid of this icon
description author we're going to keep
the viewport because this is going to be
a responsive theme for the title let's
change that to biz light theme let's see
we're not going to need any of these any
of these CSS references we only need to
reference our one app dot CSS file all
right that's what's great about sass is
that it will take all of your CSS files
and combine them so let's say link rel
stylesheet and then we want to include
href and let's see we have that in CSS
all right you know what I created a
folder called style sheets we actually
don't need that since it compiled it
into the CSS file out folder so CSS
slash app dot CSS alright so let's see
down here we're going to get rid of all
these script includes as well so let's
save that and we'll go and try to open
up that index.html with Chrome and there
we go so you can see that the CSS is
being included now the reason that this
is underneath the nav bar is because of
this class right here now bar fixed top
I'm actually going to get rid of that
and I'm going to change now bar inverse
to nav bar default
save that and there we go so let's just
recap what what we did what's happening
okay we installed bootstraps ass with
Bauer which resides in Bower components
we have in bootstrap stats all of these
s CSS files that are being imported into
this one bootstrap S CSS file and then
what we're doing is we're importing that
into our or is it into our app CSS file
right here as well as the compass
version and then we're compiling it
using koala into app CSS alright and
then we're just including that in our
HTML right here so that's what we've
done so far hopefully that's not
confusing now right now we're loading
this index.html file right from the file
system and that's fine if you want to
keep doing that but what I want to do is
install a dev server using NPM and
actually run it in a server so I'm going
to go to my command line and we're going
to say npm install - g4 global and then
live server alright I already have it
installed so I'm not going to run it but
once you do that you should be able to
run live server and make sure you're in
the right and you're in the theme folder
all right now by default it's going to
start on port 8080 which may be fine for
you but that's being used on my machine
so I'm going to specify - - port equals
8000 and that will just start it on port
8000 so now you can see I'm on my local
host on the loopback address here and
port 8000 and now if I go when I change
something let's see we'll just let's
change this project name right here
we're going to change it to biz light
theme and save it and you'll see that it
should reload there it goes okay so it
reloads without me having to actually
click the reload button
which is nice all right so now that
that's done we're going to set up a full
file a SAS file for our variables now if
we look in the bootstrap stats folder
and go into the Style Sheets bootstrap
you'll see there's a file called
underscore variables dot CSS this holds
all the variables for everything for the
navbar for the the main background
anything that is a variable is in this
in this file now I don't want to edit
this file directly what I want to do is
copy everything in it so just copy
everything and then we're going to go
into our SAS folder and create a new
file and I'm going to call it custom
variables dot s CSS actually underscore
custom variables since it's a partial
and then we're going to paste everything
in there and then save it all right now
we want to do is go to app dot s CSS and
we just want to impor that up here so
I'm going to say import and then custom
variables ok notice we don't need the
underscore and we don't need the dot s
CSS so let's go ahead and save that okay
that reloads now we should be able to
change stuff from here in the custom
variables file and it should change on
our site on our theme so let's look for
the navbar area it's well commented so
you should be able to find it
let's see nav tabs right here navbar
okay we're using the navbar default
class if you were using navbar inverse
you would use these ones so let's go and
change the height of the navbar I want
it a little bigger so I'm going to
change it from 50 to 70 all right so if
you look at it up here once I save it it
should reload and you can see that now
it's bigger all right so we can add
at this file edit the variables here and
it'll reflect in our entire theme okay
now I want to have a variable up at the
top that's going to be the main color of
the template so let's put an area here
for custom and we're going to say main
color alright and the main color I want
is that light blue color which is a
hexadecimal of one a8c nine seven okay
that's going to be our main color now we
want to implement that in a few
different places one is going to be the
the navbar all right so if we go down to
where we just were the navbar let's see
I want to put this right here now by
default BG which right now is this value
which is this light gray so I'm going to
replace this with main color okay and
we'll save that let every load and now
it's that bluish greenish color now if
you look at the text the text is not
what we want we want that to be white so
let's change right here now bar links
we're going to change this to FFF which
is white same thing here here and that
should do it so let's save it let it
reload and now we have white text I also
want the hover when we hover over it I
wanted to have this color background now
another really nice feature of sass is
that you can actually use percentages
for the color for instance if we look
right here what this is doing as far as
the color is it's taking this color and
passing it in a function called darken
and then it's adding a percentage okay
so it'll darken whatever this color is
by that percentage so what we want is
the hover which by default is trans
that's why we don't see anything when we
hover but we want to change that to
darken let's see
Dakin and we're going to pass in here
actually know what we'll just copy this
this whole thing and we'll put that
there
okay so now if we save that now when we
hover over it we get that effect that
color all right good
the next thing I want to do is implement
font awesome which gives us a bunch of
icons and font awesome actually uses
sass as well so let's go to our command
line and let's see we're going to stop
the server for a minute with ctrl C
twice and then we're going to say we're
going to use bower install font awesome
and then we want to add dash dash C okay
so that that will install font awesome
just like it did with bootstrap sass so
let's go ahead and run the server again
live server port 8000 okay that'll open
up and then if we look in our bower
components we now have font awesome
inside the bower components so there's a
folder called s CSS and inside there
there's a font awesome dot s CSS and
just like with bootstrap it includes all
of these other sass files so we just
need to import this one into our main s
CSS files so let's do that
alright let's put this right at the
bottom here I'm just going to copy that
and then we'll just go ahead here and
say font awesome /s CSS / font awesome
all right so save that and then there's
one other thing we need to do before the
icons will actually show up let's see
we're going to go into the folder where
is it this light theme and what we're
going to do is go in the font awesome
inside the bower components and grab the
fonts folder copy it and then we're
going to bring it into into our main
project into the root we're going to
paste it in alright because that's where
it's going to look so now we're going to
add our social icons up here so let's go
ahead and open up we'll go back to the
index.html page and I'm going to copy
this ul right here and we'll paste that
in like that and then we're going to add
a class here called navbar right and
that'll that'll float it over to the
right and then we're going to get rid of
this active class here and let's
actually get rid of all but one here and
the link will go to http twitter.com and
then what we want to do is we want to
put in a font awesome icon here so we
want to use an eye tag and then class
equals F a and then FA - Twitter okay
that's the class to get the Twitter icon
and let's try that out so if we save
that now you can see we have the Twitter
icon
alright we're going to do the same for
the other networks so let's just copy
that and I'm going to make this bigger
this wider alright and let's see we'll
just paste this in here so we're going
to have Twitter and then we're going to
have Facebook
I'm going to change this class as well
to Facebook
let's do Google+ and if you go to the
the font awesome site close these out
and we click on icons you'll see that
there is a ton of them okay so pretty
much an icon for whatever you need and
we're looking at these brand icons right
here for instance Facebook is right here
you can also use Facebook Square a
Facebook official there's there's a lot
of them all right so let's go ahead and
finish this up so we have Google+ fa
google dash plus and let's do LinkedIn
so FA - LinkedIn and let's save that oh
that's not right there we go so now we
have our icons now up to this point
we've only edited the variables we
haven't created any of our custom styles
so we're going to create another s CSS
file in the sass folder and we're going
to call it underscore custom dot s CSS
all right and then we just want to
import that in here but at the bottom so
we want to say import custom all right
so this is where any custom styles we
have will go now let's put in the navbar
and what I want to do is I want these
icons to be a little bigger now we can
use nesting normally we would have to do
like navbar and then dot FA if we wanted
to do that but within SAS we can
actually include that in here we can
nest it just like we would HTML so let's
say font size and we'll step down to 18
pixels
save that and you can see that those are
now a little bigger okay next thing we
want to do is the showcase we want to
work on that main showcase area so let's
go back to index.html and we're going to
go down down here and we're going to get
rid of all of this all right and then
this will be the showcase area so let's
create a div we'll give it a class of
showcase and inside the showcase we want
a container and inside the container
let's put an h1 and this is going to say
got ideas and then we'll have a
paragraph and let's give that power
graph a class of lead which is a
bootstrap class and I'm going to grab
some dummy text and just paste that in
here all right so just a couple
sentences of dummy text and if you want
to generate some dummy text you can go
to I think it's lip some calm and just
click this generate button and gives you
a couple paragraphs of dummy text so
under the paragraph we're going to have
a button or a link that's formatted as a
button so let's see we'll just have this
go to about HTML and then we want to add
a class of BTN and BTN primary and
that'll just say read more so let's save
that ok so that's what it looks like now
we want our background image so it's a
free stock photos I'm going to go to
this pixels comm and let's see
the image that I want is here somewhere
let's search for business right here
this is the image that I'm going to use
so you guys can go ahead and download
this I'm going to get the nineteen
twenty by twelve eighty version and
click download and I'm going to save it
into let's see projects viz light theme
and I'm going to create a folder here
called IMG I'm going to save it in there
and I'm going to save it as a file
called showcase JPEG so now we want to
do is go into our custom s CSS and we
want to add in here showcase and
showcase is going to have a background
which will be a URL and we're going to
say no-repeat and inside here let's do
dot dot slash and we want to go into the
image folder and then showcase dot jpg
all right so let's go ahead and save
that and if we look in the front-end now
you can see the images in the background
alright so obviously we need to make
this bigger I also want to get rid of
this space right here this comes from
the nav bar it actually has a margin so
let's go to the nav bar make sure you're
not inside the DFA and let's do margin
bottom and we're going to set that to
zero okay save that and now that space
is gone so back to the showcase let's
let's add a height to that so we'll set
that to 600 pixels and we're also going
to set padding you want 30 pixels on the
top and bottom alright let's save that
okay now I want this image moved up a
little more so we're just going to add
after this no repeat we want zero and
then we're going to bring it up negative
100 pixels
okay so that'll just push it up a little
bit all right now the h1 I want that to
be bigger so I'm going to nest that
inside of here put an h1 and let's say
font size and we're going to set that to
60 pixels all right now this whole area
right here I want to have a clear
background so we're going to add some
styles to the container make sure this
container class is within the showcase
all right that's the only container we
want to style like this so background is
going to be white and we're going to set
opacity oops I set that to 0.7 and then
we want some padding which will be 20
and then 30 for the rest so let's save
that okay so that gives it MUC
see-through background now the button
here obviously I don't want that to be
that color blue when the rest of the
template is going to be this color blue
so let's go to our custom variables and
we want to go let's find the buttons
let's see all right so it's a button
it's a primary button so this right here
that's the text color which is white we
want the background all right so it's
set to this brand primary so let's see
where's that let's do a search for that
okay so right here oh it was actually
right at the top so we want to change
this to be the main color so I'm going
to get rid of this okay we'll save and I
can see that it's that bluish greenish
color let's actually make this a little
less see-through so we'll change the
opacity let's say 0.8 okay so that's
better so that's pretty much the
showcase next thing we want is the area
down here with the icons it'll have a
bluish greenish background or whatever
the main color is so let's go back to
index.html and let's see we're going to
put a div and let's give this a class of
section - ay all right and then we're
going to have a container and we're
going to use the grid system here so
let's create a row class and then we're
going to have three divs that will be
four columns each so div class call MD
for
okay and we're going to have three of
these and this is going to have an icon
so let's put an eye tag here and we'll
say class equals FA this is going to be
the html5 icon so FA - html5 okay and
then under that we're going to have an
h3 and the heading is going to be clean
and simple code okay and then we'll have
a power graph which is just going to
have a couple sentence of sentences of
dummy tax so let's paste that in alright
so I'm going to copy the icon the
heading in the paragraph all right we're
going to paste that in these two as well
so there and there all right now this
second one here the icon is going to be
a gear so it's going to be FA - gear and
we'll change the heading let's change it
to say sass pre compiler you can put
anything you want really
and then this icon is going to be a
light bulb so let's see this is going to
be FA - light bulb - OH
and then we'll change the heading -
let's change it to customizable all
right so let's go ahead and save that
see what we get okay so notice the icons
are really really small so we're going
to add we're going to add some custom
styling so let's go to our custom s CSS
file and let's see we're going to put
down here we're going to say section - a
and let's see what we want here we want
to add padding of 30 pixels 0 I want to
align everything to the center so we're
going to say text aligned to the
Center and the background is going to
have it's going to be that main color so
we can use that variable here and let's
see the fa the icon is going to have a
font size and I actually want to put
that as a variable so inside custom
variables will go right here and let's
say icon - size and we'll set that to 60
pixels his weight is that what I want
yeah 60 pixels so we'll save that and
then we'll put that in right here icon
size so let's go ahead and save it
reload and there we go now the text is
dark and we could simply just change it
to white but what if we want to change
the main color to be a light color
alright so for instance if I go to
custom variables and we change this to a
really light color and save it now this
looks good because it's dark text on the
light background but this doesn't it's
white now what we can do is we can
actually create a function that's going
to check to see if the background color
is dark
if it's dark it'll give a white text and
we can check to see if it's light if
it's light it'll be a docx text all
right which is really cool really really
helpful so what we'll do is we're going
to create inside the sass folder a file
called underscore functions dot s CSS
all right and we're going to create a
simple function here we actually have to
have an @ symbol right here okay so
function we're going to call it set text
color alright and that's going to take
in a parameter which will be a color
variable and then what we can do is we
can say if
so if lightness pass in the color if
lightness is greater than 50 then we're
going to return the hexadecimal value
for black all right and then we can put
an else okay that should actually have
an @ symbol as well else then we want to
return white all right so this is a very
very helpful function we'll go ahead and
save that and then we need to make sure
we import it in through our main app CSS
file we're going to put it right below
the variables so we'll say import
functions okay we'll save that and then
let's go to our custom CSS file and we
want to use this let's say we want to
use this in our section a so right here
we'll say color set text color and then
we're going to pass in here main color
okay because it takes a look at the
background which is this if it's light
if the text color will be black if it's
dark the text color will be white now we
also want to do that in the nav bar okay
so up in the nav bar let's put a for the
links and then color set text color and
we'll pass in main color alright so
let's go ahead and save that and then
let this reload okay so let's see that
didn't work oh you know what we need to
add an important flag here okay then
we'll save it okay so now it has a dark
color now if we go and change it back to
the bluish greenish color
and save let it reload the text is white
okay so it's it's a basically a smart
stylesheet okay and adapts its dynamic
so let's continue on down below here
we're going to have another area if we
look at the final product it's going to
be this right here we have an image and
then we're going to use this accordion
from for bootstrap now in order to use
this we need to include JavaScript our
bootstrap javascript file which I don't
think we included yet so let's take a
look in index.html down at the bottom
here we need a script tag source okay
now we need to include jQuery as well
because the bootstrap JavaScript depends
on jQuery and that was installed if we
look in bootstrap Bower components so
jQuery dist and then jQuery j/s so let's
go ahead and add that
so bower components slash jQuery slash
dist slash jQuery j/s all right now I'm
going to copy that
and then we're going to include the
bootstrap J s so bootstrap sass let's
see bootstrap sass just check this real
quick and then it's going to be in
assets slash JavaScript slash bootstrap
dot J s alright so let's save that and
that should also give us the responsive
menu if we go ahead and we make this
smaller we have this little button here
and now we have all of our links in this
mobile menu alright so let's continue on
down here let's see so after section a
we're going to put in Section B actually
I'm going to just copy this paste that
in will change this to Section B and
this is going to use the grid system as
well but it's going to have two not
three so we'll get rid of this last one
this column d4 alright and then we're
going to change these to column d6 both
of these and then we'll just clear out
everything inside of here and in here
all right
now the image we have to grab that as
well let's grab it from pixels let's see
what did I search for let's search for
computer
and what's here somewhere
the hell is it right here this right
here this chip so we're going to grab
the 640 by 449 download that I'm going
to save it as CPU dot jpg all right so
let's go ahead and insert that right in
here so IMG source and that's going to
be in the IMG folder slash CPU dot jpg
ok let's save that take a look all right
now we want to actually make this the
100% width of its container so we can go
to our custom CSS or s CSS and let's add
down here dot section dash B and then
the image inside of that we want with
100% all right now the background we
want to change that to this grayish
color so that it kind of matches so
let's see in Section B we're going to
say background and that's going to be a
hexadecimal value let's see where is it
so it's going to be e e 6e b f1 and then
we're also going to add padding 30
pixels on the top and bottom and let's
save that okay so on this side we're
going to have our collapsible accordion
now that's a lot of code to write so I'm
going to just go to get bootstrap comm
and we're going to go to JavaScript and
then collapse and we want this accordion
example right here I'm just going to
grab everything in here
so we'll copy that bring it over to
index.html and we're going to paste it
right in here and this call md6 okay I'm
just going to indent this a little bit
alright let's save it and go back and
take a look and there we go now I want
these panels these headings to have the
the main color as the background so
let's go to our custom CSS CSS file in
Section B and actually know what let's
go outside of Section B because we're
going to use panels other places as well
and we'll say plot panel - heading - a
space h4 and we're going to set let's
see we want the color to be dynamic just
like this we want to use the set text
color so we'll paste that in now for the
background we need to do that in our
variables so let's go to custom
variables and I'm going to search for
panel and we want let's see we want a
panel background where is it's our panel
header background
the hell is it
panel heading padding is it default
right here I think panel default heading
background let's change that to main
color see if that works
yep alright good so that's all set next
thing is the newsletter area so let's go
back to index.html and I'm just going to
copy what we have for section a and then
we'll go down the bottom here paste that
in change it to section C and then we're
going to get rid of let's see we're
going to keep this call MD but we're
going to get rid of these two all right
and then we want to change this to call
m.d.
8 but we want it to have an offset ok we
don't want it to go all the way across
but we want to move it to the middle so
we want to just add another class called
call MD - offset - - ok we want to push
it over to columns and then let's get
rid of all this and then here we want an
h2 and we'll say subscribe to our
newsletter ok we'll put a line break and
let's I'm going to just grab a paragraph
of dummy text ok then we'll put an HR
and then we're going to have our form
okay form we'll have an input give it a
type of text and give it a class of form
control and also input - LG that'll make
it a little bigger all right then we'll
give it a place holder let's just say
enter email okay let's put another line
break and then our button button we'll
have a class of BTN BTN - primary BTN -
LG and then BTN - block these are all
bootstrap classes okay that'll say
submit and let's take a look alright so
you can see it's only eight columns wide
but it's pushed to the middle because we
added an offset of - all right so now we
need to style this so let's go to see we
want to go to custom CS CSS and let's
see section section C and we're going to
add padding it's going to have a little
more padding we're going to do 60 pixels
and margin top we're going to set that
to 40 pixels we're going to align
everything to the center the background
is going to be the main color
and let's see the text will be dynamic
let's grab that now let's see let's see
what that looks like
all right so let's see I don't want that
there let's actually get rid of that
margin top all right now the button
you'll notice is the same color as the
background so what I want to do is
darken that a little bit
so let's actually add inside section C
dot BTN - primary and we're going to use
the Dakin function so darken and then
we'll pass in the main color and then
it's going to take a second parameter of
the percentage we want to darken it so
we'll say 10% so now I'll save and now
you can see the button is darker all
right so we're almost done with the home
page let's just add the footer which is
very very simple put our container
all right and we're just going to put a
paragraph and we'll say copyrights let's
put a copyright symbol here 2016 is
light theme okay so we'll save that and
as far as styling that's going to be
really simple as well let's set padding
30 in the background I'm going to make
the same color as that button I'm going
to dock in the main color so let's just
copy that
throw that in and then the color of the
text will be dynamic with the set text
color function and there we go alright
so our index page is done now the inner
pages are going to be very simple so
let's go ahead and create those in the
route we want to create a file called
about HTML we want a file called
services HTML contact dot HTML all right
now in the index page let's fix the
menus so that we can navigate to these
pages so home is going to go to index
about will go to about HTML contact and
let's also add the services
all right so now we're going to do is
copy everything in here so we're going
to select all copy it and then go into
about and paste that in okay now let's
start at the top here and in the title
I'm just going to add a pipe and then
about okay the menu and then the navbar
all that is going to stay the exact same
we don't want let's see show case we're
going to change this to title bar we are
going to have a container and then we'll
have an h1 which will have the page
title and then I'm going to get rid of
the paragraph and the button okay so
that's our title bar now we don't want
Section A or B however I am going to
keep Section C which is the the email
form all right now right here is where
the main content will go so let's say
div class so you'll set it to main okay
this will have a container and let's say
we'll have a row and this column will be
an a column div so call MD eight and
then under that we'll have a four column
which will be basically the sidebar all
right now we're going to have a panel in
here so div class panel panel default
and let's see we'll have div class panel
heading and inside the panel heading
will have an h4 with a class of panel
title all right and then this will just
say who we are
okay now below the panel title div we're
going to have a div with a class of
panel body and then this is just going
to have a couple paragraphs so I'm going
to grab that from lips simcom just copy
two of those and let's see we put
paragraph tags paste that in and let's
make sure we end this paragraph and then
start this one okay
so let's save that and then we're going
to go and click on a boat and there's
our boat page let's make it so that the
about link is active so if we go up to
the menu we're going to just remove
class active from home and put it on the
about li alright now we're also going to
have a list group in the sidebar and I'm
just going to actually grab that from
get bootstrap so if we go to components
list group I'm going to grab this right
here the linked items okay we'll just
paste that in alright
and there we go so there's our menu so
that's the about now the title bar I
will I want that styled a little bit so
let's go to custom CSS CSS and we're
going to go right here and say title bar
and I want that to have the same
background image as the showcase so this
right here I'll just copy that
alright instead of 100 pixels I'm going
to pull it up 300 pixels just to show it
a little bit more and we're going to add
padding bottom and that's going to be 10
pixels alright and I'm also going to add
a border bottom which will be 4 pixels
solid and it's going to be the main
color all right so let's save that okay
that looks pretty good let's add a
margin to the main div right here so
we'll say dot main margin top 30 pixels
all right so that's the about page now
services is going to be very similar so
we're going to copy our boat page paste
that in services and let's just change
some stuff that's right here on the
title ok we want to change the active
class to this li we want to change the
title right here okay the panel title
will say what we do and in the body I'm
going to clear out these two paragraphs
and we want to have our services within
well dibs so I'm just going to paste
this in that's one it's just a div with
the class of well an h4 and a paragraph
all right so we'll paste in two more of
those okay I'm just going to change this
one to web development and we'll change
this one to SEO very simple okay we'll
save that let's click on services and
there's our services page okay last one
is contact so I'm going to copy
everything here in services and paste it
in contact and then we'll simply change
the title ok we'll change the clap the
active class this okay and then the h4
on the title right here let's just say
get in touch and then let's clear out
these well divs in the body and then we
just want to form here and I'm actually
going to paste this in just to save on
time all right so we just have a very
simple form we have div with the class
of form group label with name and input
same thing with email and then message
which has a text area so let's go ahead
and save that and we'll click on contact
and there we go all right so our theme
is now complete and what's really nice
about this is now if we go to our
variables and we want to change the main
color let's say we want to change it to
that light color save it you'll see that
now it looks completely different and
text is also dynamic so it's the right
color if we wanted to change it to let's
say I don't know red which will be very
ugly but we can't we can do it if we
want all right so it's very customizable
so that's going to be it guys I will
upload this code on github hopefully it
wasn't too confusing I know it was kind
of long and there was a lot to it but
hopefully it wasn't too bad alright so
