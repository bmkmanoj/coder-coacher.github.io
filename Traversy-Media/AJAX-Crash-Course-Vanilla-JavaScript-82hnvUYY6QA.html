requests to do a crash course on ajax
ajax is an extremely important
technology and web development so i
thought it would be a good idea so we're
gonna talk about what ajax is what it's
used for we're gonna go through some
slides look at how it works and then
we're gonna jump into some code and
we're going to experiment a little bit
with Ajax and the xhr object alright so
before we get started I just want to
quickly mention some of my social media
links for anybody that wants to follow
me and stay up to date with videos and
projects udemy courses and so on I also
just created a discord chat server
that's open to the public it's a place
where anyone can go and get help with
programming and web development share
ideas and so on I pop in daily and chat
for a little bit as well all right so
what is Ajax it's an acronym for
asynchronous JavaScript and XML it's not
a language it's not a framework or a
library it's simply a set of web
technologies to send and receive data
from a client to a server asynchronously
so it's all done behind the scenes
without having to explicitly reload the
web page now one thing that's kind of
ironic is even though XML is included in
the acronym XML is very rarely used in
Ajax any more jason has pretty much
taken its place that's JavaScript object
notation and it's just easier it's
faster and it's much more popular so
most of the API is if you're working
with external api's you're probably
going to be working with jason and not
xml or maybe both some sometimes these
external api's will return both if
needed alright and ajax can also just
work with plain text so let's take a
look at a quick diagram to kind of
explain how ajax works so this is the
client or the browser and then this is
the server this could be your local
server or it could be some kind of web
api some kind of external API all right
now usually when we
I work with a server when we make a
request to a server from a client we
type in the link or we click a link I'm
sorry we type in a URL or we click a
link and it makes a common request to
the server and then the server sends a
common response back which includes the
headers the web page pretty much just
everything we request everything and we
get everything well with Ajax what it
allows us to to do is it allows us to
make requests asynchronously in the
background without having to reload or
refresh the entire web page all right so
if we wanted to just update one little
section of text we can do that with Ajax
and it's a hell of a lot faster than
having to reload the entire page ok and
it makes things much more interactive
now the way that this works is by making
some kind of Ajax call and this can be
done with plain JavaScript or it can be
done with some kind of library okay it
can be done with jQuery or an HTTP
library like Axios there's a lot of
different ways to do it we're going to
basically focus on plain JavaScript all
right and I'll talk about that in a
little bit but basically the server is
going to return data usually in JSON
format it could be an XML it could be
plain text and this is done this request
is done by using the XML HTTP request
object okay and I'm going to talk more
about this in a minute but we'll make
our request it'll do whatever it needs
to on the server it may update a
database you may have it so that when
you you know type something into a form
and then you click outside of the form
that'll actually make a request and
update the database or you may just be
fetching some data you'll get it back
and you'll do what you want with it you
can put it in your web page or whatever
it is that you want to do there's just
so many different things that you can do
with Ajax all right now like I said this
happens through something called the XML
HTTP request object also called the xhr
object and this is actually an API in
the form of an object okay
and what that means what I mean by an
object is it has properties and methods
attached to it and this is actually
provided by the browsers JavaScript
environment so all modern browsers have
this API its methods transferred data
between client and server or browser and
server and it also can be used with
other protocols other than HTTP although
HTTP is usually what it's used with all
right they can also work with data other
than XML obviously like I said Ajax is
these days more commonly used with Jason
all right
it can also use plain text so we're
going to be examining this object and
we're going to look at some of its
properties and methods and look at how
it works a little bit all right so
there's a bunch of different ways to
make Ajax calls now just like with
everything there's libraries to make
things easier as far as the amount of
code that you need to write the handlers
and things like that
now libraries can be great but you
should know how to make an actual
request using plain old JavaScript you
know using the xhr object before jumping
into these libraries so that's what
we're gonna focus on in this series are
not in this series but in this video in
this crash course and then towards the
end if we have time we'll jump in and
we'll look at some of these libraries
all right so jQuery is you know you guys
know what jQuery is it's a Dom
manipulation library it's it's huge as a
lot of different things you can do with
it I would not suggest using jQuery just
for Ajax calls it's it's way it's way
too much overkill for that if you are
using it anyways in your application or
your website then fine but I wouldn't
suggest using it just for Ajax calls
okay a library like Axios or super-agent
these are really nice slim libraries for
making HTTP requests and you can make
updates and deletes and all kinds of
things so these are really nice
libraries to work with the fetch API is
actually part of the browser it's it's
pretty new I know it's fully implemented
in Firefox and Chrome I'm not too sure
about the others so if someone wants to
clarify you know the compatibility with
with
edge in Safari and these other browsers
I'm not really sure I have used it and I
do like it I'm just not sure as far as
the compatibility goes although I know
there are polyfills for and stuff like
that prototype is another library I
haven't used so I can't say too much
about and then of course we have no js'
node HTTP but you need to you need to
install node and get into that and
that's just not part of this of this
course here all right so what we're
gonna do now is jump in we're going to
I'm going to show you how to set up an
ajax request we're gonna really look at
the xhr object look at some of its
methods and properties and I want you to
just kind of wrap your head around how
Ajax actually works and then if we have
time we're gonna look into using some of
the libraries as well alright so let's
get started alright guys so we're gonna
get started now as far as your
environment you do need to have some
kind of server to work with Ajax you
don't want to be just opening your HTML
file from you know from windows or from
your filesystem now you can you have a
lot of different options what we're
gonna be doing is using xampp which is
it gives us an Apache server it gives us
PHP and MySQL on our local machine and
if you want to install this you can go
to Apache friends org and you can
install it if you watch the second video
of my PHP front-to-back series it shows
you how to install it now the reason I'm
using this is because we are going to
deal a little bit with PHP towards the
end for those videos you will need you
will need PHP and xampp gives you that
for the first few videos just looking at
making requests to to an external API
into a plain text file and adjacent file
you don't actually need PHP installed
and you could use any server you could
just use your if you're using vs code
you could use live server or something
like that but we're just gonna use xampp
so i'm gonna go to my c drive and then
xampp and then htdocs this is the server
folder and I'm just gonna create a
folder here called ajax crash
and we're gonna creating a I'm going to
be creating a bunch of different files
in here what I'm gonna do is open this
folder up in vs code so htdocs Ajax
crash alright and we're gonna create a
new file here called Ajax 1 dot HTML
we're gonna have about eight different
files because we're gonna go through you
know loading a plain text file loading
Jason loading an external external data
loading from a PHP file and then we're
gonna look at some of the different
libraries as well so hopefully this
crash course will be about an hour so I
want to keep it around there alright now
what we're gonna do is just set up a
basic HTML document now I'm using vs
code which has Emmet's so I can just do
an exclamation and tab and it'll give me
this basic HTML layout and I'm just
gonna enable word wrap here so you guys
can see everything alright and then what
I'll do is just let's change the title
we'll say Ajax 1 and I just want to give
a little description for each file we're
going to let's just say I'll say text
file because we're just going to fetch a
text file asynchronously so we'll save
this and then I should be able to go to
my local host slash Ajax crash slash
Ajax 1 dot HTML alright and you'll see
it's going to load that HTML file now
what I want to do is I want to create a
button to click and then we're gonna
create a function that's going to make
our Ajax call so let's go ahead and
let's create a button I'm gonna give
this an ID of let's say button oops
so an ID of button and then let's go in
here and we'll say get I will just say
get text file alright and then what
we'll do
actually we'll just leave that that's
all we'll do for now so we'll save it
and we should see a button that says get
txt file so let's go ahead and create
some script tags right above the ending
body tag
say script put those tags in there and
we want to we want to create an event
listener all right because we want to
catch the click of this button so what
we'll do is we'll say document dot get
element by ID okay we gave it an ID of
button and you're going to learn if
you're new to JavaScript you'll learn
quite a bit about you know Dom
manipulation and things like that as
well so get element by ID button and
then we just want to add an event
listener so we're going to say dot add
event listener we want to listen for a
click on this button and once we click
we want to run a function called load
text okay so now we're going to create
that load text function and this isn't
going to be like you know a clean-cut
application type course we're just we're
just messing with the code so that we
can see what's going on I'm not trying
to create anything pretty or anything
like that okay just to let you guys know
so let's just do a console dot log here
and we'll just say button clicked just
so we know that it's actually hooked up
so we'll go ahead and click f12 to open
up our dev tools make sure you you're on
the console and you reload and we click
and we get button clicked all right so
now let's set up to make an AJAX request
so what I'm gonna do is create another
file and I'm gonna call it sample dot
txt okay so just a simple txt file and
we're gonna put some text in here I have
Emmet so I'm gonna say larom 50 tab and
that'll just give us 50 words of sample
text and I'm gonna go ahead and save
that and close it all right so we have
this sample text file so let's get rid
of this console log and the first thing
we want to do here is we want to create
the xhr object all right and this this
file is going to be heavily commented
because I want you guys to know what's
going on the rest of the files not so
much just this one just to kind of
explain everything
so to create this object we need to
create a variable and you'll see this
sometimes called request or even HTTP
request XML requests I like to call it
xhr just keep it short but we're gonna
set it to new XML HTTP request okay just
like that
and that's actually going to be a
function so it's going to have
parenthesis on the end okay next thing
we want to do is decide we need a
function to make the request the type of
request and what what file or URL we're
making it to so we're gonna use the open
function so let's say open and this
takes in three parameters one is gonna
be the type one is going to be the
either the URL or the file name and then
one is gonna be if it's asynchronous or
not so true or false so we'll take that
xhr alright and actually you know what
before we do that lets just console dot
log the xhr all right just so you can
see that this is actually an object with
a bunch of properties and methods so if
I click the button you'll see XML HTTP
requests and it has all this stuff
associated with it so it has an onload
function which we're going to be dealing
with it has a ready state with different
values it has a status so HTTP status
200 is is normal you know 404 means it's
not found so it has all these properties
and methods assigned to it
all right what we want to do here is we
want to call open okay which actually
it's not going to show right here but it
has a function called open so we're
gonna say xhr dot open and then like I
said it takes in these three parameters
first one is going to be the type of
request which is going to be get then
it's going to take the URL or the file
name in our case it's just going to be
sample dot txt and then it's going to be
a true or false if it's going to be
asynchronous or not so it's we're going
to say true this is going to be a
synchronous all right now there's two
functions that we could use here one is
onload one is onreadystatechange on
ready state changes the older way of
doing things and I'll kind of explain
that in a little bit but first we're
going to use onload all right and that's
what we're gonna use throughout the
series I keep saying series throughout
the course so let's say onload XH our
onload and we're gonna say equal
function alright and then in here what
we want to do is we want to check for
the status of the response so we're
gonna say if now we can say xhr dot
status but since we're in this function
we can actually just use the this
keyword so we can say if this status is
equal to 200 ok now 200 is is basically
means okay when you make a request to a
server 200 is okay and I'm just gonna
paste in some comments down here so 200
is okay for outh 403 is forbidden 404 is
not found what does this keep opening I
don't want that open all right so we
want to check to make sure it's okay
before we do anything else all right
now what I'm gonna do is just do a
console dot log and we should be able to
reget our to get our response from this
file by saying this dot response text
okay just like that so what we'll do is
if we go ahead and we cloak we wrote we
load this and we click get text file
we're not going to see anything yet
because there's one last function we
need to call on that send so we're gonna
go right below the onload still within
the load text function and we're gonna
say xhr dot send okay and I'll just put
a comment here send request
all right so let's go ahead and save and
then we'll reload and click get text
file and you'll see that it gives us a
response now we're logging the response
but even if we didn't do that so if I
comment that out you'll see it's not
gonna log anything but with the chrome
tools if we go to network and we reload
and you'll see there's nothing down here
if I click the button all of a sudden
you'll see this sample text you'll see
it has a status of 200 it has a type of
xhr and if we click on it you'll see all
the headers I just want to make this a
little bigger so the headers with the
request type which was a get we have a
200 response it gives us all the the you
know the content type which is text
plain gives us the date all that stuff
and then it gives us the response which
is the content of that file all right
so we're getting that data even if we're
not doing anything with it from within
onload we're still getting it in the
browser all right so what I want to do
now is show you the old way of doing
things which was using
onreadystatechange instead of onload
okay so what I'm gonna do is just for
now comment this out and then we're
going to say xhr dot onreadystatechange
equals function all right and then when
we do this we do need to check for the
status but we also need to check for
something called the ready State all
right now I'm gonna paste in something
else in down here and this is just the
different states that the request goes
through so 0 is going to be requests not
initialized one is server connection
established two is request received prot
3 is processing requests and four is
request is finished and response is
ready so when we use onreadystatechange
we actually have to make sure that we're
at number four here okay so and here we
need to do if
this dot readystate
which is a property of xhr and we want
to we want to make sure that that's
equal to four all right and then and we
want to make sure that the status is
equal to 200 okay and then we can do
what we want we can console dot log same
thing we can console log this dot
response text all right so now if we go
ahead and save this and go and reload
and click you'll see it does the same
thing that it did with onload all right
now the difference with onload is this
is not going to run unless ready state
is ready unless it's at four so what I
want to do is is go to some different
points and show you what the ready state
actually equals so we'll go right under
where we did the right under where we
did the open and we're gonna console dot
log let say so we'll say ready state and
let's say xhr dot ready state okay
remember it's it's a property of xhr so
if we go ahead and save that and we go
ahead and click the button you know what
let me get rid of the console log of the
text just to clear that up
all right so let's click it we get ready
state one so at this point of the of the
whole thing we're at 1 which is server
connection established now let's go down
to onreadystatechange and let's go
before this check ok and we'll do the
same thing we're gonna log the ready
state before the check so if we go ahead
and now you'll see it goes through one
two three four okay so it's actually
going through all of those until we
check for and then we want to do what we
need to but with onload it's not going
to go through all of these checks so if
I go ahead and I comment this out
and we go and uncomment this and we go
and we put our checkout readystate
and save and click the button you'll see
we get one right here and then here it's
already at four
okay so onload is not going to run
unless it's ready that's the biggest
difference between these two all right
hopefully that makes sense
now it's perfectly fine for you to use
on ready state change instead of onload
just know that you have to check for the
ready state here as well all right and
then we also have a method for on xhr
called on progress alright so we'll say
optional and let's say this is usually
used for like loading or loaders you
know and when you go to and you click
something or you go to a page and you
see the little round loading thing
little gif image that's usually
signifying that you're waiting for
something so if you want to do something
like that you can use on progress so xhr
dot on progress equals function and
let's go ahead and log the ready state
here
okay so we'll click that and you'll see
that that's actually on three okay on
progress is on three which is what
processing request okay so if it hangs
or something or if it's waiting in that
progress state you're gonna see your
your little loader there if that's what
you how you set it up alright and this
is completely optional I'm just trying
to show you guys the different you know
properties and methods attached to this
xhr object now one more thing that you
should do if you're going to use onload
is you should also you also use on error
in case something goes wrong you want to
have that handler so what we'll do is go
right under it and say xhr dot on error
and just set that equal to function
and then I mean you can handle it how
you want I'm just gonna do console.log
what and we'll just say request error
all right now you're not gonna need all
this stuff
I'm you know like I said I'm just going
through you're not gonna need both
onreadystatechange and on load you're
not going to need on progress unless you
want it you want some kind of loader all
right so it's not as hard as it looks
right here and you're gonna see that in
the other files that we create all right
now you can do whatever you want with
the return data in this case we were
just console logging it but if we want
to put it into the actual web page what
we could do is let's just put in a
couple line breaks and we'll create a
div with the ID of text and then what
we'll do is go right here and we'll say
document dot get element by ID text and
we'll say dot in our HTML equals this
dot response text okay so if we go and
we reload and click that brings the text
right in okay and it does it all
asynchronously
there was no reloading of the page or
anything like that it's all behind the
scenes okay and this is a very very
simple example of what Ajax can do
obviously you can do a lot more this is
just just to give you an example now you
can test for other statuses as well so
right now we're just testing for 200
which means everything's okay but we
could also do like elsif and let's say
else if this dot status equals 404 which
is a not found then we could con
sexually we don't have to console.log
we'll just put it here in the in the
text okay so we'll say document dot get
element by ID enter HTML equals and
we'll say not found
all right and now if I go when I change
this to sample to dot txt which we know
there isn't a file called that but if I
save and we go when we click we're gonna
get not found it's also gonna tell us
down here all right but just in case you
want to handle that somehow like putting
it in the actual page you can do that as
well okay and there's a lot of different
HTTP statuses if you want to go ahead
and do a search the Mozilla website is
really good for stuff like that alright
guys so that's gonna do it for this file
so that's basically just kind of
explaining everything now we're just
gonna jump in and we're gonna we're
gonna make this a little more simple and
you know leave out these comments and
these explanations and stuff like that
so let's create a new file let's see so
we'll create a new file called Ajax two
dot HTML all right and let's put in some
basic HTML tags and we'll say Ajax - so
this one we're gonna be fetching Jason
or you know let's say local Jason and
what I'm gonna do is create two files
here one is gonna be user dot jason and
then one is going to be users dot jason
okay so for user dot jason i'm just
gonna paste this in so very simple we
just have an object here with an ID a
name and an email we'll save that let's
go to users and we're just gonna paste
in adjacent array of users with an ID
name and email and you may recognize
these names here if you're cool
alright so let's save those close them
up and that's the data that we want to
fetch so let's go to Ajax - dot HTML
and then what I'll do is in the actual
HTML on the body let's create a button
with the ID of button one hand will say
get user and then we'll have another
button we'll call this button two and
we'll say get users all right and then
we just want I let's see what I want to
do let's let's just put in a couple line
breaks and then we'll have a div with
the ID of user nothing in it just the
div and actually it's putting each one
above it Emmet is really kind of acting
up lately so say user and then right
below that will say users and change
that to users so that's our HTML now
let's put in our script tags okay and we
want to document dot get element by D we
want button one and we want an event
listener so add event listener want to
listen for a click and we want to call a
function called load user all right let
me turn on wordwrap
can make this smaller too so now we're
going to go and create that function
load user
all right and we're gonna kind of do the
same thing that we did in the other file
we're going to create a variable xhr
we're gonna set it to new xml
httprequest all right and then we want
to call xhr dot open we're gonna make a
get request and then the URL or the file
name in this case it's going to be user
dot jason and then true for async all
right then what we want to do is is use
our on load so xhr dot onload set that
to function okay we want to check to
make sure everything's ok with the
status so if what we want to do an if so
if this dot status equal to 200 then for
now we'll just console dot log this dot
response text all right and then of
course we need our send so down here we
need to say xhr dot senton now you
should put in your on error here as well
but i'm just gonna leave it out so let's
save that let's go over here and reload
let's say get user and there we go so
it's getting the user from user dot
jason now you may think if we go ahead
and we put this in a variable like user
and then we say console dot log and we
say user dot name okay because you can
see it clearly has a name value just
make this smaller so if i save that we
reload and we you click that you'll see
we get undefined okay the reason for
that is because we actually have to wrap
this in a function called jason dot
parse if we want to be able to access
the probably the values that way so if
we reload click it now we get rick okay
so now we can get user dot email or user
dot
and so on so let's take this user and
let's out put it into this div right
here so we'll get rid of the console.log
and we'll create a variable called
output and we're gonna set that we're
just going to initialize it with an
empty value here and then we're gonna
just append on to it so we're gonna say
output output and then we can append
with plus equals okay so we're gonna say
plus equals let's put a ul and then if
we want to go on to another line we have
to put a plus now if this were a
production prod project I would be using
es6 temp template strings or template
literals where we can use backticks and
we don't have to concatenate like this
but I want you guys just to have this
and you know pure es5 JavaScript I know
it's it's a little more difficult but
you should know how to do it anyways
alright so let's go ahead and continue
this here so next line will be the Li
will have an Li so let's go Li like that
and then we want to concatenate in here
well we'll say ID and then we'll
concatenate in like this so user dot ID
and then let's just copy that paste in
two more so that'll be ID this will be
the name this will be the email
all right and then finally we'll just
have an ending ul and we can end this
with a semicolon so that's basically our
HTML string or our output string and
then what we can do is we can say
document dot get element by D we want to
grab the element with the ID of user so
user dot inner HTML equals output so
let's go ahead and save it let's go up
here and reload click get user and there
he is there's Rick so what we've done is
we've fetched data from the JSON file
behind the scenes asynchronously and
we've built a template string or an
output string and we've output it into
the browser and this is this was all
done asynchronously without having to
reload the page or anything like that
all right so if we wanted to get users
which is an array that's gonna be pretty
similar let's do that with this button
too so what I'll do is add another event
listener with button two and we're gonna
call a function called get let you load
users all right and then what I'll do is
copy the entire load user function paste
that down here change that to load users
this time we want to get users Jason and
let's see we're gonna go down here now
since we're getting an array we need to
do this a little differently we need to
actually do a loop so that we can loop
through and then append the output
append the UL to each user so we're
gonna wrap this in a for loop we're
gonna say for I'm actually going to use
a for in loop so we'll say var I in
users which should be this okay that
should be users and let's see we're just
going to wrap
let's see we want this to end right here
oh okay so you don't want to have this
this document.getelementbyid d you don't
want that in the loop all we want to do
is just add in the output in the loop
all right and then we're gonna output
this to users so let's put an S right
there and save and then we can still get
the single user if we click get users
now the reason we're getting undefined
for these is because since we did a loop
here we actually we can't access it with
just user dot ID we need to say users
and then the current iteration so we
need to put an I brackets and an I like
that okay and then we'll save let's try
it again get users and there we go so
now we're getting them all all right so
that's how we can fetch some local jason
with ajax all right now what i want to
do is i want to show you how we can work
with an external API so we're going to
use the github api which is extremely
public extremely easy to use we don't
need any authentication or anything
unless we're making a ton of requests so
let's create a new file called ajax
three dot HTML and let's go ahead and
put some structure in here we'll say
ajax three handle six sternal api so in
the body all i want to put here is a
button will give it an idea of users
i'm sorry an idea of button
and let's say load github users okay
we'll put a couple line breaks and we'll
put an h1 I'll say github users and then
we'll just put a div with the idea of
users okay all right now for the github
API all we have to do is visit an eight
URL which is HTTP slash slash API
github.com slash users and it'll give us
a list of the first hundred users you
could you could add parameters to filter
this and stuff but we're not we're not
gonna get into that I just want to show
you how to actually make the request so
that's the URL we're gonna make the
request to instead of just a local file
like we've been doing alright and like I
said some servers are different some API
is you need authentication they need
cores enabled which which has to do with
cross domains and you know using your
client on a different domain than the
server and it can get really complicated
but what we're gonna do is go down here
and put in our scripts and let's put a
document dot get element by ID button
and we want to add an event listener for
a click and we want to call load users
alright so let's go ahead and actually
put a comment here we'll say load github
users and function load users and what
we want to do is grab our xhr object
that and we're gonna call xhr dot open
it's gonna be get now for the second
parameter it's going to be this URL so
the github API slash users and then just
add true here all right then we'll do
our onload okay so in here let's go
ahead and check for status if this dot
status is equal to 200 then we want to
create a variable called users set it to
jason dot parse and this dot response
text okay so that should give us the
actually let's just console.log the
output here users all right we got we
need to do our send so let's make sure
we go down here and say xhr dot send and
save and then let's go to ajax three dot
HTML click load github users and there
we go there's all of our users so i want
to output these into the browser so what
we'll do is kind of the same thing we've
been doing let's create a variable
called output and set it to nothing and
then we're going to loop through so
we're gonna do for for VAR users i'm
sorry for VAR i in users and we'll say
output plus equals
and let's just depend a bunch of stuff
here so we're gonna put in a div with
the class of user alright and then let's
see we're gonna put an image because if
we look at what we can get here we can
get an avatar URL which is the actual
image of the the github user so in the
source attribute here we're going to
concatenate so single quotes and then
plus sign and we'll say users i dot
avatar underscore URL alright and I'm
just going to give that a width of 70
and a height of 70 alright so that'll
give us the image let's concatenate the
next line so we'll put a UL here and
then we'll do an Li and then inside the
Li we're gonna put the login you see we
have access to all this data we just
want the actually let's do the ID and
the login okay that's that's really all
I'm going to use here so ID will have to
concatenate users i dot login I'm sorry
dot ID okay and we're going to copy that
this one will be the login
and then we'll have the closing ul and
then we'll have the closing div all
right and that should be our output
string so now we want to go under the
loop and just do document dot get
element by ID we want the users ID and
we want to say dot in our HTML equals
output so let's save let's go back and
reload and there we go so now we're
fetching all those users putting them
into the HTML now I'm just gonna add a
very very simple styling up here so in
the head let's put in some style tags
and I'm gonna take the class of user and
let's say display flex which will just
align them horizontally and we'll give
them a background of light gray and
let's do a padding of 10 pixels and do a
margin bottom of 10 pixels all right and
then for the UL so I'll just say user
and ul I just want to take away the
bullets so we'll say let's type none all
right so let's reload click it again and
now it'll look like that so a little
nicer and that's how we can use Ajax to
fetch data from an external API
asynchronously behind the scenes and and
put it into our web page all right so
the next thing we're going to do is
we're gonna work a little bit with PHP
so what I'm gonna do is create a new
file here called process dot PHP all
right now if you're not using xampp or
some kind of server that has PHP
installed this will not work so make
sure that you're using either xampp or
WAMP or you're on an actual Apache
server maybe on a bun 2 machine or
something like that
all right so for now
what I'm gonna do is just put in a PHP
tag and I'm just gonna echo out a string
that says processing okay we'll save
that and then we're gonna create a new
ajax file so we'll say ajax for dot HTML
and close that up now a lot of you
probably know how to submit a form to a
PHP file okay so you can make a get
request with the form or a post request
so i'm gonna show you how to do that
first and then how to submit a get
request form and post request through
Ajax alright so let's go ahead and put
some markup in here and this is gonna be
Ajax 4 and we'll just say ajax and pete
PHP forms I don't know all right
and then let's see in the body actually
before we do the forms let's just put a
button in just to show you we can fetch
data from PHP so we'll say button let's
give it an ID of button and it will say
get name alright and then we'll put in
our script tags
and then let's do a event listener so
document dot get element but get element
by ID button add event listener we want
to click and what we'll do is we'll call
a function called get name okay let me
just turn on word wrap I don't know why
word wrap doesn't just stay on so let's
create a function called get name and
what we're gonna do here is we're going
to set up our xhr object okay we're
gonna say xhr dot open this is gonna be
a get request to our PHP file which is
process dot PHP and we'll say true
alright and then we'll do our onload and
let's just do console dot log and we'll
log this dot response text okay we just
need to do our send
and let's save okay we'll go to Ajax
four and if I open up the console here
and I click get name you'll see we get
processing so it's just getting whatever
is in this PHP file now what I want to
do is I want to send a get variable to
process PHP now when you work with PHP
and don't worry about it if you don't
know PHP there's gonna be some stuff in
these files you're not gonna really
understand but what I want you to
understand is just the way that Ajax
interacts with PHP okay or just how Ajax
works in general with with a couple
different examples so what we can do is
we can check for a get variable alright
we can do that by saying if and then PHP
has a function called is set and if you
want to learn more about this kind of
stuff with PHP I have a core course in
on YouTube called PHP front to back
where we go over all this stuff alright
so we're gonna say if is set money sign
underscore get which represents the get
super global and we're going to search
for a variable called name if that
exists then we want to echo and we'll
just say get your name is and then we're
gonna concatenate on money sign
underscore get name by the way this is
this is pretty unsafe just you know
outputting stuff like this but I just
want to show you how it works there's
actually security monk shion's you
should wrap around these and stuff but
I'm not going to get into that so let's
save that now the way that we can send a
variable to process PHP is by adding on
to it and a question mark and we can say
name equals and let's say name equals
brad alright so we'll go ahead and save
that and let's reload and we'll say get
name and we get get your name is Brad so
we sent this value to the PHP file and
it's getting it with this and it's
outputting it to us
all right now this right now is
hard-coded so what if we want to have a
form that we can submit and we can we
can get you know whatever the name we
put inside the input so let's do that so
I'm gonna create a couple forms up here
let's go right below the button I'll
just put in an HR and we'll say form
first of all let's just do it through
regular PHP so for that we would have we
would say method equals get it is get by
default but I like to put the method
anyways and then the action which would
be the actual file which would be
processed dot PHP alright and then in
here we'll have an input type of text
and then it would have a name which
would represent that that get name
variable we're gonna set that to name
alright and then we'll just put in a
input submit and we'll say value equals
submit alright so if we were to submit
this form we'll just say
John and submit it actually will you
know make a normal request to process
dot PHP it will redirect us it also put
that name variable inside the URL since
it's a get request all right now with
Ajax what we want to do is we want to
submit it behind the scenes and not
actually have it redirect to the page so
what we'll do is copy this you know what
we'll do is put an h1 right here oops
and let's say I'll just say get form so
this is a normal PHP get form alright
and then this one here is going to be an
Ajax get form so we don't need any of
this crap because they're not actually
submitting it to the PHP file we're
gonna do it through JavaScript so what
we'll do is give it an ID of let's say
get form we also want to give the input
an ID so that we can access it so we'll
give it an ID of name actually let's do
name one all right and then what we'll
do is go down here and let's do another
event listener but at this time we're
not going to do the button we're gonna
listen on the form which does the idea
of get form so let's say get form and
then we're not listening for a click
it's gonna be a submit of the form okay
and then we're gonna call the same
function get name which is this function
here now when we submit a form by
default it's gonna do what we just saw
it's gonna try to go to a new file so
what we need to do is pass in an event
parameter here and then just stop that
from happening with prevent default like
that alright and then we can continue
now we want to get the value of this
input because that's what we want to use
for this name okay so what we'll do is
we'll say variable name equals document
dot get element by ID okay it has an ID
of name one except we want to get the
value of it so we're gonna say dot value
all right just like that and then what
we'll do is replace this hard-coded Brad
with name okay we're gonna need to
concatenate it like that and then we'll
get the response text so let's go ahead
and save and let's reload so this is the
regular get form if we submit it it'll
get reloaded and you know make a normal
HTTP request with the Ajax form if I say
John and submit it'll do it behind the
scenes we get it back and then we're
just console logging it okay and we can
of course do whatever we want with it we
don't have to just log it we can bring
it into the web page and we can do
whatever we want with it all right let
me put let me fix that title all right
so hopefully that makes sense guys I
know it's a little difficult to
understand so now we're going to do is
we're going to do the same thing but
with post with a post requests okay when
you use a post request when you're doing
something like like adding data to a
server when you're you know submitting
to a server and you're saving data
things like that it's much more secure
so first we'll do the regular post form
just like we did with the get so we'll
go down here and we'll say post form
we'll change the method to post okay
it's still gonna go to process PHP let's
save it and then in process PHP we can
actually kind of do the same thing and
we can check for for post variables so
let's copy this so we'll check for post
and we can use the post superglobal just
to differentiate it let's go ahead and
write post right here so we know what
we're getting back and then post there
okay so if we go when we reload and we
say hello we submit it gets redirected
you can see we get post your name is
hello so it's just it's redirecting us
to the actual PHP page and it's
outputting that so now let's do the same
thing with Ajax so what we'll do is
we'll copy the ajak
get form paste that end this is gonna
now be the post form okay and then we're
gonna change the ID to post form and
change the ID of this to name two just
to kind of to differentiate these two
all right so let's copy this event
listener sorry for moving kind of fast
guys as if this video is getting really
long so this is going to be a an event
listener for the post forum and it's
gonna call a function called post name
alright so what we'll do is go down here
and let's see I guess we could just copy
get form cuz it's kind of similar and
we'll change it to post form our post
name sorry so the the form submits right
we need to stop the you know the initial
submit and then we're gonna grab the
value of - name - which is this right
here okay and then instead of making a
get we're gonna make a post request
now with post request we don't attach
the parameter like this so we're gonna
get rid of that and we just need to add
what needs a quote there we need to add
another property called set request
header under open so we're gonna say xhr
dot set request header and we need to
set the content type okay since we're
sending a post request so we're gonna
say content - type and we want to set
that as application I spell that right
application slash X - WWE for my URL
encoded okay that's that the content
type that we want to send this as and
then down here when we send it this is
where we need to send our params so what
I'm gonna do and what I mean by params
is the is the name
so we're gonna create another variable
called params up here and we're gonna
set it to name equals and then we're
going to concatenate on the name
variable which is this which comes from
the form and then all we have to do is
pass that in to send so it saved that
and let's reload let's go to our Ajax
post form we'll say Tom and submit and
we get processing post your name is Tom
alright so it looked at this right here
and it gave us this back ok as our
response and of course we could do
whatever we want with that all right now
I'm gonna take this a step further we're
gonna get a little more complicated
don't worry about it if you don't know
everything that's going on in PHP but
we're gonna actually submit the data
when we make our post requests I want to
submit it to the database to a MySQL
database
so I mean even if you want to stop the
video here if it's getting too difficult
that's fine but I do want to just keep
going just to show you guys so in
process dot PHP we're going to connect
to a database all right you have to have
MySQL installed if you have xampp
installed then you do have my as mysql
in fact you also have a tool called PHP
myadmin
so you could go to localhost / PHP
myadmin
and you can see your databases so we're
gonna cook quickly create a database by
clicking here database name I'll just
call it test or actually let's call it
ajax test all right now we're gonna
create a table called users with two
columns all right now we're gonna have
an ID for the user which will be an
integer and let's say 11 length and it's
gonna be make this bigger it's going to
be auto increment meaning it's going to
the ID is going to increment by one
every record that's passed in and then
we want it to be the primary key and
then we're just gonna have a name which
will be a varchar' variable character
and we'll say a hundred for its max all
right and save so we have a database
called Ajax test with a user's table
with an ID and a name okay I remember
that so now what we want to do is
connect to our database we can do that
by creating a variable called Conn or
whatever you want to call it and we're
gonna set my SQL i underscore connect
and if you're interested in this kind of
stuff again PHP front to back we go
through all of this stuff so we'll say
localhost is going to be the host we
connect to my password for my databases
root and I'm sorry the username and then
my password is one through six and then
the database we want to use is Ajax
tests because that's what we just
created all right so now what we want to
do is go into where we check the post
right and we want to create a variable
here called name and we want to take the
post name and we want to wrap it in a
function called MySQL real escape string
and this is really important for
security so we're gonna say MySQL I did
I say MySQL I meant MySQL ha i
underscore real underscore escape
underscore string all right so let's go
ahead and paste in here the connection
and then the post name variable okay so
now this name is gonna equal whatever is
passed into the input form all right and
then what we want to do is go down here
and say query we're gonna set it to an
SQL query which will be insert into
users remember we have a table called
users and we just want to insert the
name and then say values and the value
is going to be that name value that's
passed in from our form
okay then what we need to do is check
for the query so we're gonna say if
MySQL I underscore query we need to pass
in the connection and we need to pass in
the query that we just created which is
the insert query so if that happens and
it goes in everything goes okay then
let's just say echo user added okay else
then something went wrong and we can
just echo error and you can actually get
the actual error string which will just
whoops want to go like that
we'll just concatenate with MySQL MySQL
i underscore error and then that just
takes in the connection all right and
that's it so let's save it let's go back
to our form and reload let's go to our
post form cuz that's what we're working
with and we'll say John we'll say John
Doe
and submit so it gets our post your name
is your name is John which is coming
from this line here I probably should
have got rid of that and then we get
user added because it went through all
this and I and it looks like it actually
worked so we can check it by going to
our database going to our Ajax test
database going to users and now there's
John Doe okay so what we've done is
we've made an ajax request through this
form to our PHP file and then our PHP
file actually inserted that into the
database okay and we got back a request
which is just this user added I'm sorry
not a request a response so if we go
when we add another name let's say I
will just say Kevin looks like Kevin
Hart and submit we get post your name is
Kevin Hart a user added we should
probably get rid of that line that's
kind of confusing we'll save that
alright we'll add another one we'll say
Harry White submit processing user-added
now let's check our database reload and
we have those three names all right now
one more thing I want to do is I'm going
to create one more ajax file called ajax
five dot HTML and what we're gonna do
here is i want to fetch the users from
here through ajax okay so what we're
gonna do is create another PHP file and
I'm gonna call this users dot PHP and
just to save some time I'm gonna paste
this in so we're connecting just like we
did in the other file this should
actually be a Jax test and then we're
selecting all from the users table and
we're getting the result and then we're
gonna fetch the data put it into a
variable and then we're gonna echo it
out but we're gonna wrap it in jason and
code and what this does is it'll take
our result our associative array that's
returned from the database and put it
into JSON format okay and then give it
give us a response so let's save that
and then we'll go to our new Ajax five
file and then this is actually going to
be very similar to Ajax two where we
just got it from users Jason so what I'm
gonna do is copy that file paste it in
let's go ahead and change this to let's
say Ajax five and we'll say fetch from
PHP MySQL and we only need one button so
it's just so we'll say button ID one
will say get users and then we're just
gonna have the h1 with the users and
then an ID of users okay then we want an
event listener for just that one button
and it's gonna call load users okay
so we have two functions here load user
and load users I'm going to get rid of
the singular load user
and we just want this one here now
instead of users Jason we want users dot
php' okay and then down here we're gonna
do the same thing we're gonna get the
response remember it's gonna be encoded
and Jason so that's fine we can leave
this and then for the output we don't
have an email in our database it's just
ID and name so let's go ahead and just
get rid of the email all right and then
we just want to output it to the div
with the ID of users so that should be
good let's save let's go and go to Ajax
five dot HTML and let's click get users
and there we go we're getting the data
from MySQL it was all done
asynchronously through Ajax if we go to
our network tab and we go to users PHP
you'll see the response right here
alright and if we would go to go back to
Ajax four dot HTML and add a new user
we'll just say
Brad our Brad Travis II submit and then
go back to Ajax five dot HTML get users
and there is there I am alright now I
know I said that I was gonna go through
some of the libraries like Axios and
jQuery but we're really running out of
time here I didn't expect it to take
this long so what I'll do is make
another video of different Ajax
libraries and how to use them okay so at
least you have the standard JavaScript
xhr object under your belt you
understood understand how that works at
least at least the very basics if you
didn't get the PHP parts that's that's
fine don't worry about it that was kind
of a bonus as long as you understand how
this object works how we call you know
new XML HTTP requests we call the open
method onload and we can get our
response and we can do what we want with
the response all right so thanks for
watching guys I apologize for the last
10 minutes or so my son is being really
loud upstairs but thanks for watching
please hit that like if you liked
