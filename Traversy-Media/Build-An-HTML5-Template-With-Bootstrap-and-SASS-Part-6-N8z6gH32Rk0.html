CSS part of this series I realize that
the HTML took quite a bit of time you
know I could have just copy and pasted
but I kind of just want to go through it
line by line just so you can see exactly
what's going on alright so what we're
going to do is start our CSS and we're
going to work inside of our sass files
or our s CSS files okay so I want to
start with the actual body and some of
the base styles
alright so what I want to do is open up
actually just start over with this so if
you go to your S CSS folder and then
base and then base dot CS CSS that's
what we're going to start and start with
the body
alright so font family we're going to
use this I'm not exactly sure how to
pronounce it it's SC g OE UI so c go say
go I'm not sure how you say it alright
and then we're going to also include SE
goe WP
and also regular all right
and then sans-serif okay so that's our
font I want to set the font size now I
should mention right now I'm not going
to I'm not going to do the variables yet
we're just going to do our just our
regular CSS and then we'll work in the
variables after all right because I'm
going to have a variable for the font
size maybe even for the font family but
right now I'm just going to just put it
right in line height will do 1.7 m and
then the color on the base color will be
great
okay so let's just see if that pain any
difference okay you can see the font
change the color changed and remember
we're not in the CSS file we're in our s
CSS file now you need to have Scout
going okay your project should have this
little square stop icon all right if you
don't have this going it's not going to
compile into the CSS file
all right so links I just want to set a
color and that's going to be that bluish
color or the primary color which is zero
zero a FF zero
all right lists okay list I want to set
I don't want any bullets
so with style none
and CEO else
I want to set
actually I'm also going to open the
normalize because I want to set my
headings to not have any margin on the
top h2 h3 h4
all right
and let me just show you the CSS file
because it gets generated whenever we
save the s CSS file alright so you can
see we have our H ones from our
normalize s CSS file and then the body
is from the base and you can see it has
the comments and the line numbers
alright and that's because we have it on
development mode if we change it to
production mode we won't get that all
right so next let's do one else do I
have here
inputs I want to set the border-radius
to zero okay I don't want rounded edges
on the forms and stuff so input also
text area and buttons order radius zero
actually you know what I think I will do
the variables and the mix-ins and all
that because it might be too much of a
pain to go back after and look for where
we need to put them so let's do that
all right so in the SCSS ace folder I
want to open up variables in mix-ins
okay so variables let's set like font
colors we'll have
um
background colors
all right so flaunt colors
we'll say base font okay now when you
use variables you need to use a dollar
sign in the beginning all right
base font size I'm sorry it shouldn't be
in equals you should have a colon will
be 15 pixels
all right so now we should be able to go
to base and then instead of having 15
pixels here we'll say base font size
okay so let's check that out
and just to make sure that it's
definitely working let's try and change
it to 25
all right so you can see now it's
working all right so that's the base
font size let's do base font family
and I'm just going to grab this
try that
all right
is that right those that the color is at
the right font
we try changing this
okay all right right
all right so we get font size font
family I think that's good you know I
mean I don't like to have too many
variables not really any reason for that
but some of it I just think that some
developers is just unneeded to have you
know lines and lines of variables
especially when you when you know you're
not going to be changing it the base
color font color I want to do these font
color
all right so for the background let's do
primary color
okay and that's going to be this here so
I can just replace this here with
primary color
okay so we'll do a secondary color and
that's going to be that greenish color
so I'll paste that hexadecimal value in
alright light color
that's going to be that light light blue
and then we'll do a dark color and I'll
set that to really dark gray
all right
so that looks good so now you can you
can use these variables throughout your
site and if you ever want to change the
theme colors you just change them here
and they'll iterate through your entire
website all right so that's definitely
one of the best things about using a
preprocessor
all right so mix-ins we're not going to
have very many I do want to have one for
border-radius
because when you do this when you are
setup border-radius you should always
use the prefix at least for Mozilla and
Chrome for WebKit so you'd say Moz order
radius zero and also WebKit order radius
zero
all right so I instead of doing this
will create a mix in so let me just copy
this I'll actually I'll cut it go to
mix-ins
and what we need to do is say at mixing
in the name of it I'm just going to call
it border-radius
all right and then it's going to take a
parameter which is going to be the
number of pixels or the radius and then
I'm going to paste this code in and just
change this here to radius so it works
just like a function all right so now
back in my base I can just say include
whoops yeah border-radius
and we can just slip we can just throw
in here zero pixels all right so let's
make sure we have no errors all right so
when you have an error it'll actually
show you in the browser all right which
is kind of cool to have a CSS error
handler all right so moving on for bass
like that's pretty good for normalized I
just want to add a margin top for page
headers page header say margin top
30 pixels okay so save that
so for now I'm going to get out of the
base file and move on to the navbar so
we want to go in layouts nav
all right
so for the core navbar class we're going
to overwrite a lot of the bootstrap
styles all right so we're going to set a
width of 90 percent margin Auto and
we'll get what get into nesting here as
well which is another great feature of
sass margin Auto we're going to set a
border right and actually I like to use
a mixin for borders so let's do that and
put a little comment up here
all your CSS from all these files gets
thrown in the main dot CSS file so you
want to have you want to have a
commented as best as you can let's see
so we'll do mixin
add border and this will take let's see
we'll say size size color and position
and we're going to use some if
statements here some if-else statements
okay so we're going to say if actually
you know what we don't need parentheses
here we're just going to say if position
is equal to all
then say border
sighs oops
sighs solid color now you could also add
the border style in the parameters but
I'm not going to do that because we're
pretty much only using solids so sighs
solid color all right and then we're
going to say else if position equals
top
we're top size solid color alright so
basically I'm going to do that for the
all the positions
bottom
if position is bottom then we're going
to say border bottom
position is right
left
left and you could keep going and say
top bottom actually you know what we are
going to do that
say if position equals top bottom
because we're going to do that with some
of the sections I think
actually I'll just copy this
and then for this will say if position
is right left and it will just change
this
all right so I think that takes care of
all situations so now we want to what do
we want to do you want a border on the
right and the left of the navbar so
we'll say include ad border and the
first one is going to be size so we'll
say one pixel okay next is going to be
color in this case I'm just going to use
a grayish
all right and then the position which is
going to be right left
okay
I'm going to change the minimum height
by default I think it's 50 I'm going to
sync change it to 60
and background is going to be white and
we want to give it a margin bottom of 30
pixels
all right so something isn't right
did we include the nav
in the main file
layouts
huh
in valid CSS after else--if expected
okay so we have an error in our code
it's in the mix-ins line 13 house if
position equals top
ah
oh you know what we need to have an @
symbol for all these else ifs alright
let's see if that works
all right there we go
so our navigation does look different
okay we have this this black border at
the bottom excuse me I want to change
that color so I think I can just say
border color
here we go all right so that's the
navbar itself now we're going to do the
links now this is where we can use
nesting normally you would say navbar
a-alright which is going to cover the
links in the navbar class but with sass
you can go right into the navbar class
and just say a-all right and this is
going to give us the same result as this
which is really cool because this is how
it's structured in the HTML okay so
we're going to change the color the
color of the links is going to be the
primary color
odd size
I'm going to do a letter spacing of
negative 0.5 pixels and padding-bottom
we'll do 24 and padding-top
we'll do 20
all right
save
all right
now I also want to do the hover
actually you know what
I want to grab I'm going to do an f12 to
see to use Chrome tools and just check
out this right here I need this class
well I'm sorry these classes
and I should be able to put these
actually I want these out of this
and I'm going to change the background
to the primary color and then the actual
color will be white
okay so this is my hover colors this
active one I also want to change that oh
so I'm going to grab all this
then as well
save
look
there we go alright so now we have that
blue hover
so my links aren't reading some of these
styles it's not overriding the default
bootstrap CSS so we need to add some
important tags okay so for the color
just add important
and we're gonna do it for the padding as
well because it doesn't look like it's
taking
all right there we go this color here is
a little messed up
okay I also want to add important to
these
there we go
all right so I think I'm going to stop
here and in the next part we will work
on the showcase
and you can see that the content goes
behind the nav bar and it's supposed to
do that if you look at the finished
product you can see that the area goes
behind it on the homepage of the
showcase
alright so that's why it does that so
that's what we'll do next is this this
showcase area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
