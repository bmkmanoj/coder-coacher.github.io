react is the ability to add events to
our components all right and just have
it have your component encapsulate all
its events all right all together
so if we look at this page here in the
documentation it tells us all the
different kinds of events all right I'm
not going to go through them through all
of them but if we look real quick we
have keyboard events so on key down on
key press on key up which have their own
properties then we have focus events
unfocus on blur form events on change on
input on submit and we have a bunch of
Mouse events okay so clicks double
clicks drags drops all that good stuff
all right so let's go ahead and what
we're gonna do is this link we have here
we're going to get rid of our link
property up here and for the href I'm
just gonna put in a hashtag symbol all
right now in order to add an event to
this what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a handler let's say on click and
we're gonna set that to this dot on
click alright and this here can be
anything you want all right this is the
event this is the function that you're
going to create when this event is fired
all right so it's on click so what we're
going to do is we're going to go right
after the render function here and we'll
specify on click and that's gonna be a
function all right and then what we'll
do here is we'll just send an alert and
we'll say you collect all right so let's
go ahead and save that and we'll reload
this click the button and we get you
clicked all right so you can see how we
can nicely encapsulate all the events in
that particular component now there
might be a case where you want to have a
parameter in here all right you want to
bind something to it so to do that what
we can do is we can add on dot bind and
the first parameter is gonna be this and
then whatever after that you can choose
what you want so let's say we'll say
hello all right and then down on the on
click we're gonna add our parameter oops
sorry about that we're going to call
this greeting all right and then what
we'll do is just alert reading okay
we'll save that and if we reload and
click we get hello okay if you want to
have another parameter here let's add
one and we'll say goodbye and then down
here we're going to add a second
parameter called greeting too and then
we alert greeting to reload and we get
goodbye so that's a simple example on
how to use component events alright so
in the next video we're going to take a
look at state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
