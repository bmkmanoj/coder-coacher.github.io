not really sure where I'm going to go
with this series yet I'm just kind of
winging it kind of just going just
moving along so but what I want to do in
this video is install nodejs and we're
going to install it on Windows most of
the videos that you've seen probably the
probably using Linux or a Mac but we're
going to use Windows just because things
run a little different and I know some
of you might not know might not use
Linux or Mac so we're going to install
nodejs but first I want to install get
for Windows and there's two reasons I
want to install this one obviously is
for version control so we have that
accessible on our Windows machine and I
also like the terminal that it gives us
it allows us to do Linux like commands
and just just different things so that's
what we'll be using basically as our
terminal when we use node so you want to
go to get - SCM comm and click download
for Windows and actually already have a
video of this if you want to check that
out - I already downloaded it so I'm
going to go to that my downloads folder
and we want to install get
all right so I'm just going to use I'm
just going to use the default directory
for the components I'm going to just
leave
yeah we're just going to leave it as
default all right now here I actually
want to change this from using git bash
only because I want to be able to do get
and other Linux like commands within the
regular command prompt so I'm going to
choose this option where I get and
include UNIX tools from the windows
command prompt and for this option check
out Windows style we'll just leave this
as the fall
all right so you might get a security
alert you just want to allow access
that's just the windows firewall
I apologize if anything runs slow this
is actually a virtual machine that
doesn't have that much power so
all right so that's finished now you
usually would get an icon here but I
guess we didn't now this program comes
with a GUI as well the get GUI so you
can actually have an interface with
icons and stuff I have actually never
used it I basically just want this for
the command line you can check out the
GUI if you want but I'm going to take
this git bash and send it to my desktop
that way we can easily access that all
right and if we open that up it's
basically just a command prompt all
right so now what we want to do is
install node so you want to go to node J
s org and click install and it should
automatically give you the right file to
install depending on your system
all right so we want to open that
Oh
all right so this is just going to
install note on your system
just click all the defaults
all right so Note has been successfully
installed
and if we go to all programs
no js' we can send this to the desktop
all right now if we click on nodejs we
get this coming in line and what this is
is it's called repl which stands for
read eval print loop and it's basically
the command-line interface that we can
use to interact with node and we can
write JavaScript and among other things
but we're not going to be using this too
much because we can actually just access
it from our command line we could access
it from the standard Windows command
line as well as this get bash all right
in the all we have to do to access it is
just type in node and then it gives us
that same greater than sign and we can
do some stuff here all right so let's
just do a couple simple things we can
basically run JavaScript in the command
line all right so we can assign
variables we'll say variable Y which
gives us it instantiates a variable for
us we can say y equals 4 and it'll give
us 4 back if we say variable x equals 5
we get undefined and it's just not
returning us anything it's just
assigning the variable and this happens
if we use the VAR keyword and I'm not
I'm not a hundred percent sure why it
does that but it just does but either
way you're still assigning the variable
we can do basic math so we can say X
plus y which will give us nine we can
increment
so X is now six we can do stuff with
strings will say variable color is equal
to red and you want to make sure you use
quotes just like you would in any
JavaScript alright and we can do strings
we can print stuff out with console dot
log alright so in here we'll say my
favorite color is and then we can
concatenate on our variable okay so it
says my favorite color is red and this
console dot log you may have seen before
you may have used it in chrome tools
nodejs
actually runs on the same JavaScript
engine that Chrome runs on which is the
the v8 JavaScript engine and that's it's
really fast and that's one of the
reasons why note is so quick so that's a
basic installation like I said I'm just
kind of winging it for this series so I
know in the next video I want to start
getting into writing scripts that we can
access in the browser we'll write a
small web server program with node you
actually have to write the web server
yourself you have to send out the
request and response it's not like
something like PHP where you just
install it onto a server no it actually
is the server
alright so it's actually kind of cool so
we'll get into that and I'm also going
to I'm going to be using Express which
is an MVC framework for node it's a node
module so we'll get into that as well
and we'll do some other cool stuff as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
