project we're going to be creating a
landing page with a full-screen image
background now this is something that
stumps a lot of new developers and new
designers is how to get it so that no
matter how how the browser is sized the
image the background image stays full
width and full height so that's what
we're going to be doing today and what
we're building is not going to anything
special it's not going to be a
full-fledged website but we're going to
focus on the showcase the the landing
page the image and then we're going to
add some content down here well style it
a little bit we're going to use a little
bit of flex box but you'll see if I
resize this page here this browser
window the image is always going to stay
full width and full height no matter
what until we scroll down and then we
can see the content all right and it's
completely responsive if we go down to
you know mobile size it'll look like
this and you can see the rest of the
content we're using flexbox to align the
content here as well as these boxes down
here but again this is not a flexbox
tutorial if you're interested in
learning flexbox I do have a video
called flexbox in 20 minutes so let's
all be doing today guys hopefully you
enjoy it and let's get started this
video is sponsored by dev Mountain if
you're interested in learning web
development iOS or UX design dev
Mountain is a 12-week design and
development boot camp intended to get
you a full-time job in the industry to
learn more visit dev mountain comm or
click the link in the description below
alright guys so we're going to get
started here we're going to start off by
grabbing the image now of course you can
use whatever image you want the one that
I'm using is this Beach image from
pixels comm which is a fantastic site
for free stock photography very high
quality images and you have different
sizes to choose from this is the URL for
this image if you want this one and I'm
grabbing the large which is the nineteen
twenty by twelve eighty so let's click
download and we're actually going to
save this to the project folder that
I've already created called beach
landing okay there's nothing in it right
now so I'm going to create a new folder
in there called IMG that's for our
images and we're going to save this file
as showcase dot JPEG all right so now
that we've done that because you have
downloaded a couple times now that we've
done that I'm going to open up atom
which is the text editor I'm using which
opened on the wrong screen all right you
can see over here I have my beach
landing folder with our image folder so
there's a few other things we need to
create here of course we need an HTML
file so we're going to create index dot
HTML and then we're going to need place
for our CSS file so let's create a
folder called CSS and inside there we'll
create a file called style dot CSS and
that should be it as far as I'm the
structure so let's go to the index.html
and we need to generate some head and
body tags standard HTML document
structure now I'm using a plug-in called
Emmet which is absolutely incredible it
allows us to quickly add HTML and CSS
abbreviations I just did a video on it I
think two videos back so you guys may
want to check that out but that allows
us to do exclamation and then tab and it
generates our structure for us gives us
head body tags HTML tags also gives us a
viewport for responsiveness so very
handy plugin and i'd highly recommend it
so let's go ahead and just change the
title i'm going to call it the beach and
we're going to have to link our CSS
files so we're going to put in a link
tag here so that's going to be CSS slash
style dot CSS and then we're going to go
into the body now the main image
showcase area I'm actually going to put
in a header tag alright so I'm going to
say header and we're going to give this
an ID of showcase ok now I can do this
here because I'm using Emmet so I can
say header and then we want an ID of
showcase and then hit tab and that's
what it'll give us all right so in this
header we're going to have a couple
things we're going to have an h1 so when
the h1 I'm just going to say welcome to
the beach and then we're going to have a
paragraph and I'm going to generate some
text here so I'm using Emmet so I can
say lorem 15 tabs that will give us 15
word
some sample text again if you're not
using Emma just go ahead and type you
know put whatever you want in here so
let's go ahead and put and create a link
that's going to be styled as a button
so it's going to be an a tag I'm going
to give it a class of button alright and
it's not going to go anywhere we'll just
put a hash in there and then for the
text we'll say read more all right so
that takes care of our header now I'm
going to save this and I'm using a
plug-in called atom live server which
will allow us to open up this directory
on my localhost and a browser of course
you don't need that you can simply open
up your index.html file but I'm going to
go ahead and say start server and it's
going to open it up in the browser and
this is what it's going to look like so
far alright now what I'm going to do I'm
going to hold off on the rest of the
HTML the sections below it because I
really want to focus on this part of it
the showcase image so we'll hop back
into atom and we're going to go to our
CSS all right so let's add some stuff
for the body okay so for the body we're
going to zero out the margin so there's
no spacing around it you know what let
me open let me split the screen here
yeah well just I guess I guess that's
good so margin and this is all the load
by the way this atom live server as soon
as I save this will update so we got rid
of the margin around the body let's go
ahead and change the font because I
don't want Times New Roman it's very
ugly I'm going to say font family I'm
going to use Emmet and just say FF font
family : a tab and that will give us
Arial with a backup of Helvetica and
sans-serif save that and you'll see the
font changes alright so lets change the
size of the font i want it to be a
little bigger than the default so we'll
say font size and I'm going to set it to
17 pixels alright and then we're also
going to change the color to a brownish
color which is the hexadecimal value of
nine two six two three nine all right
and then we're just going to set the
line height
the default line-height 21.6
and save alright so that's that's the
styles for the body now we're going to
work on the image the showcase area
remember we gave the header an idea of
showcase so we're going to use that and
we want to give it the background image
so background image and then URL okay so
the URL it's going to be dot dot slash
because we want to go outside of our CSS
file and then into the image folder so
into IMG and then showcase dot jpg now
what this has done is it's given a back
it's given the image background to the
showcase header but it's only taking up
the amount of the actual content which
is the h1 the paragraph and the link so
what we want is it to take up the entire
thing now when you're starting out you
may think that you can just say height
100% like that but what that's going to
do is it's not going to change anything
because it's taking up a hundred percent
of its content all right now we could
also set it to a fixed pixel like if we
said 800 pixels and save that we'll make
it 800 pixels high which is okay if your
browser is always going to be at that
that 800 pixel mark which it's not you
know a lot of people are going to view
your your content your website on
different devices different browsers
different sizes so that's not going to
work either so what we want to use is we
want to use the VH CSS unit so if we
look up CSS units you know we have
pixels we have percentages we have
points what we want is VH and this
stands for viewport height okay so this
is the the main secret of what we're
doing here and the viewport height what
you can think of is the whole viewport
which is the body of this browser here
think of it as a hundred slices across
okay and then you can fill it you can
fill whatever amount of slices that you
want so we want it to cover the entire
thing so we want a hundred viewport
Heights so we're going to set it to 100
VH and save and now it's at 100
by the way the space you're seeing up
here is just from the the margin from
the heading okay by default actually you
know what I'll do is I'll just zero out
all the margin and padding by using an
asterisk right here okay so this is
actually called a reset we're going to
set margin zero and padding zero by
default there we go alright so we have a
hundred VH now if we wanted to take up
half the size we could do fifty VH and
save and you'll see it takes up those
fifty slices of the hundred slices
available and you can do V W as well you
can do it with wise but we're going to
stick with just the VH now as it is the
image is taking up the full window but
we can't see the whole image we're just
seeing a piece of it so we want to add a
couple extra things here we want to add
a background size property so I'm going
to go right here and say background size
and we're going to set that to cover
okay and then we also want to set the
position I want to Center the image so
we're going to set background - position
and we're going to set it to Center
alright so now let's go ahead and save
it and there we go so now if I go ahead
and I resize this you'll see that it's a
hundred it's going to be a hundred
viewport Heights now if I add some
content below it under the header let's
put in a section I'm going to give it an
ID of section - a alright and then we'll
just put let's put some content will say
lorem 100 tab and actually let's put
that in the paragraph so lorem 100 tab
save and now even though I have some
content in there we have to scroll down
to see it because the image the header
takes up a hundred viewport Heights
alright so that's that's the main
ingredient in creating this this full
screen landing page now I don't want to
just stop here and leave you with this
even though we've really covered the the
viewport height so we're going to
continue to style this now this text and
this content I want
be in the middle here there's a few
things you could do you could add you
know padding to the to the top you could
Center it but we're going to use flexbox
which makes it really easy to align
things and is really the recommended way
to do things like this at least
recommended by me so we're going to set
the showcase to display flex this makes
it a flex container as soon as we do
that it's going to take all the content
within it all the you know we have the
h1 the paragraph and the link and it's
going to align them horizontally as flex
items okay now there's different
properties we can use here to change the
layout and I don't want it to go across
like this I want to go down so we're so
the default is actually a flex row but
we want to change it to a column and we
can do that by saying flex - direction
and we're going to set it to column and
we'll save that and now it's going to go
you know
vertically instead of horizontally now I
want to set it to the center I wanted to
I want to align to the center both
horizontally and I want it in the middle
here okay vertically so there's two
properties we need to add here one is to
justify content and we want to justify
it to the center if we save that that's
going to move it down to the to the
middle and then we want to align it to
the center as well so we'll say a line
content center and save
I'm sorry not online content Hawaiian
items and save and now it's in the
middle okay and I do again I have a flex
box in 20 minutes video that you may
want to watch a few if you want to learn
more about flex box so I'm also going to
just add a little bit of padding on the
sides here because when the window gets
really small you'll see that the text is
right up against it so let's go ahead
and just say padding you'll say zero top
and bottom and then 20 on the left and
right okay that way when the screen is
really small it has some space on the
sides so now let's take care of this
stuff in the middle so we'll start with
the h1 I'm going to make it
little bigger so let's go over here and
say showcase h1 and I'm going to set the
font size to 50 pixels okay so make it
bigger and then I'm going to set a
margin bottom actually well we don't
need the margin bottom I initially was I
was going to do that because I didn't
have this reset up here at first but I'm
just going to leave the reset alright
and what that reset does again is just
takes away the margin and padding from
all elements on the page because by
default h1 and paragraphs they have
default margins so that's just going to
remove it so for the paragraph I want to
make that a showcase paragraph and I
just want to make the font a little
bigger on that so we're going to say
font size and we're going to set that to
20 pixels all right and then for the
button or it's actually a link formatted
as a button so showcase remember we gave
it a class of button so for that we're
going to change the font size to font
size to 18 pixels and we're going to
take the the underline off so text
decoration we're going to set that to
none we're going to change the color to
to that brown color which is this right
here this hexadecimal value okay we're
also going to add a border around it if
I save it so far it's going to look like
that but let's go ahead and add a border
border is also going to be that brownish
color so just grab that we'll say one
pixel solid we also want some padding so
padding is going to be 10 pixels talking
bottom 20 left and right and then let's
make it a little rounded so we'll safe
order radius we'll set that to 10 pixels
and save and there's our button all
right now we're going to have to push it
down a little bit so what I'm going to
do is add a margin
top of let's try 10 pixels actually
let's do strike 20 all right so that's
good now when I go when I make this
smaller you'll see that it kind of
messes up that's because we need to add
a text-align:center - to the items in
the showcase as well so right under a
line-item Center let's do
text-align:center there we go
all right now the line height for the
heading and see when it breaks into two
lines I want this a little smaller so
what I'm going to do is in the h1 I'm
going to set the line height line height
we'll set that to one point to save and
that looks a little better all right so
that's the showcase that's yeah that's
the whole showcase now what I want to do
actually we want to take care of the
button:hover
I wanted to have an effect where the
background turns brown so real quick
let's just say showcase class button on
its hover State we want to add a
background of this color here and we
want to make the color of the text white
okay so now we have that hover effect
all right so the showcase is done now
let's move on to the sections I'm going
to go back to the HTML let's just make
this a little bigger all right and we
have our section a here and we're going
to have a section B as well so I'll just
copy this whole thing and we'll go ahead
and paste that in and we'll change this
to Section B and then we're going to
have a section C section C is actually
going to have three divs within it so
let's say section ID will be section - C
and then in here we're going to have a
div with the class of box 1 and let's
put alarm we'll put 20 words in here
and yeah so let's copy that we're going
to have box 1 box 2 in box 3 alright so
if we save it this is what it's going to
look like by default just a bunch of
mess so let's go back to our CSS and
let's see we're going to add some
padding to we're going to start with
section a so ID section a we're going to
add 20 pixels padding okay so 20 pixels
padding let's add a background of the
brown color now we can't see any text
because the text color by default is
that brown color so we're going to go
ahead and just change the color to white
all right and then let's just
text-align:center all right there we go
now for section B I'm just going to copy
this so section B again will have 20
pixels padding but the background we're
going to say the background is going to
be very light gray so f4 three times and
then the color is going to be the brown
color which is the default so we don't
actually need a color all right so let's
save that and there we go and then for
section C I want these three divs to be
aligned horizontally so we're going to
turn them into Flex items so we're going
to say I D section C we want to display
as flex okay once they save that you'll
see that they'll automatically align
horizontally so what I want to do is
each the first and the last box box one
in box 3 I want those to have a dark
background I'm actually going to put a -
box - one two and three all right so
let's say we want to take section C and
we want the class of Box one okay we
also want
Section C the class of box three that
actually should have a dash there okay
so one in three and we want the
background to be the brown color so I'm
going to grab that base that in and
scroll down we'll also need to make the
color white okay let's actually add some
padding to each of these divs here so
I'm going to say section let's say
section C div and say padding 20 pixels
okay there we go now the middle one here
you could leave it at white if you want
but I had it at a slightly lighter gray
than this gray so what I'll do is grab
that and let's do box two and we'll set
the background to f9 three times get rid
of the white coloring save and now it's
it's light gray and it's it's a little
lighter than this one alright so that
looks good guys I think that's it yeah
so let's just just you know make this a
little bigger see how it looks good
let's change the height and notice that
that the image is going to stay in the
background no matter what size until we
scroll down on mobile devices it'll look
like this which looks pretty good so
that's it hopefully you guys enjoyed
