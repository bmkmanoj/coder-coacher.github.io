we're gonna be building a coming soon or
an under-construction landing page from
scratch and we're not using any
frameworks or anything like that it's
just vanilla HTML CSS and JavaScript
okay we're going to include this dynamic
counter here at the bottom that updates
every second so we can simply set a
launch date and it'll calculate the days
the hours the minutes and the seconds
and this is something that's very
practical that you can use for your own
projects this is actually for an
application I'm working on for my
full-stack react course it's a social
network called the dev connector but of
course you can switch out the logo and
the background image the text whatever
you want alright it's also completely
responsive so if we were to make this
smaller you'll see once we get to a
certain point what I've done is I've
I've changed the we're actually using
flexbox for these these boxes here and
I've changed the orientation to column
and just stretched out the width and I
got rid of the minutes and the seconds
and the hours because when you're on a
mobile device it's gonna be much shorter
and we're setting an overflow of hidden
so there's gonna be no scrolling I don't
want there to be any scrolling at all so
I feel that if I kept that the other
stuff it would be just be too long so I
think that it's fine for on mobile
devices to just show the days all right
we also have a responsive height so if I
were to make this shorter once we get to
a certain point you'll see that the logo
gets smaller the little paragraph goes
away if I go even shorter then the h1
should go away as well all right so it
still looks good even at a very small
height so that's what we'll be building
hopefully you guys enjoy this and you
can use this in your projects feel free
to use it it's completely open-source so
let's get to it
coding dojo is a programming school that
turns beginners into developers and only
14 weeks over 90% of their grads land
jobs within three months of graduating
often making over seventy K per year to
learn more visit coding dojo com or
click the link in the
cindello all right so let's get started
here so I just have vias code open and I
have an empty folder called coming soon
landing and there's nothing in it so
we're gonna create this from absolute
scratch so let's create our index dot
HTML file and we're gonna need just a
couple folders here so let's create our
CSS folder and let's create our
JavaScript folder j/s and let's also
create a folder for images so IMG now I
will have the code pen in the
description which will have some links
to some remote images so you can grab
the images from there especially the
logo one of the images the background I
got from pixels calm and I'm not exactly
sure what I what I search for might have
been programming let me see and you can
use any image you want it doesn't really
matter but if you want to be exact yeah
it's this one right here so I got the
the ten eighty nineteen twenty by twelve
eighty version all right if you want to
be exact and then the logo you'll be
able to get in the code pen I might I
might even put a link to it in the
description all right so let's get
started here the HTML is gonna be very
simple I'm just gonna use Emmet to put
in some boilerplate code actually you
know what let's also add in our CSS file
and stuff so let's add style dot CSS and
let's add main dot J s and then I'm just
gonna bring the images over as well
alright so in the image full IMG folder
I'm gonna bring over three things
there's actually three images because
I'm actually going to create a favicon
for this as well just in case you guys
don't know how to do that I'm gonna use
a program called dynamic drive or a
website called dynamic drive that allows
us to take a PNG or a JPEG and turn it
into an ICO file but if we take a look
at these images they just look like this
okay this is the main logo this is the
background the showcase and the favicon
alright so let's go ahead and continue
with our HTML so I'm just going to
change the title here too
just say coming soon and we're gonna add
a link to our style sheet which is in
the CSS folder and then style dot CSS
let's also add a link to our JavaScript
so that's gonna be in the jas folder and
it's gonna be main dot j s alright and
then let's go ahead and put in a section
here I'm going to use html5 section tag
and give it a class of landing and then
in here we're going to have a class of
landing - inner and the main reason for
this class is because I want an overlay
I don't want just the image as the
background because there's just too much
noise we won't be able to read our text
so we want an overlay where we can
actually add a background color like a
darker color with some opacity with some
transparency so that's why we're doing
that and then let's put our logo in so
it's going to be an image and it's gonna
be in the image folder and it's called
logo dot PNG for the alt I'll just say
dev connector you can put whatever you
want and under that will put our
paragraph and we're just gonna say a
social network for developers and guys
the react course should be out within
might say 30 or 40 days as an estimate
it's gonna be completely full stack you
know nodejs mongoose in the backend JWT
tokens all that stuff so look forward to
that
h1 we're gonna do an h1 with the class
of coming soon and we're just gonna say
coming soon and then under that we'll
have another h1 this is going to be a
placeholder for the countdown so I'm
gonna give it a class of sorry about the
phone guys ever ever feel like every
video this happens let me just shut this
off
all right so we have an h1 as a
placeholder and that's it that's our
HTML so we'll save this and you can go
ahead and just open the HTML file if you
want but I'm using live server with vs
code so I'm gonna say open with live
server and we're just gonna see
something like this alright so now let's
go to our CSS ok CSS is next we'll do
the JavaScript last now I'm gonna just
go ahead and set all everything to have
a box sizing box sizing property of
border box and that's just gonna make
sure that any padding or border or
anything like that goes inside of the
box model alright so it doesn't add to
the width or the height or anything like
that then we're gonna take the HTML and
body and we're going to set margin to
zero let's set the font-family I'm just
gonna use Arial which is right here and
let's add a color we want white as our
color and someone asked me recently why
I use hexadecimal values and not the
color name and it's just preference you
can use what the word white if you want
it's just it's just a preference no
special reason I guess so the background
I'm also either even though we're gonna
have an image background I'm gonna set
the background color to a dark dark gray
almost black and then I'm gonna set
overflow:hidden which is going to make
it so that we can't scroll so it's a
overflow:hidden and that's our body so
let's save okay next thing we'll do is
the landing okay which is the main
section has a class of landing and we
want to position this as relative
because the landing inner that goes
inside of it is going to be positioned
absolute and we want the landing we want
this class to be its parent so it has to
be relative and then we'll set the
background
and we're gonna set that to a URL and
let's say dot dot slash because we need
to go outside of the CSS folder into the
image folder and then we want showcase
dot PNG okay we want to add a couple
background properties here so we want
background size and we want it to cover
okay we want to cover everything we also
want to position it so we'll say
background position and let's say Center
okay and then the height I want to take
up the entire the entire height of the
the browser window so we're going to set
it to 100 V H which is viewport Heights
all right so if we save that let's see
why are we seeing it section class
landing what I miss here image showcase
oh it's a JPEG I'm sorry not it's not a
PNG there we go
okay so now we just have the actual
image there's no overlay and it's just
it's very bright and just doesn't work
so this is why we have the landing inner
where we can put our overlay okay and
and for VH if you're not familiar with
that it stands for viewport Heights and
you can basically think of the height of
the browser as a hundred different
slices across and we want to take up all
100 if I were to put 50 VH and I've
explained this in quite a few videos
it'll only take up 50 of those 100
slices okay but we want it to be full
screen alright next we're gonna do the
landing - inner okay so landing inner we
want to position as absolute and so it's
basically it's it's basically just gonna
completely cover the landing okay its
parent so let's see we want to we want
to basically the position we want from
the top zero
and left zero so from the top left-hand
corner and then we want it to be a
hundred percent across so we'll say with
100 and then a hundred percent height so
it covers the whole thing and then we
want to add a background it's going to
be a color but we want to do rgba okay
and the reason for that is because rgba
allows us to specify an alpha value
which is an opacity value so we can make
it transparent and we're gonna make it
black which is just three zeroes now if
I did that if I did RGB like that that's
not gonna work or if I did a hexadecimal
value not gonna work because we need to
add that extra value at the end which is
the opacity which I'm going to set to
zero point seven and if I save now you
can see that week it's actually
transparent okay another thing we're
gonna do inside the landing inner is I'm
just gonna text a line everything to the
center and let's add just a little bit
of padding at the top of 50 pixels and
there we go now for the h1 this coming
soon and actually that the counter will
also be an h1 we're gonna set a font
size so we're gonna say landing h1 and
let's set the font size of that to 50
pixels and then I'm also gonna set for
the paragraph will set a font size of 20
pixels
okay and the paragraph is this right
here all right so let's see the rest of
the stuff aside from the media queries
has to do with the countdown and we
can't see the countdown yet so we're
gonna hop over to our JavaScript now so
that we can get that settled alright so
we're gonna start off by creating a
variable called countdown and we're
gonna set this to the the elements with
the class of countdown so we're going to
use document dot query selector and we
want to choose the class of countdown
let me get rid of this sidebar okay next
thing we're going to do is we're going
to set the launch date
okay so we'll say Const launch date and
let's set that to new date okay we're
gonna use our javascript date
constructor and the launch date I'm
gonna choose is going to be January 1st
of 2019 and I'm gonna say it's gonna be
at 1 o'clock so 13 0 0 0 0 and we want
this as milliseconds so we're gonna
attack on the get time method and
that'll give us the milliseconds all
right so if I were to console.log here
the launch date save that let's open up
our console and you'll see that we have
the milliseconds for that okay now we
need to set an interval for every second
so every second we want the the time to
update or the countdown to update so
let's say update every second and I'm
going to create a variable called int V
al for interval and we're going to use
the JavaScript function set interval
okay now set interval takes in a
function I'm going to use an arrow
function this is an es six arrow
function you could you could just do the
word function and get rid of the arrow
like that but I want to keep it more
modern and use this syntax and then the
second parameter is how often do we want
this to go on which is every second now
good it takes milliseconds so we want to
do 1000 okay every second and if we were
to do like let's say console dot log
hello and let's save and let's what let
it run you'll see right here every
second it's law its console logging the
word hello okay so it's gonna run every
second and that's what we want alright
so in here what we want to do now is we
want to get today's date and time and we
want to get it in milliseconds okay this
is also in milliseconds so to do that we
can create a variable I'll call it now
and we'll set it to the new date and if
we just do new date with no parameters
it's going to be today's date and date
and time and then we use get time to get
the milliseconds okay now what we want
to do is get the distance from now to
the launch date in milliseconds and we
can do that vile it's set a variable
whoops don't want it to be capital so
distance equals and then we can simply
do launch date - now alright and if we
console.log distance and save you can
see that well it's actually gonna do it
every second and it's gonna give us the
distance from then until now and it's
gonna go down one second every time
alright so next thing we want to do is
our calculations
and this is how we get the days the hour
is all that stuff and they're just just
general formulas to do that I am I am
horrible at math I had to look this
stuff up and I'm not ashamed to admit
that I'm just I'm not good with math but
basically we want to create our days
variable and say floor which is going to
round down and we want to take the
distance and divide it by 1,000 times 60
times 60 times 24
okay so 60 minutes in an hour or 60
seconds in a minute 60 minutes in an
hour 24 hours of the day this is gonna
this is gonna get the days for us and
the next thing we want to do is get the
hours so we're gonna do the same thing
math dot floor and we're gonna take now
distance and we're going to use the
modulus operator and pass in that same
formula so this right here alright and
then we want to divide by 1,000 times 60
times 60
all right so that should give us the
hours and then we want to get the
minutes so we'll say mins and we'll set
that to math.floor and this time we're
gonna put in here actually know what
this this part of the equation here
should be in parentheses so we want to
put one there and we want to put one
here and then I'm just gonna copy this
whole thing four minutes and then we
just want to change let's see
all you have to do is get rid of one of
these six T's so it'll just be 1000
times 60 all right and then I guess I'll
just copy this down and this will be our
seconds so seconds and then we want to
take this same thing oh you know what
I'm sorry for the minutes we don't want
this last 24 so it should be 1000 times
60 times 60 divided by 1,000 times 60
and then for seconds it should be 1,000
times 60 for the first divided by 1000
so we don't need these parenthesis
because it's just 1000 okay and if
you're not that great at math that might
confuse you it does confuse me a little
bit but it's just a general formula
you'll see this all all over the place
online so next thing we do now that we
can calculate all that stuff is we want
to display the result okay so we're
gonna take that countdown variable which
is the countdown class okay we set it to
the element in the DOM and we want to do
inner HTML equals and we have quite a
bit to put in here so I'm going to use a
template string which is part of the
es2015 or es6 standard so we use back
text not quotes and we can put we can
mix in here HTML with variables
all right so we're basically going to
have for dibs can I use em in here I'm
not sure if I can yeah I can all right
so we have our divs and then in here we
want the day's value and this is how we
can use a variable with template strings
so that'll be the value and then we want
the word days but I want it inside of
span oops
I'm it's not working there so we'll say
span like that and we'll say days all
right and then this next one here will
be the hours so we want that hours
variable our calculation and then we'll
say hours okay so this one will be mins
say minutes
and finally we have seconds all right so
that's our output now the last thing we
need to do is check to see if the time
is already past is it or is it January
first or later and we can test that by
simply saying is distance less than zero
so let's say if launch date passed which
really I mean if it's your launch date
you're most likely not even going to
have this up anymore but just in case
we'll say distance if it's less than
zero then let's stop the countdown and
we can do that by using clear interval
okay but we want to pass in the interval
which I called int VL so clear that and
then let's just style and output some
text it says launched so we'll take the
countdown which is our element our h1
countdown element I'm gonna set the
style dot color I want it to be that
bluish green color so I'm gonna set that
to the hexadecimal value of one seven a
to be eight and then we just want to put
some content so we'll say countdown dot
and our HTML equals and we're just gonna
say launched like that and that's it so
let's save okay so you can see that it's
working the functionality is working and
the second two counting down if I were
to let's say change let's change it to
January 2nd and save and you can see now
this is 298 days all right if I were to
change the time to let's say 17 and you
look at the hours
well I guess that would add to the day
as well because I mean right now it's
108 p.m. but you can see that this is
working it just looks horrible so now we
want to go back to our CSS now that we
have this done and continue on alright
so the countdown itself if we look the
countdown is just an h1 right and it has
it has if we look at what we put inside
of it some divs some spans and so on now
I guess that I guess that really doesn't
make sense does it because we don't want
divs inside of an h1 so I'm actually
going to change this to a div not in h1
okay but then what we want to do is
change this just get rid of that h1 no
I'm sorry not that you just want to say
count down and make sure we set the font
size to the same 50 pixels all right
good
I didn't realize I did that anyway so
let's continue on here now the countdown
is going to be displayed as a flexbox
okay if I do that it's gonna
automatically just align horizontally
which is what I want if I were to make
this bigger you'll see that it's not in
the middle so we want to add a couple
things here we want to justify the
content to the center we want to align
I'm not aligned content we want aligned
items to the center and we'll also do
text aligned
to the center and save and now it's
pushed to the middle okay
and I can make this bigger I guess yeah
so let's see next thing we're gonna do
is take each of the divs now the divs
are the actual Flex items countdown is
is the display flex everything in it
which our divs is gonna be the Flex item
okay so let's go down here and let's say
countdown div and we want to first of
all I'm gonna set padding to 20 pixels
and we want a border around each div so
it's gonna be border one pixel solid and
white okay so that gives us the border
I want two border radius I wanted to
have a little bit of a curve so we're
gonna say border radius 10 pixels
alright we also want some margin to
break them up because they're right on
top of each other so that moves them out
we want a little bit of opacity a little
bit of see-through this here
transparency say 0.7 and let's see we
want the background to be black and
there we go all right so next thing we
want to do is let's say I want the these
days hours minutes the words here these
are in spans remember if we look at our
meat our main j/s those are all in spans
so we can target those by saying
countdown span and we want to display
block which will knock it on to the next
line I save that and then just change
the font size make it smaller so we'll
set the font size to half which will be
25 and there we go now the first one
which is the days I think that's the
most important so I want that to have
the
blueish background so what I'll do is
I'll say countdown and actually I want
this up here yeah so we'll do countdown
and we can grab the first one by saying
div first child so that'll grab the
first div which is the day's box and
we're gonna set the background to
hexadecimal 1 7 a 2 B 8 alright so we'll
save that and there we go so now the
days has the the bluish greenish
background alright so we're pretty much
done for for this this screen size but
if I were to make this smaller you'll
see it's not responsive at all okay same
thing with the height so we want to
change that so we're gonna add our media
queries I'm gonna go down here and let's
do a media query for any screen size
that is 650 pixels or less so we want to
do max width of 650 pixels and for those
of you that aren't really familiar with
media queries it just means that
anything that we put inside of here is
only going to be an effect if the device
that you're viewing this on or the
browser is 650 pixels or less okay so if
I were to take the body and say
display:none and save it's gonna go away
because right now it's less than 650 if
I go above 650 the body shows because
that's no longer in effect so what I
want to do in here is take the landing
image first of all so this actually
should be class landing and we want the
IMG and I'm just gonna set the width to
be 70% okay that's gonna make it a
little smaller and it's gonna make it
fit better okay so you can see once I
hit 650 the the logo is basically
relative and it has a percentage of 70%
all right next thing I want to do is the
coming soon text I want to make that a
little smaller so I'm gonna say down
here landing H actually we can do just
landing h1 now that I think about it
because before we had two H ones and
that's really the only reason that I had
these classes so we can get rid of that
make that a little bit cleaner and then
we can go back and we can just do
landing h1 so landing h1 let's do font
size forty pixels okay so that made that
a little smaller let's also do the
countdown let's see countdown I'm gonna
set the font size to 30 pixels all right
now you could make this even smaller and
you could keep you know keep that the
hours and minutes and seconds if you
wanted to but I don't want I don't
really want to make it too small so
that's why I'm gonna do the getting rid
of the hours minutes and seconds and
just doing the days and I'm gonna just
change the Flex orientation to be in a
column fashion so what I'll do is
actually in this countdown I'll say flex
direction it's already displayed as flex
from above but we want to change this to
column and save and it just changes the
orientation to be vertical okay let's
see so I want to get rid of these
because again if you're on a mobile
device it's probably going to be shorter
and there's no scrolling so I want every
bit everything to definitely be visible
but you can I mean you can do some
testing if you want that's just what I'm
what I'm choosing to do so I'm going to
take all of the divs from countdown
which are the Flex items
and we're going to display:none
and if I save it's gonna get rid of all
of them okay now we want to grab the
first one which is the days so we're
gonna say countdown div and we're going
to use the pseudo first child selector
and we want to then set that to display
as a block instead of display:none and
if I save then that will show alright
and I'm also gonna see it set the width
to 80% save that and let's also make the
padding a little a little less it's 20
right now I'm gonna set it to 10 okay
and there we go so now it is responsive
width wise so now what I want to do is
take care of the height because right
now if we get to a certain height let's
just bring this up it just doesn't look
right so let's add some media queries
for height and this is gonna be pretty
easy so say media and let's do height or
I'm sorry max height so max height of
600 then I want the image which is the
logo to have a width of 20 percent so
I'll save that and you'll see that the
image automatically gets smaller and
then I don't want to display the
paragraph so I'm gonna just say
display:none all right now if it gets
even smaller like like right here then I
want to get rid of the h1 so I'm just
gonna add one more media query
and just change the max height to 400
instead of six and then simply put in
the h1 here and display that to none and
save and there we go we probably want to
add
yeah let's add a little bit of padding
to the image to the bottom because
they're like right on top of each other
now
so we'll say padding bottom 30 pixels
and there we go that's good alright good
so now it's responsive in every way and
that's it alright so we now have a
landing page that has a count down feel
free to experiment with it a little bit
if you want to change some things up if
you want to of course change the logo
and the background and all that but it
gives you kind of a boilerplate for
future projects you know when you're
working on and for your clients you can
throw up a page with their logo and you
now you can really understand everything
rather than going and finding a template
there's plenty of under construction
templates you can buy but now you've
actually coded this yourself and you
understand everything and you can easily
edit it and stuff alright one more thing
I almost forgot is the favicon so in d.c
in the image folder you have this
favicon PNG if you want to use that up
here then one of the tools that I use is
I'm just going to search for favicon
generator and there's a few of them the
one that I've used for I've used this
for years I mean like seven or eight
years now is this tools dot dynamic
dr.com slash favicon and you can simply
