to do is install Joomla three-point oh I
have a joomla 2.5 installation on my
youtube account which you can check out
but this is going to be installing
joomla 3.0 which it is basically the
same thing but the interface is a little
different so I figured I'd just make a
video for a three point 0 as well so the
first thing we want to do is go to
joomla org and I'm going to be
installing this on exams over so it's a
local environment it won't be on an
actual web server that's available to
the internet so on joomla org and you
want to click on joomla 3 and download
joomla 3 and as of now joomla 3.1 is the
recommended installation if you're going
to set up a joomla website but on my
opinion 2.5 is just as good sometimes
better depending on which third-party
components and modules you're going to
be using but we're going to do 3.1 so
we'll download that zip package
and like I said this is going to be on
on to my local machine so I'm going to
go to my htdocs folder and i have a
video on installing zamp on a windows pc
if you want to check that out and get it
up and running before you do this but
like I said you could do this through an
ftp account for a web hosting a web
hosting account are or however you want
to do it so i'm going to create a new
folder and I'm going to call it joomla
30 and I'm going to get that zip file
that i just downloaded and i'm going to
take all the contents in that file and
bring it over to the joomla 330 file
in while waiting for that I'll set up
our database if you use examp you want
to go to localhost / PHP myadmin if
that's what you use that's the tool I
use to interact with databases
so I'm just going to create a new
database and call it joomla 30 all right
so we have an empty database ready to
install joomla
okay so it looks like everything is
transferred so now we're going to go to
localhost / june 1030 and you can see if
you have our install joomla 1.5 a 2.5 or
1.7 this is a quite a different
interface than those versions but as far
as the information that you have to
enter it's pretty much the same thing
you want to give you a site a need I'm
just going to say jun 13 dev site this
is a dev site you want to put an admin
email
username I'm just going to make I'm just
going to keep it at admin password
and asked us if we want to have our site
offline I'm going to keep that to know
and here's where you want to enter all
the database information host name
should be localhost my username will be
root and the database we named was
joomla 30 and the prefix I'm just I
actually like to change it to Jos it
really doesn't matter though old
database process I'm going to leave that
on backup that really doesn't matter all
right so now we want to choose if we
want the sample data and there's
actually some different choices you have
here as far as sample data I'm going to
choose the default English sample data I
actually haven't chose any of the other
ones so much sure exactly what that
entails but I'm just going to leave it
at default email configurations I'll
leave that no and then it just gives you
some checks some different configuration
options I'm going to keep all that and
just click install
alright so now it's installed and we can
you want to you always want to remove
the installation folder because it's a
big security vulnerability so we want to
click that and we're done so the 3.0
installer is actually i think a lot
smoother and just just a lot easier to
work we're not easy to work with but
just just a lot smoother and elegant so
now we can choose if you want to go to
our site or the admin area i will first
go to the front end site c make sure
everything went ok looks good we have a
standard default template that comes
with joomla 3 and we can visit our admin
panel
and joomla 3 has a kind of a different
layout for the login and it was admin
alright so this is the back end I looks
quite different from 2.5 I can't really
say if I like it better or worse I guess
I guess I like it a little better but
I'm not a big deal most of the the
functionality that you have here you
also have in 2.5 there is some better
there's better responsiveness with 3.0
as far as templates you can see the back
end is totally responsive but I'm this
was just an installation video I'm not
going to go into the specifics of the of
the admin panel so I hope you like this
video and subscribe to us if you can
