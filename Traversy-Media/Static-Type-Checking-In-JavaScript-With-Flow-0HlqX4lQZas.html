video we're gonna take a look at flow or
flow j/s which is a javascript static
type checker okay so this is gonna be
kind of a quick video it's Friday it's
the end of the day and this is just
something that I wanted to show you guys
now javascript is a dynamically typed
language meaning that we don't have to
define our our variable types you don't
have to say a string goes in this
variable or a number goes in this
variable and we can also change it up we
can take the same variable and change
the type now that's not allowed in a lot
of other languages that are statically
typed now typescript which you've
probably heard of is a superset of
JavaScript so it's basically a new
language it's JavaScript plus a bunch of
other features like classes and a bunch
of other cool stuff it's actually a
really nice technology but you may not
want all of that you may just want the
type checking and flow is a good
solution for that and it's really easy
to set up it's it's just you install it
with NPM and you can compile it with
babel which is a javascript compiler
you've probably used it if you've ever
used es6 or compiled es6 code so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna jump in
and install it where i'm gonna show you
how to set it up how to set it up with
babble so that we can compile it how to
check for for type errors now the errors
will be checked in in compile time not
in run time so it'll still compile a if
there are errors but the errors are
there to tell you that looks something's
wrong and you put you know a number
where a string should be or whatever so
that's what we're gonna be doing in this
video guys hopefully you enjoy it and
let's get started
coding dojo is a programming school that
turns beginners into developers in only
14 weeks over 90% of their grads land
jobs within three months of graduating
often making over seventy K per year to
learn more visit coding dojo com or
click the link in the description below
alright guys so we're gonna go ahead and
jump into flow and type-checking in
JavaScript so what I have here is an
empty folder called flow app in vs code
I also have it opening get
and we're gonna go to flow org and go to
install flow now the documentation gives
you the option to use the yarn package
manager or NPM I'm going to choose NPM
you can also use the babel compiler or
flo remove types which I haven't used so
I'm going to use babel because i'm more
familiar with that from using es6 and so
on alright so first thing we want to do
before we get into any of this is create
a package dot JSON file with NPM in it
alright so we're going to go through
this description we'll say sample flow
app and just enter through the rest all
right you can see we now have a package
dot JSON file now we want to say npm
install we want to install these as dev
dependencies so we want to do - - save -
dev and we want the babble - CLI we also
want the preset for flow which is called
babble - preset - flow so we want to
install those two things as dev
dependencies alright we also want to
create a file called dot babble RC so
we're gonna do that let's say touch dot
babble RC and let's edit that file and
we just want to put this in here so
basically just saying that we want to
use the flow preset we'll save that and
that's all that we need in that file
alright now we need some scripts so we
need a build script for babel to
actually compile the code because you
know obviously javascript doesn't use
types so we have to take our flow code
and compile it down to regular
JavaScript much like you would with
typescript or es6 or anything that needs
to be compiled down so let's go to our
package dot jason go into scripts I'm
just going to get rid of this test and
we want a build script and this is going
to use babel
and we're gonna have a folder called
source that's where we're gonna put all
of our flow codes so anything with with
types and then we want this D option and
then the folder that we want to compile
to which I'm going to call dist
so we want to do dis slash they put lib
on here but I'd rather call it dist and
then they also have this pre publish
option here and that is going to be set
to NPM run build alright so we'll save
that now down here they just install
flow bin which is the main program they
install it locally I want to install it
globally actually because I had some
issues when I tried running it locally
so let's go to our git bash and first
I'll install it locally so I'll say npm
install flow bin alright and then i'm
also gonna say npm install - g flow -
bin ok so now we need to initialize it
so what they did here is they installed
it locally and then added it as a script
since i installed it globally i should
be able to just say flow and knit to
initialize alright and notice that it
created a flow dot a dot flow config
file over here so now i should be able
to just run flow
now it there's no it says there's no
errors because there's actually no file
yet to check okay when we create our
file we can just do flow status to check
for errors so let's create our file now
remember that we're looking we're going
to be developing in the source folder so
let's create that source and we're gonna
create a file called index dot JSON
on this page let's go to usage and we
need to define this at the top of our
file so double we'll forward slash and
then we want to do at flow like that
okay which just basically prepares your
code for flow and then we should start
we should be able to use types so what
I'm going to do here is say variables
and we're gonna define a variable I'm
gonna say let name and now we can use
types so we can say string equals John
Doe so if you if you've used typescript
or angular 2 plus then this should look
very familiar so let's save it and let's
go to our command line here and let's
say flow status no errors now let's
create an error by saying name equals 50
because what we've done is we've taken
this name that's supposed to be a string
and we've made it a number so now we'll
do flow status if I save it say flow
status and we get one error it's telling
us that number this type is incompatible
with string so it works just like
typescript okay now if we want to
compile this let's take that away if we
want to compile this into regular
JavaScript to use in our application
which we have to do because the browser
doesn't read this the browser doesn't
know what this is we
to compile it to regular es5 JavaScript
so to do that we can run npm run build
okay and what it did is it created a
dist folder because that's what we
specified right here and if we look in
our distal door index file
it's just name equals John Doe so it
compiled this to this alright so you see
how that works pretty simple so I mean
it's an easy solution to add typing to
your JavaScript alright so let's try
adding some other stuff here look at
some other types
so we'll say age and whoops this is the
wrong file this is the compiled that's
the dist we don't want to be in there so
we'll say let age we'll make this a
number 40 some other types we have we
have any so we'll say something any and
this can be anything it can be an array
alright if we want to define an array of
a certain type like let's say an array
of strings will say users and we'll set
this to string and then a set of
brackets which signifies that this
should be an array and we'll put John
Sarah all right so if I save this and we
go and we say Flow status no errors if I
put a number in here and we say flow
status we're gonna get an error because
this is supposed to be an array of
strings all right same if we were to do
let's say number array so if we do all
numbers let's just get rid of this one
so if we do all numbers and check no
errors but if we put in let's say a
boolean
and we do a check we get an error
all right so it works just like
typescript it's just much lighter it's
not a whole separate language now I can
also do boolean so let's say let's I
don't know we'll say has kids set that
to a boolean and then we could say has
kids equals true and we run flow status
no errors if we set it to a number flow
status we get an error all right now
it's important to mention that these
errors are there just at compile time
they're not at run time so if we compile
this with npm run build even though it
has errors it's still going to compile
and if we look at our file here you'll
see it's just regular javascript okay
and we we did it did in fact allow us to
change that has kids value that had a
boolean type to a number it's not going
to stop us from doing that I don't know
if there's a way to change that but it
still will compile even with the errors
the errors are basically for you they're
not for you know they're not to run at
run time all right so we can also do
interfaces just like we can with
typescript so for instance if we say let
person and we'll set it to person and
let's go ahead and create an interface
down here so interface person name
string age number and we'll say has kids
boolean
all right so let's now create a person
so we'll say person equals an object
named John age 30 has kids true alright
so let's go ahead and run that will run
flow status ok no errors everything's
good let's change age to a string and
save and run and now we have an error
because age is a string all right now if
I take out house kids let's say we don't
want to include that and save and then
let me clear this you can see that we
have an error because the interface
includes has kids now we can make this
we can make the some of these require I
want so if we put a question mark here
like that and save and run flow status
we get no errors we're basically saying
that this person can it's optional to do
as kids or not so that doesn't throw an
error but if we want we can put it in
okay we'll check status and no errors so
just like type script let's see so let's
look at some functions so we'll go down
here actually I just want to put a
comment here and you guys can use this
for reference if you're gonna work with
flow so let's do function greeting all
right and then we're just gonna do a
return
hello and let's pass in a name here and
then we'll say hello and we'll just
concatenate the name so we can use types
here for the attributes so excuse me
let's say the name should be a string
and we can also do it for the return
value so we'll say right here string
okay and then we'll go down here and use
it so we'll say greeting pass in Brad
actually let's put that in the console
log and save and let's run flow status
okay we have no errors now if I were to
put in two greeting one as a number and
do flow status we're gonna get an error
saying that that should be a string all
right so we can use it for function
parameters and for function return
values all right so even if we put a
string in here but we return a one right
here that will also throw an error now
let's say we had a function call it sum
function and we wanted the parameter
that's passed in we'll call value two we
want it to be a number or a string or a
boolean what we could do is set it to
string and then put a pipe character and
then number and then a pipe actually
let's do string or number all right and
then we'll just return hello
all right so we'll save that and then
we'll say some function and we'll pass
in one so flow status we get no errors
we pass in a string say Brad no errors
we pass in true which is a boolean and
we get an error because that's not
included in this in this in these types
here all right so let's see we also have
utility types we can create our own so
I'm not going over everything there's a
lot more I'm just going over the basics
I'm very new to this so what I'm gonna
do is create a type called suit suit
like that and we're gonna set this to
diamonds put a pipe character here clubs
and spades all right so we got three
suits here and then let's say Const
clubs set this to suit equals clubs
and then we'll say Const hearts equals
I'm sorry hearts suit equals hearts all
right now let's comment the hearts part
out and save and run flow status oh
we're still getting this error cuz this
is true let me just fix that
so flow status we get no errors if I
uncomment this and we're using hearts as
a suit and we run flow status we're
gonna get an error because hearts is not
included in this suit utility type all
right so if you want to go to the flow
documentation and take a look at the
docs okay let me make this bigger and
you go to there's a lot of stuff here
but go to type annotations this will
give you a lot more examples alright so
we went over like primitives and
literals and interfaces there's also
class types so you can look at the class
types burial types we already looked at
that utility types this is where I got
that suits example and then there's even
like generics they can get some it can
get pretty complicated but yeah it's
just it's just a way to use static
typing in JavaScript because a lot of
programmers like that it gives you it
gives you that extra layer of you know
debugging and makes you less prone to
errors and so on and it's easy to
compile you know we can compile all this
real quick so just npm run build oops
can't type today or any day and if we
look at our compiled code you'll see
that it's just regular javascript
alright so hopefully you guys like this
and maybe you'll experiment with it it's
Friday and I don't have a lot of time
today I have a lot of things to do so I
wanted to do something quick but
something useful and
hopefully you enjoyed this so thanks for
