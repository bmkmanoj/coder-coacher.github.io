install xampp which is a local Apache
server I'll like and it comes along with
PHP MySQL and a bunch of other good
stuff it basically allows you to run a
server on your local machine alright so
we want to go to Apache friends org and
click on we want to download for Windows
because I'm using Windows and it should
pop up if not then click here download
let's save that now this is a quite a
big file 226 megabytes so it could take
it could take a few minutes to download
so I'm going to pause this and then come
back when it's finished
alright so it's now downloaded let's go
ahead and open the exe file and run it
all right so we're just going to go
through this just a basic Windows
installation I'm going to keep all the
the default components that come with it
and I'm going to keep the default
location as well which is in your c
drive xampp folder and just ignore this
pop-up okay click Next and now it's
going to take a couple minutes to go
through the installation so I'm going to
pause it and come back when it's done
alright so finish downloading and we're
going to start the control panel click
finish
right now you want to install Apache in
MySQL as a service that way you don't
have to manually start it up whenever
you want to use it it will start
automatically and it will run in the
background so what you want to do is
click on these red X's and that will
install them as a service okay click
this one and if you get a pop-up like
this just click allow access okay so now
we have them installed as a service so
we should actually be able to see them
if we go to services and windows
and so you can see right here we have
Apache 2.4 and it's automatic so it's
going to start automatically and we also
have MySQL right here which is also
starts automatically all right so let's
see let's click on start for both of
these all right so now we have that
running and your your folder that you
want to put all your your HTML or PHP
files in is in the C Drive xampp htdocs
all right so this is it this is
equivalent to your public HTML or your
WWE on any other kind of server okay
there's just some sample content there
and it's set up so that if we go to
localhost if we just go to localhost
it's going to redirect us to the xampp
control panel and there's something I
want that we need to do in here so I'm
gonna click on my language English and
as it is now your MySQL account doesn't
have a password and even though this is
a local server so there's not too much
risk you still want to get in the habit
of having a password for your on for
your my sequel user and if we go to
security right here
um you can see that the root user has no
passwords so we want to click on this
link here and type in a password all
right and you can add some authors you
can add stuff to your htaccess file too
but we're not going to do that so we're
going to click on password changing and
it says the the root password was
successfully changed all right so xcf
also comes with PHP myadmin which is a
basically a it's a GUI it's a it's a
management tool for your databases and
you can get to that by going to
localhost / PHP myadmin
and I don't know why just did that HTTP
alright so in the password the usernames
root the password is going to be
whatever you just made it in on the side
here we have some sample databases
here's a CD collection database which
just has one table called CDs and you
can browse the table alright and you can
see the structure of the database you
can add fields but that's another
tutorial in itself so let's uh let's
test out that htdocs directory and see
if we can create a file and access it
from within the browser so you probably
want to create folders for each
application or website that you build so
let's create a folder called just call
it sample and then we'll create a new
file and we'll call this index.html and
if we just open that we'll say this is
in next page alright we'll save that now
we should be able to go to localhost /
sample and there's our index page
obviously I assume that you know at
least a little bit of HTML and you know
that when you name it index dot HTML you
don't need to actually put the file name
here alright if we named it sample dot
HTML then we would have to put the file
name
so that's pretty much it you now have a
complete Apache server with PHP and
MySQL running on your local machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
