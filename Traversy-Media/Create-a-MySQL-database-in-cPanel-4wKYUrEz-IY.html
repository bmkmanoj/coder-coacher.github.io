guy web solutions and this is a really
quick tutorial on just how to set up a
MySQL database and see piano it's very
easy it's a lot easier than people think
so just log into your cPanel and go down
to where it says databases and click on
MySQL databases you'll get a screen that
looks like this and all you do to create
a database is right here create new
database and name it whatever you want
let's just say test data and you'll get
a trailing your username will precede
the actual database name I mean the
username for this cPanel account is tech
guy 3 so the database will be called
tech guy 3 underscore test data so let's
create that so now the database is
created now what we got to do is link a
create a user and link that use it to
the database I have a few users here
that I could link but I'm going to
create a new one just to show you so
let's name we'll name the user and I'll
test use give it a password now you
really want a very secure password with
with using databases you can generate
one by clicking password generator it
gives you this this really secure
password for this tutorial we'll just
use that create user added test use with
the password with the password so now we
have a user now we get a link to user to
the database we just created we do that
by going down here see it's all in steps
it creates the database at the top then
add new user now we add the user to the
database so we pick we find the one we
just created which was test use
and the database we created was test
data so and then click Add now in most
cases you're going to click all
privileges so they can they can do
everything from within the database they
can add drop select to just do
everything click make changes and there
you go that the user test used was added
to the database test data so now you
have a brand-new fresh database it's
where the new user and and you can do
many different things with into the
database there's all types of content
management programs and you can just
create really really great dynamic
websites so if you have any questions
you can email support at tech guy web
