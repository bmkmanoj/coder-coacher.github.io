went ahead and set up our database with
doctrine when we're able to list our
articles were able to go to the show
page now what I want to do is create a
form to add an article so we're actually
gonna go down to the terminal here and
we're gonna use composer to install or
require form alright so that should
install and then in our controller we
won't basically want to take some
components from this form extension so
let's go up here and let's say use
symphony component
slash form slash extension extension
slash core slash type slash
ok so basically just like a text type or
an input field and then what I'm gonna
do is just copy this two more times and
the second one is going to be a text
area type and then this third one is
going to be a submit type okay so we
need those in order to use these fields
so let's go back down here and let's
create a new row so basically we want we
want a row that's going to be it's going
to be a get route and a post row it's
going to display the form it's also
going to handle the processing of the
form so let's say route and it's gonna
be article or slash article
/ knew and I'm also gonna give it a name
of new underscore article okay we also
want to add a method so method is gonna
be get as well as post and the function
I keep forgetting public so public
function new and this is gonna take in a
request with a variable of request and
request is something that I don't think
I brought in so we have to actually
bring that into so I'm going to go right
here and say use symphony slash bundle
not bundle component this is all in the
documentation if you get confused I know
that bringing this stuff in can be a
little confusing so its component HTTP
foundation same as the response slash
request yeah and I guess I guess we
could bring that whoops didn't mean to
do that
I guess we could bring that up below the
response yeah we'll put it right there
alright so now let's go back down to our
new function or a new method and we want
to create our form okay first of all we
have to create a variable called article
and set it to new article and then we're
going to create our form variable and
set that to this and we want create form
builder and then pass an article so we
want to create a form for our article
and we're gonna put in here add she'll
put this on a new line alright yeah you
should be able to do that so add title
and this is going to take in a second
parameter of the type which is going to
be text type remember we brought that in
above we're gonna say text type class
and then pass in an array of options now
bootstrap need that the inputs they need
a class of form control so I want to
pass in attribute our attr and then set
that to an array and you can put an
array of attributes and basically all I
want is a class of form control okay and
then we want to again add the body
and that's going to be text area type
class pass an array and now this is
where we can actually everything is
going to be required by default and if
you for instance don't want the the body
to be required you could set required to
false and then we also want the
attribute actually I'll just copy this
attribute just grab that and we can go
like that and that should be all we need
for the body now let's do the Save
button so we're going to do yeah add
save and save this is gonna be the
submit type that we brought in so submit
type class and let's pass in array and
we're gonna add a label of let's say
create and then we will also want
attributes
so attributes is an array and I just
want to add a class or a couple classes
we want BTN BTN primary let's do margin
top three just to move it down a little
alright and then the last thing we need
to add on here is just get form like
that so that creates our form now we
should be able to render it if we go
right under it and let's say return this
render and we're gonna have a view
inside articles called new dot HTML dot
twig and then we pass along array and
inside here we want to pass in form and
we want to set that to that form
variable we created and then a method
called create view so it's gonna
actually create the view for us so let's
save that now if I were to go to if I
were to click on this link because we
already have it set to article new let's
see what happens
okay so impossible to access an
attribute title on a null variable
wait a second new dot html' I don't know
why it's trying to load show actually I
do know why it's trying to load show
because it's it's looking at our new
right here as an ID okay so if when you
use this parameter here this should go
the order actually matters so we're
gonna move this down below this one this
route and this function so that should
be at the bottom so we'll save that and
reload and it's just gonna tell us that
I can't find the view because we haven't
created it so let's go to templates
articles create a new file called new
dot HTML dot twig and now if I reload it
just gives us a blank page now all we
have to do since we basically generated
the form view from within our controller
we just have to first of all extend our
base so I'll just copy what we have in
show and put that into new and let's
change the title we'll say new article
well one thing in the show instead for
the title we can actually put the
article title like this and go like that
for the title and then in new I just
want a new article for the title and
then everything in the body we can get
rid of and we can use we can say form
underscore start and then just pass in
that form variable and then let's copy
this down twice so we have form start
and then we have form widget
so I believe form start is like the
opening form tag with the attributes it
needs and then form widget is the actual
form and then form end is like the end
tag and that should create it for us so
let's save it and reload and there we go
there's our form so again to reiterate
we're creating the form here with all
the attributes the classes everything
like that and then we're passing form
create view in AZ form and then we can
use these these placeholders here to
create everything okay now when you use
the create form it's gonna if we look at
let's actually take a look at the source
code it's just a post request to the
same URL to the same route okay the same
route that it that the get request comes
from which is this route here so that's
why we're gonna also make the post
request to the same route because that's
what this form does and you'll see this
is required the title the body is not
though you see how that just submits to
the same route which we're not doing
anything yet but the body is not
required because we put required false
right here now up to this point we're
just loading the form we haven't taken
care of actually submitting it and we
want to we want to use this same route
we want to use the same exact function
so what we can do is we can test to see
if it's actually been submitted but the
first thing we need to do is just say
form handle request
and then pass in that request variable
okay and then once we do that we can
just check to see if it's been submitted
and we can say if form is submitted
and form is valid then this is basically
whatever we want to do when we submit it
and what do we want to do we want to add
the data to the database right so we're
gonna say article equals the form data
or form get data and then we're going to
create our entity manager by saying this
get doctrine and then get manager it's
kind of a strange syntax but once you
get used to it it's it's not bad and
then we just want to persist the data
just like we did above or just like we
did in that save method that I created
so persist we want to persist the
article and then we want to flush
because right now it's it's just getting
ready to save it didn't actually execute
so let's say entity manager flush
and then let's just redirect so we'll
say return this and we can do redirect
to route and we can pass in a route name
now I want it to go to the home page
which has a name I believe it's article
underscore list let me just check that
so the index yeah article list so that
should just redirect us back and it
should create the new record so let's
save that and let's just reload and
let's say article 3 this is article
number 3 and let's create and there we
go it gets added and it redirects us
back to the home page alright so we can
now create and read our articles now all
we have left to do is update and delete
so let's do our delete next now I want
to use a delete request so we're going
to use a little bit of Ajax or we're
actually going to use the fetch API the
JavaScript fetch API but let's first of
all create a button to delete so we'll
go to our view which is our index and
let's create let's see we'll go right
under I'll just copy the show it close
this up so we'll copy the show and this
will be delete
and the href is just gonna be nothing
just gonna be a hash the class I'm going
to change to danger because I want it to
be red and I'm also gonna give this a
class of delete - article and I'm gonna
give it a data - ID attribute and I'm
going to pass in the ID of the article
that way we can access it in the
JavaScript all right so let's save that
and reload and then what we'll do is
create inside of our public folder a new
folder called j/s and let's create a new
file called mange a s and we want to
include this let's just do an alert say
alert one and then to include this I
don't want to include it on every single
page so I'm not going to put it in the
base I'm gonna put it just in the index
because that's where we need it because
that's where the delete button is so
remember in the base we have the
JavaScript block right here block
JavaScript so what we can do is in index
we'll go down to the bottom here and
let's define a block JavaScript
and in here we're just going to include
a script of J s main dot J s and let's
save and reload and we get our alert so
we know that that javascript file is
loading alright so back to the
JavaScript file what I'm gonna do is
create a variable called articles and
set it to document dot get element by ID
and I don't think I have an articles ID
so we're gonna have to add it I'm gonna
add it to the table so right here I D
equals table and we're using some event
delegation here since there's more than
one delete button we need to use event
delegation meaning we have to target a
parent object or a parent element like
the table and then cert and then do an
if statement to search for the delete
button we want so in here let's first of
all check to see if there is an articles
so if articles then we're gonna create
an event listener so we're gonna listen
for a click event and then we'll have a
function I'm just going to use an arrow
function and we're gonna pass in an
event parameter here and we basically
want it chiming right now if I were to
like if I were to say alert oops I'll
say alert to and save if I click
anywhere in the table well wait a minute
if articles
get element by T what I do did I save
this oh I gave it an idea of table what
you guys say anything should be articles
so if I click anywhere in the table it
runs and I don't want that I want to
target the delete button right so what
we have to do is an if statement and
we're gonna say if e dot target meaning
the button we click class name so if it
has a class whoops if it has a class
that is equal to BTN it has to be exact
so we want to include these as well and
then delete article all right so we're
targeting if we look at the index we're
targeting
this this link or this button right here
because it has that class that's what
we're looking for then we want to do
whatever it is we want to do so I'll
test it with the alert of alert too and
now if I click anywhere in the table it
doesn't doesn't do anything but if I
click any of these delete buttons you'll
see it will go ahead and run all right
now what we want to do is just do a
simple confirm because it is a delete so
we want the user to be sure so we'll say
if confirm and we'll just say are you
sure
so if they confirm then let's get the ID
so we're going to create a variable
called ID and what we want to target now
is this the data ID because that's an
actual attribute on the link so to get
that we can take a dot target dot get
attribute and we want to talk we want to
grab the attribute of data - ID all
right so now if I I'll just alert I was
gonna console.log but whatever
so now we'll alert the ID so now this
should be one this has the idea of -
this has the ID of three so now we're
getting that ID now we want to make our
fetch request to the backend okay so
let's say fetch and here we're gonna
have I'm actually gonna use back ticks
so that we can use a template string and
we're gonna say article / delete slash
and then the ID okay so that's gonna be
the row we haven't created that yet on
the back end now we need to add a second
parameter of an object because we need
to specify that this is going to be a
delete request all right so it's a
delete request and fetch will give us a
promise back so we use dot then and
it'll give us a result but all I want to
do is redirect so I'm gonna say window
dot are not redirect reload so window
dot location dot reload and that's it
all right so now we need to create this
route to do the delete so let's go back
to our controller and create that route
so let's put in route and the route is
gonna be article / delete / and then
whatever the ID and we want to specify
that the method has to be a delete
request okay and then we'll create our
function which will be called delete and
this will take in the requests whoops
with the variable request and also the
ID alright now we just want to use
doctrine to first find it by the ID and
then delete it
okay I'll remove it so let's actually
just copy from the show so this right
here we can actually just grab this and
put that in there and then we can grab
the entity manager just like we did here
so we'll grab these three lines except
instead of persisting we're going to
remove so we want to just change that to
remove all right now we have to send
back a response because fetch it expects
a 200 response it says everything's okay
so we're gonna say response equals new
response
and then we're gonna simply do a
response send like that okay and
hopefully that works so what should
happen is our JavaScript is making a
fetch call to that row and it's gonna
get a response when it does it's gonna
call the promise the dot then and it's
going to reload the page and the
should be deleted so let's reload this
and let's delete article three so we'll
click that are you sure okay and there
it goes now it's deleted alright so the
last thing to do is update so let's go
back to our controller now this is going
to be very very similar to the new
function or the new route that we have
so I'm gonna copy that entire thing let
me just get rid of this I'm gonna copy
this this whole public function new with
the with the annotation and then go down
here actually make sure that you're
above this this should probably be at
the bottom whatever we'll put it right
under the new and then change the route
to edit and we'll change the name to
edit article and let's see we want get
in post so we want to change the
function name to edit and it's also
going to take in the ID because we're
not just creating a new one we're
editing an article so let's say we're
gonna say article equals new article we
want to get the article with this ID so
we'll copy this right here
and we'll paste that in here so it's
gonna find the article by the ID that's
passed in actually this edit should also
have slash ID because we need to know
which are which article we're dealing
with we're editing so once we get that
that article will be found and then
passed into our form builder and it
should automatically fill and then down
here once it's submitted it's very
little we have to edit here once it's
submitted we actually don't need this
because it already knows what we're
talking about we can get rid of this we
can get rid of the persist so all we
have is the entity manager and then we
call flush and then we redirect now for
the their form I'm gonna render out a
template called edit dot html' dot twig
and we're still gonna pass in the form
like that so let's save and let's create
a new template called edit dot HTML dot
twig and let's copy the new and you
could actually you could use the new
template if you wanted to but I like to
have them separate also I want a
different title I mean I know that's not
a big deal you could just use the new if
you wanted to but whatever it's fine so
now let's create the edit button so
that's going to be in the index file so
I'm just gonna copy the show and
actually we'll put the edit after show
change this to article slash edit slash
and then the ID will change the class to
button light and change this to edit
so let's save that reload it should work
okay so now we have an edit and let's
click on article to edit and you can see
that it's already prefilled now if I
change let's change this to the number
two actually one thing I want to do is
change the create text so back in the
controller inside the edit right here
where it says create I'm gonna change it
to update and I'll reload now it's
update and we'll change it to number to
update and there we go so now it's
changed to article and then the number
two so we now have a complete crud
application all right so I know that
that was kind of a lot and you know it's
not a it's nothing special the
application but hopefully you learned
enough to try and create your own
projects with doctrine and using a
database using twig templates using the
console using the form help or all these
different things that we've looked at
alright the routes the annotations and
hopefully it gives you a nice start on
on learning Symphony for obviously
there's a lot more there's
authentication there's stuff like that
and there's a lot of other packages and
you can make it into a big application
there's also creating micro services
maybe we can create a REST API at some
point but that's going to be it for this
series guys I hope you enjoyed it maybe
we'll go ahead and deploy this
application but that's gonna be it for
