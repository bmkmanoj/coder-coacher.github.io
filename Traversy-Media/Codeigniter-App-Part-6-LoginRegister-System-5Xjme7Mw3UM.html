take a look at models and models are
used to they used to interact with data
whether that be database or maybe a
restful api or something like that even
hard-coded values it's it's just used to
hold the data or just grab the data from
something all right so what we want to
do here is we have our registration form
and we want to submit it and enter our
fields into the database and we need to
do that through a model alright so we
have our form and it's going to submit
to the users controller and we're going
to do some validation on it and if the
validation passes then we want to insert
the data now of course we need to create
a user's model but to do this we can
call this user model and models it's not
obviously it's not mandatory but I
recommend using singular for models and
plural for controllers so we have a
user's controller but we'll have a user
model alright so user model and then a
function or a method that we want to run
which will be create member
all right so that's gonna call the
create member method in the user model
all right now instead of just calling it
I want to wrap it in an if statement so
that we can redirect we can get a
message saying you are now registered
and redirect all right so let's put this
in if statement alright so we're going
to redirect back to home a home index
but I don't want it to just redirect we
want to we want to create a message to
let the person know that they're
actually registered and the most common
way to do that with codeigniter is to
use flash data and that's that's given
to us by the session library all right
so we can say this session
set flash data all right and in here
we're gonna have two arguments we're
gonna have basically a key so say
registered and it's just basically a key
to identify this message and we're just
gonna say you are now registered and can
login all right so it's gonna set this
this flash date of this message and
redirect to the index page the home
index page so I'll save this and that's
the first part of this is setting the
data now we need to get it and we need
to get it in the index view because this
is going to go to home index excuse me
the home view so we'll go to our home
view and right above this here
we want to call that message but we only
want to call it if it's set all right so
we have to do first do an if statement
let's say if I'm gonna say if this
session last data
and in here we want to put whatever that
key was in our case was registered all
right and I'm just doing the shorthand
so that we can just use tags on every
line here all right so what do we want
to do if that's if that's found if the
registered flash data is found then we
want to echo let's see we want to echo
this session flash data so this session
last data
registered
and what I want to do is wrap this in
the bootstrap classes for the alerts
which we have somewhere in here where do
we have it right here and copy that
you just paste this and you know like
this
all right so
if we're registered actually you know
what this shouldn't say danger because
this is a helpful message a success
message so I think that that works
I think that'll make it green alright so
save that and get back to this deal with
the model alright so what we need to do
is create a user model so in the models
folder we want to create a new file and
save it as user model dot PHP alright so
this is similar to setting up a
controller I'm gonna say a class user
model extends not CI controller but CI
model
all right so we need a public function
called create member all right so what
we need to do is we need to grab all the
fields that we submit and if you have
any experience with PHP you probably
know that this goes through post data
all right and we can grab the post data
if you're dealing with just PHP without
CodeIgniter we could get it in this this
post superglobal so we could have like
post first-name in coding NIDA we
actually can use the input helper which
we have Auto loaded and we can use this
input post and then and then whatever
first-name and that's what we're gonna
do all right
and we could do this we're going to
create an array of the post either we
could do this in the controller but it's
good practice to try to keep your
controller thin and then have most of
the this the data manipulation go on in
the model so it's I mean it's really
just preference but I'm just gonna put
it in the model so I'm going to create
an array
well
okay so in this array we want to we want
to set the database table name equal to
the post values all right so the first
one we have is first-name and that's
going to come from this input post
this input post first-name okay
and we'll actually just copy this
all right so we have last name can these
here these fields need to match your
database
your database fields okay which we have
right here
okay last name
email
I'm what else username
and password
now we don't want to store just a plain
password which is which is what this
will give us right here so what I want
to do is I want to encrypt it and that's
pretty easy to do I'm just going to cut
this out and still in this method I want
to create a new variable called ENC
password for encrypted password and
we're going to set that equal to md5 and
then wrap the input the post input
alright so very simple this md5 just
encrypts this from plaintext to being
encrypted so we're not we're not adding
just regular text passwords into the
database which would be really stupid so
it's easy enough to do so that's going
to be Inc password that's what's going
to be submitted into them into the
database all right let's see let's make
this look a little nicer
I take that last comma off all right so
there's our data array all right so now
what we want to do is create a variable
you can call it anything I'm gonna say
actually we'll call it query and what
we're going to do here is we're going to
use active record which is basically a
help our a database helper so that we
don't have to write long database
strings or SQL strings so I'm just going
to actually pull over the the
documentation for the active record
class and we can do all different types
of crud we can do create read update and
delete or select insert update and
delete all right so this the simplest of
this class is the is to select fields
from the database and we can do this
with this DB get alright so here we're
just creating a variable called query
we're setting it to this DB get and then
the name of the table and it's the same
as saying select all from whatever table
all right and then we would just say we
could return the the result which I'll
show you later on and we can add in
where statements
let's see
join we can join different tables so for
instance we're getting data from the
blog's table but we want also join the
comments table alright so we'll be doing
that as well with the lists and tasks
this is this DV where you can basically
just say this DV where name equals Joe
or whatever so that's kind of a lot of
information but let's just take it slow
so what we need to do now is an insert
so let's find that
alright inserting data pretty simple
we've already created our data array
with the table names and the post values
so basically this is all we need to do
right here so if we just copy that
well actually we want to say query
equals that and this will be the users
table and actually let's just change
this to insert all right and we just
want to return insert alright so if this
goes through and returns then the user
has been created right so let's save
that and this return insert is going to
allow us to have this if statement so if
insert then you know just give a success
message all right so let's save that
and let's try it out you may have a
couple errors at first
so let's actually just want to make sure
I didn't insert anything no you can see
our users table is totally empty alright
so
user name will stay admin
alright so the username needs to be at
least 6 characters okay you know what
let's change that
so username we'll say has to be four
characters in the database I mean I'm
sorry the password
all right
all right so looks like we have an error
and the reason you again this is we
didn't load the user model all right so
what we need to do is we could just say
this load user model but I want to auto
load it so I'm going to go to my config
folder and then auto load dot PHP and
where it says auto load model we just
want to throw in user model all right so
hopefully it works now
all right so you are now registered and
can log-in so let's go ahead to PHP
myadmin
and reload the users table and here's
our our information we have first name
last name email username and an
encrypted password alright so this
definitely adds security to your your
app and then we have the registration
date which is the exact date and time
that we made this submission all right
so that is a good example of an insert
query so now what I want to do is look
at a select statement because we need to
log in which means we to validate our
username and password against the
database and what I'm gonna do is paste
in the login function and I'm pasting it
in because we've already dealt with
pretty much everything that's here so
it's kind of redundant to type it all
out again all right so we're just
setting a couple rules here validation
rules if the form has not been submitted
we're not going to do anything because
this login controller doesn't have its
own view it's actually just inserted
into the template through the layout so
we don't need to show up for you we
don't need to do anything
alright so if it passes or if it's
submitted sorry then we're putting our
post variables into a regular variable
username and password and with the
registration we did this in the model
but you can I only did it this way to
show you that we can do it in the
controller as well it's really
preference and what we need to do is
we're setting a user ID to this user
model login user all right so this is
going to call the method login user and
in order to to access these in our model
we need to pass them through as
arguments all right so then we're saying
basically this is only going to happen
we're only going to get an ID if the
login is correct so here we're saying if
the logging is correct
then we're creating a data of user or a
user data array which includes the user
ID username and a boolean a logged in
true or false and we're setting that to
true because we validated it against the
database and then we're just setting a
session with setting user data in a
session so what this means is that as
long as we have a session we can check
to see if it's true and if it is then we
can display data or pages that only
someone that's logged in can see all
right we can actually just say if logged
in do this if not do this so that's I
mean session class is pretty easy and
we've already actually used the session
class in the flash data function all
right so let's see we can save that and
what we need to do now is create the
login user function in the model all
right so we'll go to user model say
public function
logging user and we also want to include
the parameters here as well all right so
the first thing we want to do is convert
the password to to an encrypted password
so we can match against the encrypted
value in the database all right so we're
just gonna say E&amp;amp;C password is equal to
md5 and then the plaintext password all
right and let's see we just want to
validate against the database so we have
to perform a where clause
all right using active record so where
Clause we're going to say this DB where
and we're going to say where username in
the database is equal to username that
we typed in
all right and we'll do the same thing
for the password except
we want to use the encrypted version
okay so those are the where clauses that
we want to check now we're gonna say
result is going to be equal to this dB
yet we want to put the name of the table
which is users all right and then we
want to say if results num rows is equal
to one there should only be one value
one match because we're not going to be
able to have duplicate usernames so
obviously it'll be one
all right so if result num rows is equal
to one then we want to return result row
zero because it only be one which is
zero because all objects and arrays
start at zero all right we want to
return the ID that's all we're doing
here is returning the user ID and we
want to say else so if there isn't if
there's not a role found we just want to
return false all right so let's go over
this we pass in a username of the
password to the function we encrypt the
password we call to where clauses was
sitting where the username the database
is equal to the username we typed in and
the password in the database is equal to
the encrypted password that we type in
all right so now here we're saying this
result variable is equal to this DB get
users all right so this is going to be
filled this num rows will be filled
it'll equal one if these match okay
and then here we're just returning the
the ID row
all right so if the users ID is one
he'll return a 1 else if there are no
rows found if none of these match then
we're just going to return false and
back in the controller
let's see where our you log in which is
right here so what we're setting user ID
equal to whatever we return here if it's
the ID it's the idea if it's false then
it's false we're saying here if it's not
false if it's set then we're going to
add the data to a session we're going to
start a session and redirect if it comes
back false then we're just going to set
a message saying login failed and
redirect so in both cases we're
redirecting to the home page so let's
save this in the model and let's just
see if this is working
okay so nothing happened
but
nothing happened but we don't have an
actual message we need to set a message
here
so when we set the session I want to set
a message and we'll say login success
we'll say you are now logged in and then
in home index which was using the home
view
let's copy that
vlog in success
all right let's see if that works
all right so we are logged in so
obviously we're logged in we want to
make it so that this box doesn't show
the input fields when we're logged in we
want it to just have a logout button
so first we need to create a logout
button so let's go to the login view so
I'm going to views users log in and we
want to check if we're logged in or not
and we can use the session the session
class to do this so we'll just say PHP
if this session
user data
if this session user data logged in yeah
so that's all actually all we need we
want an else HP else all right
so if we are logged in we want to show a
logout button if we're not then we want
to show the form which I will grab from
here cut it and put it in here all right
so let's save and now if we reload we
shouldn't see the form all right good
so what we need to do up here is just
create a logout button I'm sorry not a
logout button but a logout form so I'm
actually just gonna pay something in
here alright so what this box is gonna
show when we're logged in it's gonna say
you are logged in as and then what we're
doing is calling the username value from
the session okay so whatever the user's
name is user name is gonna show and then
we're just opening another form here
that goes to users slash logout and it's
just going to have one input which will
be a button and input button and that's
really it so save that
all right so now it just says you are
logged in as admin now we need to create
the controller function Lago
and a little off-topic but I would
definitely suggest that you add comments
to your cold each each controller I'd
suggest you have a little comment saying
what it does I'm not doing it just
because for time issues but it's
definitely recommended alright so for
logout
what we want to do is we want to unset
all the user data all right so the unset
session data and we can do this session
unset user data and then we can have the
value which will logged in so we're
going to unset that login value and
we're going to unset all the set all the
values which are the user ID and the
user name
all right and then we want to say this
session
Seth's destroyed
all right
so that should kill all the all the
session data in the session itself then
we want a message let's just copy this
here
this isn't going to be an error
so this will say we'll name this logged
out
you've been logged out will redirect and
now we just got to catch that flash data
message in the home view
and change this to logged out
all right so let's try this out if we
reload log out all right it logged us
out just didn't show the message
so with logged outs
logged out
oh you know what I think it has
something to do with killing the session
in this function so I mean we can tell
when we logs out because of the box here
but I think that it's messing with the
flash data when we kill a session so
we'll just keep it as it is and just
have I mean obviously we're logged out
now so that's really it actually one
more thing when we're logged in I don't
want this register link to show I wanted
to say hello and then our username so
that is in the layout the main layout
right here and I'm just gonna paste this
in okay so if we're logged in it's gonna
say welcome if not it'll have the
register link so let's reload and you
can see it says welcome head okay if you
log out register all right so our login
and registration system is pretty much
done what we need to do next is create
the lists list and task functionality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
