cover an important part of not only PHP
but programming in general and that's
conditionals
alright so conditionals are used to test
for something test for a value compares
compare stuff whether it's comparing if
it's equal to something a greater or
less than I'm going to go over all the
different comparison operators as well
okay so I'm going to create a new file
in PHP sandbox and I save it as
conditionals dot PHP okay let's open up
our PHP tags and we're going to actually
just comment in here now I'm going to
specify the different types of
comparison operators so we have equals
which is a double equals and then we
also have this triple equals which
matches not only the value but also the
datatype okay so this is actually
identical and then we have less than
great what greater than I also have less
than or equals two we have greater than
or equals two we have not equals two and
we have not identical okay so let's go
ahead and try some of these I'm just
going to create a variable called num
and such as equal to five okay so if we
want to test to see if this is equal to
five we can do if and then we can do num
is equal to five okay and if that's true
let's just echo so we'll just echo five
past
okay so let's save that and then let's
go to localhost / PHP sandbox slash
conditionals dot PHP oops forgot the Oh
okay so we get five past because of
course num is equal to five now for this
one here identical I'm going to show you
if I change this to a string and I just
put quotes around it and we reload it
still passes okay because this is just
being the value not the datatype now if
I put an extra equals in there and we
reload it doesn't pass because this is
an integer and this is a string okay and
this tests for it to be identical all
right we can also do so you'll just take
that off you can also do let's say
greater than so if num is greater than
five if we reload we don't get anything
because five is not greater than five if
I were to say greater than or equal to
five then that's going to work all right
we can also test if it's not equal to so
if I change this to 52 and reload it's
going to pass because num is not equal
to five
all right so this is very basic stuff so
let's let's add another equal there and
let's say else echo and it'll just say
did not pass okay so if we save that
reload we get five passed if we change
the number let's say six and reload we
get did not pass now if we wanted to
test for another value we could also do
an else if so let's go on this line and
say else if and then go like that and
let's say num is equal to six and then
we'll just echo out six passed
okay so now if we save that we get six
past if we change it to five reload we
get five past if we change it to four we
get did not pass all right so that's
very very basic itself in elseís so
let's comment this out now you can also
nest if statements so let's say a
nesting if and let's do num equals five
and then we'll just do if num is so
state yeah greater than five and then in
here we could actually keep putting it
statements as well as many as we want
and we'll say if num is let's say less
than ten so let's do greater than four
less than ten and then in here we'll
just echo it'll say num past okay so if
we save that reload we get five past we
changes to six reload we also get six
past okay because it's still greater
than four but less than ten now this is
an ideal there's a better way we could
we could do this and that's by using
logical operators okay we can put more
than one condition in one if statement
so let me show you what I mean and I'm
first just going to show you the logical
operators so we have and which can also
can also be formatted as a double
ampersand we have or which could be the
double pipe characters and we have XOR
which is exclusive or so a better way to
write this would be to do one if
statement and then do if num is greater
than four
in numb is less than 10 all right and
they will just do the echo numb past
okay so I'll comment this out
and let's save that reload and we still
get six past okay so this is a much
better way to write it than this now we
can also use the double ampersand okay
now if you wanted for instance this if
you have an else then you would want to
nest it because you have to put this
house in here and then you do let go you
know whatever all right so we also have
or which means that one of these has to
be true so let's do that we'll put in
our double pipes or the word or and save
that reload and we get six paths okay
because one of these is true even if we
were to let's say make one of these
false by saying two two because it has
to be greater than four to isn't but if
I reload it still passes because only
one of these has to be true okay and
then we also have exclusive or EXOR
which means that one of them has to be
true but not both so if we save this
that this should pass because one of
them is true but if we were to change
this back to six which makes it true for
both and we reload it doesn't work
alright so just remember that an XOR
means that one has to be true but not
both alright so let's take a look at
switches now okay let me just comment
this out
okay so switches will test for value and
then it'll test it with different cases
and depending on which case matches
it'll do something whatever you want to
do so it's a switch and what we'll do is
create a variable I'm going to call it
fav color and we'll set that equal to
red okay so let's say we want to test
for the save color value we can put any
switch and we want to test these color
okay now let's specify a case so we'll
say case let's use single quotes case
red and then we want to put a colon
right here and then whatever we want to
happen if it's red so let's say echo I
will say echo and your favorite color is
red okay and then you just want to put
in a break when you're done with
whatever that functionality is okay so
that's one case let's go ahead and copy
this and paste it in do three more times
so this will be blue and change this to
blue and let's say green
all right so this bottom on here I'm
actually going to change this from case
red to default and then let's echo out
we will say your favorite color is
something else okay we actually don't
need the break here so basically it's
testing the saved color if it's red this
will happen blue this screen this and
then if it doesn't match any of those
the default will fire ox all right so
let's go ahead and save that I'm sure
you know what's going to happen we get
your favorite color is red okay we
change it to blue and reload your
favorite colors blue change it to green
your favorite color is green and then
anything else turns into yellow will say
your favorite color is something else
okay so pretty simple
so that's going to be it for if
statements and switches in the next
video we're going to talk about dates
and formatting dates and how to create
dates from strings and so on alright so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
