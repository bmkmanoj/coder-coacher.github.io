hey what's going on guys so I have a
little Sunday project for you we're
gonna build a vanilla JavaScript image
gallery slider with thumbnails alright
so basically we have a large image here
and then down here we have some
thumbnails we're using grid CSS to line
them up and you can see that whatever
selected has the opacity effect if I
click another image it'll fade in and
we're going to use a tiny bit of CSS for
that effect all right now 90% of the
examples you're gonna find on the
internet for something like this are
gonna use jQuery and it's really
unfortunate because we don't need jQuery
for most things that it's used for in my
opinion I think that it really prevented
a lot of people not so much now because
people are really catching on that
that's not the way to do it but a few
years ago it really prevented people
from learning actual JavaScript so I
would have people on more than one
occasion ask me if they should learn
jQuery or JavaScript first which is a
little nuts you shouldn't learn a
library of a language before knowing at
least the basics of the actual language
so I'm gonna show you how to build it in
vanilla JavaScript now the other 10% of
tutorials online that use vanilla
JavaScript are just I wouldn't say bad
code I just say less efficient then it
could be one of the examples is
w3schools which i think is a great site
for learning it actually taught me a lot
about JavaScript CSS HTML but I think
they really need to update some of their
code or at least add new examples that
use more modern JavaScript there's no
reason to use all the images he
and all of them here just have a single
image where you can change the source
attribute when you click on one of the
thumbnails there's also no reason for
these multiple functions they should use
query selector instead of get class name
that way you can use a higher-order
array like for each array method I
should say like for each instead of
these four loops and you can just make
this a lot shorter and a lot cleaner so
that's what I want to do and I don't
mean to pick apart the code here I don't
like people that really dissect other
people's code and just trash it and
that's not what I'm doing this is
actually very fundamental stuff like
learning variables and in for loops and
I do think you should learn selectors
like get elements by class name even
though the stuff is older I think you
should still learn it but I also think
they should put a like a newer version
as well
all right so but then again that takes
the job away from me so that's what
we're gonna do we're gonna build this in
a more efficient way than this version
here and also add the fade effect this
doesn't have the fade effect I actually
boiled it down to two lines of code to
build this without the fade effect and
without the opacity here so I'm going to
show you that as well I'm using es6
arrow functions things like that all
right so let's jump into it guys no more
negativity and I don't mean to trash
jQuery or w3schools
just I'm just trying to give you an idea
of why I made this video all right so
let's jump in all right so to get set up
here if you're gonna follow along and
you want these exact images you can go
to pixels comm which is a great free
stock photo site and just search for the
word Tek and that's pretty much where I
got well that is where I got all of
these images and if you want to grab the
same exact size you want the large which
is the nineteen twenty by twelve eighty
in this case 1279 but that's fine
alright so inside here in my vs code you
can see I have a folder called thumb
gallery and inside the IMG folder I
labeled the images IMG one through
a okay and then I just have a blank
index.html mein Jas and style.css so if
you want to follow along just go ahead
and get that set up all right so we're
gonna start off with the HTML as usual
so let's throw in our Emmet exclamation
and then hit tab and we get our head and
body tags so in here I'm just gonna say
thumb gallery and then let's add our CSS
so we're gonna add style dot CSS still
spelt it wrong alright and let's add in
our main J s down here so say script
source and it's gonna be main dot J s
alright so we have our files linked now
for the mark-up it's gonna be very
simple I'm gonna make it much neater
than the w3c which is this here pretty
ugly looking and I don't mean to sound
like demeaning or anything like that I'm
just trying to show you guys a better
way to do this so let's create a
container and let's create a class of
mein - IMG and then in here we'll create
an image tag I'm gonna give this an idea
of current and we're gonna set the
source to the first image so it's an IMG
and then it's IMG one dot JPEG alright
we don't need the alt okay and then what
we'll do is go under the main image div
and create a class called images or IMG
s and then what I'll do is grab this and
let's paste that in but let's get rid of
the idea of current you don't need that
I just want the image and then we're
gonna just copy this down so we'll go
ahead and just put an eighth of these so
that's four five six seven eight and
then let's just change the image name so
that'll be eight seven five four three
two and one
alright and that's it that's our HTML so
you can see that that is pretty neat
compared to this here and this there's I
don't know why they did this with the
multiple images at the top what we're
gonna do is
just change the source through
JavaScript of this one image tag alright
so let's open this up
you cannot go ahead and open up the HTML
file or if you're using vs code and you
want to install live server you can do
that and then you can just open with
live server alright so this is what
it'll look like it'll just be all the
images the first one's gonna repeat
because that's the main image here and
we have it in the list here alright so
let's move on to the CSS which is also
going to be very simple we're gonna
start off with the body tag
alright so the body I'm just gonna add a
margin of 20 pixels and we're gonna add
padding of 0 I'm also using prettier
which is a great vs code extension if I
save it'll go ahead and format my code
whether it's CSS or JavaScript HTML if I
leave off a semicolon by accident and I
save it puts it right there you see it
move the bracket up as well
highly recommend it so it's the
background we're gonna set to dark gray
alright so the container which goes
around everything I'm gonna set a max
width of 760 pixels and you can change
some of this stuff if you want and let's
add a margin Auto to move it to the
middle I'm gonna give it a border of
white solid and what do we want three
pixels and then the background of the
container will also be white alright
save that so here we're gonna do the
main image image okay so the image
inside of that class and I just want to
set that to a width width of 100% of its
container so you can see that now it's
fit it fits inside of its container
which is 760 pixels we also want the
images images to be with 100% so let's
go ahead and say class images
is image set that to a hundred percent
as well okay
now the images class is actually going
to be a grid so we're gonna add in dot
images and we're gonna set the display
to grid all right just doing that it's
not going to change anything we need to
add our template columns so let's say
grid template columns and I do have a
crash course on grid CSS if you if
you're interested what I want to do here
is have four four images per column so
to do that we could do one fractional
for x so one F are like that so we could
do that and save but there's a shorter
way we could do this and that's by using
repeat so we could say repeat four times
one fractional like that alright and
that will give us the same result now to
add some spacing in between these images
we can add a grid gap I love grid CSS is
fantastic so we could set this to let's
say five pixels and save and there we go
all right
I think grid CSS is one of the best
technologies to come out in the last
decade it's just makes things so much
easier instead of doing floats and
clearing them and all that crap so
that's it for the CSS we will add a
fading class later with a little bit of
animation for the opacity for the fade
in but we're gonna do that later so now
we're gonna jump into the main j/s and
from here we're going to grab the
current image so we'll set that to
document dots
we'll use query selector and that has an
ID of current okay and then we want to
grab all the images now since there's
more than one we're going to be using
query selector all
all right and what we'll do here is it's
basically like using jQuery as far as
selectors go let's say dot images class
and then all the images inside so now
what we want to do is we want to add an
event listener on each of these images
now query select are all returns what's
called a node list which is basically
like an array works like an array so we
actually need to loop through these
images and then add the event listener
onto each image
so since node lists since query selector
I'll returns a node list we can actually
use the higher order method of for each
instead of using just a for loop so we
can do exercise should be images so we
can do images dot for each and in here
we could do a callback function like
that but I'm going to go ahead and use
an es6 arrow function so we're gonna say
image and we're gonna set this to image
dot add event listener and then in here
we want to listen for or click okay and
then the second parameter we could put
an arrow function as well and I'm gonna
show you a really short way to do this
we could just say current current which
is our variable for the the main image
the current image we're gonna set that
source attribute we're gonna set that
equal to and this should have an event
passed into it I'm gonna set it equal to
that event dot target dot source okay so
just this should actually give us the
the thumbnail functionality so I'm gonna
save and now we'll go over here and we
can actually change the images all right
now you'll see that prettier I'm using
the prettier extension for vs code which
formats on save but this could actually
be one line of code if I were to make
this bigger so it could be one line of
code right and then if we wanted to we
could also use es6 d structuring for our
variables so we could say Const and then
inside of
some brackets and I'm not gonna leave it
like this I'm just doing it to show you
guys how short we can make this so we
could say current and images equals set
that to brackets and then we could take
this put that in there take this and put
a comma here put that in there and go
ahead and get rid of that and now we
have two lines of code okay when I save
it it goes it goes to this because in
Auto formats but you can you saw that it
could be two lines of code and it still
works okay I'm not going to use
destructuring though I just wanted to
show you guys that real quick all right
so we're gonna go back to this and let's
just make this smaller again and instead
of just pointing our using our arrow
function here I'm gonna use I'm gonna
create a new function so we're gonna
replace this with a function called
image click OK and then we'll create
that function here so I am G click and
that can take in an event parameter and
then we're gonna do the same thing we
just did we're gonna take the current
source and we're gonna set it to e dot
target dot source okay and that should
still work let's go ahead and test it
and there we go all right so let's take
care of the opacity when I click on an
image I want it to be kind of faded out
so up here I'm going to set a variable
for the opacity and I'm gonna set it to
0.4 by default all right and then we'll
go down here and after we change the
source actually let me just put some
comments in here we'll say change
current image to source of
clicked image and then we want to change
the opacity to whatever the variable is
- VAR will say opacity VAR so to do that
we take the e-dot target and we want to
take the style and the opacity and set
it equal to whatever that opacity is so
let's save that and now if I click on
the computer image you'll see that now
it's lighter now the problem we have is
if I click on another image if that
opacity changes but the computer is
still left like that and it's just
they're all going to stay like that so
what we're gonna do is at the beginning
of our image click we want to reset the
opacity of all the images so to do that
we're just going to take our images and
we're going to for each and we're gonna
take image and we're gonna set that to
image dot style dot opacity and just set
that to 1 okay so that will reset it on
every click so if I click that and we
see the opacity if I go to another one
it resets it sorry about my son yelling
upstairs it resets it and then it sets
the opacity to the level just for that
single image okay so that is that
functionality is covered now the final
thing we want to add is the animation
and you can see I'll need this code is
so for the animation we're gonna go to
our style CSS and let's say fade-in
animation so we're just going to create
a keyframe here so we're gonna say at
keyframes and we're gonna say fade in
yeah we'll do fade in like that
and we just want to say to and then we
want to set the opacity to 1 okay and
then we just want to have a class called
fade in will do fade - in and set
opacity to zero and then just call that
animation
so we'll say animation fade in and we'll
say 0.5 seconds so half a second and
we'll ease in one and we'll say four
words all right and that's it that's our
CSS animation and the four words is just
is the fill mode property which it's
basically gonna make it so the element
retains the style values that's set by
the last keyframe but that's it that's
all we need so now what we're gonna do
is go back to our java script and when
we click on an image we're gonna add
that fading class to the current image
okay so let's go let's see we'll go
right here after the source changes and
let's say add fading class so we can do
that by taking our current image and
just saying class list dot add that'll
add a class and we want to add fade
in/fade - in so let's save that let's
click on an image okay so say current
class add fade and I save this no I
didn't okay so let's say I'm just reload
this and click now only the first one
fade it in did you see that if I reload
and I click it fades in now the reason
it's not working on these other ones is
because the fade in class has just
stayed on on this and the animation is
only going to happen when the class hits
when it actually gets that class and it
already has it so it's not doing the
fade in so what I came up with as a
solution
to use a set timeout and remove the
class in a half a second after we click
it alright so I mean there's other ways
you can do this I just figured that this
was a nice solution so we'll say remove
fading class after 0.5 seconds so all we
have to do is say set timeout and that's
gonna take in a function we'll use an
arrow and we're gonna say current dots
class lists just like we can do add we
can do remove and then we want to remove
the fading class so fade dash in and
then the second parameter will be the
length of time I'm gonna say 500 this is
in milliseconds so 500 milliseconds is a
half a second alright so let's try that
we'll save so that fades in click the
next one and even if I do it real fast
it works okay now the last issue that I
just realized I didn't do is when we
first come to the application I want the
first image to be to have the opacity so
we can easily do that by going up to the
top here and just we'll say set first
image opacity and we'll do that by
saying the images we want the first one
when we use query selector all we get a
Dom Dom list back we can use we can
select the images like an array so we
want the first one and then we're just
going to set the style well don't need
to do that style dots opacity and we'll
set that equal to that opacity variable
which I'm going to make a little lighter
let's do six and save and now you can
see the first one has the opacity if I
click on the next one gets the opacity
the fade works and everything is good
alright so again if we look at this
JavaScript here in my opinion at least
it's nice and clean and it looks much
better than what they did here all right
and please don't take this as a dig at
w3schools there it's a great site it's
one of the
for learning at least based in the
basics of JavaScript HTML CSS but what
I'm trying to do is just show you that
JavaScript has evolved and we can do
things in a much cleaner and easier way
and we also don't need jQuery to do
something like this even with faden's
and so on I mean the CSS is easy enough
it's a couple lines so thanks for
