developer or any job at all where you
sit all day can do horrible things to
your back and your health in general
over time so I would definitely suggest
looking into a stand set desk and anthro
desk has affordable and quality
solutions for maximum health and
productivity you can choose from
different frame widths depending on your
needs I actually just got one myself and
I love it they also offer accessories
like standing converters and floor mats
so check out anthro desk com
or click the link in the description
below hey what's going on guys welcome
to my Gatsby j/s crash course if you do
not know what Gatsby is it's a static
site generator that uses react and it
also has a rich data plug-in ecosystem
to work with things like headless
content management systems api's
databases your own file system and much
more ok so it has has a slew of plugins
that can really extend the functionality
of this beyond just a regular static
site generator all right it also uses
graph QL to query things like files from
your file system for instance we're
gonna be using markdown to create a blog
on our static site and we will be using
graph QL to basically query the file
nodes and bring those into into our site
all right now in web development you
have many different tools whether it's a
framework a library a CMS whatever it
may be and some are practical and some
are not okay some are really awesome
technologies but they're not very
practical when it comes to you know a
one-man show a fleet a freelancer that
wants to create something of substance
for a client and this is something
that's very practical for freelancers
okay if you want to build like brochure
type websites and you don't want to do
the old you know HTML files where you're
constantly repeating yourself you have
the same navbar on every single page
this is awesome because you can just
create a simple react component
a simple navbar or whatever it may be
sidebar menu something like that footer
and just included in your layout and
then you no longer have to worry about
that you can just simply create new
pages and that will automatically show
up so it's very very practical in that
sense and it can be very easy if you're
making just a brochure website if you're
adding a blog or you're adding you know
if you're at it if you're dealing with
api's and stuff like that it can get a
little more complicated
you'll see when we create our markdown
blog there's quite a bit of
configuration it can be a little
overwhelming but once you get past that
and you already have those files created
it's simple you just create your folder
with your blog post and it will
automatically show up in the list and
you can click on it and read you and
people can read your blog posts alright
so we're just going to jump in and get
started it has its own CLI that will
generate a site for us with some
boilerplate we'll take a look at that
we'll create a menu component and we'll
work on the blog so we'll do as much as
we can within an hour so I like to keep
my crash courses around an hour so let's
jump in and get started alright guys so
we're gonna jump in and get started here
now first thing you're gonna want to do
is install the Gatsby CLI and you want
to install it globally so we're gonna go
ahead and do NPM install or NPM I - g4
global and then Gatsby - CLI okay and
obviously you need to have no js'
installed so you have access to NPM
alright so mine went really quick
because I actually already have it
installed once you do that we'll be able
to generate a new application with the
gatsby new and then the name of the app
so I'm gonna call this gatsby underscore
let's do underscore crash underscore
course that's fine
all right and I'll have all the code for
this in the description as well and like
I said we're gonna we're gonna give it a
shot
deploying it to nullify I haven't
actually done it yet but we'll we'll try
it together
so what's happening now is it's just
generating all the files for us so now
we should be able to CD into gatsby
underscore crash underscore course and
from here I'm just gonna open up visual
studio code or whatever you know
whatever text editor you want doesn't
have to be vs code I'll upgrade later
and now I'm gonna use the the internal
or the integrated terminal from now on
all right so let's take a look at some
files here if we look at our package dot
Jason we have some dependencies of
course Gatsby Gatsby link is so that we
can use the link tag like you would do
in regular react and then Gatsby plugin
react helmet and react helmet is used to
basically generate head information for
your pages down here we have some
scripts gatsby develop is what we'll do
to run our server gatsby build will
build it out we can also do testing and
so on and then it looks like it also
includes prettier as a dev dependency
okay I'm also using the prettier
extension for vyas code so that's the
package.json file we have some config
files here I'm not really gonna go over
these just yet we will be working in
these later when we start to implement
our blog with markdown but the main the
main stuff is in this source folder okay
just like with any react application we
have a components folder you'll see we
have a header J's file we have pages
which includes an index J s a 404 page
and a page two and then we have a
layouts folder which has an index J s
and an index dot CSS alright so if we
were to look at a page let's look at the
index page it's basically a functional
react component we have an arrow
function here called in it's called
index page
we just have a div so basically this is
the render and we're linking to page two
here using link which comes in from
Gatsby link and then we're just
exporting the page all right so when you
want to create a page this is all you
have to do this is the second page and
this is the 404 page all right now if we
look at layouts if we look at index j/s
we're bringing in helmet so helmet has
to do with the head and so you can see
we can have a title which we can get
from data sight dot sight metadata title
we can include our own description and
keywords and stuff and then we have our
header okay so our header component and
then we have some styling and you can
use global styling you can use sass
there's actually a sass plug-in you can
use styled components there's there's
plenty of different options when it
comes to styling and then down here we
just have a standard graph QL query just
to get the site metadata and all that
all right but basically this is your
layout if we look in hetero js' this is
our header component just has a bunch of
styling and has the site title in it as
well okay and that's being passed in
here so let's go ahead and run the
server by just saying gatsby - develop
or not - what am i doing it's gasp
gatsby space develop weirdo
so what this will do is it'll open our
site on localhost 8080
and there it is Gatsby default starter
so let's actually put this to the side
here and just have these side by side
and just to let you know where
everything is this this purple area this
is the header component you can see the
background I can actually change this if
I want let's say background and I will
say Coral Save and it actually has hot
reloading so as soon as I save this
updates there's no need to actually
reload the page I don't want coral
actually let's use let's use a dark grey
there we go and you can change their
styling here if you want if you wanted
to move your styling to a CSS file
that's fine as well here we have just a
link which is comes in from Gatsby link
this is used instead of an a tag with an
href it's gonna be linked with a to
attribute and anyone any of you guys
that have dealt with react recently you
probably know that then we just have the
site title now the site title we can
change in the layout if I go to index J
s and let's see site title or is it not
in the site title it's in config so
let's change it to will say gatsby crash
course and save
okay so you know if we change this
config file I think we have to restart
the server so let's control C and run
Gatsby develop again and there we go so
if you change the config file you do
have to restart the server all right
we'll be adding some plugins here later
right now we just have the helmet plug
in so if we wanted to change let's see
let's go to our layout and XJS so if we
wanted to add a description here we
could say for a description this is a
sample website for the gatsby crash
course and then for keywords we can put
like gatsby react I don't know tutorial
whatever you get the point so if we save
that we take a look at our source code
well actually we can't see it here
because we're running our server but if
we look at let's see let's go to
elements and pull this down and we look
at our head you can see right here a
description there it is there's our
keywords alright so when we build out
our site we'll see those and I'm just
going to move this to the bottom alright
so let's change the index page up a
little bit so in pages index j/s we're
just gonna say welcome to my website
we'll put let's put one paragraph in
here
and we'll just say this is a sample site
for the Gatsby crash course and I don't
want this link to go to page two I'm
gonna get rid of that and save and there
we go so there's our home page nothing
special nothing nothing we build here is
gonna be it is gonna be is gonna look
good it's just to get you to understand
how to use Gatsby and then you can build
your own sites of course you can bring
in bootstrap and/or materialize whatever
you want to use use the grid however you
want to style your site so but we're
just gonna use the default styling so if
we want to create a page all right let's
say we want to create an about page all
we have to do is create a new file in
here called about dot J s and then we
need a functional based component I use
a an extension in V s code called or is
it es7 react Redux graph QL and I can do
our FC tab and it just gives me a
functional component if I do our CC tab
it'll give me a class-based component
alright but we just want a simple
functional based component and we're
gonna just cut the export default and
we're gonna say Const about page equals
our function and then we'll make sure we
export it down here so explored about
page alright and then in here let's just
put let's see what did the index page
have an h1 we'll go ahead and just copy
this and we'll say
about us and let's actually just put
some sample text in here I'll say lorem
40 tab and save and then if I just go to
slash about there it is alright so if
you've worked with next Jas which is
react on the server it works in kind of
the same way you just create your page
and it's it's available you don't have
to bring in react router you don't have
to create any special routes or anything
like that you just simply create the
page in the pages folder
alright let's create one more page
static page here so we'll say new and
let's call it services I'll say services
dot Jas and I'm just gonna copy what we
did in the about paste that in we'll
change this to service services page and
we'll say our services I'll go ahead and
make this two paragraphs and change the
export to services page and save and now
all we have to do is go to services and
there it is alright now we'll probably
want a menu because we want to be able
to get around so let's create a menu
component so what I'll do I'm just gonna
close these out these files and we're
gonna go into our components folder and
create a new file called menu dot j/s
alright now from here we're going to
import that she'll just do my RFC tab
make it a little easier and we're going
to cut out the export default we're
gonna say Const menu equals and then
we'll export it down here
okay now I'm gonna add some inline
styling here for our menu so let's go
let's see well you know what we don't
want the return did that get added to
our pages it did we don't actually need
this what we can do is get rid of the
curly braces since we're using an arrow
function we can get rid of the curly
braces and we can get rid of the actual
return so we can go like that alright
and if I save that we should still be
able to go to a boat without any
problems okay same thing with services
just to make it a little cleaner so
we'll get rid of that bring that up
there get rid of the curly brace and
there we go good
so in our menu let's do the same thing
we'll get rid of the return and the
curly braces and then what I want to do
is I want to add a little bit of styling
so we're gonna put a div here and we can
say style equals and then we want double
curly braces and in here I'm gonna say
background let's do background and we'll
do light gray so we'll do f4 three times
let's do padding top okay and this isn't
standard CSS you want to make sure you
use camel case don't don't do padding -
top okay so let's see that's our div and
then inside here will have a ul
and inside here let's do style and we're
gonna do a list style of none we're
going to display flex because I wanted
to I want it to be displayed horizontal
and then I'm just gonna add in here
justify content and we're gonna set that
to spaced evenly alright so that should
do it for styling now we'll go ahead and
add our list item so let's do I will say
Li and let's put 4 so I'll do Li times
for using Emmet and then in each one
will have a link of such a V capital L
so link 2 equals okay so link to this
will be slash and it's gonna be home
alright let's make sure we bring in link
so we're gonna say import link from
Gatsby - link so that's our home I'm
just going to copy this so we'll have
home we'll have about
and we'll have services and then we're
also gonna have a blog but I'm actually
I'm not gonna put this in just yet so
for now we'll just have our static pages
like that and let's save this alright so
now it's not going to show up yet even
if I reload it's not gonna show up
because we haven't inserted it into into
our layout okay and that's what we want
to do so let's go to our layout index j
s and just like they brought in the
header here we're going to bring in the
menu so components menu and then we're
just gonna put this let's see let's put
this right below the header which is
right here so we'll say menu like that
and save reference none is not defined
okay that's because I forgot my quotes
guys probably noticed that and save and
there we go so there's our menu I don't
like this space right here so let's see
let's go to our header where it has
margin bottom I'm gonna set that to zero
and there we go
cool so if I click on home brings us
home services about it's not it's not
the best-looking thing in the world but
you can see what I'm doing here I'm
creating separate components and they're
gonna show on this is gonna show on
every page rather than just building a
regular HTML site where you'll have to
include this on every in every file not
to mention you have all the benefits of
react
now we have this inline style you don't
need to do this but I just figured since
the the header has it I just added it to
the menu but let's say I want to get rid
of these underlines and change the color
of the links here I'm gonna go to
layouts index CSS and this is the global
CSS file so let's go to write to the a
tag here and let's just say color will
do color 333 and we'll say text text
decoration equals none and save and
there we go alright so that's basically
how you can create like a justice
regular static site just a brochure
informational site you can do anything
you can do with react pretty much now
what I want to show you is how to
implement a blog now it doesn't have to
be a blog it could be like let's say
events maybe you have a list of events
or something like that maybe you have a
list of I don't know maybe it's like a
school type website and you have a list
of homework just any kind of data but
we're gonna just use a blog for
simplicity so first thing we'll do
before we do any configuration let's
create a couple blog posts okay and I'll
just show you what what you would do to
create those posts we're gonna make it
so that you just go into the pages
folder and let's say let's create a new
folder and you can call this whatever
you want this is gonna be our first blog
post you probably want to put the date
that's what I've seen that as a
convention so we'll put like 2018 and
we'll say oh four - oh nine and we'll
call it post - we'll say post - one
all right and then inside here we're
gonna create a file called index dot MD
okay it's gonna be a markdown file and
with vyas code I have an extension
installed that will give us a preview of
any markdown file we open now in this
markdown file we're gonna have our post
which will be the content then we also
have something called frontmatter okay
so our frontmatter is gonna go in
between two triple hyphens okay or
dashes and we're gonna have a couple
fields here so we're gonna have a path
we're gonna specify this as whatever the
the path the URL we want for this post
I'm gonna say post - one okay so that's
gonna be our path and let's define a
date and by the way you can put whatever
you want in here you don't have to put
this stuff aside from the path and I
guess a title but I'm gonna put a date
we'll say the same date as the folder
will say 2018 - oh for - oh nine then
we'll have a title okay so for the title
we'll say my first Gatsby post and let's
also do an author okay again not
required but I just want to put one so
I'm going to just put my name all right
so that's our frontmatter I'm actually
going to get rid of that preview it's
not even working well actually it is
working it just it's not gonna display
the front matter so under here is where
we actually create our content so I'm
just gonna say this is my very first
blog post in Gatsby alright so that's it
that's a blog post we'll save it and
this is I mean once you get your
everything configured and you create
your clients website you simply tell
them to do this to create a blog post is
it as convenient as logging into
WordPress and doing it from there maybe
not but you know it gives them an
easy way to add content they don't have
to add any HTML you can show them a
simple markdown cheat sheet or better
yet direct them to my markdown crash
course and if he wanted to make like
something bold you could just surround
it in asterisks or that's that's
actually ital like it's double for bold
but things like that so you can use that
instead of HTML tags but let's save this
and let's create one more post so we're
gonna create another folder in pages
called 2018 - oh four - ten - post - two
okay and then we'll create another index
dot MD file and I'm just gonna copy the
first one we did paste that in there
we'll change the path to post two we'll
change the date we'll change this to
let's say my second Gatsby post we'll
change the author - John Doe and we'll
say this is my second post in Gatsby
alright so now we have two blog posts
now just doing this isn't going to do
anything whatsoever there's no way for
us to get to these pages what we'll have
to do is we need to install a couple
plugins okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna make this bigger and I'm
gonna stop our server with control C and
looks like my clearing isn't working
again so just open up a new terminal
alright so there's there's basically
three plugins that I want to install so
we're gonna say NPM I the first one is
called Gatsby - source - file system I
can't talk and type at the same time
sometimes system so what this does is it
allows us to work with data from our
computer's file system and we need this
to be able to query our blog posts from
our file system now since we're using
markdown we're also gonna need gatsby -
transformer
- remark and this will allow us to
basically transform blog posts that are
written in markdown MD files like the
index MD files we created on the local
disk into HTML for rendering that's what
this is gonna do
and then we also want Gatsby - plugin -
catch - links and what this will do is
it'll intercept local links for markdown
and other non react pages and does a
client side push state to avoid the
browser having to refresh the page so we
want to install these three plugins here
let me just make sure I spelled
everything right because I was talkin
all right so let's run this have gotten
permission issues installing these on
windows before so hopefully that doesn't
happen
all right good so it looks like that
worked if we look at our package dot
JSON file you can see that we have our
plugins here all right now after we
install these plugins we need to
configure them okay so we have to go to
our gatsby config dot j s you can see we
have an area for our plugins we already
have the helmet plugin so we need to add
some stuff here now in this array let's
put this on a new line we're going to
put in a comma and let's put in here
gatsby and we'll do our dash plugin -
catch - links okay now the next one here
we want to put in our file source
filesystem plug-in but we have some
options as well so we're actually going
to put in a set of curly braces and
we're gonna say resolve and then the
name of the plug-in which is gatsby -
source - file system alright and then we
also want to put in options which is
going to be an object and we want the
path so here we're going to use back
ticks because we're going to use a
template literal we want to put in this
syntax which allows us to put a variable
and we're just gonna do double
underscored our name meaning the current
directory and then in the source folder
and then in the pages folder so
basically we're just showing where we
want to look and it's in the pages
folder that's where we're putting our
blog posts that's what we want to put
right here and then we just also want to
put a name of the folder which is pages
ok so that will configure that then we
want to put a comma right here and we
want to add our last plug-in which is
the transformer remark so Gatsby -
transformer
- remark having a lot of trouble talking
and tight typing at the same time today
so that should be it as far as this goes
as far as adding our plugins to this
file so let's save this and let's it
let's at least make sure we can run our
site so we'll say gatsby develop make
sure we don't have any errors at least
alright I'll go ahead and open this and
let's just reload it alright so this is
still working that's that's a good sign
we can close the config file now before
we get into this we need to add to this
gatsby node.js file we also need to
create a template for our blog post but
before we get into that let's go back to
our browser and since we're using graph
QL we have a tool called graphical
available to us and if you've used graph
QL before if you've watched my five-part
graph QL server series then you've
worked with this but we want to do
localhost 8000
graph graph QL all right and then this
is this allows us to basically just
write queries and this is an actual
query to get all of our files within the
pages folder if I go ahead and press run
here I don't know if this will
automatically show up on yours it might
be on mine because I've already ran it I
think it might have been my last query
if not just go ahead and put that in
there and I'm not gonna go over graph QL
in depth here it's basically a query
language and it's formatted like the
data is formatted so if we go ahead and
we run this you'll see it's going to
give us back this data object that has
all file and edges edges is basically
going to be an array of our nodes and
our nodes are our files okay and you can
see we're getting the
d which is the complete path and file
name of each file so our 404 about page
to index and we also have our blog pages
here as well so basically what we're
doing is we're getting the edges we're
getting the array of nodes or files and
we're just requesting the ID and it's
giving us all that data all right now
when we make our query to get our
markdown files we're going to use the
markdown transformer so let's put a
different query in here let's get rid of
this and instead we're gonna put in some
curly braces hopefully you guys can see
that I guess I can make this bigger you
know what let's let's just make this big
all right so let's say all right here it
even pops up all markdown remark and if
we wanted to do sorting and stuff like
that we could put that in parentheses
right here but I'm not going to get into
that and then let's do edges
let's do node and then let's get our
frontmatter now remember frontmatter if
we look at one of our posts is going to
be this data here so we can get any of
this data that we want so let's go well
I can't see with that in the way can I
so frontmatter
and then we can pick and choose what we
want so let's get everything we'll get
the path we'll get the title and there's
no don't put a comma if you haven't you
worked with graph QL it might look a
little funny without a comma but we
don't do that in our query so date and
author
oops date author and let's see if that
works so if I run that and there we go
you can see that we're actually querying
querying our markdown files and we're
getting the frontmatter
now if we want the actual post we could
get that it's not part of the front
matter so we're gonna go underneath and
we can get excerpt so let's run that and
now you can see we get the actual
content in excerpt so we're using graph
QL to grab our markdown files and that's
basically what we're gonna do from
within our blog post template alright so
just remember this this type of query so
let's go back up let me bring this back
down let's go back to our browser let's
get rid of close the post up and let's
work on let's do an end a blog index
page first which will just show the
listing of posts and then we'll get into
the actual individual post pages which
are these so I'm gonna create a new page
or a new file called blog dot j/s
alright and we're just gonna grab let's
grab the index file here and copy it and
then we'll just change this to flog page
we'll change this to blog page alright
and then what I'm gonna do is in the h1
will just say latest posts and then we
need to query our posts just like we did
in the graphical interface so to do that
we're gonna go down here below the or
I'm sorry above the export and we're
gonna create a variable here we're going
to export Const and let's call this page
query and we're gonna say equals graph
QL and then to make a graph QL query we
need our back ticks like this okay so
our query will go in here so we'll say
query and we're gonna say blog index
query and then we can actually copy what
we just did in graphical so this right
here because what we want is this stuff
right so I'm going to paste that in and
we actually don't need the excerpt you
don't need to include that we do want
all this frontmatter and let's see i
also want to get the ID which is outside
of the frontmatter and the reason I want
the idea is because when we when we loop
through the pit through the posts we
need to have a key if you're if you have
any experience with react when you map
through anything you want to have a key
or you're gonna get that little warning
in the console so I want to use the ID
as the key so will requite where we will
request that as well all right now what
we'll do is go back up here and in order
to get this data we need to pass in
curly braces and data okay like that and
let's see we want to map through it so
we can say data and then dot all
markdown remark and we want the edges
which is basically the array okay
remember it's edges and then we have the
nodes inside but we want to map through
the edges we want to map through this
array and we're gonna say post for each
one and we'll set an arrow here and then
for each post let's let's create a div
and then this is where we're gonna have
to add our key so we're gonna say key
equals post dot node dot ID
and then here let's put an h3 let's say
post dot node and then we want the title
and remember the title is in the front
matter so we want to say front matter
dot title okay
underneath that I'm gonna put a small
tag and I'm gonna say posted by and then
we can say here post dot node dot front
matter dot author okay because remember
we included the author I believe if I
see yeah if I save this it's gonna get
rid of the spaces anyway so we might as
well not do that
so posted by the author and that's let's
say on and then here we'll say post dot
node dot frontmatter dot date because
that's included as well all right and
then under the small tag I'm gonna put
two line breaks like I said this is not
gonna be styled very nicely and then we
want a link to go to the actual post
okay remember in the front matter we
have that path very that path value so
we're going to use our link we're gonna
say link to actually we don't want
quotes here we want a link to post dot
no dot frontmatter dot path and here
let's just say read more okay and then
under the link I'm going to put two more
line breaks
and let's also put an HR to separate
each post all right so let's save that
looks like we're getting an error here
expected name found hold on a second did
I do this wrong oh yeah I have an extra
set of curly braces this shouldn't be
here so this one let's get rid of that
and that and save let's go down to the
bottom here okay so it looks like it
compiled successfully now what I'm going
to do is add to our menu component let's
add the blog
okay save and yeah let's cross our
fingers where's my browser one second
all right so we have our blog let's
click on it and there there we go latest
posts my first Gatsby post posted by
Brad Travis e on this date and we have
our second Gatsby post so that's our
index page now if I click read more
we're gonna get a 404 because we still
have quite a bit to do in order for this
to actually register as that post ok as
the posts supposed to so let's go back
and we're gonna have to create a
template for our blog post so we're
gonna create a folder in the source
called templates okay and you can call
this whatever you want I'm gonna call it
blog - post dot J s okay so this is
gonna be our template let's go ahead and
import I will say import react from
react now the way they have prettier set
up is not to use semicolons if I save it
gets rid of the semicolon which is funny
because my prettier extension I have it
envious code I have it set if I forget a
semicolon it adds it because I prefer to
use them but apparently you know some
platforms like like like Gatsby like
view J as they encourage not using
semicolons but it's all preference so
here we're going to let's say sports
default function templates and it's
going to get passed in data
and what we want to do is create a
variable called post and we want to get
this from our markdown remark so you can
get that from data dot markdown remark
oops don't want to do that so let's see
underneath that we're going to have our
return and we'll put in a div here and I
want to have a like a back button this
commemorative poster I'm gonna have link
which I actually need to bring in so
let's import link from oops Gatsby -
link so right here will say link - and
let's set this to slash blog because
that's the index page for the blog and
in here we'll just say go back okay and
then I'm just gonna put an HR underneath
again this isn't gonna be pretty
and then we'll have an h1 which will
have the title so we can say post dot
frontmatter
dot title okay we don't have to include
the node now because we're dealing with
single posts we're not dealing with
we're not mapping through the edges
array alright and then under that I'm
gonna have an h4 and we're gonna say
posted by so same it's basically going
to be the same stuff that the index page
has except it's going to have the actual
content so let's say posted by post dot
frontmatter and by the way we haven't
created the query yet to actually get
this we'll do that below on
post dot frontmatter dot date and then
to actually set our HTML we're gonna
have a div and we're gonna use reacts
dangerously set inner HTML so
dangerously set inner HTML and we want
to set that to double curly braces and
we want to do double underscore HTML and
set it to post dot HTML okay and this is
just standard react this is going to
allow us to actually have HTML markup
inside of this alright so that takes
care of our template it's very simple
now we need our query so let's go down
here yeah we'll go down to the bottom
here and let's say export Const Post
query and we're gonna set it to graph QL
put in our back ticks and let's say
query and we'll say blog post by path
and we're gonna pass in money sign path
which is gonna be a string and then
instead of using all markdown remark
because we use that before because we're
getting all of our posts now we're
getting a single one so we just want to
use markdown remark alright and then we
pass in here inside these curly braces
this is gonna look a little weird so
we're gonna say frontmatter
and then set some curly braces and we're
gonna say where the path and then
another set of curly braces is equal to
EQ is equal to the path that's brought
in so money sign path I know that looks
a little weird and we want to get the
HTML and then we also want to give snow
comma we want to get the front matter
okay we can define what front matter we
want which is basically everything we
want the path the title the author and
the date okay
now remember you this doesn't have to be
a blog you could have other stuff here
like event location or something like
that but we're using a blog so these are
these are relevant pieces of data
alright so let's go ahead and save that
now this still isn't gonna work in fact
let's let's restart our server control C
Gatsby developed
all right so let's go back here and
reload and let's click read more now
we're still getting a 404 page the
reason for that is basically even though
we created our template in our query it
doesn't know what this is it doesn't
know to that this post one should
actually go to that that particular post
so we have to do one more thing or edit
one more file I believe and that is
Gatsby - no js' alright so we're going
to get rid of everything here and this
may seem a little confusing but we
basically need to we need to use the
create page API ok and that that's it
does exactly that it's going to make it
so that we can have post one post two
and any other pages so that we can
create those so we're gonna bring in the
path say require path which is just a
standard nodejs module and then say
sports dots create pages and gatsby you
it's gonna it uses redux which has
action creators and it kinda is
happening it happens in the background
but we need to pass in here bound action
creators ok this is probably the most
confusing file of all I don't even
understand some of this stuff but we
want to pass in that and then graph QL
we're basically registering it so
registering our post so that we can use
those URLs alright so now we're gonna
just set an arrow function and we're
gonna say Const
we're gonna use destructuring here and
we're gonna pull out create page
from bound action creators like that all
right and then what we need to do is
define our template so we're gonna say
const post template and we're gonna use
the path module and just say path
resolve and the post template is gonna
be in the source folder it's gonna be in
templates and it's gonna be called or it
is called blog - post dot JSK remember
that's that's the actual template for
the page alright now we want to do is
return a graph QL query so we want our
backticks here I'm sorry we want to go
like that and then have our backticks
oops backticks and then in here we'll
put in some curly braces again we want
to do all I could probably just copy
this from from our blog page this right
here let's see where does this end this
ends here right so we'll grab that and
paste that in here I think yeah we want
edges node we want of course we want the
HTML we want the ID the front matter so
that should be good now this will
actually give us a promise so we're
gonna go down to this closing
parenthesis and we're gonna say dot then
and then pass in our response we want to
check for errors
so we're gonna say if res dot errors
then we want to return and we're just
going to return a promise reject so
promise dot reject and pass in res dot
errors okay now if there are no errors
so we'll keep going down here then we
want to say res dot data and we want to
call all mark down remark dot edges and
we want to loop through these so we're
going to use a for each loop and in here
we want to put in some parentheses and
then our node object are no data and
we're going to create an arrow function
here oops it should be here
like that and then we just want to call
create page okay an inside create page
we pass in an object with the path and
we can say no dot frontmatter and we
want to get the path for that particular
post and then for a component we want to
say post template which is just our
variable that's up here that includes
our actual template all right so that
should do it hopefully unless I mess
something up but it's we're basically
just registering it using the create
pages API that's included with gatsby to
be able to have post one go to the
actual post have slip posts to go to the
actual post so basically look at
whatever this path is and have that
register okay so hopefully that makes
sense I think that this file
oops this file is the most confusing of
all to me at least but let's try it so
well we will have to restart the server
and hopefully it works all right so it
looks like we have an error here
something to do with our promise cannot
read path of undefined front oh I forgot
a T in matter
I love when the error is that easy all
right I'm just gonna restart this again
okay so hopefully it looks like it's
gonna compile successfully
good let's go back and there it is we're
already on it post one now works go back
click on read more for the second post
and there it is so we can now
continuously to create blog posts over
here in our pages okay so you can
instruct your clients to just simply
create a folder with the date it doesn't
mean eh this doesn't matter the name of
the folder doesn't really matter what
matters is the path but no matter what
path you choose it's gonna now be put on
the blog in fact let's test it out let's
add one more post so we'll say new
folder 20 1804 - 11 - post - 3 and we'll
create a new file called index dot MD
and we'll just grab just grab this
close that up paste that in there we'll
call this post three for the path change
the date
my third Gatsby post third and let's
save it and let's reload did I stop the
server you must set the path when
creating a page alright let's let's just
restart this Gatsby develop and
hopefully the up there it is my third
Gatsby post-its click on it and there we
go alright awesome so we have a static
site with a blog and I know that that
there was this quite a bit of
configuration if you haven't used graph
QL before that probably confuse the
out of you
but graph QL is is an awesome technology
I would suggest watching my my five-part
course where we create a graph QL and
Express server or just any video it
doesn't have to be mine but it's
definitely a technology you're gonna
want to get into if you are you know if
you're looking to stay current in in the
world of web development alright so I
think that's gonna be it for building
the the actual site like I said it's
nothing special to look at but it should
give you some good insight on how Gatsby
works so now what I want to do is try to
push this too gonna push it to github
and then we're going to try to deploy it
with nullify all right so let's deploy
this bad boy so we're going to go to
github.com and I'm going to create a new
repository I'm gonna call it Gatsby
crash course will say sample websites
built with Gatsby alright so let's go
down to our command line I'm gonna stop
the server and actually it's open up a
new terminal here and I'm gonna say get
in it so we're gonna initialize a git
repository then we're gonna do git add
all so get add dot and then we're going
to get actually hold on oh yeah ok so it
already has a good ignore file good so
now let's do get commit - a.m. and we're
gonna say we'll just say initial commit
okay now we're going to grab the remote
link right here or there I'm sorry the
remote command and paste that in and
then we're going to push to our remote
git repository I just got to put my
stuff in here
oops something happened where I think my
SSH keys are gone or something I don't
know why I have to do that all right so
let's reload our repository and there it
is I'll probably change the the readme
later on but that's fine for now now
what we want to do is go to net laughs I
notified comm say get started for free
we want to choose github and sign in
with github you might get like something
that that says you know is it okay to
sign up with github just click OK let's
say new site from git we're gonna choose
github we're going to authorize net
Liffe I put in your password okay so we
want to choose C got a lot of
repositories here I want Gatsby crash
course let's see so it's gonna run
Gatsby build remember that's part of the
package Jason script be at Gatsby build
it's gonna build into public and I think
that's that's pretty much all we need to
do we don't need to change anything here
I don't believe so let's say deploy site
alright so deploying your site
looks like it's still going that in
what's awesome about Neto fly is of
course you can add your custom domain
you can do that with with any service
and you can add HTTP really easily okay
basically in one click it says so that's
really cool there's also contact forms
so you don't have to build your own
back-end just just to have a contact
form it's a really really awesome
service and they give you a lot for free
actually alright so it still says site
deploy in progress alright so it looks
like your site is deployed now you could
keep on going and setup a custom domain
I'm not gonna go through all that it's
very self-explanatory but let's check
our site so it gives you a a custom URL
which is this right here it's just gonna
make up something weird dotnet Wi-Fi
let's click on that and there's our site
we're now deployed to the internet let's
try the about services the blog let's
click on a blog post and everything
works perfectly and it's very fast it's
that's one thing I didn't really talk
about about Gatsby is it's incredibly
fast everything is just instant alright
and I'll go ahead and leave this up too
as well if you guys want to check it out
I'll put it up with the link in the
description but hopefully you enjoyed
this and hopefully you'll look more into
Gatsby there's a lot more you can do you
can integrate with different api's you
could integrate with WordPress it's it's
it's a really cool technology and I
think it's something that's very
practical which is kind of rare these
days to find something that you can
actually use you know on your own
without a big company without spending
incredible amounts of time to create
something you can just whip up some nice
static sites some really fast static
sites for your clients so thanks for
