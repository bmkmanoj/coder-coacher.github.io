take a look at animate CSS which is a
CSS toolkit or a library or whatever you
want to call it that has been around for
a while and it's used to create really
nice animation effects using just CSS
okay without having to get in and
creating custom animations and all that
we can just import the library and we
can use it we can also use JavaScript
and also jQuery to to implement events
and things like that and make it a
little more a little more in depth in
terms of what we can do so this is the
animate dot CSS website there's not much
to it it's basically just a drop-down
with all the different effects that it
offers and if we click this button it's
going to animate the header here that's
the bounce effect we have the pulse
we have shake what else we have
we have fading in and out exits so let's
say we want to fade out down let's see
we also have flipping so there's all
types of animations that we can use and
it's as simple as just adding a class to
change the animation alright so what
we'll do is we're going to create a
sandbox to just take a look at some of
the animations and how they work we're
also going to implement a little bit of
jQuery and JavaScript to control the
animations okay because by default
they're just going to run when they when
you enter the page but you can create
events to fire them off when you want as
well all right so that's we're going to
get into guys hopefully you enjoy this
and hopefully you can use this in future
projects that's the point of these
videos is to give you guys you know all
the tools I can to help you build
websites UI's applications and then use
this stuff later on so that's it let's
go ahead and get into it so if you guys
really like my videos and you learn a
lot from them and maybe you have a
couple extra dollars to spare check out
my patreon page I'm working on creating
special content for patrons you also get
special deals on future courses and
there's even an email support here for
all YouTube videos and projects to learn
more visit patreon calm
traversée media alright guys so we're
going to get started here now I have an
empty folder called animated or animate
CSS sandbox and I have an index.html
file inside of it I'm using the atom
text editor and I'm using two plugins
one is Emmet which gives me the ability
to use shortcuts to create HTML tags and
classes and so on I'm also using atom
live server which I have running right
now and you'll see that that just allows
me to open it up on my local host on
port 3000 so let's go ahead and add some
HTML tags now since I'm using Emmet I
can do exclamation tab and it gives me a
basic HTML structure so let's change the
title here to animate dot CSS sandbox
and I'm going to be bringing in two
things so one is going to be bootstrap 4
so I'm going to say bootstrap for CDN
and we'll just get it from the official
bootstrap 4 website or an alpha 6 right
now but when it gets updated this link
should be updated too so let's just go
ahead and paste that in there and then
we're also going to need animate CSS
itself now if you want you can download
the the CSS file but I'm just going to
use the CDN so let's say animate CSS CDN
ok and this this CDN GA s comm site is
absolutely fantastic it gives you all
pretty much any library you can think of
any JavaScript library CSS file any
remote link that you can think of so I'm
just going to copy this link tag here
and paste it right under the bootstrap
CDN ok and then let's go ahead and save
that
and now you'll see that my local host
here has been updated you can see this
animate CSS sandbox in the title so
let's go ahead and start to build out
our UI now I could have just done this
beforehand but I do like to do you know
start from finish you guys can actually
see what I'm doing
and it also gives you some insight on
you know
some of the bootstrap for classes and so
on so when I teach something I like to
to include other technologies as well
even though that's not the main focus of
of the video all right so let's start
off by just creating a container did
with the class of container and in there
we're going to have a header okay so
we're going to have a header and in the
header we're going to have an h1 and I'm
just going to give that a class of
display - 4 which is a bootstrap for
heading class and let's just say animate
dot CSS sandbox and we'll save that all
right so that's what it should look like
so far now I'm going to add some classes
to the header all right so first of all
I want everything to be centered so
we'll say text enter I want to give it a
background so in bootstrap 4 we have
these background classes I'm going to
use BG primary ok if I save that gives
it a blue background I also want the
text to be white so it has a class of
text white and then let's add some
padding in bootstrap for we have these
spacing classes for instance I can say P
- 5 and that's going to give it some
padding all the way around all right so
that's our heading and then we're just
going to have two sections underneath
that so let's say section I'm going to
give it an ID of section section 1 and C
in here we're going to have an h1 and
we're just going to say section 1 in
there okay and then we're going to do a
paragraph now I just want a bunch of
sample text here so what I'm going to do
is say lorem 40 tab and that's going to
give me 40 words of dummy text okay so
let's go ahead and save that okay that's
what it should look like now I'm going
to add some classes to the section as
well to make it look a little better so
let's give it a class of VG - faded
which will give it a grey background you
can see the gray background is now grey
I want some padding so I'm going to say
p5
just like we did with the header and
some margin on the top and bottom so
that's going to be my - and let's do
three okay there we go
now I just want one more section so I'm
going to copy the entire section tag
just space these out and then this is
going to have an ID of section two and
I'm just going to change the text to
section two
all right so that's that's what we're
going to work with this is our UI so now
let's start to work with animate CSS now
if we go to the documentation which is
the github page and let's see we've
already brought it in these are all the
different animations that are available
and for the usage what we want to do is
we want to add whatever we want to
animate so let's start off with the
header we're going to animate the head
our we need to give it a class of
animated okay and we also need to give
it a class of whatever the animation we
want in this case they're using bounce
but we can choose from any of these what
I want to choose is slide where as it
slide in down because I want this header
to slide in from the top I wanted to
slide and down so let's go to our header
now we already have some classes that
are the bootstrap classes so we're just
going to add on to that I'll say
animated and let's say slide in down and
save and now when we reload you'll see
that it slides in from the top going
down okay so now let's do these sections
I want this one to slide in from the
left and this one to slide in from the
right so for the section let's add a
class of animated and let's do slide in
slow slide in left what hon
oh yeah hurry up come here come here
say hi to everybody
hi-c say hi old buddy this is my lovely
daughter
alright copes yes don't forget you stuff
and that's our friend Jalen maybe
alright so back to business so like I
said we want this section to come in
from the left so we have class animated
slide in left would it be sliding and
left our slide and right let's go ahead
and save that yeah there we go so it's
going to slide in from the left and then
this last one section two we're going to
give that a class of animated and let's
do slide in right okay save and there we
go so the top one comes in from the
bottom these ones come in from the left
and right now we can actually mess with
some of the properties here if we go to
the documentation and we look this is it
even here right here so if we go in our
CSS we specify the element and we can
control the duration the delay and the
iteration count so remember we have
section an idea of section one and an
idea of section two so what we'll do is
go into our head and put some style tags
in okay and let's see we're going to do
animation oops
first of all we need to specify section
one and we'll say animation delay and
let's set that to three s so three
seconds alright and then we'll save that
notice that section one is going to sit
there for three seconds and then come in
okay not only that but we can also
control the duration so let's set that
to five s are five seconds delays three
seconds and then it takes five seconds
to come in so you can slow it down you
can speed it up and then we also have
animation iteration count all right so
let's set that to three and then we're
just going to change the delay back and
change the delay to zero the duration to
one which I think is the default so
let's save it so comes in once twice
three times we can also set it to
infinite and now it'll just keep
happening okay but I'm actually going to
comment out the duration and the
iteration connection I won't comment it
out I'll just set it to the default so
one second and then the count will set
to one all right
and actually I'm going to set the delay
to one second and then what I'll do is
set the section to say section two and
we'll set the animation delay to two
seconds that way one will go and then
the second one will go so let's save
there we go one into alright cool so now
what I want to do is I want to look at
using javascript and jQuery with animate
CSS because right now this stuff is just
going to happen when the page loads but
you can actually make it so that you
know you can dynamically add these
classes these animation classes to make
these things happen whenever you want so
let's go into section two right under
the paragraph and we're going to create
a button so it's a button I'll give it a
class of BTN and BTN primary
we'll say animate and let's go down to
right above our body now we're going to
need jQuery so I'm going to search for
jQuery CDN j/s okay we're just going to
grab jQuery Jaso I'll say copy script
tag and we'll paste that in and then we
need to create our own script tags and
this is where we'll write our JavaScript
now since we're using jQuery let's go
ahead and say function and we're going
to put everything in here so I'm going
to create a custom function called
animate okay and then that's going to
take in two things an element and some
take in the actual animation effect okay
and then all we need to do is to add the
class and then remove the class a second
later so let's say whatever the element
is add class and we're going to add the
class of animate okay remember when you
want to animate something you need to
have that class it's actually animated
and then I also want the class of
whatever's passed in for instance bounce
or fade or whatever it may be now this
is a variable so we're going to have to
just concatenate that in like that so
that'll add the class then we want to
just set a timeout I'm just going to
create a variable called weight and set
it to set timeout okay so set timeout
which takes in a function and then
second parameter will be the time which
is going to be 1,000 because that's
1,000 milliseconds or one second and
inside here we want to remove the class
so say element dot remove class
and we want to remove animated and
whatever the custom animation class and
that's it so now what we'll do is create
a click event for our button ok so let's
see we're going to grab did I give it an
ID
no I didn't so the button I'm going to
give an ID of animate BTN so let's grab
onto that and the made BTN and we're
going to say dot click so when someone
clicks it it's going to run a function
and all we want to do is call the
animate and we need to first of all
figure out what we're going to animate
we're going to do the h1 and the
paragraph in section 2 so I'm going to
add an ID here we'll say annum head and
then for the paragraph will say ID annum
body ok and then that's going to take in
the element K it's going to take an
element so that's going to be the ID of
annum head and then the type of
animation we want which I'm going to do
bounce alright so we also want to just
return false at the end of this and
let's try it so we'll let that go on and
then we hit the button nothing's
happening let's see why bounce is not
defined that's because this should be in
quotes let's try that hit it and there
we go so now every time we click it it's
going to bounce so let's also do the the
body remember the power graph we gave
that an idea of an embody so for that
let's do let's see so we have all these
to choose from
let's do let's do rubberband and let
that load sorry about that let me shut
this damn thing off okay so now if I
click the button you'll see the
paragraph gets the rubber band effect
cool so last thing I want to do is I'm
going to add another button and I want
to be able for I want this this header
to go back up because when it loads it
comes down I want to an event to make it
go back up so let's just copy this
button and we'll call this one animate
button to say animate - and then I'll
just copy this so animate button - and
see we only need one of these animations
we're going to grab the header and we're
going to apply the slide out up okay
want it to slide out and up now if I do
that it's going to work okay
but it doesn't it's not going to stay up
there it's just the event it's not going
to actually stay up if we wanted it to
stay up we could just add in some custom
JavaScript here let's do a set timeout
and this takes in a function and we're
going to say we want this to go one
second okay and then in here what we'll
do is we'll grab the header and we're
just going to set we're going to say
what I do CSS and we'll set visibility
and let's set that to whoops let's set
that to hidden now you want to do the
set timeout because if you don't it's
just going to disappear right away it's
not going to even do the effect so it's
save and then as soon as I click animate
- it's going to go up a second later
visibility gets changed to hidden and it
stays
okay so I don't know if that's useful or
not but it just gives you an idea of
some of the things that you can do you
know when I do videos like this it's not
to you know it's not for you to build
this exact thing and use this exact
thing it's to just show you how to do
this so that you can think of and
brainstorm your own projects and use
these tools okay so hopefully I think
most you guys understand that it's not
always about the actual project
especially if I call it sandbox that
basically means it's just it's just that
it's a sandbox to learn stuff it's not
an actual project okay although we do do
have actual projects as well so
hopefully you guys like this I think
animate CSS is pretty cool you know it's
a nice easy way to add some animation
effects to your your website or your
application so that's it guys please
subscribe please leave a like if you
liked it and I will see you in the next
