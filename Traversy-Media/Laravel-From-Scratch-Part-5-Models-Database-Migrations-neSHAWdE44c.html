going to start to get interesting
because we're going to start to work
with the database and we're going to
create a model a post model we're going
to create a post database migration and
so on so let's go to PHP myadmin now if
you are if you're using xampp PHP
myadmin is automatically included unless
you chose not to install it but
hopefully you did if you aren't using
xampp and you're using a native lamp
stack just go ahead and install it it's
not that difficult especially if you're
on a Linux distribution so let's go
ahead and create a database I'm just
going to call this LS app and then
that's really all we have to do okay
we're not going to create tables through
here or have to do any of that because
we have migrations so let's go back to
visual studio code and I'm going to open
up the terminal and hopefully you guys
like this style here I think I'm
actually going to really start using
this in my videos this like how this
terminal is integrated so easily and
let's see we're going to first create a
controller okay we've already done that
so we know that we do PHP oops what the
hell so PHP artisan and we're going to
do make controller and let's say post
controller alright so it was created
let's look in our app folder HTTP
controllers and let's refresh and there
it is post controller alright now we
also want to create a model so to do
that just like with controllers we can
say PHP artisan make model and you want
to use the singular version of it okay
so you want to do stu post now I also
want to create a migration because we
want to create a table for it for our
posts so to do that we just add - M
all right so let's run that and now
you'll see that right here created a
post dot PHP this is our model and you
can see it extends model and if we look
in the database folder and migrations
you'll see a create post table dot PHP
since we added the dash M it went ahead
and created that so let's take a look at
this this is this is what a migration
looks like so we have a class a
descriptive class extends migration and
then we have an up-and-down function so
when we run DB migrate it's going to go
ahead and run this and as it is it's
going to create a post table it's going
to create an ID field which will it'll
it will make it a primary key and then
it's going to add to timestamp columns
one will be created at one will be
updated at and those will get
automatically filled when we insert data
through our application now you probably
want to add more fields so what we would
do is come over here and say table and
let's see what we want we want a title
right so let's do table string we're
using MySQL so a string is going to be a
varchar' all right so say string and we
want to call it title ok so that'll
actually create a title column we also
want a body and I want this to be a
medium text field which is longer than a
string so let's do medium text and
that'll be body all right and then
further down that's going to happen if
we roll back the migration so if we roll
it back we just want to drop the entire
post table all right so we're going to
leave this for now later on we're going
to add a user ID to the post when we
implement authentication but I'm not
going to do that just yet so let's save
this and then if you look over here in
migrations there's also this create
users table and laravel includes this
automatically ok so that we can easily
implement authentication so users will
have an ID a name an email that will
have to be unique a password and some
time stamps and this remember token
value all right it'll also create a
password reset table
now there's a few things we need to do
before we run the migration and create
our tables we need to first go to the
dot env file and input our database
information so I'm using a database
called LS app and my user name is going
to be root and my password is going to
be my root user password for my database
alright so make sure yours matches yours
and let's go ahead and save that and
then there's one more thing we have to
do before running the migration I'm not
sure exactly sure why but since we have
a string in here we're going to get an
error that says something about maximum
length and to fix that we need to go to
and it's possible that you won't have
this issue depending on what version
you're using but I would I kept getting
it so I'm going to go to I forget where
as a continuity some providers providers
and then app service provider and what
we want to do is bring in something up
here we want to use illuminate which is
basically just laravel slash support
slash façades slash schema ok so we
want to bring in this schema library and
then in this boot function here we're
just going to say schema double colon
and then default string length and we're
going to set that to 191 alright so if
if we don't include this here we're
going to get some strange error when we
run the migration so let's save that and
then we should be all set so let's go
let's open the terminal back up whoops
ok and now what we're going to do is run
PHP artisan migrate and now if we go to
our database you'll see that there's a
few tables here those users
there's password resets those are the
two from the two migrations that laravel
includes then there's a table called
migrations which actually key
track of our migrations and then the
post stable which we created so if we
click on that and go to structure you'll
see there's an ID primary key it's set
to auto increment automatically there's
a title a body and then two timestamps
all right so our table is created and
it's ready to to take some data now I
want to have some initial data to work
with so you could go ahead and go to
insert and you can do it through here I
don't want to do that I actually want to
use tinker which is a tool that we can
use to insert data select data and all
of that so let's go back to our terminal
here I'm just going to make this bigger
and let's clear this out so to use
tinker all we have to do is do PHP
artisan tinker and you'll see that we
get this these brackets right here and
that lets us know that we're in this
we're in the tinker program so from here
we can you can interact with the
database with eloquent which is an ORM
that makes it really easy to do things
so what we can do is we can bring in the
model so let's say we're going to do so
to access the model we can do app slash
and then the model name so we called it
Post so we can call functions with this
for instance account alright and it
tells us we have 0 posts in the post
table and the post model so what we'll
do is set a variable we're going to say
variable post and we'll set that to new
and then app back slash make sure you do
a back slash not a forward slash and
then we can do post just like that and
that'll create a new instance now that
instance is basically being held in
memory so we can add fields to it we can
say post can use that variable and we
can add a title so we'll say post title
we'll just call it post one alright and
then we can press ENTER and we can add
another another field let's do post
body and we'll set that to we'll just
say this is the post body enter so it
has a title in a body now we can say
that if we want so to do that we'll just
do post save and we get true so now if
we go back over to PHP myadmin
and go to our post table there it is as
an ID title body and the creative at and
updated that gets put in automatically
so let's create one more so we'll do
post equals actually yeah let's do post
equals new app slash post and then we'll
do post title equals close to and then
post body equals this is post two and
then we'll do post save and there we go
now we should have two records in our
database all right so now we have some
data to actually work with now in order
to add crud functionality for our posts
we need to have a bunch of functions in
our controller and we need a bunch of
routes all right now let's open up the
control I'm just going to get out of the
terminal for now whoops we shouldn't
need it for a while and let's look at
the post controller so we're going to
need a lot of different functions here
we're going to need an index okay so the
index is going to be basically the
listings of the listing of all the posts
we're going to need and I'm just putting
this in here for now you don't have to
do this we're going to need a create
function which is going to represent the
form okay so if we go to post slash
create it should be the create form and
then it's going to submit to a function
called store ok that's going to be the
function that takes care of actually
submitting it to the model to the
database we're also going to need edit
which is going to be the Edit form just
like creatives for the ad
and then that submits to a function
called update which will take care of
actually updating it and then finally we
want a destroy which is going to take
care of deleting it and actually there's
one more which is show and that's going
to take care of showing a single post
okay so these are the main these are
actually resource functions or resource
methods now what we could have done
which I should probably should have done
is when we created our controller just
clear this out oh we got to escape this
I think we can do quit okay so what we
should have done is PHP artisan actually
we still you can still do it let's just
delete the controller so I'm actually
going to delete the post controller and
recreate it alright so let's do PHP
artisan make controller and then we're
going to say - - resource up we didn't
name it make controller posts controller
resource and now if we go and look at
the controller to get rid of this
terminal you'll see that it has all of
those functions that I just showed you
okay and certain ones have certain
parameters so index create those don't
need any parameters store since we're
going to we're going to submit to this
from a form and we need to grab the
variables from the form that's going to
take in a request object all right show
is going to take in an ID because we
need to know which I do of the of which
posts we want to show and then edit is
going to take an ID for the same reason
because the Edit form needs to have you
know we need to know which post to show
in the form update will take in requests
and ID because we're submitting the form
to it and we need to know which one to
update and then destroy has an ID so we
know which one to update so if you're if
your handwriting needs and you didn't
want to delete your controller and
create a new one with resource just go
ahead and
add those functions with those
parameters all right but it's fine if
you just delete it and create it again
all right so now we need routes to all
of these so if we go to our routes file
it's going to be kind of a pain in the
ass to actually do to write out every
single route so there's actually a
shortcut we can take which is to use
route resource and I don't know if I
showed you this before but if we go back
to the terminal clear that out you're
not supposed to see that if we clear the
terminal we can actually run a command
an artisan command to show us what
routes we have in our application so we
can do that with route route list and it
shows all the routes so we have slash
for the home page which is a get request
shows us the controller method it goes
to about services and even the API user
we created which is just a function or
closure inside the the route now we'll
go back to let's close this up and go
back to our routes and we're saying
route resource all right and then in
here what we want to pass in is posts
and we want to map it to a controller so
posts controller and then it's going to
actually create all the routes we need
for those functions that we created so
let's save this and we'll go back to our
terminal clear this up and let's again
do route list and look at that it
created all that we need so we have C so
posts get a get request to post is going
to load the index you can see it
actually has a name as well it's going
to load the index function if we make a
post request - I'm sorry if we make a
get request to post create it's going to
load up the create function if we make a
get request to post edit down here along
with the ID it's going to call the Edit
function if we submit a form and make a
post request to posts it'll call the
store if we make a put or a patch
request to post slash ID
that's going to call update and if we
make a delete request to post slash ID
that will call the destroy so it
connected all of our routes to those
functions that were created all right
hopefully that makes sense that it's not
too confusing
all right so in the next video what
we'll do is in our controller we're
going to bring the model in so that we
can interact with it we want to fetch
all of our posts in the index function
and then pass it to a view that we're
going to create for to view our posts
all right we're going to do the same for
create for edit and then we'll move on
to creating our forms and submitting
them to store we'll submit the edit form
to update and so on alright so thanks
for watching guys and I will see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
