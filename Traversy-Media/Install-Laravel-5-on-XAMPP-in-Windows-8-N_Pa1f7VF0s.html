I'm gonna show you how to install
laravel 5 on to windows 8 machine that's
running xampp or zamp xampp is in a
local Apache server that comes with PHP
MySQL Perl some other things and it's
it's it's a really nice environment to
do your PHP development in if you want
to do it locally alright so I already
have it installed if you need help
installing it I do have a video on how
to install it it is old but the process
is still the exact same so it's still
relevant so check that out if you want
to install xampp alright so what we're
gonna do is take a look at the
documentation for laravel and gives you
some steps to install you can see we
need version PHP version 5 59 or higher
you also need these PHP extensions and
if you're using xampp then you shouldn't
have any issues these should already be
enabled alright now we'll go down to the
installation it's telling us we need to
use composer which is a dependency
manager that laravel uses alright so if
you don't have composer then you need to
install that first alright so if we go
to get composer org there's a lot of
information here with Windows there is
an installer
that you can use I've actually never
used it I've always installed it
manually so that's what I'm gonna show
you how to do if we go down here you can
see you can install it using curl or if
you can just use PHP is what we're gonna
do is we're gonna copy this right here
and then I'm gonna go to my xampp
control panel and click shell it's gonna
open up right in the xampp directory
which is my c drive and what i want to
do is go to the PHP folder
that is in exam alright and then I'm
going to go ahead and paste that in and
run it
all right so you can see it says
composure successfully installed and it
created this composure dot far too P har
file and that's right in our PHP
directory okay so if we go back one
let's go to C Drive xampp and I run
composer we're gonna get an unrecognized
ever that's because it's not available
from everywhere and we need it to be so
what we need to do is I'm going to go to
that PHP folder so right in the xampp
folder and then PHP and we're going to
create a new file and we're going to
call it composer dot bat dat alright and
I'm not going to open it directly from
here I'm actually going to open notepad
and you want to run it as an
administrator
all right and then I'm just going to
navigate to that file go to open and we
want C Drive xampp
PHP and then we'll go down here and
select all files and we want to open
composer dot bat
all right so I don't know what that is
but let's get rid of that and I have
some text I'm going to paste in here
oops that's not it okay so that's what
we want to put in here
alright so copy that exactly okay make
sure all the characters are the same and
then we're going to just go ahead and
save that and close it up and now let's
see if we can run composer we might have
to restart the shell nope so you can see
we have all these commands now ok so
that's just telling us what we can do
with composer so now you can run that
anywhere and now we can go back to the
laravel site and grab this command right
here and we'll go ahead and paste that
in
all right now if you look at this you
want to take note of this path right
here you can see mine is in my users
that my username app data roaming and
then composer alright we're going to
need to know that path right there so
that we can set a global variable so
that we can access laravel from anywhere
alright so now that we have that all set
let's create our environmental path all
right so we're going to just there's a
few ways to get to it but if you just go
to this PC or my computer depending on
which versions of which version of
Windows you have you go to properties
and then advanced system settings and
then you'll have this environmental
variables button and we want to edit the
path variable okay so if we click Edit
now what you have here is probably
different than what I have but no matter
what you have just put a semicolon at
the very end and then we'll just
continue on here okay so we want C Drive
and it's gonna be users slash in my case
it's Brad but yours will be whatever
username you have alright and then we're
gonna do app data
let's see AppData slash roaming slash
what is a composer and then slash vendor
slash bin alright and then a semicolon
to end with alright so that's gonna
point to composer so let's say okay okay
and it's not gonna work now you have
actually have to restart your machine
all right so I'm gonna virtual machine
so I'm gonna just go ahead and restart
it
I shall do it down here
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and restart
this and I'll be right back all right
guys I'm back and went ahead and
restarted my computer now I'm gonna go
back into the shell and what you want to
do now is go to wherever you want to
create your project and in our case we
need to go to our web server folder
which is htdocs' okay so I'm going to CD
htdocs and we're gonna run laravel new
and then whatever you want to call the
application I'm gonna call it gold
tracker
alright that's going to go ahead and
create the application and this can
sometimes take about three minutes or so
there's a lot of folders and files that
it has to create alright so I'll go
ahead and pause it and I'll be right
back
alright so that went ahead and finished
now if I go ahead and open up that
folder
I want htdocs gold tracker and you can
see that it created all these folders
and files for us all right if I go up
and open the browser and go to we want
to go to localhost / goal tracker and
you'll notice that we just have a
listing of files and folders which
definitely is not what we want that's
because when you install laravel you
have to go to the public folder okay
that's the folder that the browser needs
to access and the browser needs to go to
access the application alright and this
is the standard welcome page for a new
Allen a new laravel app so even if you
want a live server you would be at your
domain whatever dot-com / public and
with that's not where we want to be so
what we can do is we're using Apache so
we can set up a virtual host and point
it to this directory okay so I'm going
to show you how to do that we're gonna
go into the xampp folder and then into
apache and then conf extra and you want
to open httpd - v host con
okay so we're gonna go ahead and just
let's see I'm gonna open it with sublime
text and then you want to go down to the
bottom and you can see these virtual
host tags first thing you want to do is
uncomment this right here okay so get
rid of these two number sides all right
and then let's copy one of these blocks
and we want to uncomment the start and
the end tag and then all we need is the
document root so to get rid of that and
the server name and we can get rid of
the rest of these all right and then you
want to uncomment these okay and the
document root is going to be the public
folder so we want htdocs slash goal
tracker slash public and then we're
going to change the server name to goal
tracker
and that's it okay so we'll save that
now there's one more thing that we need
to do before we can access it and that
is we need to edit the hosts file okay
your Windows host file I'm sure a lot of
you know what that is if not we need to
go now we can need to open up notepad
first actually we want to open notepad
as administrator
all right so we'll go to oh i'm not new
we want to go to open and we're gonna go
to our C Drive and then windows and then
you want to go to system 32 and then
drivers and then et Cie okay down here
we're going to choose to see all files
and you want to open hosts all right and
then down here you'll see you should
have this address with localhost all
right I'm going to do is copy this and
going to uncomment and then I'm going to
change this to goal tracker or whatever
you called your app look alright and
then we'll save that and then before it
can take effect we need to restart
apache so i'm gonna say stop
I'll start
all right so now if we go back to our
browser and just go to http gold tracker
it brings us to our lair of a lab all
right and you would do the same thing if
you were on a live Apache server alright
so that's how you can install arival 5
on to xampp in a Windows 8 machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
