our code ignitor series and in the last
video we created a login and
registration system and we added some
access control what I want to do in this
video is first add some pagination to
our blog post because right now even if
we had 100 posts they'd all be on this
one page and I want to be able to switch
between you know maybe 10 per page or 20
per page and so on so that's that's a
little bit of work and then we're also
going to implement some access control
with the categories basically when a
user is logged in and they create a
category I want I want in the table in
the categories table to have that users
ID and then we want that user to be able
to delete their own categories okay only
their own nobody else's right now we
don't have any delete functionality for
the categories alright so we're going to
go do those things in this video so
first thing I'm going to do is actually
let's look up the documentation for the
pagination all right so this kind of
tells us what we need to do in a
nutshell we need to load the pagination
library then we need to add a bunch of
config values okay the base URL the
total rows that that are in your
database total posts and then the amount
per page you want then initialize it and
then add to create links into the view
alright so let's go ahead and load the
library you could do this but I'm just
going to add it to the auto loader so
config auto load and then down to
libraries and we're just going to add in
here pagination and we'll save and close
that up alright so now let's go to the
controller for the post and we're going
to be working in this index function
here alright so let's take a look let's
grab the config here and the initialize
and we're going to put that at the top
of the index method
all right I don't know why it does that
it's weird so for the config let's
actually put a comment here and we'll
say pagination config and then this is
going to anit pagination so for the base
URL basically what we want for that is
going to be this right here localhost CI
blog / post / index okay that's going to
be the base and then when we go to so
let's say the next pagination page it's
going to be slash you know 2 or 3 or
whatever so that's that's going to be
the offset so what we're going to put
for the base URL is first the base URL
function which just gives us localhost /
CI blog and then we want to concatenate
on to that post / index / ok that's
going to be the base URL for the
pagination now the total rows is all the
rows in the database well in the post
table and we can't manually set this
because every time we add opposed or
delete a post this is going to change so
there's actually a function we can use
for this in the DB library so if we say
this DB and we can use a function called
count underscore all all right and then
that takes in one parameter which is the
table in our case it's going to be the
posts all right so that'll get up such a
big TV
that'll get all of the you know the
total rows now per page is how many we
want to show per page 20 is good maybe
10 but for this example I'm going to use
3 because I don't want to add 20 posts
so we'll use 3 for now and let's see
what else we also need to set the
segment that's going to be used for
pagination so this right here
and we're going to just put that in
there and we have to use real quotes
here so the UI segments basically goes
like this so we have our localhost CI
blog then this is going to be segment 1
this is segment 2 and then the
pagination number here is going to be 3
so 3 is correct we want to leave it like
that all right if you if you had for
instance admin / post / index / 3 then
it would be 4 ok all right so then what
we need to do is this index function we
need to pass in an offset and that
should be optional by default it's going
to be 0 all right
and then what we need to do is pass in a
couple things to our get post method
here because this is what you know gets
all the posts for us we need to set a
limit of the current page all right we
also need to pass in the offset now if
we open up the model the post model the
get post function takes a slug as the
first parameter which by default is
false but we can't ignore this so we
need to actually put that in as the
first value which will be false okay the
next one will be the config per page so
we'll grab that and then the last one
will be the offset ok and now we have to
go to the model and deal with those so
the slug whoops not that right here the
slug and then we have what did I call
this is going to be one second guys
okay so yeah this will be the limit so
limit and we'll set that by default to
false okay and then the offset will also
be false and then what we want to do is
check to see if there is a limit passed
in okay which right here
there is one okay it's the per page so
let's check for that will say if limit
and then we just want to add the limit
in the offset to our query and we can do
that by saying this DB limit which takes
in first of all the limit and then the
offset and it should be all we have to
do to the model so let's save that and
let's see that should do it let's um
let's go to the view now the post index
view and down at the bottom here we're
going to put in that create links this
right here alright so we'll put some PHP
tags paste that in and save now we're
going to have to add a couple posts for
this for us to you know use the
pagination so I'm just going to log in
and let's say create post and what do we
have for post we'll start we'll do blog
post three and for content we just
grabbed some dummy text
okay and let's see I guess we don't need
an image alright so something is already
wrong because this shouldn't be
happening oh we have it in the for each
that's why I'll fix that in a second
let's create another one let's say post
four submit alright so let's go back to
the view and take this out of the for
each loop and paste reload and now
you'll see at the bottom here so we have
the latest posts and then let's click -
and there's the other - all right so
it's working if we go back to one okay
so that's not working oh you know what
we have to fix something in the routes
because when we go to post /index if we
take a look at the route it's looking at
this okay
post / ñè and it's putting index in
here which is trying to load the view
post / view so all we have to do is
let's copy that and then we just want to
say post index should go to post index
and make sure you put it before this if
you put this under it's going to look at
this first it goes you know from top
down so it's save and reload and there
we go so 2 &amp;amp; 1
alright now I want to just style these a
little bit because they're tiny and you
know they're easy to miss so we want to
add a class to both of these or to all
of the pagination links so if we look at
the documentation there's a config
option for this see where is it there's
a whole bunch of configs
the hell is it all right here adding
attributes to the anchors so let's grab
that and let's go back to our post
controller and just add onto the config
here we want a class of pagination -
link okay and then back in the view I'm
just going to wrap this in a div and
we'll give it a class of pagination -
links all right save that and now let's
go to our CSS file which is in the
assets folder right here and then
style.css and see what we want to do
here let's first do pagination links and
I want to I want
I just want margin on the top and bottom
of 30 pixels so 30 pixels zero and then
let's see we'll do a dot pagination -
link so this will take care of each one
only the links though because you know
the one you're on is not a link see how
it's black I can't click on it so these
were going to say padding let's do 8
pixels top and bottom 13 pixels left and
right alright and then margin we're
going to do five pixels and then the
background we're going to do a light
gray and then just a light border as
well so one pixel light gray and solid
all right so let's save that and reload
why is that not working
clear the cash waving there we go all
right so that looks a little better now
the one that's not a link I also want to
have the same styling so that actually
has a strong tag around it so we can
latch on to that using a strong strong
attribute so we'll say a dot actually no
we want pagination links and then strong
okay and we're going to have that same
styling so let's go ahead and reload and
there we go we also have the arrows as
well so it looks pretty good I think
that's all set pagination is all set now
let's start with the categories so we're
going to go to PHP myadmin and go to the
categories table and we need to add a
user ID field so I'm going to say we'll
go to structure and say add one after ID
and click go from here we're going to
say user underscore ID and it's going to
be an integer we can go ahead and save
alright and let's say let's just add
user 1 for category 1 and user 2 for
category 2 all right now when the user
is logged in such as we are we should
see an X a delete X next to our
categories that we own all right I'm
pretty sure we're logged in as user 1
right now
see that's the dev users yeah so one is
Brad two is John Doe so let's go ahead
and let's say we're going to go to let
me close these out and then let's go to
our category view so go to categories
and then index and we want to see if the
current category item user ID matches
the logged in user now we did this in in
our post if we go to the post view and
view dot PHP
right here this is the logic that we
need so let's copy that and let's see
we're going to go back to index and go
right after the a tags still inside of
the Li and let's paste that in and then
we need to end that now it's search it's
it's matching the logged in user using
session user data to post user ID we
just want to change this to category ID
user ID alright so if it is the user
let's just test it out let's just say
delete and reload and - next to
technology we have delete ok because we
own that category so we need to make a
delete request we need to use a form
okay we actually need to do a post
request so what I'm going to do I guess
I'll just type it out so let's say form
and we're going to give this in action
and the method is going to be post and
inside the action it's going to be
categories / delete / and then we need
the category ID so let's say PHP echo
category ID okay then we'll end that
and then inside the forum whoops so
inside the forum we're going to have
input and it's going to have the type of
submit and see we don't need a name
let's put a class we're going to give it
a class of BTN - link and also text -
danger okay that will make it read and
then for the value let's just set some
brackets with an X okay so that will
just be the delete so let's go ahead and
save that all right now I don't want it
down here it's down here because it's
displayed as a block we want it to be
displayed as inline so let's go to our
style sheet and from here actually let's
give it a class to work with and it's
going to be on the form so on the form
I'm going to give that a class of cat -
delete okay and then over here we'll say
dot cat delete and let's go ahead and
just display that inline and there we go
so now we have the button now we need to
take care of when we submit it it's
going to go to categories delete and
then the ID so let's go ahead and go to
the controller categories controller and
I'm going to copy what we have in the
post controller for delete okay we'll
grab that and paste it in the categories
it's going to take in the ID it's going
to make sure we're logged in and then
we're going to call the category model
and say delete underscore category
passing the ID or also have a flash
message here category deleted
and then we're going to redirect to the
categories page alright let's go ahead
and and set this flash message so we'll
go to views templates and then header
and we just need to add this now someone
mention that this is not very DIY but
the ROI or dry don't repeat yourself
because we did quite a bit and I might
fix this up later we'll just set out
loop and we can go through and you know
check for the session for the flash
message and then spit it out but I'm
just going to leave it for now so let's
change this to category underscore
deleted and then we'll set this category
deleted alright so we'll save that close
it up now when we when we do the delete
we're calling a category model of delete
category so we need to create that so
let's go to the category model and we
can actually copy what we have in the
post model for delete or is it right
here delete posts
and we'll go back to the category model
and paste that in and this is going to
be delete category and we don't need any
of this crap all we need is that okay so
we're ID equals the ID that's passed in
and then it's going to be the categories
table and that should do it so let's
save it and let's go back click the X
and your category has been deleted so if
we go and create a category let's say I
don't know food and submit all right so
we should see oh you know what we
haven't done the functionality to
actually add our user ID when we when we
create it so let's go to controllers and
I'm going to go to the post controller
and grab the actually no we don't need
to do that let's go to categories and we
want this create all you know what we
don't even have to do it here we need to
do it in the model so category model
where we do our insert which is this
right here create category we just want
to add a user ID
okay so user ID and that's going to be
the session variable which holds our
user ID so this session user data and we
want the user ID all right so let's save
that and now when we create a category
it should add the user okay so let's say
technology and submit and now we have
the red X okay food actually doesn't
have a user ID if we check it out see
it's just zero so I'll just change that
to one which is our user and if we
reload now we have the X there as well
alright so hopefully you guys enjoyed
this I have to figure out what I'm going
to do
next I'm thinking maybe maybe change it
around to actually have an administrator
area that we could log into right now or
maybe a photo gallery I'm not really
sure yet so if you guys have any ideas
let me know and that's it thanks for
