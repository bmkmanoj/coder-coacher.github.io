we're going to be looking at a lot of
the different features of es6 or es2015
and i'm just going to use the latest
version of Chrome because most of the
features are implemented in Chrome but
if you're going to build a production
application at this time I would suggest
using some kind of compiler or
transpiler and what that does is it'll
take your es6 code and then compile it
into es5 so that people you know users
with just about any browser will be able
to use your application without issues
so what I'm going to do first before we
get into the syntax and all that I'm
going to show you how to set up a
project and use Babel okay Babel is a
JavaScript compiler and if we go to the
Babel website and then go to try it out
there's actually so let me get rid of
this there's an editor here where you
can type you can you can put in es6 code
and it'll compile it to es5 and show you
over this side so what we'll do is let's
use let because that's not available in
es5
and we're going to say let create a
variable called test and we'll set it to
hello all right now on this side you can
see that it's using var because this is
es5 and let isn't available we're also
setting it into strict mode okay which
you'll see a lot of when you're using
transpilers all right so let's do
something a little more complicated
let's create a class so it will say
class user and on this side you can see
that this is a lot more complicated
we're using this class call check method
we're passing in an instance in the
constructor and so on now if we add a
function let's say test okay so this is
now a method of the user class and you
can see over here it added a bunch more
code as well much much more complicated
than what we have here all right so
that's what Babel does now before we go
on with with that I just want to take a
look at the compatibility chart at the
kanga
webpage so on this side on the left you
can see all the different features of
es6 areas 2015 and up here you can see
the different browsers okay so if you
look at idea 11 it's read down the whole
column okay so it's only 15% compatible
with es6 alright so this is the these
are the reasons you might want to use
something like babel if we look over
here at the latest versions of Firefox
and Chrome we're up to 93% and then 98%
for Chrome 52 all right you can see it's
all green so when you're doing your
testing or your development I think it's
fine to use something just like the
latest version of Chrome all right now
if you're a production then you probably
want to use something like babel and you
can see over here we have about 74%
compatibility okay so most of the
features are implemented and can be used
with babel alright so before we get
started and show you how to set up babel
you're going to need nodejs installed
just go to node.js or download it
install it I do have a video on how to
install it in Windows as well as Linux
I'm also going to be using a tool called
git bash for Windows which is just a
command line tool with some extra bells
and whistles if you want that you can go
to get - SCM comm and go ahead and
download that but of course you could
use your Windows command line or your
terminal for Linux or Mac or whatever it
is that you use alright so let's go back
to the babel website and i'm going to go
to setup and you can see there's a lot
of different tools that you can use to
implement babel alright we're going to
click on this CLI right here the command
line interface tool and it has some
steps for us but it does leave a couple
things out so what I'm going to do is
just go through this and show you how to
get this set up so first thing I'm going
to do is go into my C Drive and then I
have a folder called projects I'm going
to create a folder there called es6
and I'm going to open my command-line
tool up here if you installed git bash
you should have this this option here to
just open it right inside that folder
all right and of course you can use your
standard Windows command line if you
want now what we're going to do is we
need to create a package.json file which
is a manifest file if you've had any
experience with nodejs you probably know
what that is now we could create it
manually but we can also create it by
saying NPM in it
alright that's we're just going to ask
us some questions the the application
name the version I'm just going to click
enter through the whole thing alright so
that should have created that file for
us now I'm going to open up my text
editor I'm using atom which is really
nice
I used two blaim text for a long time I
just recently started using atom because
it has a really nice typescript plug-in
which I was using with angular 2 and I
don't know just I really like it it's
really simple but it also has a lot of
nice features so I'm going to open up an
ADD project folder add es6 and you can
see we have the package JSON file
alright which has all the stuff that we
just added so we want to install a
couple things for dependencies okay one
we want babel CLI and we also want the
babel preset for es2015 alright so what
we can do is go to our command line and
let's say NPM well actually going to get
out of that first so NPM install babel
CLI and also babel preset 2015 all right
and then i'm also going to add in the
end here save dev and that will add it
to our package JSON file as development
dependencies alright so let's go ahead
and run that what's this what'd I do
wrong oh I pushed put 2015 ES 25
all right so that should be good let's
take a look okay so now we have if we
reload the package.json file you can see
in dev dependencies we have both of
those both modules okay so the next
thing we want to do is we want to create
where is it we want to create this file
here dot babel RC and that's where we
can specify the preset okay so let's go
say new file and we're going to call
this dot babel RC alright and in there
we're going to just actually yeah I'll
just do this we're just going to open
some curly braces and say presets okay
that'll be an array and all we need in
here is es2015 okay we'll save that
close it up and what we're going to do
is create a folder called SRC or source
and in there we're going to create soaps
I'm going to create a new file called
main dot J s alright this is the source
file this is where we can write our es6
code alright so what we want to do is
create another folder and that's we can
call this dist or you can call it
whatever you like but I'm going to call
it dist and this is where the the actual
application will be along with the the
compiled es5 code alright so once we
write our es6 if we wanted to get
compiled we need a way to do that so I'm
going to go to package Jason and we're
going to add to our scripts here we can
actually get rid of this
okay so scripts and we're going to say
build
say Babel SRC a daddy flag and then the
folder that we want this to be compiled
to which in our case is dist okay now
I'm going to add another scripts here
and this one will be for to run the
preset alright so again we're going to
say build that's going to be the command
that will run and then it's going to run
Babel say presets es2015 source D and
then the folder we want to compile to
compile to which is dist all right so
let's save that and now we'll go to our
main J assets in the source file and
let's just put some es6 in here we'll
just create a variable called test and
we'll set that to hello okay so let's
save that and now we're going to go back
to our command line and all we have to
do to compile now is run npm run build
ok and you can see here what it did is
took the main J's in the source folder
compiled it into main J s in the dist
folder so let's take a look at that and
there it is we have our es 5 version of
our code alright so let's go back and
create a class ok so this is strictly
es6 code we'll create a class called
user and let's say we want a method
called register and just echo echo this
isn't PHP well console dot log
user registered okay save that let's go
ahead and run npm run build take a look
at the compiled file and there we go
so we now have our es5 code so that's
how you can write es6 and compile into
es5 using babel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
