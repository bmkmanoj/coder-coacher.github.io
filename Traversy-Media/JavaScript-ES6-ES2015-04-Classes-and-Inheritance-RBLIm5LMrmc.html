looking at es6 classes
alright so classes are now available in
plain old JavaScript we don't need
typescript or anything fancy like that
pretty easy to use if you've ever used
PHP it's very similar or something like
Java or some some other object-oriented
programming with classes so what we're
going to do is we're going to jump in
and I'm going to create a class called
user and in our class we're going to
need a constructor
now constructors are methods that will
run when your class is instantiated ok
when your object is created and they can
take in parameters okay so this user is
going to take in a user name it's going
to take in an email and it's going to
take a password alright and then what we
want to do is we want to take these
passed in values and assign them to
properties of the class we can do that
by saying this dot username setting it
to the username that's passed in okay we
want to do the same thing with email and
we want to do the same with password all
right so that's the constructor now we
can also create methods in our class a
method is just a function that belongs
to a class so let's say we have one
called register and all we're going to
do here is just do a console log we're
going to take the user's name so this
dot username and we're going to just
concatenate string is now registered
okay so we have a class we have some
properties and we have a method so let's
go ahead and use this class to do that
we're going to create a variable I'm
going to use let and let's call this
variable Bob it's going to represent a
user so we're going to say new user and
then we need to pass in some data one is
the user name one is the email and one
is the password which in real life would
be encrypted all right now if we save
that and load it up nothing's going to
happen because we just instantiate it we
just created the Bob object we're not
using it if we want to use it what we
could do is call the register method
okay so we'll say Bob dot
register and save that let's reload and
we get Bob is now registered all right
so you simply take the variable that you
use to instantiate the object and you
can call any method you want on it now
we can also have what's called a static
method all right so to do that we just
need to use the keyword static and let's
create a method called count users and
all we're going to do here is
console.log we'll just say there are 50
users all right now certain methods can
be used statically in some can't for
instance register you wouldn't want
static because you need to instantiate
an object in order to do it all right so
we need to create a user in order to
register user this however is going to
be the same no matter what it's just
going to echo out this there are 50
users so we can make this static and if
it's static you don't have to
instantiate it so let me just comment
these out and then all we need to do to
call the static method is say the name
of the
user and then say dot count users
alright so we'll save that we'll run it
and we get there are 50 users all right
so that's the the very basics of classes
and objects now we can also inherit or
extend classes so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create another class
called member and I want to extend the
user class so I'm going to say extends
user all right now this is also going to
have a constructor okay and it's going
to take in the same stuff that the user
takes in so I'm going to just copy that
alright and then it's also going to take
in another property called member
package all right now we need to set up
our properties and we could do this
again we could just take this and put it
down here but there is an easier way and
that is by using the super method okay
so if we stay super and then we pass in
username email password that's going to
do the same thing as if we were to do
this now we do have an extra one here
member package so we do have to assign
that so we'll say this dot package
equals member package all right and then
what we'll do is let's create a method
called get package
and what we'll do is consult log and
we'll get the username and let's
concatenate on to that and then in here
we should just be able to say this dot
package okay now to use this we'll go
outside of the class and let's create a
variable called Mike
and we'll set him to be a new member
all right now inside here we get a pass
in the usual the username the email the
password and the package will say
standard okay now we have this member
let's see if we can say Mike dot get
package save that reload and we get Mike
and subscribe to the standard package
alright so that's how you can inherit a
class now we can also call methods from
up here in the user class let's say
register so we'll change she'll just
comment that out it'll say Mike dot
register reload and we get Mike is now
registered alright so that's how classes
work and that's how inheritance works so
in the next video we're going to take a
look at template literals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
