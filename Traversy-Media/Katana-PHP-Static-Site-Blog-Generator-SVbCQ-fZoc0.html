we're going to take a look at a tool
called katana which is a PHP static
website and blog generator so you know
what a static website is it's basically
just you know single HTML pages uploaded
onto a server somewhere well what really
sucks about building static sites is
that you do a ton of repeating yourself
every single page needs to have the
doctype the head and body tags you need
all that header information and there's
nothing to generate it you just have to
basically copy and paste it into every
single page well katana is just that
it's a site generator so that you don't
have to do that stuff it actually uses
blade template templating which is the
same same engine that laravel uses and I
actually found this while doing research
for laravel projects from my course that
I'm creating and I thought it was cool I
thought you some of you guys could find
it useful if you have been watching my
videos for a while you know that I like
to kind of introduce new tools that I
find but there is a certain group of
people that just can't understand that
I'm not pushing anything on anybody I'm
not saying anything is better than than
anything I'm probably the most unbiased
program or web developer that you can
find yeah you guys see I use Windows I
use Linux I don't have a Mac or
otherwise I'd probably use that too I
like to dabble in all types of
technologies and systems that's that's
what I love to do so again I feel like I
need to kind of kind of do a disclaimer
before every videos saying that you know
I'm not saying you have to use this
don't don't write comments saying you
know why do I have to use this and if I
don't want to do this and whatever I
don't care just it's something to watch
that maybe some people will like and
find a use for that's it alright so
let's go ahead and get started so you
need a couple things before we can get
started you need to install composer
which is a dependency manager for PHP
basically it's kind of like NPM for
nodejs it allows us to install software
so get that installed you can go ahead
and download it I'm on Windows so I
would get the exe file here but of
course it's cross-platform
I'm also using xampp which gives me an
Apache server and PHP on
my local machine and this is also cross
cross-platform and then from my terminal
here a command line I'm using commander
which is which is a Windows it's
basically a better command line for
Windows feel free to use it again I'm
not saying it's better than what you use
but that's just what what I'm doing here
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
documentation here now to install it
again we're using composer and we just
need to run this command so I'm just
going to copy this and if you're using
xampp make sure you're in your htdocs
folder that's your your web root and
we're going to go ahead and paste that
in and just I don't want to name it that
I'm going to call it katana site alright
so that'll go ahead and it'll install
everything it'll set up all the files
and folders that we need ok while that's
going on let's go over here and see what
we have to do next ok so we need to go
into that directory and then when we
want to build out the file the static
files we do PHP katana build now I
couldn't find anywhere any kind of watch
command that will just constantly watch
the files and generate them when you
save them I don't know if that exists if
any of you guys know let me know in the
comments but as far as I can tell we
need to run this whenever we want to
compile which kind of sucks but you know
it'll be fine so let's CD into katana
site and let's see I'm going to add this
let's actually open this an atom so I
can do that with atom dot that'll just
bring it up in that directory alright
can see let's close e and close this out
and then this is what it created this is
what I gave us so everything that you'll
have to edit is going to be in this
content ok as far as the content there's
also a config dot PHP file let's go
ahead and open that up and from here you
want to put your base URL now what we're
going to do is we're going to set up a
virtual host because you'll see if I go
if I just go to localhost /
Kitana site that what I called it you'll
see that it's just going to show us the
directory listing and then what happens
is when we generate our site it's going
to get put into a folder called public
and that's what we need to point the
virtual host to in fact let's just go
ahead and compile it just to get that
folder alright so if we say PHP Kitana
build and over here you'll see it
created the public folder and it has all
the static assets okay it gives us it
basically gives us a sample website to
work with and we can go now go over here
and go to the public folder and you'll
see all the mark-up now the CSS isn't
there because it doesn't know where to
look we have to create a virtual host so
to do that see we're going to go to my
Apache folder with which if you're using
xampp it's going to be in your xampp
folder right here Apache and we need to
just go to cons and then extra and then
there's a file called HTTP Divi host
conf and if you've worked with laravel
you probably know too what this is we're
basically going to just point the domain
to this to this installation so let's go
ahead and open that I'll just open it
with sublime text and it looks like this
so we want to go down to the bottom
where you see these virtual hosts and
what I'll do is comment uncomment copy
this and you see the number sign here
this means that these are commented out
so these aren't even doing anything
right now but let's paste that in and
then remove these comments and then in
here all we need is the document root
and the server name so we can get rid of
this get rid of that and then uncomment
these alright and then what I want to do
is I want see xampp htdocs to go to
localhost as a server name alright and
then we're going to copy this paste it
in again and now we want to point to the
the directory of katana which is katana
site and then we want the public folder
ok that's where the static web site is
and then for the serve
name I'm going to change that to katana
site and we'll just do dot dev you can
put anything you want here alright so it
saved that now this isn't going to work
right away we need to put an entry into
our hosts file alright so you need to
open your host file as an administrator
so what we're going to do is open up
notepad as administrator so run as
administrator alright and then you need
to locate your host file now if you're
on Mac or Linux your host file should be
in your Etsy folder or your e TC folder
if you're on Windows then we want to
open and you want to go to your C Drive
and then windows and then system 32 and
then drivers and then at etc' okay now
we do not see anything here because
we're only seeing text documents so we
need to go to all files and now you'll
see your host file so by default you
should have something like this now what
we're going to do is just go to the
bottom and we're going to add in a
couple of things we're going to do
127.0.0.1 and that's our local host
that's our loopback address for this for
the machine that you're on and we're
just going to say local host here we're
going to add that entry and then we're
going to do that again and now we're
going to do katana site dot dev alright
so that should do it let's go ahead and
just save this and close that out and
now the last thing we have to do before
what's shouldn't do that before we get
started is we need to really start
Apache so if you're using xampp you can
just open the control panel and just
stop apache okay you may get a security
message just say yes once you do that
just start it back up again and now
everything should be okay so let's go to
our browser and let's go to http katana
site dot dev and there we go so there's
our static web site that we generated
with katana alright so there's this home
page you can see it has this little
showcase area we have the menu
the site name or the logo branding and
then we have a main area we have a
sidebar with links to the blog all right
so if we click on blog we actually have
some articles here that we can click on
and we can read the whole thing okay not
I mean it's not much for functionality
but it's just it's getting skinning
automatically generated for you through
some templates that we're going to use
all right and then the about page okay
very simple and then these two go
off-site all right so let's go ahead and
look in our full in our files here and
we can leave this as slash because now
our our domain is just katana site dev
if we had it in a subdirectory we could
just put the base URL here and then you
can also disable the blog as well so if
we were to say false and then we're
going to just going to have to run the
build command again and you'll see that
all those files in the public folder
just disappeared all those blog posts
now if I reload you'll see that the the
menu is gone all the blog links the the
link is still here we would have to
manually remove that but even if we go
to it and reload you'll see that there's
nothing here alright but I do want the
blog so I'm going to set that back to
true alright and then you can also
change the post per page for the blog by
default it's three let's go ahead and
change it to four post list view site
name I'm actually going to change this
let's let's just say katana site I guess
and then you can change the description
as well so let's save that and then
we'll just go and run the build command
again you see all the blog posts are
back and if we go over here and reload
the blog the listing has four per page
and there's even pagination you can see
we can go to previous posts and newer
posts now this is a straight static site
and just to show you what we'll do is
we'll take the public folder everything
that's in there and upload it on to my
Travis e-media web site in a subfolder
alright now I'm going to put it in
traversing media.com slash test so for
the base URL we're going to do tests
/ like that so that it knows where to
look for the assets and then we're going
to save it and recompile okay and then
I'm going to open up FileZilla you guys
don't have to do anything like this I'm
just showing you as an example and let
me just connect to sea-traversing media
and I have a test folder here that's
empty and what I'm going to do is just
bring over everything that's in the
public folder here it should upload
pretty quick alright and then let's go
back to the browser and now if I go to
travesti media.com slash test there it
is okay we have our blog posts are there
and it works exactly as if we were on
the localhost alright so this is this is
nice if maybe you don't have PHP
installed on your server but you want to
create your your websites quicker you
don't you want to use templates you know
it just can make and make things a
little quicker now I'm not going to
leave you with this just showing you how
to install it and use this boilerplate
I'm going to show you how we can
actually we're going to look at the
syntax and we're going to switch to
bootstrap and build a little site with
bootstrap enabled alright so let's go
ahead and close this up and then I'm
just going to delete everything I just
uploaded alright and let's see so we're
going to go over to the files here now
when we're developing we don't need to
pay attention to the public folder
that's just everything that gets
generated where we want to look is in
this content folder so each page we want
to create we're going to create a blade
template for so if we look at a boat
blade what happens here is we're going
to extend the base layout okay you see
how we get this extends includes dot
base and if you've ever used laravel
with blade templating this should look
very familiar it's the same exact thing
so we're extending the base template
which is in this includes folder and
it's this base dot blade so this is the
only place that we need to have the head
info and all that stuff and the PIA the
navigation everything is in this file we
don't have to keep repeating it in about
and then an index and blog it's just
extending it okay so we can only do we
need to change something in the head we
only do it in this one file alright and
then we also have dynamic content like
the page title you can see we're
yielding the page title and the
description so for instance if we want
to put a certain title for about all we
have to do is add the section for page
title all right so you can see the page
title is about if we look at index
well the page title for that we don't we
don't need to add but let's say blog ok
you can see if we look in in the
application here we go to about the hell
oh you know what I get to change that
config get rid of this test all right
and then I'll just recompile that all
right so you can see the page title is
dynamic alright so what we're going to
do is kind of wipe everything clean so
let's go to base blade and I'm going to
just get rid of everything here so we're
going to start from scratch
alright and by the way the sidebar is
also and include and you can see we're
looping through the blog posts that's
what you're seeing over here but we're
going to redo everything here just just
so you can kind of you know see how we
do it from scratch I hate when people do
videos like this and they just basically
show you how to set up the default
template and that's it
alright so let's go ahead and just put
in some basic HTML tags here alright
remember the title we can use we can use
a dynamic title we can use this site
name variable which will put whatever is
a site name and then let's do yield and
we want to yield page title okay so
that's basically a section that we can
fill from within our sub templates all
right and then for the title all that is
the title for the description we could
do that as well to add a meta tag here
alright so the name is going to be
description and then for the content we
just want to do the yield
page description that's Jesus I can't
type alright so we get the description
and now we want to link to our style
sheet that we want to use now I want to
use bootstrap and I'm actually going to
use a customized version from boots
watch which if you guys watch my videos
I use this all the time it's just
something really quick so let's grab
this Flatley I'll click download and
just grab this link right here and then
we'll put in a link here and paste that
in all right so we'll now use bootstrap
we also want to link to our CSS file
which if you look in assets and then CSS
actually that's not right right here
assets CSS and then there's a file
called all dot CSS so let's go ahead and
add that alright now when you're
pointing to links within within your
content you can use this at URL and then
let's do assets slash
CSS slash all dot CSS okay so what this
is doing is it's putting whatever you
have in your config in front of this so
for instance we have just this slash
right here so it's just going to be our
root domain okay but but if you had this
in a subfolder that's how it would know
what to what sub what to load here all
right so we have that and I think yeah
that's it that's all we need for the
head and then in the body let's see what
I want to do let's actually put a nav
bar here so I'm going to go to get
bootstrap calm let's go to getting
started and then examples and then I
want the starter template here we'll do
a control U and let's grab the nav tag
okay we'll copy that paste that in and
we're going to remove the the navbar
fixed top class we're going to change
the project name now we can put the
dynamic site name here like we did up
here so we'll just grab this it'll put
that right here alright and then for the
menu let's actually get rid of all those
and I'm going to paste these in okay so
notice we're using this at URL again and
this is to the home page and then we
want the blog page the about page and
then we're also going to create a
contact page which isn't there alright
because I do want to create a new page
so that's the navbar let's go ahead and
save it let's recompile it so we can
take a look the nice thing is though it
does do it very very fast it's not like
we have to wait every time all right let
me just close out of these and then
let's reload and that's what it looks
like okay so the reason it looks messed
up is because we're including the all
dot CSS and that has stuff in it we
don't want I actually want to clear all
of that out alright so now let's try
that again
on reload and now it looks like a normal
navbar now there's no content being
output here because we haven't yielded
the body so let's go to our base file
again and down here I'm going to create
a div I'm just going to add a container
and then inside here we can do yield and
we're going to yield the body which is
whatever view we're currently looking at
so let's go ahead and save that alright
and then if we go over here and reload
we have to recompile reload and there we
go so that's the main content now if you
remember there was also a sidebar and I
want to put that in the main template
because I want every page to have a
sidebar so what I'm going to do is use
the the bootstrap grid system here so
let's create a row and then we'll create
let's do call m.d. 8 call sm8 and then
we're going to put the body inside there
okay that's the eight column divs and
then we're going to do a four column did
for the sidebar so call md for call sm4
and notice the sidebar file is up here
and it's in the includes folder we see
sidebar blade PHP so we can put since
it's an include if we want to do include
ok and it's going to be an underscore
includes dot sidebar
alright so let's save that and compile
it reload and now we have our sidebar
now I want to make these look a little
better over here let's actually use a
list group so I'm going to go to the
sidebar file which is sidebar blade PHP
and you can see it just does a for each
loop through the blog posts blade syntax
allows us to use stuff like for each
loops and if statements and so on
alright another great reason to use
something like this so we're going to do
here let's see let's go right above the
for each and let's say div class and
we'll do list group ok and then the
ending div is going to go down here and
then inside here we're going to just
going to have the a tag and then just
add a class of list group item ok and
that's going to display that the post
with a link I just want to get rid of
the BR tag the line break at the end
here alright and then we'll save that
build it out and there we go so that
looks a lot better and that's going to
go to the blog posts because everything
is being yielded out in the content over
here for every page now the reason we're
seeing from the blog down here is
because if we look in for instance the
index
Paige and we look down here it's
actually putting the sidebar out here
instead of doing this what I did is I
put the sidebar out in the base so we
don't need this here so we can get rid
of that all right and then this is
giving you an example of how to use
markdown which is a different way of
displaying text I don't particularly
like markdown so I'm not going to use it
but you can just use this tag here and
then you can put whatever you want for
markdown in here
but I'm going to get rid of all that
actually I'm gonna get rid of this whole
div this whole left side and then let's
also get rid of this
alright so anything we put here is going
to be in the home page in the index page
so for instance if we just say hello and
save it compile it and go over here and
reload we just get hello alright but
what I'm going to do here is put a
little Jumbotron so let's go ahead and
just put a div and we'll give it a class
of Jumbotron and then let's see I'll put
I guess you know let's do an h3 it'll
just say welcome and I'm just going to
put some sample content in here and Adam
you can do larom and then tab and it
will put a bunch of sample data or
content whatever I'm just going to make
it a little shorter though all right and
then under that let's just put another
paragraph with some dummy text and it'll
save it
it's actually make that an h1 all right
now for the about page let's go over
here and let's get rid of this whole div
basically everything okay and then in
here let's just put just put an h1 we'll
say about us and then some sample crap
okay it doesn't really matter you can
put on this isn't the point to make this
a really nice-looking site it's just to
show you how to use this tool alright so
what else we want to do we want to
create a contact page so if you want to
create a new page you actually need to
create a new blade file alright and that
should be in the content folder so let's
say new file contact blade PHP and I'm
just going to grab what we have in the
about because we want to extend the base
and you can even have multiple layouts
and extend different layouts and
different pages change that to contact
so that will just say contact us with
the form below all right and then let's
just paste in a form here alright so
just a simple form with for bootstrap
form group with a name email and message
and a button so let's save that and then
we already have it in our menu in the
base okay we already have it right here
so it should work so let's go ahead and
compile let's go over here and reload
and go to contact and there it is okay
so it's as easy as that to add an extra
page so let's take a look at the blog
the blog area okay I don't like how this
is it has the the sidebar down here so
let's go to blog glade PHP and this has
a bunch of dynamic stuff we're looping
through the blog posts and then we can
access things like the title the path to
link to the single page the date even a
kind of a truncated text of the main
content alright but I'm just going to
get rid of all this except for the
what's in the for each okay we want to
get rid of the all this down here okay
so it's just looping through those posts
I don't want to use an actually we will
use an article tag that's fine
but let's see if I'm going to put let me
get rid of this or I'll copy the link
and then let's put that down here and I
just want this to be a read more link so
we'll put a class right here VPN or VTN
default alright and then the title I
don't want that to have a link around it
I want that to actually be an h3 alright
and then let's see we'll do a lot ha we
don't need to line break because it's a
heading and then we have small tags with
the date that's fine let's make this an
HR give it a put a line there and then
the content that's fine so let's go
ahead and actually want to get rid of
this paragraph ending tag here alright
so that looks much neater let's save
that let's see what it looks like see
let's actually put a line break after
the text because that link there is in
line so I'm just going to go like that
and that should do it for the blog
listing now when we click read more
it'll go to the single page so to edit
that you want to go over to where is
this includes and then right here blog
post base and this is that single file
so let's see let's get rid of this
and this market is these dibs right here
we don't want those and we'll keep the
back to blog the title is in an h1
that's fine the dates and small tags and
then let's just put an HR right here all
right let's see what that looks like by
the way guys I'm not caught I'm not
copying this code or anything I'm just
kind of going you know on a whim just
kind of winging it so this is the single
blog page that looks pretty good yeah so
I think that this looks better than the
original the mock-up there at least it's
using bootstrap now again I should be
able to just take the public files and
upload them to my server so let's try
that out before I go to the public
folder so actually I know I'm like a
copy I'm going to drag them over I'm
going to have to change the config file
again since it's in the test folder so
save that file and then we'll just
overwrite this stuff
okay now let's go to university Mediacom
/ test and there it is
alright so whenever I want to add a page
to this static website if I want to add
a page or new functionality we can just
edit the content folder through katana
and then just recompile it and re-upload
it alright you could even set up
something where you could just run a
command and have it automatically SSH to
your server or something like that
alright so this video went a little
longer than I planned one thing I hate
about working with this and laravel is
having to do the virtual host thing
because that can confuse some people and
if I don't put it in that will confuse
them even more so sorry it was so long
and that's it hopefully you enjoyed this
and maybe you'll use it somewhere down
the line maybe you won't thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
