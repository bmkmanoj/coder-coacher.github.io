make this application look a little
better first thing I want to do is
create a public folder so the public
folder is basically we're going to set
it as a static folder meaning that we
can load static assets like CSS files
and images and so on so let's create a
new folder here and we'll call it public
now we need to let xpress know that this
is the folder we want to treat as a
static folder so we need to open up our
app j/s file and then we're going to go
let's see we'll go right under the body
parts or middleware let me just add
those semicolons and we'll just put on
comment here we'll say set public folder
all right and we'll just do app dot use
and in here we want to say Express dot
static and then we're going to use our
path module and say path dot join and we
want the current directory so on double
underscored our name and then the name
of the folder we're using and that's
going to be public and you could call a
client or static or whatever you want so
let's save that and then in the public
folder let's create a new file and we'll
just call it about HTML just to test
things out we'll just say about save it
and then if we go over here we go to
slash about HTML it's going to load it
alright
we don't want an HTML file there but
just to show you that you could do that
so let's go ahead and delete it alright
now we're going to install bootstrap and
we're going to use bower which is a
front-end package manager I can't
remember if I already said that
to install Bower is really easy we do it
through NPM and if you want to read more
about it
Bower jazz and you can read this is the
the website barrio and right here it's
showing us we can install it globally
with NPM and then we can install
packages by using Bower install in the
package ok we're going to install
bootstrap
and what's nice about it is it'll also
install the dependencies since bootstrap
the JavaScript file in bootstrap needs
jQuery it'll also install jQuery alright
so before we do that actually let's
install it first so I'm just going to
stop this and then we'll say npm install
- gee flour now when you run Bower
install whatever our bootstrap it's
going to by default create a folder
called bower components and it's going
to put everything in that now that's
fine but we want the bower components to
go into the public folder so we can load
it statically and the way that we do
that is by creating a file here in the
root and we're going to call it dot
bower RC alright and then we can define
the folder that we can define the
location that we want bower components
to be installed to so let's go into that
file and we're just going to put in a
set of curly braces and this is really
easy we just wanted to say directory and
we want to make sure that it goes to
public slash Bower components all right
and you can call it something else but
I'm just going to leave it as bower
components so we'll save it and then
let's go over here and install bootstrap
so bower install bootstrap I'll run that
and if we look over here in the public
folder once it's done you'll see that it
now has a bower components folder with
bootstrap with jQuery ok so now all we
have to do is include these in our foot
in our script so let's go to views and
go to our layout and we're going to
include those up here so we need link
remember we're using pugs so we have to
use plugs in text and let's say rel
equals stylesheet and then the href is
going to be slash bower underscore
components slash bootstrap and let's see
what the exact location is and then we
want to go into dist CSS and then
bootstrap CSS all right so let's save
that go back to our application and
reload hope we need to start the server
and let's see that doesn't look right
let's look at the source code here our
components it should be looking in
public oh let's get rid of the slash
actually no it didn't do it
so this should be looking in the public
folder bootstrap dist CSS Oh a spike
spell bootstrap wrong
there we go all right so now what we'll
do is kind of just add some bootstrap
markup let's add a container and we'll
put that around the entire view so this
block content so right here let's just
put id container and we'll just bring
that over all right let's put all this
in the container as well so these should
actually be on the same level I don't
know why it's bringing them over so much
all right so let's try that reload no
difference
oh should be dot container it's a class
not an ID there we go so brought it over
to the middle all right um see what else
you want to do let's um let's go to the
articles or the index view and the UL
here let's add a class of Lists group
and then for the Allies we'll add a
class of Lists group item save that okay
so that looks a little better let's also
add a navbar so if we go to our views go
to the layout and we would want to put
this see let's put it right under the
body now instead of typing it all out
what I'm going to do is go to get
bootstrap and let's go to get started
and then we'll go to examples and
starter template do a ctrl you we're
going to grab the nav and then there's
actually a site it's what it's like HTML
or Jade to HTML right here it's a
converter so if we were to paste this in
it should give us the Jade code alright
so I'm just going to grab this copy it
and let's put that right here it screws
it up a little bit as far as the end
so we just need to move this over like
that and that should work hopefully
let's save it go back and reload and
yeah so that worked now I'm actually not
a huge fan of JR POG Jed whatever a lot
of people do like it because it allows
you to kind of structure your HTML like
like real code like you know Python
syntax or something with with
indentations Ruby and so on but I
actually prefer standard HTML but I
wanted to give you another option all
right so let's remove the navbar fix top
because that's causing this to go
underneath so I'll just get rid of that
and then for the project name let's say
I will just say knowledge base and for
the link for the brand we'll just go to
slash and then we have our menu so this
is going to go to slash that's the
homepage that's the list of articles and
then we also want add article and that's
going to go to slash articles slash ad
all right that's all we want for now so
let's get rid of that and then if we go
back and reload there we go add article
now add article that actually isn't
working because I got rid of the slash
right here so it's actually trying to
look in slash add slash bower components
so we need to make sure that that's
going to go from the root alright so if
we save that and reload it's going to
work
let's remove the the active class on the
nav bar so right here maybe we'll add
that later dynamically but for now I'm
just going to get rid of it and then we
can switch from the form to the home
page now we're also going to want to add
the bootstrap j/s because if we make
this smaller this button for the menu
it's not going to work so let's go to
our layout file which I'm already in and
we're going to go
see we're going to go down at the bottom
and let's go on the same level as that
container right there and let's see
we're going to do script and it's going
to have a source like I'll do single
quotes so this is going to go to our
bower components slash bootstrap slash
dist
/j s slash bootstrap KS okay it also
needs jQuery so we're going to include
that as well so I'm going to copy that
let me make this wider copy this make
sure it goes above it and then that's
going to go to compiler components
jQuery slash and let's see where it
where this is jQuery dist and then
jQuery j/s all right so let's try that
I'll reload and now it works all right
so we're getting there what I want to do
now is make these links right here so
that we can click on it we can go to
another page all right so let's go close
the layout we'll go back to the index
and we want see how we're going to do
this we're going to go get rid of that
equals and we'll go on a new line and
right here we're going to put a tag and
let's say href equals and we'll get the
route in a second but let's just put
that for now and then this should be
indented like that or not actually that
should go on the same level I think
up we need the equals all right now for
the link here it's going to go to slash
article slash and then we need the ID so
what we need to do here is concatenate
and put a plus and we'll say article dot
underscore ID I believe that will work i
i'm like i said i'm not i don't use pug
that often alright yeah so if we click
that you can see it goes to article
slash and then the ID so we now need to
create a route for that a get route so
let's go back to our app j s and go down
to our routes and let's see let's say
get single article alright so we're
going to do apt-get oops and in here
we'll put the route which is going to be
slash article and then slash : ID k the
colon means that this is a placeholder
this is this can be anything and it's
going to be whatever the ideas and then
we want function it's going to take
request and response and what we want to
do is is we want to do article okay
we're using the model and we're going to
do find actually let's do i think we can
do find by ID from not mistaken and then
we can pass in the ID now to get the ID
that's in the URL we can use request dot
params and then whatever the parameter
is in this case the it's an ID all right
and then that will have a callback and
that's going to take it's going to take
an error and a single article all right
and then in here let's go read actually
for now it's just console.log it and
make sure we can get it
all right so let's save that and then
let's go over here and reload okay we're
getting an error oh all right so if I
click that and then we look here and you
can see it's getting the article if I
click on article 3 it's console logging
oh sorry about that guys I have to go
pick up my daughter from the bus stop
and I'm going to leave that in because I
want this I want these tutorials to be
real you know I want you guys to feel
like I'm with you guys actually doing
this instead of you know chopping it up
and making it you know into a cookie
cutter type of type of tutorial so I'm
going to pause this and I will be right
back alright guys we are back and what
we're going to do now instead of just
console logging let's get rid of that
we're going to render a template so I'm
just going to grab this red dot render
and it's going to be a template called
article and then for the title what
we're going to do actually we're not
going to send a title because we'll be
able to get it from this so that's all
we want to send it to that article
response all right actually we could no
this is fine
so we'll save that and then let's create
that view so in views we're going to
create a new file and we'll call this
article dot pod and we want to do the
same stuff we did here we want to extend
the layout and put in the block content
and then under that let's put what do we
have an h1 and we should now have access
to article title so let's try this out
pull reload we'll click on one of these
and you see we get article one article
two and so on
so under that let's put let's put I
guess what should we do here let's do a
paragraph no let's let's do in each five
and we'll put the author actually what
we're going to do is we'll say written
by and then we should be able to use
this syntax like that see if that works
yep and then we'll do the body let's put
that in a paragraph will say paragraph
article dot body and there we go so I
mean it doesn't look very good but
that's not really the point you guys can
can do what you want with this you can
add more fields I just want you to get
the you know the core understanding of
what's going on how we can fetch data
how we can insert data and so on we can
always go back later and make it look
prettier so in the next video what we'll
do is we'll start to create the edit
function so we can actually update
articles that are already there and also
delete them we want to be able to remove
them all right so that's what we'll do
next I will see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
