solutions and this is my product of the
week or website of the week I'm gonna
try to bring you guys new tools that I
find online for a web development and
this particular site is called font
dragger and what it does is it allows
you to to test any fonts that you have
on your PC in on the site in the browser
so all we need to do its font drag accom
its DRA gr so what we need to do is we
can go click on this font drag our
button and we get this list it tells us
to drag and drop a font so we want to go
to I'm not sure on a Mac but I know on
Windows you want to go to your control
panel and you want to go to appearance
and personalization and then fonts and
you'll see all the current fonts on your
computer and all we need to do you see
if you look at this text here it looks
like Arial let's just get something that
we'll change it drastically all right so
we can go with this black oak STD black
and if you bring that over to the list
it changes the site's font just like
that it doesn't change any HTML or CSS
if we reload the site it comes back so
so it's a really cool tool I just found
it today but I do plan on using it you
can basically just test any font that
you want and see how it'll look in the
browser
what
all right so yeah so that's the tool of
the week or the website of the week I
hope you enjoyed it and don't forget to
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
