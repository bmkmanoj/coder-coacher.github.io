end project build for you today we're
going to be building a web hosting
website or template front end using a
few different technologies and I'll get
to those in a minute but let's take a
look at the project first okay so like I
said it's a web hosting web site or
template whatever you want to call it
and we have a few different pages but
this is the home page alright now
there's kind of a lot of markup in here
so I am going to have to do some pasting
and I usually don't like to I like to
type it all out so you can see exactly
what's going on but what I'll do is
paste the HTML and the CSS and just go
over it alright because I wanted to make
something that's kind of nice I mean
this isn't the best looking template in
the world but it's better than a lot of
the stuff you see in tutorials which is
usually just very very basic so I wanted
to give you kind of a real-life project
front end project so this is the home
page we have this top bar here with the
address and contact we have this submenu
then we have the main header here with
the simple logo no images just CSS and
then we have some different packages
here which I'll show you the ghost pages
in a second then we have the showcase
with this box here just some features
control panel data storage stuff like
that and we have the starting price
which is actually wrong it should be
$9.99 but we'll fix that get started now
link then here we have a domain search
field or domain submission basically
when you order a hosting package you
usually pick a domain so that's what
this is then we have this tab in the
area as tabs which is part of foundation
which we'll go over in a second and it's
just different packages okay I left the
same text here I didn't want to go
through and change all that because I
figured it's just a waste of time you
guys can edit the content if you want
after all right so if we keep going we
have these couple sections so we have an
image here some paragraph text read more
button and then we have this title or
heading with some sub
texts and we have these different icon
sets with different features okay we'll
be using font awesome for icons and then
we just have a footer with some menus
and I put this trust symbol here just to
make it look a little more legit so
that's the home page then these hosting
pages are basically just what we had in
the tabs over again and then just some
of the sections down here so all these
pages are pretty much the same so that
will be pretty easy and then up here we
have the about page okay so this is the
about page you have this image here of
this person and then some text and I
kept these too as well - sexy sections
the support page is just the contact
page which is a simple form alright and
then the login link is a modal or as
foundation calls it or repeal okay which
is just the username password and then
we have this little switch for remember
me okay so that's what we'll be building
now like I said we'll be using
foundation which is a front-end
framework it's very similar to Twitter
bootstrap so if you haven't used
Foundation and you've used bootstrap you
should have no issues even if you
haven't used bootstrap basically we're
just using predefined class names from
foundation so it's not going to be too
difficult now we are going to be using
the foundation CLI which is a command
line interface tool and we're only going
to use this to generate the application
or the template with foundation new and
then we also want to run foundation
watch because that's going to watch our
files and it's going to compile any sass
any sass files so we will be using sass
which is a CSS pre-compiled err which
allows us to do things like use
variables we can nest styles you can see
here with their nesting aul inside of
the nav so we will be using stats but
we're not going to have to really manage
it because foundation CLI will do that
for us alright so don't get overwhelmed
if you've never used the command line
before because we're just using a couple
basic commands now in order to install
the CLI you do need nodejs installed
because we're
we have to use NPM NPM is part of nodejs
its node package modules if you don't
have no js' installed just go to node.js
org go ahead and download it there's a
very easy Windows installer so just get
that set up and should be good to go all
right so the last thing I want to show
you is the tool called git bash which is
a command-line tool and it's available
with the git version control system I
would suggest using it if you're on
Windows you can also install it for Mac
if you'd like but just get that set up
you don't need it you can still use the
Windows command line but I find that
when I'm working with NPM and Windows I
get these weird issues sometimes
permission to choose things like that
and I don't get that when I use the git
bash tool so I would suggest that if
you're using Windows
alright so that's what we'll be building
let's go ahead and get started all right
so let's go ahead and get started now
I'm in my projects folder this is where
I want to create my project
now when we use the CLI tool to generate
to generate a project it's going to
create the folder as well so you want to
open up your command line inside of the
projects wherever you want to put it or
if you want to put the new folder so I'm
going to go to git bash here now if
you're not using git bash you can use
your you can hold shift and then right
click and open command window here all
right but we're going to use git bash so
let's go ahead and open that up and
first thing we want to do is install the
foundation CLI so I actually have right
here we're going to run this command
right here NPM install - JEE foundation
CLI now the - G is global meaning that
you'll be able to use it from anywhere
so let's go ahead and do that install -
G and foundation - CLI
okay so once that's done we're going to
generate our project we should now be
able to use the foundation command so
we're going to say foundation new okay
make sure you're in your projects or
wherever you want to create this and it
should just ask us a couple questions so
it asks us what we're building a website
a web app or an email template we're
going to click enter for a website and
it's going to ask us what we want to
call it we're going to call it BT
hosting or you can call it whatever
you'd like and then it's going to ask us
if we want a basic template or a ZURB
template okay so we're going to use a
basic template and it also includes a
SAS compiler so that'll go ahead and
create everything install the
dependencies and whatnot the foundation
CLI uses a lot of tools behind the
scenes it uses gulp which is a task
runner for javascript which does a whole
bunch of things but we're not going to
get into that it does it for us
same thing with SATs we're going to use
the SAS files but we're not going to
have to compile it ourselves
okay we just need to run foundation
watch and it will do all that stuff for
us so now I'm going to go to my editor
which I'm using Adam which is a really
good editor I would suggest it I'm
actually going to be using the dev
server plug-in that it has so that we
can open it up in on a local host on a
server and if you want to use that you
just need to install it by going to
settings and search for adam live server
and go ahead and install it it's this
one by this jazz chen alright and then
once you do that you'll be able to go to
packages and then live server and then
you can open it on whatever port you
want alright so let's go ahead and add
the project so I'm going to say add
project folder and projects BT hosting
alright and then you could go ahead and
just open your index.html file but I'm
going to open it in on my server on port
5,000 ok so now I don't want to use edge
though so let's close that and let's
open it up here
okay so this is what it will look like
at first and the reason that it looks
like this because the CSS hasn't been
compiled or the sass files haven't been
compiled so if we look over here we have
a folder called s CSS these are our sass
files okay if we look at the the main
one which is app it just includes all
the separate foundation sass files which
are in bower components okay we're not
going to have to touch any of those but
it just imports all those it also
imports the settings right here which is
this file and what this is is it
contains a whole bunch of variables that
we can mess with okay we can change up
the colors and the palette font size is
pretty much anything to do with
foundation okay heading sizes things
like that now for this to compile into
regular CSS we're just going to go back
to get bash and it even tells us we just
to run foundation watch so to escape
from this we're going to do a ctrl C and
then let's do CD and go into BT hosting
and then we'll run foundation
watch look I spoke it wrong
and that should watch the project and
also you can see it just compiled our
sass files and now if we look over here
we have a CSS folder with an app dot CSS
so this is all the sass files compiled
into one CSS file and then that's being
included right here in the index.html so
if we go now and reload you can see now
the CSS has now kicked in okay so this
is basically just the boilerplate that
they give us so we're going to start
working on this index.html file let's go
ahead and change the title say BT
hosting and I'm going to just get rid of
everything in the body except for the
script tags at the bottom okay you want
to keep these okay and it's including
jQuery
it's including the foundation jf okay
everything is was installed using Bower
okay Bower is a front end package
manager it's like NPM but on the client
side and the foundation CLI uses that
behind the scenes
okay we're also going to use it for a
couple of things as well so let's start
out just creating our HTML so if we look
at what we're doing here I'm going to
start at the top and work our way down
so we're going to start with this top
area here now this header right here
this is actually the foundation top bar
if we go to our documentation let's go
to doc site Doc's and see top pie so
it's actually this okay just change some
styles now the very top this part is has
nothing to do with foundation we're just
going to add our custom CSS so we're
going to start with that so right in the
body let's do a div and we're going to
give it a class of top nav
okay and it's going to have a row class
now Row is basically like container in
bootstrap it brings everything into the
middle okay and then inside row we're
going to use the grid system okay now I
should have said this earlier but if you
want to you may want to watch the
foundation crash course I have because
it really goes into depth with the grid
system and all that but basically
there's a grid system we can use twelve
columns and what I want to do is just
use two six column dibs so this should
be six columns this side should be six
columns so let's do a div with the name
of columns and then we're going to say
large six so basically on large screens
like this it's going to be divided into
two six column dibs
so we'll need that one and then we'll
need another one
okay now inside here we're going to put
this UL which is the location and stuff
like that okay so stupid stuff like this
I'm going to paste in there's no sense
in you watching me type out an Li you
know Li tags now this here this eye is
going to be an icon which comes from
flan awesome now we haven't brought in
font awesome yet so it's not going to
show up but I do want to just put the
mark-up in okay so that's going to be
that side now this side I'm going to
paste in another ul that's going to be
on this div okay so now we have both
sides let's go ahead and save that and
then we'll open that up
okay so this is what's going to look
like so far and there's no CSS yet but
it should you know what this is a medium
this is watch this is medium so we also
want to add in medium - six okay save
that I don't know why this is an auto
loading it usually does but that now
that's going to split into two columns
or two to gives that have six columns on
medium and large screens now if we go
down to small it's not going to and we
don't want it to we want it to we want
to be responsive and mobile-friendly all
right so that's the top bar HTML or the
top nav I should say now we'll do the
top bar so let's go underneath that and
we can actually grab that from the
documentation so right here copy that
and paste that in
all right and then we do want the top
bar left but it's not going to be a ul
so we can get rid of this whole thing
okay and then top bar right is not going
to be this either so let's get rid of
that so we have top bar left top bar
right on the left is going to be our
branding which is going to be in an h3
so this is going to say BT hosting but
if we look at the project you'll see the
BTS it's coloured and it has this
background and padding so we're going to
add a span tag around just a BT all
right and then we want to do is add in
these links here so let's go back to
let's go to the top right and then it
just pasted this in okay so we have our
different pages and notice on the home
the home link I put a class of current
okay because we want to style that
separately depending on which page were
on so let's go ahead and save that and
see what we get okay so that's what it
will look like this should actually be
inline by default I would think you know
what we might have to give it a class of
menu try that yeah okay yeah give it a
class of menu and your foundation will
make it inline all right so initially I
was going to do all the HTML and then
the CSS but I'm going to do it by parts
okay so let's now jump to the CSS and
start with the top bar here I'm sorry
the top nav I keep calling that the top
bar this is actually the top bar so
we're going to create a special sass
file to work in
so in this F CSS we'll create a file
called underscore custom dot F CSS
okay now let's just put some code in
here to test it out so I'll say body and
let's say background read save it and
then to bring this in we just need to
import it into app CSS CSS so down at
the bottom we're going to do at import
and then we just should just be able to
fake customs actually needs to go in
quotes save that and there we go so we
know that that's being brought in so we
can now get rid of that okay so we're
going to start with the top nav and you
put comment in here and I'm going to
just paste some Styles in so we'll start
with the actual top nav class so we're
going to set that to width 100 the
background actually you know what I want
to set that to a variable we'll keep it
like that for now but I'm going to show
you in settings we're going to change up
some of the variables so tot now let's
save that okay so that gives it a width
of 100% background with that dark color
and then zeroes out the pattern padding
and margin so we now we want to do if we
look at the HTML top list okay we have
top list and then topless right top list
top list right so let's go ahead and go
back into our custom and paste that in
so for this was setting the margin and
padding to zero taking away the bullet
points and setting the overflow to
hidden so if it goes outside of its
element it'll be hidden all right so
let's save that and if we look at that
it's not going to do much it just
removes the padding and bullets now we
want to do the list items okay so the
list items we want to float
this way so we want them in line so we
can actually do nesting with sass
instead of having to do you know top
list Li we can put an li inside of this
like that okay and it will only reflect
on list items that are in this class so
let me just paste in this so again we're
starting with style none to probably
don't have to but I do it anyways
and then we're floating them to the left
making them go horizontal adding some
padding top and bottom we'll have ten
pixels left and right we'll have 15 and
then the color is going to be light
color and font size 13 pixels so let's
save that reload and should look like
that alright now I do want to add some
padding to the right of the icon which
you can't see yet because we haven't
implemented font awesome so I am going
to just say li Pi which will grab all
the I tags and then let's just say
cutting right eight pixels alright so
we'll save that and then the first one
here the first li I want to set the
padding left to zero because I don't
want it push over so we can do Li and
then say : first - child and set padding
left to zero okay save that and then
that removes that left padding all right
so let's see the next thing we're going
to do is the top list
right which is this so let's go outside
of top list so way down at the bottom
here and I'm just going to paste this in
okay so topless right basically doing
the same thing we did up here we're just
floating to the right
okay and then let's go ahead and paste
in the list item
okay so list item pretty much the same
as what we did above adding the padding
changing the color font size save that
and now it should look like this okay
now we want the link to be white or a
light color here so in here let's put in
an a just tab this over so for that
let's say color and we'll say white I'm
going to replace some of these colors
with variables like I said but for now
we'll just put that and that's that so
that's the top nav okay so now we want
to style the top bar so I'm going to put
comment in here and let's say dot top
dash bar so we want to actually you know
what what's up let's go into settings
dot F CSS because there's some stuff I
need to change here so top bar actually
has some styling down at the bottom if
we go all the way down you'll see this
top bar padding 0.5 I'm going to set it
to 1.5 so if we save that when we reload
you'll see that it added more padding
okay so it makes it thicker now the
background you'll see that it's set to a
variable called light gray I'm going to
set it to dark gray all right so if we
save that now it's a dark gray now if we
go up at the top you can see our
variables for light gray medium dark
gray and then the primary I mean the the
foundation palette okay so it has these
different classes that are associated
with different colors now what I want to
do is set my own primaries that are
secondary values up here so I'm going to
set primary
let's see I'm going to set that to this
value which is not much different than
the blue that's included with foundation
but it's slightly different and then
secondary which is usually gray I'm
going to set that to a green color so
let me just paste that in it's going to
be that value okay and then down here
we're going to set primary to the
primary variable we created and set
secondary to the secondary value okay so
and then down here for light gray I'm
going to change that to f4 three times
so it's going to be even lighter than
that like right and then medium let's
see what we have for medium okay let me
grab that it's going to be that for nine
for B for C and then dark gray is going
to be 3 D 3 F 4 0 and then I'm going to
add one more gray shade and call it
medium light gray and that's going to be
all C's 60s okay and then black which
they have set to this I'm going to set
it to total black which is six zeros and
then white we'll set that to total white
which is 6x all right I think that's
good let's save that and if we reload
you'll see that this got darker now I
don't want this top nav the same as this
I actually want this to use the me Tom
wait what did we use on the top bar top
bar oh yeah we set that down here didn't
we so the top bar is using the dark grey
let's um
let's change that to medium break save
okay so now that uses the medium gray
and then let's go into our customs FCSS
and let's exchange this for the dark
gray variable which we can use we can
use any of those variables in this file
okay so we'll put dark gray and then for
the Li color
let's put white and let's see for this
Li color we'll also use white and for
the link color white you don't have to
do this but I think it's a little better
using the variables so save that it
shouldn't change much okay it doesn't
look like it changed at all but that's
good okay now let's see for the color of
the top bar I think that that's in the
settings as well or maybe not know so
we'll add that alright so in the custom
at CSS under top bot let's give color
and we'll say white that should change
the heading color or the logo whatever
okay and then the links we also want to
be white it will go like that
save okay I also want to set those to
uppercase so instead of doing on the a
tagging and do it on the Li tag and
we'll say text transform uppercase okay
it's good now for the hover state I want
to have the secondary color which is the
green so what we'll do is we'll go down
here and say a and what we want to say a
: hablar and then let's do color and
we'll set it to the secondary save it
and now it has the green color when we
hover over it now we also want to style
the current class so a dot current and
we're going to set again the color to
secondary and then we're also going to
set border bottom three pixels solid and
secondary save and now you can see that
the the active or the current link has
the border and of the back the color
secondary color okay so now I want to do
the branding right here so the BT which
isn't a span tag we want to style that
so let's go I'll just go right here and
say span and let me just paste this in
okay so now for the color what I'm doing
here the primary which is a dark blue is
too dark to be on the gray background so
what I'm doing is I'm using a lighting
function that's available with sass and
we're passing in the color we want to
lighten which is primary and then
lighting light lightening it's and 30%
okay and then setting the background to
dark gray which isn't going to work
because this is duck no that's medium
gray so setting the background dark gray
padding margin right and a light gray
border I'm going to set that to medium
actually let's not use a border all
right so let's save that and reload and
now we have our logo which isn't much
but it's better than just having it all
one color okay now notice that if I
stretch this out this is going way over
here that's because we don't have a row
class like this like we did with the top
nav so let's go ahead and go back to
index.html and in the top bar right
under this div will say div class equals
row and that's going to end right here
can I save that and now it pushes it
back to the middle okay so I think
that's it for the top nav and the top
bar so now we're going to move to the
showcase area so let's go to the HTML
and we're going to put this in a section
and give it a class of showcase whoops
HB section and we want to move
everything in the showcase into the
middle so div class row
and we're going to be using the columns
here if we look at the finished product
basically we want this to be inside of a
five column div okay we're going to put
it into a five column div and move it
over one you can see how there's space
here because we offset it by one so
let's say div class want to do div class
columns and I'm going to set large five
it's going to be five columns set for
medium as well and then we want to
offset it so large offset one and medium
offset one okay and then let's see what
I'm going to end that now if we look at
this we look at the final template this
blue box right here is going to be a div
with the class of showcase box and down
here the green is going to be show
showcase box bottom so these are
actually going to be separate and then
inside the showcase box we're going to
have right here we're going to split it
into two six column dibs okay that's
just basically you know half six and six
because it's 12 all together so we're
going to paste that in right inside the
five column so basically have showcase
box we have an h3 we have the power
graph and then we're creating a row with
two six column divs with each of the you
ELLs inside okay which are these two you
ELLs so let's save that and it's going
to look like crap right now
alpha it's not to take a look
okay so that's what it looks like now
and then we're going to put the bottom
showcase box so this ends right here so
let's go directly under it and let me
just grab that real quick and paste that
in okay so now we have our press using a
showcase box bottom which is also going
to have two six column gives because if
we look at it we have this is split into
two six column divs okay we have
starting at and then the price is going
to have a div around it and then the
actual number that the dollars is going
to have a span around it because we want
to make that a little bigger and then we
have on the other on the other side we
have an H five with a link get started
now and we're also going to put an icon
there so we're using the eye tag with
the class of FA for font awesome and
then FA arrow circle right which is a
specific icon we're using so let's save
that and take a look okay so that's what
it looks like with no CSS so that should
be it for the HTML for the the showcase
so let's go ahead and add the CSS all
right so we'll go down below the top bar
and let's do showcase I'm not smelling
good today
okay so showcase let me just enter down
so that you guys can actually see what
I'm doing let me paste this in so we're
going to have a background with an image
showcase JPEG and you guys will be able
to find that in the code in the
description below if you need that image
and we're setting it to no-repeat and
then we're just moving it over a little
bit 100 pixels and that's going to be
from the left and then we're setting the
minimum height of the showcase to 450
and the color of the text which let's
use the variable white
okay and I'm just going to go into our
project create a folder called IMG I'm
going to paste images that we're going
to be using in here okay and you want if
you want to see those that's what it's
what they are alright so let's go ahead
and reload wait did I save it and now I
didn't all it gets to makes it go down
to the bottom that sucks I actually
think there's a plug-in with atom that
we can stop that from happening okay so
now it's showing the background image
and now we want to do is we want to
style this both of these the showcase
box and the showcase box bottom so let's
go back and let's nest this and I'm
going to paste this in okay so we nested
this showcase box class padding we're
adding top and bottom 20 left and right
30 margin top we're moving it down 30
pixels the background is going to be
primary which is the blue color and the
color is going to be white and then what
I'm doing is setting the border top
right and border top left right to 10
pixels because if we look at this we
want these corners rounded and it ends
here so we don't want these rounded
because that wouldn't make sense we want
the top right and left rounded and then
the bottom left and right rounded on
this one alright and then for the
paragraph we're setting border bottom
and padding bottom that's this right
here okay so let's save that and take a
look and there it is alright now let's
do the showcase box bottom which I'm
going to just grab real quick
and paste that and now make sure your
outside of this showcase box and paste
that in so background secondary the
green color padding again we're setting
the radius to the bottom pricing is
going to have a font size of 35
font-weight:bold and the start link
we're going to add some padding to it
and the link itself will be white I
should have did this earlier all right
so let's save that and reload and there
we go and what's actually changed 29 to
999 okay so that's our showcase alright
so I realize this is again this is going
to be kind of a long video I wanted to
try to squeeze it in but I don't think
I'm going to be able to do that without
it being you know an hour and a half two
hours so what I'll do is break it into a
couple parts so we're going to stop here
and in the next video we'll continue
with the next section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
