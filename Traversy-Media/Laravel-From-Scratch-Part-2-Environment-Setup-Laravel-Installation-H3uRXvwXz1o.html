to get our environment set up for
laravel now the only thing that I
already have installed that I'm not
going to do in this video is install
xampp ok xampp is it gives us apache
which is a web server PHP and mysql ok
now I already have it installed it's
very simple but I will put a link in the
description to the episode of PHP front
to back where we installed it and set it
up okay so Apache friends dog you can
see it's cross-platform but if you are
if you're on a Linux distribution I'd
probably suggest just running a native
lamp stack rather than something like
xampp you can also use WAMP for Windows
you can use MAMP for Mac it's all up to
you it's all it's all the same thing as
long as you have Apache PHP and MySQL
alright so we're also going to download
composer which is a PHP dependency
manager it's kind of like NPM for nodejs
so I'm going to go ahead and download
that it's completely cross-platform as
well I'm going to download the exe file
I'm on Windows alright and then we're
also going to install git and get bash
okay get bash is a much better editor
for Windows and we're also going to be
using Visual Studio code which is a
really nice text editor and we're going
to implement the integrated terminal so
that we can have the terminal and the
editor all on the same screen
I think it'll free up some real estate
and it'll be it'll be a little more
efficient now by default the integrated
terminal uses PowerShell but we're going
to make it so that it uses this git bash
program and I'll show you how to do that
so let's download both of these ok
Visual Studio code we're going to
download alright so let's start off with
installing composer so open up the exe
file we downloaded and it's just a
simple installer we're just going to
click next it's going to ask for it
wants to know where your PHP dot exe
program is if you're using xampp it's
write an xampp slash PHP we'll click
Next when
using a proxy and will install click
Next and finish so composer should now
be installed alright now we're going to
install get and get bash so let's open
up the file we downloaded ok so another
installer will just breeze through
there's one screen right here so so I'm
going to choose the last option and this
basically gives you some UNIX tools that
you can use in the Windows command
prompt
all right commands like LS and things
like that so we're going to choose that
and then the rest of them we're just
going to choose the defaults all right
and while that's going on let's open up
the visual studio code installer okay so
we'll just click Next and I'm also going
to add the open with code option on the
windows explorer menu so let's click
both of those and click Next and then
install alright so that's done I'm going
to just click finish ok and now that's
done so I'm going to launch Visual
Studio code we'll click finish and let's
see bring it down here and I'm going to
maximize it and I'm going to go to view
and then or is it integrated terminal
now you don't have to use this you can
use whatever terminal whatever editor
you want but I think that this is going
to be a good option for us now by
default as I said it uses Windows
PowerShell if you go over here you see
we have PowerShell Exe what I want to do
is add git bash as an option so to do
that we need to go to the settings file
if we go to preferences settings and
this is just a JSON file so we can get
any of these settings that we want to
change we can just bring over here and
replace alright so
I want is search for terminal right here
terminal integrated shell windows this
option points to PowerShell so we're
actually going to change it you know
what let me pull up the the web page
will say vs code vs code terminal bash
and right here configuration so we want
it to go to get bash which is this
location right here alright so let's
copy this whole thing and then go over
here and we'll paste that in alright now
I also want to change the font size so
let's see where that is right here
terminal integrated font size I'm going
to change that to let's say 28 so we'll
need to copy this and it'll change that
to 28 and I also want to change the font
size for the editor which is right here
editor font size I'm doing this so you
guys can see it you don't have to do
this I'll change that to 26 alright so
let's go ahead and do a ctrl s to save
and you'll see the fonts already
increased now bash isn't an option down
here because we actually have to get out
of the editor so I'm going to close it
up and then we'll open it back up
all right and then we'll go to view
integrated terminal and now you'll see
we're using bash okay and we can
minimize this if we want and so on I
don't think we can bring it to the side
that would be a cool option but I don't
think we can do that if you guys know
how I can do that let me know I didn't
see an option in the settings okay so
now our environment set up and while I'm
using the terminal I'm just going to
maximize I'm going to make it bigger so
you guys can see and now we should be
able to set up a laravel project with
composer now we don't want to be in this
directory this is the home directory I
want to go into htdocs so we're going to
say CD dot dot that brings us out to
users I'll do it again
bring this to our C Drive and then we
want to go into xampp slash htdocs or
wherever you want to set up whatever
your web root is okay so now that we're
here we should be able to say composer
create - project laravel slash laravel
and i'm going to call it LS app for
laravel series app
all right and that can take a little a
little bit probably take about two
minutes or so so I'll just pause this
until that's done all right guys that's
all set let's go ahead and clear this
and we're going to want to just change
the directory to LS app and we're going
to add it as a project folder so right
here it's say open folder and then we'll
go to xampp htdocs and what did i call
it back is OLS app okay so this is the
entire laravel folder structure and
we're using laravel 5.4 it's a little
different than 5.3 I will go over the
structure in a minute but what I want to
do now is just get it so that our
application can run in the browser so
let's open up Chrome and we can close
these up now if I go to let's say
localhost / LS app that's last app so
what it does by default is it's showing
us a structure of our of our files and
folders and that's obviously not what we
want this is a huge security issue if we
go to public LS app / public that
actually shows the front front end of
our application now obviously we don't
want to have to go to slash public and
also the security issue
so what we have to do is create a
virtual host it's going to point to this
location all right so to do that we need
to we need to edit two files on our
system so the first one is going to be
in the C Drive it's going to be in your
xampp and then Apache folder if you're
not using xampp you should you have a
patchy installed you have it somewhere
okay so I think it's an error etc'
folder if you're just using a regular
lamp stack so let's open up that and
then we're going to go to cons and then
extra and the file we want to change is
this V host Conte file so let's see
we'll just open it with vs code and then
we're going to go all the way down to
the bottom all of this is actually
commented out see these numbers signs
commented out and we want we want to add
one of the
a virtual host entries so I'm going to
copy this and go down here and we want
to uncomment the opening and closing tag
and then for these all we need is the
server name and the document root so we
can get rid of the other lines all right
and then we just want to remove the
comment and the document root is going
to be where the public folder is that we
just saw so it's going to be an LS app
slash public and then we want a server
name which you can call whatever you
want
it's just local so we're going to call
this LS app dot def all right now you
should also add another entry before
that that's going to just go to htdocs
and we're going to say localhost okay
and then we'll save it and close that up
now we need to edit one more file and
it's very important that you open it as
administrator you open the text editor
as administrator so I'm just going to
use notepad right click and say adds
administrator and then in here we're
going to go file open and you want to go
to if you're on Windows go to C Drive
windows and then where is it system 32
and then drivers and then et Cie if
you're on Linux or Mac just go right in
your etc' folder alright now we want to
change this so that we're viewing all
files and we want to open up the dot
host file so this is what it should look
like by default we're going to add two
things here so we want to do 127.0.0.1
which is our local host we're going to
set that to local host and then we're
going to set 127.0.0.1 and then we want
our server name for the application
which is LS appdev or whatever you put
in your V hosts all right so we'll ctrl
s save that if you didn't open it as
administrator on Windows it's not going
to let you save it so make sure you do
that and then we'll close it up and then
the last thing we need to do is restart
apache so i'm going to open up my xampp
annal and we're going to click on for
apache we're going to click stop okay
you might have that that pop-up where
you just need to accept and then once
it's stopped we're going to click start
alright and that's going to it's going
to restart it now if we go back to our
browser and we go to LS app dot dev
there's our application alright so this
is going to from now on this is going to
be the root of our application and they
know one can if this was live on the web
no one would be able to see that the
file structure and all that crap that
that we were seeing before it's just the
public folder alright so this video is
getting kind of long so I want to try to
wrap it up but I want to go through the
file structure real quick so as I said
before laravel is an MVC framework Model
View controller so there's specific
areas for all of those things if we open
up the app folder you'll see that
there's actually a user dot PHP file
this is actually a model ok all your
models are going to go in the app folder
now you can create a subfolder called
models if you want but if you don't have
many you can just put them right in like
this alright I'm not going to go through
the code just yet I just want to show
you where those those aspects are now
the controllers are going to be an app
HTTP controllers and by default there's
a core controller which extends the base
controller this is what what has all
those all the functions that we can use
that we inherit all right and then
laravel also creates on an auth folder
with some controllers for login for
register reset password forgot password
so if we enable authentication all this
stuff will kick in but for right now
it's just kind of sitting there alright
and if we want to create a controller we
could manually create the file here we
could manually create a model but
artisan is
a better way to do it it'll actually
create the folder it'll create the class
it will include the the dependencies the
namespace and all that alright now when
you see namespace here this basically
gives this class or this file an
identifier so just in case it has the
same class name as another or the same
functions and so on we know that we can
we can identify them by their name space
okay now if you want to bring in a file
to use then you just say use and then
whatever that file now whenever you see
this illuminate don't get confused by
this just think of this as laravel as
laravel core okay so everything that's
imported from illuminate is imported
from the laravel core system okay it
will get it more into that later
now the views are going to be in the
resources folder you'll see a folder
called views and there's a welcome glade
PHP file so all laravel views are going
to use the blade template engine so it's
basically HTML with some dynamic
properties all right so if we go down
here you can see we can have if
statements we can have loops we can have
variables and so on there's a there's a
lot of stuff we can do with blade and
it's pretty simple so we'll be getting
into that as we as we move along now for
the routes this is really important if
you have used laravel 5.3 and under that
okay in lerigot 5.3 I believe there was
a route PHP file in the HTTP folder so
with 5.4 we have a folder called routes
now not just file and then we have
certain files for if we want to like
create a restful api we could bring in
that middle layer here and anything we
put in here would be API slash whatever
but the main routes file is going to be
this web dot PHP file alright and you
can see how simple laravel routes are
basically we say route we put a double
colon and then the type of request we
want to handle in this case it's the get
okay get request which is basically just
some
visiting the webpage and then the the
URL which in this case is a slash which
stands for the home page and then we
have a function here this looks a lot
like JavaScript or something you'd see
with like nodejs
and then in here we're just returning a
view called welcome okay so it's looking
in resources then views and then welcome
played PHP so we're just saying the home
page should load this view that's
exactly what's going on right here
alright so let's see what else we don't
need to know what every single folder
does providers okay so you can create
providers which are basically like
services that can do certain things for
instance we're going to create a
actually no not I don't think we're
doing that in this in this series but
for instance in the project series that
I created we create a form service
provider so we can register components
and things like that and then you can
spread them across all your controllers
and so on all right now config is just
that it's all the config files database
PHP you can define what type what
database you want to use what driver in
this case we're using MySQL which is the
default but you can see down here you
can use SQL lights which is a lighter
file based database this is what is it
Postgres SQL server and so on and Redis
ok Redis which is a cache manager and no
SQL database alright so what else app
dot PHP now when you install laravel
packages a lot of the times you're going
to have to add the provider to this
array right here providers all right so
you would just pop that in there and if
it has aliases you would put put that in
here and all that would be in the
documentation we'll get into that all
right what else storage this has to do
with using the file system we're going
to get into that later dot env is where
you want to put your database
credentials so right here you see we're
using MySQL so we would put our database
name and
user name and all that stuff in here
alright but we'll get to that later okay
if you wanted to write some tests you
have your Tet your unit test folder here
but we're not going to get into that I
think that's about it that's really the
most important things that you need to
know
Oh your public folder so if we go to
public this is where for instance our
CSS files go and all that now this if we
look at app CSS you can see it's a mess
that's because this is all it's all
minified and it's being compiled from
our resources assets folder alright and
I'm going to get into compiling assets
later and show you how we can use sass
and so on alright so I think that's
going to be it for now I just wanted to
get everything set up get our
environment set up install laravel and
kind of give you a little explanation of
some of the important folders alright so
in the next video we're going to start
to build our application
we're going to start to work with routes
and controllers and all that alright so
please subscribe if you're not please
