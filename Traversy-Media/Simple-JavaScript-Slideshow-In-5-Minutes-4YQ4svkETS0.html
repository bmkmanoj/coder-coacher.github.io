you how to build a really simple
slideshow using just JavaScript no
jQuery or any other libraries just plain
old JavaScript alright so I'm going to
skip the HTML body tags and all that
stuff you guys know how to do that so
let's go ahead and just put into script
tags and then the only thing that you
want to put in there HTML itself is an
image tag and we're going to give it a
name of slide ok we'll also give it a
width of let's say 400 and a height of
200 okay so there's our image tag now if
here we want to set a couple options so
I'm going to set a variable called I and
set that to zero that's basically the
start point or the start index we're
going to have an array of images and
we're going to just kind of loop through
those okay we also want a variable
called images which is an empty array
and let's create a variable called time
which will be the time in milliseconds
between each each image switch which
will set the 3 3 seconds okay so then we
need our image list so these will be
array values with image path so we'll
say images 0
and set that to image 1 dot jpg and I'll
leave a link in the description with all
the code as well as the images I'm using
okay so let's the images 1 I'll set that
to image to JPEG
and images to set that to image three
dot jpg alright so that's all right now
we need a function to change the image
so we're going to create a function
function called change IMG all right and
we want to set a document dot slide now
we can get this because we put excuse me
the name attribute of slide for our
image and then we want to grab the
source and we want to set that equal to
images I okay in this case I is going to
be 0 because that's what we set up here
so we're setting it to the first image
all right and then what we want to do is
we want to do an if statement and we
want to say if I is less than images dot
length now images dot length in this
case is going to be 3 because there's
three different indexes but the index is
zero base so it's 0 1 2 so basically we
want to check to see if it's the last
index of 2 now this is 3 so we're just
going to take away one from that alright
and then if that's true then we just
want to increment by 1 and if it's at
the last index then we want to reset it
to 0 okay and then after that what we
want to do is we want to run this
function every however many seconds we
have up here so for that we can use set
timeout and here we'll put in the
function change image and we want to run
that every 3 seconds in this case and we
can easily change this up here all right
and then we want to go outside of the
function and we want this change image
to run initially when the page loads so
I'm going to say window dot onload
equals change image just like that
alright and then that should do it
so let's go ahead and save and reload so
there's our first image let's wait three
seconds
there's the next one the next one and so
on alright and if we wanted to for
instance change this up here to one
second
and reload you see it will change every
one second and this is scalable let me
put that back two three
so if I have image for in here so if you
want to add another one we'll go ahead
and do that and just set this to three
set this to four save it
reload actually I'll put it back to one
just so it goes fast
now that's one two three four okay so
now it adds a fourth image so it's as
easy as that to do a very simple
slideshow I will do a more advanced one
with probably using jQuery where we can
have some nails and all that but just
wanting to get something really simple
out there for you guys and that's it
