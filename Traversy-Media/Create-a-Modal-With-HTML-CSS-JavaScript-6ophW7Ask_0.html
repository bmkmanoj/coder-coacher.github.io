video we're gonna create a modal which
is basically kind of like a nice pop-up
that fades in and you can put forms in
them you can put just text or whatever
and you often see these in frameworks
like bootstrap well I'm gonna show you
how to build it from scratch using just
HTML javascript and CSS ok very little
JavaScript and very little CSS it's
gonna be pretty simple so this is it
right here we have a button that says
click here if I go ahead and click it
you'll see we get this modal that opens
we have a header or footer and then a
main area and if I click on this X
button right here it'll close up also if
I click anywhere outside of the modal
it'll close but if I click inside the
modal you'll see that it will not close
unless of course it's on the X button
all right so that's what we'll be
building in this video it's something
very simple but you'll brush up on your
CSS and your vanilla JavaScript skills
so let's go ahead and get started so if
you guys really enjoy my content you
feel like you really get something out
of it consider becoming a patron to push

with even $1.00 means the world we have
different perks and tiers including a $2
tier that'll give you every udemy course
that I release absolutely free to learn
more check out patreon.com/crashcourse
to do code i'm also using the live
server extension if you want to use that
you can click on the extension icon and
just search for live server and it'll
pop up and you can just click the green
install button and what that'll do is it
will allow you to open your file up on
your localhost but of course you don't
need this you can simply just click on
the HTML file all right I'm gonna make
this a little smaller make this a little
bigger and we're gonna get started so I
have an empty folder in projects called
simple modal that's we're going to
create this so just create a folder
somewhere on your machine and then we're
gonna have three separate files we're
gonna have our index dot HTML and if you
want you can put them all in the
same file but I like to separate the
HTML and the CSS we're gonna create a
style dot CSS and we're gonna create a
main dot j/s alright so we're gonna
start with the markup of course
so in our HTML file I'm using Emmet so
I'm gonna do exclamation tab to give us
this basic head body structure for the
title will just say simple modal and
then we're gonna link our stylesheet so
let's go ahead and do that so style dot
CSS and then we're gonna link our
JavaScript file and we're going to do
that right above the ending body tag so
we'll put in let's say script and source
is gonna point to main dot J s alright
so that should be good now I'm gonna
save this I'm going to open it with live
server I can just right click and say
open with live server and that'll open
it up alright you can see the title says
simple modal now what I'm gonna do is
we're gonna start off with a very simple
simple modal with no header or anything
just the text alright and then later on
we'll create another index file index -
dot HTML or something where we'll add
the header markup and stuff alright so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna start
off by just putting in a button so let's
create a button we're gonna give this
button an ID of modal BTN I'm also gonna
give it a class of button to style it
alright so I was able to do that little
abbreviation because I'm using Emmet so
what we're gonna do in here is just it
will just a click here okay so that's
our button let's save it'll auto load
because I'm using live server and then
underneath that we want the mark-up for
the actual modal so we're gonna put in a
div with the ID I'm gonna call it simple
modal and I'm also going to give it a
class of modal
alright and in here we're gonna have
another div with the class of modal -
content okay so in the content let's put
a span and we're gonna give this a class
of close button so close BTN okay and
then we want the little X symbol we can
get that with ampersand x and then
semicolon that will give us that little
symbol alright and then as far as the
the text in the modal I'm just gonna put
a paragraph and we'll just say hello I
am a modal and that's it so let's save
and you're gonna see this stuff right
away okay because we have what we have
to do when we're building a modal is we
need to hide it when the page loads so
you can't see it and then we have a
function that's going to then display it
okay and we're gonna get into that but
before we get into any JavaScript what I
want to do is just add the CSS alright
so let's go into our style CSS and let's
just add some some basic body styles so
I'm going to set a font family of arial
helvetica sans-serif I'm gonna set a
font size of 17 pixels and what I do I
put a comma there which would be a
semicolon and then let's put a line
height of 1.6 alright and that's that's
all I want for the body
now I'm gonna style the button as well
it's not something we really have to do
but I just think it just looks a little
better so remember we gave it a class of
button so we're gonna give it a
background color or just background of
coral which is that color right there
whips when you use vs code you get these
little it'll actually show you the color
and the hexadecimal and all that stuff
if you're using atom pigments is a
really nice plugin that'll do the same
thing all right so let's set some
padding on this button I'm gonna do 1m
top and bottom 2m left and right and
let's go ahead and change the color of
the text
white in the button and we're gonna set
the border to zero and save and there's
our button and then you just want to add
a hover state so we'll say button hover
and I'm just gonna set the background to
a dark gray all right so now when we
hover it and it goes to almost a black
color so that's it for the button now
we're gonna start to style the modal now
for the modal remember it has a class of
modal we want to display none because we
don't want it to show it at first when
the page loads but if we do this now
we're not gonna be able to see it while
we're actually styling it so let's just
let's just comment that out for now
alright and then we'll start to add our
Styles now modal is gonna be basically
the entire area around it okay when we
when we have the little modal content
pop-up there's the the dark around it
that's what this is that's what this
class is so we want to set this position
to be fixed okay it's going to be a
fixed position and we're going to set
the z-index okay we're gonna set Z index
to one Z index is like the order of of
elements the higher the Z index the the
more up front it's going to be alright
we also want to set it to left the
positioning left zero and top zero okay
so we're basically saying start you know
at the left and a left top and then we
want a hundred percent with and a
hundred percent height we want it to
take up the whole window so it's say
height 100% and width is also going to
be 100% all right so let's see what else
you want to do here we want to do an
overflow auto
okay so we want we want to that'll
enable with scrollbar if it's needed and
then for the background actually let's
just save this so we're not seeing much
any much of a difference here but for
the background we want it to be dark but
not completely dark we want it to have a
little bit of transparency all right so
what we'll do is we'll set a background
let's set background color and we want
to set it it should be background -
color and we want to set it to an RGB a
value okay which is red green blue but
we want to be able to add opacity to it
or transparency so we want it to be
black so RGB black is zero zero zero red
green blue zero for all of them and then
for transparency you can choose how
transparent you want it I'm gonna go
ahead and go with 0.5 and save and now
you'll see that we have everything's a
dark background and you can change the
value of this if you want to do like 0.2
and save it you'll see it's much lighter
if you want to do 0.9 it'll be very very
dark all right but we're gonna stick
with five I think yeah all right so
that's the actual modal class now we
want to deal with the content which is
the box
okay the modal box so it's a modal -
content and let's see for this we're
gonna set a background color
I'll set background color let's do a
light gray so I'm gonna do f/4 three
times let's set a margin of top and
bottom 20% okay this is how far we want
it to go down
we'll say 20% of the window and then
auto for left and right because we want
it to be in the middle all right so if
we save that it's now gonna look like
that it's moved down - and if you want
to move it down further you could say
you could say 30% that'll move it down
if you could say 10% if you wherever you
want to put it I'm going to keep it at
20
all right so let's also add some padding
I will say padding 20 pixels just like
that and then the width is something
that you can also change and decide I'm
gonna say 70% save that now it's only
70% okay and you can make it bigger or
smaller let's see I'm also going to add
a little bit of box shadow so it's a box
shadow and for this we're gonna have 0 0
5 or 5 pixels 8 pixels yeah 8 pixels and
then 0 and then let's do an RGB a color
okay of black so 0 0 0 and then the
opacity will say 0.2 all right and then
we're gonna put a comma here and we're
gonna let's just copy this and for the
other side we're gonna do 7 0 7 pixels
20 pixels and that should be good
let's save there we go so now you can
see we have a little box shadow around
it you can mess with these values if you
want actually this should be what did i
do there 0.17 there we go alright so box
shadow is kind of tricky but I think
that that that looks fine all right so
let's see what else let's do the close
button I don't want the close button to
just be chilling right at the top here I
want it to go over to the side here so
we're gonna have to float that so
remember that has a class of close BTN
at least I think let's check yeah close
BTN and we're gonna change the color of
it to lighter gray ccc and let's float
it
to the right let's change the font size
so we'll say font size we'll change it
to 30 pixels make it a little bigger and
that should be good let's save and now
that looks much better so let's also do
a hover State and also when when we when
we hover over it
I want the cursor to change because
right now it's not changing well it
changes to two that I want to change it
to a pointer to let the user know that
they can actually click there
so we'll say close button hover and then
we also want the focus States so we're
gonna say close button colon focus
alright and then what we're gonna do is
we'll change the color of it to let's
say black and let's change the text
decoration make let's make sure there's
no underline set that to none and then
let's set the cursor I'll set the cursor
to a pointer and an extra u in there all
right so let's save that and now we
hover over it you'll see it it goes
black and also we get that we get the
cursor at the pointer I mean alright so
nothing it's not gonna work yet because
we haven't added any JavaScript but
we're just getting the the modal setup
as far as how it looks alright so that
looks pretty good I think we're gonna go
with that so now what we'll do is will
it will uncomment our display:none and
save and now you'll see that it's
completely gone so now is where we enter
the JavaScript so that when we click on
this it actually shows up so let's go to
our main J s and from here we want to
basically just get a bunch of the
elements and put them in variables so
let's say we want to get the modal
element and we're gonna set a variable
called model model modal
and let's set that to document dot get
element by D and we want to get the ID
of simple modal all right we also want
to get the open modal button so create a
variable called modal BTN set it to
document dot get element by ID and I
believe we also gave it an ID of modal
BTN to get modal BTN so let's put that
in there all right and then last thing
we want to get is the close button
okay so we'll create a variable called
close BTN and set it to document dot get
element by ID close BTN all right so we
have our variables now we want to create
our events so let's listen for a click
on the button on the modal button so
we'll take that variable modal BTN right
and we're going to say add event
listener and we want to add a click
event I want to listen for a click event
when that happens we're going to call a
function called open modal okay so we'll
just put that in there and then we'll
create our function so function open
modal all right and then this is going
to be very very easy all we want to do
is take that display value or is it
right here the modal display take it
from none and set it to block okay when
we click this button and just to test
out make sure that this is actually
running let's say console.log 1 2 3 and
we'll go over here and hit f12 make sure
you're on your console hit the button
and you'll see 1 2 3 all right so to
change the style we simply need to take
our modal and set the style
and then we want to set the display
equal to block all right save that let's
click it and there it is
alright now nothing else is gonna work
we haven't set that up yet but it does
in fact open it okay so next thing we
want to do is we want to we want to add
an event listener further close okay so
we have our closed button here let's go
ahead and copy this let's say listen for
open click and then we'll say listen for
closed click okay now this is going to
be on the close button this event
listener so we're gonna change this to
close BTN okay listen for a click and
then we're gonna call closed modal okay
now we'll go down here let's copy this
we'll say function to close modal change
the name and I bet you can guess what
we're gonna do here we're gonna just set
this back to none all right let's save
it let's see what I do wrong
cannot read property out of it listener
of no why is this now close BTN
why is that now
Oh document dot get element by D close
button what the hell oh I put a class of
close button guys hold on let me let me
look at what I did here initially oh oh
you know what
instead of using get element by ID I
didn't mean to do that
we want to grab it by its its class name
so we're gonna say get element or get
elements by class name all right now
what this this does get element by class
name by the way I'm creating a vanilla
JavaScript course on udemy and we're
gonna this is the kind of stuff we're
going to be going over but this actually
will get us an array or a collection of
classes with this close button so what
we want to do is just add in some
brackets and say we want the first one
even though there's only one it's still
going to return that collection or that
array so we need to specify that we want
that first one all right
and then let's save and now that error
should go away okay so let's go ahead
and click and let's click the close
button and it goes away all right now I
want to also make it so that if we click
outside of it it goes away so for that
we're gonna actually add an event
listener to the window let's say outside
click or you know we'll say listen for
outside click so we're actually gonna
take the window and say add event
listener and we're gonna listen for
click and we're gonna call a function
called
but I call it click outside
okay which is going to be very similar
to closed modal so I'm going to copy
that
we'll say function to close modal if
outside click and then we'll change the
name of this to outside click and then
all we're going to do is make sure that
the target is equal to modal all right
so we're going to pass in an event
parameter and we're going to put in an
if statement and wrap this around it
like that
and we're going to say if e dot target
is equal to what nope is equal to modal
okay a modal is being that you know the
dark area around so we want to check
that so let's go ahead and save click
outside is not defined always it outside
click alright let's change this to
outside click and save all right so
we'll try it out we click outside of it
good but if we click in the modal that's
fine nothing happens click the X button
and it closes alright so that's it for
the the basic modal now what I want to
do is just give you some options to make
it look a little better with a header
and footer I also want to add a little
bit of animation because right now if I
click it it just it just pops up it just
appears it goes from display:none to
display:block so I'm gonna add a little
bit of CSS animation here using a
keyframe okay and this is don't let that
intimidate you if you don't know about
keyframes this is gonna be very very
simple so let's go to the modal content
alright we're gonna go to the bottom
here and we're gonna say animation -
name and we can name this whatever we
want I'm just going to call it modal
let's just call it modal open alright
and then we want to say animation -
duration
which I want to do let's say one second
okay and you can change that you could
do 0.5 seconds or whatever you want all
right so now that we did that we need to
go and create our keyframe we're gonna
do that at the bottom here we'll say at
keyframes and remember what we called it
modal open okay and then we're going to
just put in here we're gonna say from
okay so from the initial state we're
going to say opacity opacity of 0 to
opacity of 1 okay so that's all we're
doing is we're animating the the opacity
from from 0 to 1 in one second because
that's what we set right here for the
duration so let's save let's click it
and you'll see that it'll actually fade
in in one second and you can change that
duration to whatever you want if I were
to put let's say 3 seconds and click
it'll take 3 seconds all right I'm just
gonna leave it at 1 no so that's that
now let's go ahead and let's add the
mark-up I'm going to just create a new
file let's see we'll create a new file
and we'll just call it index 2 dot HTML
and then I'm just gonna copy everything
that's in index.html and save and then
let's see if we can navigate to index 2
dot HTML okay it's the same exact thing
which is good and then we're just going
to edit the mark-up a little all right
so what we'll do is inside the content
we're also going to have a header so
let's say a div with the ID or I'm sorry
with the class of modal - header
what okay and then in this header is
where we're actually gonna put the close
button so I'm going to take the span and
cut it out and put it inside the header
and then right under the span we're
gonna put an h2 and we'll just say modal
header alright so if I save it it's
gonna look like that so far so we're
also gonna have a modal body so right
under the header actually we'll wrap
this paragraph right here let's say div
class modal - body and then we'll just
wrap that and then I'm just gonna put
another paragraph in below it and let's
just put some sample text I'll just say
lorem tab which will just give us some
dummy text alright and then under the
modal body we're gonna put a footer so
let's put a class of modal - footer and
in the footer we're just gonna have an
h3 so say h3 and we're gonna say modal
footer and save and that's what its
gonna look like so now we need to just
change up our styling a little bit so
let's go ahead and go to our style sheet
let's I should probably create another
style sheet as well because yeah let's
do that we'll create a style - dot CSS I
just I want you guys to have the simple
one and then also the one with the
header and the footer so I'm just gonna
copy everything from style dot CSS and
put it in there alright and then I'll
close up style.css and also index.html
and let's go back into index to HTML and
just change the reference to go to style
- dot CSS alright and it should still
work the same way so now let's go to
style - dot CSS and let's add some stuff
in here
so the header I'm gonna put right below
the content so it's a modal modal header
and we're gonna add let's see so first
of all I want to take the padding away
from going around the whole content
alright so if we go to modal content
let's take away that padding of 20
pixels okay so it's gonna look like this
and then in the header what we'll do is
let's add a background of coral okay
we'll do a background of coral and then
we'll add our own padding here of 15
pixels and let's set the color to white
alright so now it's gonna look like this
I want to take the initial margin away
from the h2 so what I'm gonna do is go
right above that and say modal - header
h2 and we'll say margin zero there we go
alright because of what it was doing it
was adding that margin on top of the
padding making it just way too much
all right let's also change the color of
the X now that it's on the coral
background I want it to be white so
we'll just go to our close button which
is right here and we'll just say color
white
all right now the mod the modal body we
now want to have some padding so let's
go ahead and do that so we'll go right
under the header and say modal body and
we'll set padding what I do for the body
10 top and bottom 20 on the sides there
we go
now I also want to remove the initial
margin for the the footer which is an h3
was it in h3 yeah h3 so we'll just go
and add right here to where we did the
header and the header h2 and we'll say
modal - footer h3 and also set that
margin to 0 all right and then what
we're gonna do is style the footer so
we'll say modal - footer we're gonna add
a background let's see background of
coral the white does that background of
coral let's also add 10 pixels padding
and let's set the color to white and
let's align let's align to the center so
text align Center and save
and there's our footer all right so
that's gonna be it guys
let's go ahead and if we make this
bigger you'll see it's always gonna stay
it's what I do 70% I believe but you can
change that if you want you can also
make it a fixed fixed width so let's say
we wanted to do with I don't know 400
pixels and save so it's always gonna be
400 pixels okay so you may want that but
it's it's completely up to you all right
I'm just gonna set it back to 70 all
right so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
like I said I'm creating a vanilla
JavaScript course on udemy and we're
gonna be doing stuff like this
I know this had quite a bit of CSS but
you know if you wanted to not look
horrendous then you're gonna need to add
some CSS
but yeah so that's it guys hopefully you
enjoyed it please like if he did please
