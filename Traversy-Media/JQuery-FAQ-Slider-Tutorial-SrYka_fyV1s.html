simple FAQ slider and we're gonna use
just a little bit of jQuery and
JavaScript some HTML and just a little
bit of CSS so let me show you the
finished product
what it'll look like so very simple we
just have some questions and we can
click on a question and it will reveal
that answer for that particular question
we can have hover events to make these
open and close but we're just using
clicks right now so let's get started
I'm gonna create a new folder and I'm
gonna call it if a queue I'll just call
it FAQ and we need to create our file
structure so of course we need our HTML
file which I'm going to call index dot
HTML
and then we need we're gonna need our
jQuery file which will be a JavaScript
so I'm gonna call that jQuery Jas
instead of using a Google CDN or some
other CDN we're actually going to
include the actual file because we're
working on our localhost and I know
sometimes Chrome has issues with using
CD ends on localhost and the last thing
we need is a stylesheet so I'm going to
create a new text document and call that
style dot CSS all right so if we open up
our index file obviously there's nothing
there
so I'm going to open this and I'm using
notepad plus plus which is a great
editor for simple web projects like this
I also have the FTP plug-in over here
but we're not going to be using that so
the first thing I'm going to do is just
create a structure we're going to use
the dock the html5 doctype and we'll
create a plan our main HTML tags head
body tags
and we want to close the HTML all right
and we'll give this a title we'll just
say FAQ slider all right so the basic
document structure if we reload this we
can now see the title change so the
first thing I want to do is add the HTML
and all we have for HTML basically is an
unordered list so I'm going to put a
little tab indent in here and open up a
unordered list tag and close that and
then we're gonna have a couple lists
we'd have Li and I'm going to give this
a class of Q for question and then we're
going to have a a lie with a class of a
or answer
li and we'll just say there is a
question here is a question one and then
we'll just put something here we'll say
this is the answer to the question so
the content here is an important I can
put absolutely whatever you want but I'm
going to copy these and well five is six
of them and we'll just change the number
and the question
three
four five and six all right so that's
basically all we're going to have for
our HTML we have a a Li tag which is a
question and then the Li tag which is an
answer okay so if we save that and we go
and look we just have a simple unordered
list so the next thing I want to do is
style this thing so in the head tag I'm
going to actually just include I'm going
to do a link rel stylesheet and we're
going to point that the stylesheet is
going to be located in the same folder
so we'll just put style dot CSS and you
want type type is text slash CSS all
right
so if we go to that file that's not it
was the file the folder we just created
alright there it is so we want to open
up style.css and let's just give this a
test
we'll say body and display:none just to
see if it's working if it's connected
right
all right so it's working so we can get
rid of that
so for the body we are going to have a
width of 500 pixels and we want margin
Auto because we want it set in the
middle and then we want to align the
text to the center okay so that's the
body next I want to style just all the
Li tags and I just want to take off the
bullets so we're gonna say list style
with style none
next we want the answer list so Li dot a
and we want to have no margin and we
want a padding of excuse me a padding of
1m on top and bottom and zero on the
right and left
okay so Li dot Q which is the questions
we have a couple we have a few styles we
want to add here first of all we want to
make the cursor a pointer and so the
user knows that they should be clicking
on it we're going to set the font weight
to bold we are gonna set the font size
to
let's say 1.5 m and the line height will
be set to 2 m and we will give it a
background of gray and then finally a
border that is 1 pixel
whoops sorry 1 pixel and it's gonna be
dark gray and it's gonna be solid and
then the last thing I want to add is a
class of hide and this is how we're
going to hide the answers okay so this
class is just gonna be displaying none
all right so that looks good from what I
can see so if we save that and go back
and look at I are actually you know what
we want to do we want this here to be
bored of bottom we don't want a border
around the whole thing okay so now we
can see all our answers which lot which
obviously we don't want but we can see
that the styling is complete the the
questions have the dark gray and the
large font so that's what we want so the
next thing we want to do is to just add
the jQuery and what I'm going to do is
actually download jQuery
and you can use jQuery jQuery one or two
I'm going to use the latest version of 1
which is 1 point 10.2 so I'm just gonna
copy all of it and I'm going to go into
my jQuery dot J's file that we created
and just paste all that save that and
then we don't have to touch that again
so here we want to of course include it
so we're going to open up a script tag
SRC equals jQuery dot J s and we'll say
type equals text slash JavaScript and
then we need a closing script tab
all right so now that should be working
fine now
let's open up the console just to make
sure and reload and with having we're
getting no errors so I assume that
jQuery is being loaded fine all right so
now for the actual jQuery we're going
we're going to open up some script tags
and you definitely want to make sure
that these script tags are opened under
the inclusion of the jQuery file if this
won't work if you have your script tags
up here so just make sure that and the
way we're going to do this is what we're
going to make it so this loads after the
Dom after the entire document loads so
we do that with the dollar sign document
dot ready and I'm going to do a function
this is a self evoking function
all right so what we're saying here is
when the document is ready we want to
call this function which right now does
nothing we're going to add what we want
it to do now once the the documents
loaded so what I'm going to do is use a
selector one second let me just all
right so in jQuery we use the dollar
sign and then some parentheses and
quotes and inside that we can put any
selector that we want for now what I
want to do is grab all the list elements
that have a class of a so all I have to
put in here is Li dot just like as if we
were styling a CSS adding some CSS to it
all right so what I want to do is I want
to hide all the answers if we look at
our page you can see we don't want all
these answers showing so we can do that
by adding the class called hide that
will just that's set to display none so
let's do that let's do dot add class
and inside here we want the name of the
class which is hide alright so if I save
that
and then we reload this poster did
something wrong
let's see document ready Li dot a
thought add class hide
hmm
oh we forgot to put the semicolon at the
end here alright so that should work or
not
oh let's show what's going on here
make sure that jQuery is there yeah
hide
you guys probably see it before I am
before I do
oh we have actually have parentheses
here instead of curly braces okay I feel
like an idiot all right so now you can
see that all of our answers are hidden
now we don't want this if we look at our
original that's not the original if we
look at our original document or script
you can see when we open it the first
answer is showing so that's what we
wanted to hear we want to get the first
answer to show and we can do that using
the filter function or filter action so
we want to say instead of just AB doing
this ad class here we want to add the
filter okay so in here is what we want
and here is what we want to add the hide
class to and that is to all of these all
of the answers except the first one and
we can do that using the nth child so we
can say nth child parentheses and then n
plus four so if we save that
that's not right
filter and child sorry we need to have a
colon before the enth alright so now you
can see the first one is shown and this
is a little hard to explain but what
we're doing here with enth child what
we're doing is we're going to the parent
of this selector okay so the parent of
this li class a is the UL tag okay and
what we're doing is we want to choose we
want to choose after the fourth element
from the parent okay so we have the
parent and then we want the fourth down
one two three four and this is where it
starts this is where that add class hide
is going to start and it's going to do
it for the fret from here on so from
here on anything with Li class a is
going to have the hide class applied to
it so that leaves this first one open so
we can see it I know that might feel a
little tough to wrap your head around
I'd suggest doing some research on tenth
child and some of the other pseudo
classes and stuff like that but that's
how we get that effect so the next thing
we want to do is make it so that when we
click on these questions we get they
slide up and we can see the answer and
we can do that if we just go down here
and we want to say we want to grab the
UL class I'm sorry the UL element
and we want to do dot on on click we
could also just do dot click here and as
a posed to dot on and then click but I
just I prefer to use on because that's
actually how it's used in the jQuery
file if you look in the file even if you
use dot click actually is using the dot
on function so dot click and then the
next parameter is what we want to click
on and that is the Li dark you element
that's the question so we want to click
on the questions for something to happen
and that something is going to be a self
calling function all right so what this
is saying right here is that when we
click on a question we want this
function to run which is nothing right
now we're going to add to this right now
so we want to say this referring to the
Li dot Q that we're clicking on dot next
and the dot next is basically just the
next element so when we click on the Li
class Q we want the next which is the Li
class a alright and this is called
chaining doing we're going to go from
this to dot next and then here we're
gonna say dot slide down so this is
chaining
it's basically dot syntax so slide down
and that takes a parameter of the speed
we want which will say 200 all right
okay so now we want these siblings of
the siblings of lij we want those to
slide up at the same speed 200
okay you can see when we chained like
this we don't need a semicolon at the
end of every statement all right so now
let's test this out let's save this and
reload we have no errors in the console
which is good I click on a question and
the answer comes slides up all the
question slides up and you can see I can
go back and if we get rid of this
siblings here we get a different effect
it doesn't it doesn't stating the
siblings need to also move down all
right so that's a very very simple FAQ
slider you can see we only have a few
lines of jQuery here but very easy I
think it's it's a nice little script for
a beginner I'll be having some I'll be
creating some other jQuery tutorials as
well maybe a little more in-depth than
this but I hope you enjoyed the video
