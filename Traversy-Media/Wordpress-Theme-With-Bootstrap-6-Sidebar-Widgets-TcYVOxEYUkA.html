we took care of our single post pages
and just the regular pages okay so now
what I want to do is work on the widgets
right now the sidebar is just all static
HTML and we want to change that so first
thing we're going to do is open up
functions.php and we need support for
widgets we also need to define the
positions we want the widgets to be to
be able to be placed all right so we're
going to go see we'll just just go to
the bottom here and let's say widget
locations and let's create a function
we're going to use our prefix what was
it WP be underscore and I'll say init
widgets
okay and that's going to take in an ID
what we want to do here is we want to
call register underscore sidebar okay
now no matter where you're going to put
your widgets even if it's like saying
the header or the footer or main content
you're still going to use this register
sidebar it doesn't have to be a sidebar
alright so this widget we're going to
pass in an array alright and then the
name we're going to set to sidebar okay
doesn't have to be sidebar but it just
so happens that's what we're doing we
also need an ID which is going to be a
lowercase version okay now we can also
specify be for widget and that's going
to be any HTML that we want to go right
before the widget all right now let me
just take a look at our HTML and see
what we're working with here where are
we index okay so looks like we have our
sidebar module inset okay so it looks
like each
block here has a class of sidebar module
so what we'll do is we'll say before
widget and then we'll put in a div with
a class of sidebar module just to keep
that formatting okay we also want to do
after widget because obviously HTML tags
have to be closed whoops all right and
we can also choose to do before and
after the title so let's see what that
looks like we have an H for looks okay
so we'll just do an H for of course you
could use h1 h2 whatever you'd like okay
so that's our widget now in order for
this this to run we need to we need to
hook it in using add action all right so
let's go right under it and say add
action and the hook that we want to use
is called widgets in it
alright save that now if we go to our
back-end initially we if we go to
appearance
there's no widget option but since we
added that now if we reload you should
now see a widgets option click on that
and you can see we have a sidebar widget
what we'll do is let's bring over
categories and we'll save that now if we
go back to our front-end and reload
there's no change because we still have
that static HTML so we're going to
change that let's go ahead and start
with the first div with sidebar module
we want to get rid of that ok next one
we want to get rid of that and this one
I want to get rid of that all right
and then here what we're going to do is
test to see if there are any sidebar
widgets so we can say PHP is sidebar
actually no let's wrong one is active
sidebar and then when you want to pass
in the the widget ID which in our case
it is sidebar
okay and then if there is then we want
to say PHP dynamic underscore sidebar
okay again TAS in the ID of sidebar all
right let's save it and go and reload
what's this unexpected PHP is active all
into an F okay so now you can see that
it's giving us our categories widget
because that's the one that's the only
one that we have enabled if we go back
and let's say we want the archives
widget we'll put that in there and there
we go now notice if we click on one of
these posts and we go to the single page
we still have the static text the reason
for that is because single dot PHP still
has the static HTML so we need to update
it in all places so let's go to actually
in our index we'll just copy this
actually you know what a better way to
do this would be is to actually take all
of this down to the container cut it out
and then put it in the footer file that
way we don't have to keep repeating
ourselves
so in footer let's go and paste that in
okay and then we'll go to single and we
should be able to get everything from
this container up to here get to just
totally get rid of it
alright and if we reload that looks good
go to the index the home page that's
good if we go to one of the single pages
that's not good okay we need to
edit page PHP and what we'll do is just
get rid of everything from here up to
here and that should fix that okay
and I think that's it yeah so now we
should have our sidebar widgets on every
page and if we click one of these
categories it'll take us to a page that
only has the posts for those categories
which is what we want now if you wanted
to edit this I'll create a custom layout
for that you could go ahead and create a
new file called archive dot PHP and if I
reload now it's totally blank so what we
can do is copy everything in the index
paste it in archive reload and you could
do what you want here but I'm just going
to leave it as is there's not really
anything that I need to change alright
so I think I'm going to stop here now
that we have our sidebar widgets taking
care in the next video I'm going to show
you how we can use multiple post formats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
