now we need to add function to this so
it's getting submitted to slash posts as
a post request so we need to catch this
in our routes so let's go to start route
CAS and we'll go down here and we'll say
route dot post because it's gonna be a
post request and it's gonna be two slash
posts and then we want to link this to
the post controller dot create method
which we haven't created yet so let's
save that actually you know what let's
call this store I think that's a better
convention so we're storing the post all
right now let's go to the controller and
we'll go right on it under the add
method and we'll say async store and
let's see what we're gonna do here so
this is gonna take in a couple things
okay we want request and response and
then we also want session alright we're
going to be using flash messages so that
when we submit a post after we redirect
we want a message that says post
submitted or something like that
all right we're also gonna be using
validation using a validated provider
but I'm gonna get to that after so once
this is submitted let's say Const Post
equals new post like that
okay so we're creating a new post
instance and then let's say post dot
title equals and the way that we get the
form values is using that request object
which has an input method and we can get
the title okay we also want to get the
body and add that to the post so request
input body all right then we just want
to save it now we need to use a weight
here so we're gonna say a weight post
dot save okay now we want to set a flash
message so to do that we use session dot
flash and then in here we pass in an
object and we say notification and then
whatever we want to say I'm gonna say
post added okay and then we just need to
return response dot redirect and
wherever we want to go which is gonna be
the posts page all right now setting the
flash message is one thing but we need
we also need to output it so since we're
going to the post index page let's go to
that view which is post index dot edge
and we're gonna go right below the title
and the syntax for this is going to be
an if statement so we want to do a tiff
and in here we want to say old that's
the method we want to run and then
notification okay and then we want to
end if
and inside here we're going to put a div
with a class of alert and a class of
alert danger okay which are bootstrap
classes and then we just want to put
double curly braces old notification
like that all right so let's try this it
should actually add a post so we'll
reload let's say post three this is post
three and submit and there we go post
added oops I I put alert danger I should
have this needs to be alert success so
it's green okay so one thing that I want
to do now is add some validation because
right now I can submit nothing okay so
to do this we need to install the
validator providers so we're gonna go
down here and say npm install at adonis
jas slash validator okay this isn't
included by default now when we add a
provider we need to register it and we
do that in the start and then app.js
file so i'm what i'm gonna do is put a
comma here and let's just copy this down
and change this to validate or provider
okay so now we can use it so we'll close
this up let's go back to our controller
and we need to bring in that validator
so up at the top here we're gonna say
const validate equals actually we need
to use destructuring so we need to add
curly braces around that and then we'll
set that to use
validator look I put some semicolons in
here I knew that was gonna happen
all right so now we brought in that
validator provider so now we want to use
it so down in the store method we're
gonna go to the very top before we do
anything with the database and we need
to add our validation so we'll say Const
validation set that to a weight validate
and we want to pass in request dot all
and after that request on all method we
want to put a comma and then open up
some curly braces and put in our fields
so title and then the rules we want so
I'm gonna say required and then we can
separate rules with pipes I'm gonna say
minimum of three characters another pipe
and a maximum of 255 characters all
right and then for the body I'm just
gonna say required and men three all
right just like that so that defines our
rules now we need to check to see if
that fails so we're gonna say if
validation dot fails okay if validation
fails then we want to session dot with
errors and then pass in here validation
dot messages and then we want to dot
flash all alright so each each field
will have its own little flash message
okay then we just want to return we want
to reload the same page so response dot
redirect and back okay which will just
reload the same page the form so that
looks good let's go ahead and save that
now if we were to go over here and try
to oh what happened let's see what
happened cannot find provider hmm should
did I not save it let's see let's go
back to start app J s oh I have auth
providers here this should actually be
validator all right save that that
should fix it good so now if I try to
submit without entering any any data
it's not letting me but the messages are
not showing so we need to go back to add
dot edge and we need to add some stuff
here okay and some of this looks a
little weird but it's just what we have
to do so first of all we need to put a
value so value for title and this is
gonna be double curly braces and then
again we want that old method passing
the name of the field which is title and
then an empty string so what this will
do is if there are errors and we have
something in here it'll make the con
it'll make the text stay in there all
right now we want to do the same for the
body so I'm going to copy the the curly
braces and put it inside here and then
just change that to body all right now
to show the actual errors we're going to
go to this first title input go right
underneath it and we're gonna use this L
if syntax alright so we need e l
uppercase I F okay and then here we're
gonna put in whatever we want to display
the error so I'm going to use a span
with the class of text - danger okay
that'll make the that'll make the text
read span and inside the span we want
money signed self alright now we want to
go to the end here and put in another
parameter which is going to be get error
for so get our four and then we'll pass
in the name of the field which is title
alright then we want to pass in another
parameter of has error four so has error
four and pass in title okay and that
will display the error now we want to do
the same thing for the body so I'm gonna
copy this go right under the text area
paste that in and just change these two
to body so now let's go ahead and reload
and let's try to submit we get required
validation failed on title I put
something in there and submit required
validation on body and notice that this
stays in there that's because of this
value we put here so let's go ahead and
add another post we'll say post for this
is post four submit and there we go so
now we have a little bit of form
validation alright so in the next video
we're gonna get to update these posts we
want to add that we want an edit button
where we can click edit go to a form
update it and then we also want to add a
delete button so that we can delete
posts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
