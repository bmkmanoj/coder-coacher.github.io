be building an html5 responsive website
from scratch and before we begin let me
just say that this video is going to be
geared towards beginners I've been doing
a lot of videos on advanced frameworks
with angular 2 and view Jas and so on
but I wanted to start to include videos
for the beginner many of you have
probably seen my web development 2017
guide where I made some suggestions
about where to start to learn web
development web design and I realized
that I don't have much for the absolute
beginner so we're going to go over the
html5 semantic tags and HTML in general
and build a fairly decent small website
for a web design company all right so I
tried to keep the markup and the styling
as simple as possible
there's no frameworks or libraries just
straight html5 and css3 all right so
let's go over what we'll be building
it's a fictional website for a fictional
company called Acme web design and it's
not the best layout and I'm not the best
designer but I think it looks decent so
it has a basic three color scheme we
have this this grayish blue this orange
color and then the light gray throughout
the site all right and it's a three page
site I didn't want to make this too long
so I didn't add too many pages basically
we have a header at the top with the
branding this is a h1 tag but it could
be a logo you could easily put an image
in there we have a simple menu with an
active state and hover state right here
we have a showcase area with a
background image that could be easily
changed has an h1 tag and then a
paragraph alright you can obviously add
buttons or other stuff in here as well
you can put a little form whatever you'd
like under that we have this newsletter
section with a heading and then just a
simple request form that they could put
their email in now this form isn't going
to work we're not doing any back-end
programming it's just you know just the
display form and then under that we have
three three separate areas with three
different images
now I would suggest using something like
font awesome and using some icons but I
didn't want to get into any kind of
third-party libraries or anything so
these are just straight images that
we're going to include here alright so
we just have the image the heading and
then a little paragraph and then a very
very simple footer with copyright text
all right so that's the home page very
simple I want it I want to keep this
really short so I feel free to add more
to it if you'd like so the about page
again very simple we have still the
header we're still using the newsletter
part but notice we took out the showcase
and then this is the main area we
basically have a main column and a
sidebar this just has some basic about
text than just a little blurb here on
the side in the sidebar okay very very
simple services page has the same kind
of layout as the about page as any other
inner page that you add we just have
some services which is a UL which will
dis little style a little bit and then a
get a quote form on the side here
alright so you can see it's very very
simple now one really nice thing about
this is that this is completely
responsive so if I go and I start to
make this smaller so when it hits right
about there it turns into basically a
mobile site okay so this is what it
would look like on a tablet and you can
see it's laid out pretty nicely if we go
smaller that would be that's around the
size it would be on a smartphone okay so
notice that the header has changed
there's no more floats we have the menu
directly below the logo the the showcase
area looks pretty nice the newsletter
form
no more floats we have the header and
then we have the form the button is now
blocked that goes full width these are
all lined up nicely if we click on a
boat okay see the newsletters form is
nicely formatted we have the page now
the sidebar is no longer floated it's
directly underneath the main column okay
same thing with the services we have the
UL and then we have the quote form down
at the bottom
alright so pretty pretty
I think it's a good example for
beginners to start to learn how to add
the the html5 semantic tags and a little
bit of css3 as well alright so if you
don't know anything about the html5
semantic elements or semantic tags
basically they were created to let the
browser know what content is where so
for instance we have the header tag
obviously you have some common things
that you would stick in the head or the
logo things like that the nav tag is
obviously for navigation we have the a
side which is for sidebar content which
is basically secondary content section
which is the main area main content
article which is used mostly for things
like blog posts footer has things that
you would stick in a footer all right so
these are the main semantic tags so you
might want to take a look at this page
from w3 schools which is really helpful
all right we're going to be using most
of these in this template alright so
let's go ahead and get started I'm going
to open up my editor I'm using atom
which is a really nice open source
editor I would recommend it if you don't
have something that you prefer already
all right now I'm going to just be
developing write write on my local
machine we're going to create a folder
and I'm going to call this Acme let's
just we'll just call it Acme okay and
then we're going to first create our
index.html page which is our home page
okay we're also going to create a folder
for our CSS files which we're only going
to have one and then a folder for our
images all right now I will I will
include a link to the files and that
will include the images as well we're
just going to have basically the
showcase image and then these three icon
images here I believe yeah that's the
only images that we're going to have so
let's go ahead and open up the index
page
inside of Adam I'm going to just open up
that folder which is on my desktop all
right so let's open up index.html and
with Adam we have we're able to just say
HTML tab and that will give us kind of a
boilerplate for a simple HTML file gives
us the doctype which is html5 our HTML
tags our head tags body tags we have the
character set which is set to utf-8 and
then the title tag alright so let's go
ahead in the title and we'll say Acme
web design and usually you want to have
some kind of reference to what page this
is it's the home page so we'll just say
welcome all right next thing we'll do is
link our CSS file which we need I
haven't created yet but we will so it's
a link we're going to give it a rel
attribute let it know that it's a
stylesheet and then the href will point
to it so we're going to say dot slash
CSS slash style dot CSS all right while
we're at it let's create that so in the
CSS folder we're going to say new file
and style dot CSS okay so next thing we
should take care of is our meta tags now
we're you building a responsive website
it's important that we put the viewport
okay so the viewport will set the width
of the template of the website so we're
going to say meta and we're going to
give this meta a name attribute of a
viewport and then that's also going to
take a Content attribute and we're going
to set the width so we're going to say
width equals and we want to set it to
the device width okay so whatever device
the raw mobile device tablet which is I
guess a mobile device desktop whatever
it is we're going to set it to that with
all right so you probably also want to
have some SEO so you want a description
and keywords and maybe the author so I'm
just going to paste that in all right so
we have a description I just said
affordable and professional web design
we have the keywords web design
affordable web design professional web
design I'm by no means an SEO experts so
I don't know if that would be good or
not but it's just something to have for
now and then the author you can put that
and I just put my name as the content
all right let's see let me just make
sure these are indented properly all
right so that's it for the head let's go
ahead and save that and then we'll open
it up in the browser
okay I'm using Chrome and notice that in
the tab we get acne Web Design welcome
we look at the source code everything is
okay all right so let's go back to Adam
and now we're going to start in the body
and we're going to take care of the HTML
before the CSS all right so first thing
is the header so we're going to use the
html5 header tag just like that all
right and if we take a look at the final
product we have the logo of the branding
and we have the nav all right so within
these elements here notice that they're
in the middle and you can see there's
margin on the side here or some space on
the side what we want to do is create a
class called container that we can wrap
around inside of these elements to keep
everything in the middle and keep them
from going way over to the side and also
to keep them from you know being aligned
to the left so let's go ahead and add a
div in here with a class of container
all right now if you don't know the
difference between class and ID everyone
is different everyone has a preference
some people don't even use IDs and
they'll use classes for everything but
the general the general rule of thumb is
that an ID is for something that is
unique okay so for instance the let's
just say the showcase area we're not
going to have that showcase anywhere
else on the page okay or any other
showcase element we may have it on a
separate page but not in a different
element we're not going to have a
showcase here and then a showcase here
so that would that would be something I
would put in an ID all right because
it's only occurring once a class however
is something that you're going to put
over and over so the container we're
going to put in the header we're going
to put here in the showcase down here so
that is going to go on a class all right
so that's that's basically how I do it
but everyone's different all right so
let's see in the header we have the
container then we're going to have this
branding area so we're going to put
another div and I'm going to give this
an ID of branding because I don't plan
to have this anywhere else
all right so in the branding you could
put an image logo but we're just going
to put an h1 and we're going to say Acme
web design and then we have the nav over
here so we're going to go under that
branding div and we're going to put a
nav tag okay so this is strictly html5
right here this nav tag and then in the
nav we want a ul which is an unordered
list and that's what's used for menus
inside the unordered list we want list
items okay so this will be the home link
so we need to put an a tag for the link
href which is going to point to the page
we want it to load which is going to be
index.html
okay and then the text for that link is
just going to be home alright so let's
go ahead and copy that for the other
links so we have home then we're going
to have a boat and we're going to have
services okay we'll just change these
links that'll be about HTML and this
will be services HTML all right so let's
take a look at that so far ok so that
looks absolutely disgusting but that's
because we haven't added any CSS yet all
right so before we do the CSS we're
going to continue to add the markup now
if we look at the final website here
after the header we're going to have the
showcase area which has an h1 and then a
paragraph so let's go ahead and add that
you want to make sure you go outside of
the header and we're going to put this
in a section okay so section we're going
to give it an ID because I don't plan to
have any other showcase sections ok so
inside the showcase we also want the
container because we want to contain it
into the middle there so let's say div
class container okay so in the container
we're going to have an h1 and that's
going to say affordable it's the
affordable professional web design all
right and I spelt that wrong I think
that's why I'm a web developer I can't
spell so then we're going to have a
paragraph and for this what we're going
to do is grab some dummy text from larom
epsom our lips some calm this just
allows us to generate some some of the
sample text so just click generate and
let's grab let's say that should be good
very helpful just to get something out
all right so that is our showcase area
let's see under that we're going to have
the newsletter let's just take a look at
that first okay horrible looking next
we'll have the newsletter that's also
going to be in a section we're going to
give that an ID of newsletter okay so
again we want the container and this
container idea this is you'll see this a
lot in frameworks like bootstrap and
foundation a class that will consolidate
everything and push it to a certain
width and push it in the middle all
right so this is also going to have an
h1 and this is going to say subscribe to
our newsletter okay and then we're going
to have a forum all right now obviously
this isn't going to go anywhere we're
not doing any back-end development but
usually you'd have something like action
equals and maybe process dot php' or or
whatever whatever server-side language
you're using but we're not going to do
that so it's going to have an input and
we're going to give it a type now you
could do text but we're using html5 and
html5 has really nice input types and
email is one of them so we're going to
use that we can also add a placeholder
which gives it basically some text if
there's nothing in the form so we're
just going to say enter email all right
and with html5 we don't have to close
these off like that with a slash if you
were using XHTML you would need to do
that but html5 is much less strict okay
then we're going to have a button we're
going to give it a type of submit so
that when you click it it actually
submits the form and let's give it a
class because I'm going to
this will give it a class of button one
all right and then the text for this
will just say subscribe all right so
that's the newsletter section take a
look at that okay so under the
newsletter section we're going to have
the boxes okay so we're going to have
these three boxes so let's make another
section and we're going to give that an
ID of boxes and you can call these
whatever you like close that and inside
boxes we're also going to have our
container alright so we have these three
separate boxes so those will each have
their own div so let's say div I'm going
to give them a class of box because
they're not unique okay there's three of
them div class box each one is going to
have an image but I'll put those in in a
minute they're going to have an h3 okay
so for this first one let's say html5
markup and let's just copy this here put
that in a paragraph tag okay and let's
just copy the div class box paste it in
two more times for this one we'll say
css3 styling and then for this last one
we'll say graphic design
all right so for the images I'm actually
just going to bring those in to to our
folder so let's say I am G so if I paste
these in we just have logo brush local
CSS logo HTML alright so let's go ahead
and add those so we're going to put it
above the heading say image source and
that's going to be in the image folder
and let's say logo underscore HTML dot
PNG okay let's just see if that shows up
okay so it's bigger than we want but
we'll resize it in a minute let's copy
that image I'm going to put one here
here we'll change this one to CSS and
this one I believe is logo brush okay so
there's our images now as far as the
markup we're just about there we just
need our footer okay so let's see in the
footer we're going to put a paragraph
and we're going to say Acme web design
and then copyright now they get the
little copyright symbol we can put an
ampersand and then copy and then a
semicolon and then 2017
okay reload and there's our footer all
right so the markup is complete for the
home page now I'm not going to go into
the inner pages yet I want to get this
the core CSS done first alright so let's
go to our stylesheet and I always like
to work top to bottom
we're going to start with the body okay
so let's say font will do font family
which I want to be Arial
and we'll put some secondary fonts let's
say Helvetica and sans-serif
okay so that'll change the fonts let's
take a look okay and then for the font
size let's do 15 pixels and we also want
a line height which is the line height
is the amount of space between each line
I'm going to say 1.5 save that okay now
I want to show you kind of a shortcut we
could do instead of having these three
separate properties like that what we
could do is we could say font 15 pixels
/ 1.5 okay so 15 pixels size 1.5 line
height and then put our font styles just
like that okay and if I get rid of that
reload you see we get the same thing
okay just shortens it up a bit now the
padding I mean I'm sorry the body I
don't want to have any padding or margin
so we're going to set that to zero and I
want to set the background color go
so the background-color we're going to
set to light gray all right now we're
going to use a hexadecimal value so we
need the number sign and then the
hexadecimal for the light gray that I
want is going to be that F for three
times save that and now you can see
there's no margin of padding there is
above the this the h1 because H one's by
default have padding on the top and
bottom and you can see the background is
now very light gray all right so the
next thing we're going to do is the
container now the container is a class
notice that I have the dot here when you
have a class use the dot the period when
you have an ID use the number sign all
right now the container what I'm going
to do is set the width now I want this
to be responsive so we're not going to
set it to a specific pixels we're going
to set it to a percentage of 80%
okay so that'll set that and if we
reload you can see that now it's cut off
here now I want everything move to the
middle not on the not aligned to the
left so to do that we can set the margin
to auto okay that will move it to the
middle and then the last thing I want to
do here is just say overflow I want to
set that to hidden so if something goes
outside of a div I don't want to have a
scrollbar up here I want it I want that
to be hidden and I want the content to
be hidden
all right so we'll do that now it's good
to comment your CSS this is where I want
to put anything that's global that could
be put anywhere such as the container
all right next thing we'll do is the
header so let's put a header comment and
we can style the header tag itself and
let's say we want a background and we
want that bluish grayish color so the
hexadecimal value for that is 3 5 4 2 4
a so if we go when we look at that now
you can see that we have a background
now that's a dark back
grounds so we're going to want white
text so we'll say color hexadecimal for
white is f6 times
okay so that'll change it to white
notice the link color didn't change
because those the links we have to do
separately all right but for now for the
header we're also going to add some
padding to the top we're going to say
padding top 30 pixels and then I want to
set a height but I'm going to set a min
height that way when it's responsive and
the screen is smaller and the text grow
or the the menu goes on the next line we
want the height to adjust so the minimum
height is going to be 70 pixels and then
finally I just want to border on the
bottom so we'll say border bottom and
it's going to be that orange color which
is e8 for 9 1d all right we also need to
add the pixels the width which will be 3
pixels and then the style which we want
solid okay so there's the header now for
the links let's do those so we want to
take the header and then we want the all
the links or the a tags inside of the
header we want to make those white okay
we also want to remove the underline
which links have by default so we'll say
text-decoration:none all right I also
want the menu to be uppercase and I
don't want to have to do it in the
markup we can actually do it with the
CSS by saying text transform uppercase
alright and then finally I just want to
set the font size to 16 pixels save that
and there we go okay so next thing we
want to do is we want to make this menu
horizontal okay we want to display
horizontally we also want to remove the
bullets so
say header and we're going to do ul for
the unordered list itself now by default
unordered lists have padding so what we
want to do is we want to make sure the
margin and the padding is set to zero
all right and then for the list items
themselves so header li we want these to
float left okay we also want to say
display inline and we're going to add
some padding now we want padding on the
right and left right now if we do a
single padding property like this it's
going to be top right bottom left all
right so this is setting everything to
zero we want the right and the left set
to 20 pixels so this would be the right
because it's top right bottom left and
then this would be the left we'll set
that to 20 pixels all right so let's
save that and now we have a horizontal
menu so the next thing we want to do is
we want this menu to be over here all
right at least for this screen size so
we need to float we're going to take the
nav okay if we look at the mark-up we
have the div with the idea of branding
which we want to float to the left and
then the nav we want to float to the
right okay so let's say we'll go right
here actually go down at the bottom and
we'll say header remember the branding
is an ID so we want to use the number
sign like that and we want to float that
to the left all right and then I also
want to set the h1 of the branding I
want to set the margin to zero so we're
going to say header branding h1 okay
we'll set margin zero
now for the nav we're going to say
header nav and we're going to float that
to the right all right so let's save
that see what we get okay good now I
want to move this nav down a little so
we'll also add margin top and let's set
that to 10 pixels okay
now you know what I actually want to do
I want all the you ELLs in on this
website to not have margin and padding
including this nav so what I'm going to
do is actually just use the UL so we'll
cut that get rid of that and let's put
this up with the global stuff okay so
this way all you ELLs
will have a zero margin and padding by
default all right I think that's a
better way to do it
so our header is almost done what I want
to do now is I want the current link to
be have that orange color and I also
want that the Acme in our logo or our
branding to be orange so what we're
going to do is go down here and let's
say header and we're going to have a
class of called highlight so we'll say
dot highlight and I'm going to put a
comma here because we want another style
or another property for this style and
that's going to be header and then a
class of current and then the a or the
link within that class all right and
then what we're going to do is say color
set it to the hexanol hexadecimal value
of e eight four nine one D okay we're
also going to set the font weight to
bold
okay and then what we'll do is go to our
HTML and in the Acme we're going to wrap
this in a span all right now span
is an inline level element meaning that
it's not going to make it go on the next
line if we were to wrap this in a div
then Acme would go on its own line and
we don't want that so we're going to add
the span with the class of highlight
okay so now if we go back and reload
nothing happens that I save this header
dot highlight I forgot a semicolon there
there we go all right and then we also
want the current now notice that I have
the current class and then the a I'm not
putting the actual current class on the
a tag I want to put it on the Li all
right so right here we're going to say
class equals current okay there we go
and then finally we want a hover state
for our menu so what we can do is say
header a and put a colon hover and let's
make color we'll do see six times which
is a gray color all right we'll also say
font-weight:bold okay so now we have a
hover State so now that the header is
down we're going to move on to the
showcase so let's go ahead and put a
comment in here let me bring this up
more so you guys can see all right so we
have our showcase we need that image so
I'm going to bring that in to our folder
so let's paste that in and let's go back
and for the showcase we're going to set
let's see showcase is an ID so we want
to go like that and we're going to set
the minimum height again we want it to
be flexible everything should be
responsive so we don't want to set a
fixed height we're going to set them
- 400 pixels oops am i doing 400 pixels
alright now for the image in the
background what we want to do is say
background - image and actually you know
what I usually like to do is just save
background and then we'll say URL and
then here we need the path now we're in
the CSS folder so that means we need to
go outside of the CSS and then into the
image so to go out we're going to do dot
dot slash then we're going to go into
IMG and then showcase dot P and JPEG I
think okay and we also don't want it to
repeat so we want to say no-repeat like
that
okay let's go ahead and save that it
looks like when I save it it makes it go
to the bottom like that I don't like
that
okay now that isn't where I want the
image to be okay I want it moved up so
what we can do is after this no-repeat
we're going to say zero-zero is the
x-axis so the horizontal we want to move
it up this way vertically and we're
going to move it up 400 pixels so I'm
going to say negative 400 pixels
okay reload and now you can see it's
been moved up that looks a lot better we
also want to set the text align to
Center and we want to set the color of
the text to white okay now we'll do the
h1 in the showcase
okay and we want to move this down so
we're going to add a margin top and
let's say 100 pixels we're going to set
the font size of the heading to 55
pixels and we're going to set a margin
bottom of 10 pixels all right now for
the power graph I just want to make that
font a little bigger so let's say
showcase P and we're going to set the
font size to 20 pixels okay so that
looks good
that's our showcase next we have the
newsletter area so let's say newsletter
that's an ID we're going to set the
padding on that to 15 pixels
okay fall around color is going to be
white background is going to be the same
bluish grayish as the header so that's
going to be what three from three five
four those are two for a okay take a
look at that that looks good now what we
need to do is float the h1 to the left
and float the form to the right I'm
going to do is move this up
all right so we'll say newsletter helps
get spell so newsletter h1 we want that
to float to the left and then let's do a
newsletter form we want to float that to
the right save it okay now I want to
move that form down a little so we're
going to add a margin top of 15 pixels
and then we want to style this the the
input so let's say newsletter now we
could just say input but I want to be
more specific and say the type of email
an input that has the type of email so
using css3 we can just use some brackets
here and say type equals email okay and
we're going to set padding to 4 pixels
we're going to set the height to 25
pixels and we're going to set the width
to 250 pixels okay so that looks a
little better now for the button now the
button remember has a class of button 1
and I want that to be global so that we
can use that in other places as well so
let's go up to where we have our global
styles and we're going to say button
underscore 1 okay so let's see what do
we want to do here we're going to set
the height of this to 38 we're going to
set the background to be orange which is
e8 e8 4 9 1d let's check that out
okay now by default buttons have these
borders I don't want any border so we're
going to say border zero or you could do
border none' we're going to add some
padding to the left and right let's say
padding left
xx padding right xx okay and then I also
want the color of the text to be white
and that's it so there's our button so
far so good now we're going to work on
the boxes area so let's go down here put
a comment in here say boxes okay that I
also got to put a comment for the
newsletter
okay so boxes let's take the boxes id
and I'm just going to add a margin top
to move it down a little more so 20
pixels and then for each individual box
will say boxes it's a class so dot box
and let's see what we want to do here we
need to float these to the left okay if
we do that let's see what it looks like
okay so we need to add a width now
remember what this is everything's
responsive so this is going to be a
percentage I'm going to say 30% okay now
what we want to do is add some padding
so I'm going to say padding 10 pixels
okay and we want it align Center
okay now these images I want these
smaller so what we're going to do is say
boxes dot box and then we want the image
inside of it okay we're going to set the
width to 90 pixels okay and the height
will be Auto as well
okay now the last thing on this page
that we want to do is the footer so
footer let's add padding of 20 pixels
let's add a margin top to move it down a
little bit
20 pixels let's say color white
background so background color and we're
going to do ee8 4 9 1 d okay and then we
just want to text-align:center save that
and there's our footer so our home page
is now complete
okay not too bad so now we're going to
create our inner pages so let's create a
new file and we'll call this about HTML
and we might as well create the services
page as well okay so let's open up about
and then what I'm going to do is copy
everything that's in the index file and
paste that in about alright and then
we're just going to change some stuff
okay so in the title let's actually just
change welcome to about okay we're going
to want to change the current class of
this list item I'm just going to copy
and then cut that out put that on this
one because we're on the about page
showcase is going to completely go away
that's only for the home page newsletter
can stay
boxes we're not going to have but what
I'm going to do here we're going to
change this section ID to Maine okay and
then we're going to keep the container
but get rid of everything inside of it
all right so let's save that for now and
then just click on about and it should
look like that and then what we're going
to have is we're going to have an
article another html5 semantic tag and
we're going to give this an ID let's
give this an idea of Maine not Maine
will say Maine call okay main column and
then in here we're going to have an h1
this will be the page title and we'll
give us a class of page title okay in
case you want to style that later on and
for the page title let's just say about
us alright and then under that we're
going to have a couple power graphs
which we can grab from lips um calm okay
so we'll just generate a couple
paragraphs we'll copy the first two
we'll paste this in now we're going to
open up a paragraph tag here paste that
in now we have two paragraphs so we want
to go to the end of the first one put
the ending tag and then start another
one and under that put that ending
paragraph tag just like that I'll save
it take a look and it should look like
that now we want a sidebar on this page
so we're going to go after the article
okay right after the article and then
we're going to use an a side
okay another html5 semantic element
we're going to give it an ID of sidebar
alright so in here we're just going to
put an h3 we'll say what we do which is
just going to be a short text blurb
I'm just going to grab some of this text
here and paste that in inside of a
paragraph okay save that and obviously
by default it's not going to be a
sidebar it's not going to float so we
need to do that the CSS so let's go to
style.css and we'll put this right above
the footer okay let's say sidebar and
it's an a side with the ID of sidebar
and we want to float that to the right
and then let's set the width to 30% and
I'm also going to set a margin top of 10
pixels all right so if we take a look at
that
it's floated over to the side has the
30% with but we need this to also flow
to the left with with a width as well so
let's go let's see we'll just say I
guess we'll say article or let's say
main main call all right so it's article
with the ID of main call all right and
we're going to float to the left and
we're going to set the width to 65%
let's take a look at that and there we
go now we have a main column and a
sidebar now I want this to have a doc
background what I'm going to do is set a
global style of doc so that we can add
that to other things if we want as well
so up where we have our global styles
will stay dark we're going to set
padding of 15 pixels set a background
Oh set a background of e8 for 9 1d we're
going to set the color to white let's
see what else actually no that's not the
color background I want that's the
orange color we want 3 5 4 2 4 a ok and
then we're just going to add a margin
top of 10 pixels and it's also add a
margin bottom of 10 pixels I apologize
if you can hear my son yelling in the
background upstairs ok so now we have
this class of dark so let's save that
and we're going to apply that to see
where are we in the sidebar we're
actually going to wrap a div and the
class of dark ok let's save that see
what it looks like alright so now we can
put this we can apply this class to
anywhere let's say we want to put this
on the second paragraph in the about we
could just put it on the P tag and say
class dark and reload and now we have
that which looks pretty nice so that's
the about page next we're going to do
the services we're going to copy
everything in the about HTML and put
that in the services let's change the
title okay that's all going to be the
same this class current though we're
going to take that off of the about list
item and put that on to services all
right and then let's go down here change
the h1 to services ok we can get rid of
the paragraphs
and we're going to put in a ul and let's
give this UL an ID of services okay and
obviously we need our list items
now each list item is going to have an
h3 okay so this service will say website
design and we're going to have a power
graph I'm just going to paste this in
okay so we have one power graph with
some put some dummy text and then we
have another paragraph that has the
pricing okay and then what I'll do is
just copy this li paste it in two more
times for this service let's say website
maintenance set this to let's say 250
per month and then this one here let's
change this to website hosting and we'll
change that to $25.00 per month
okay now for the sidebar we're going to
change this up a little instead of what
we do we're going to say get a quote and
then we're just going to put a form in
here so I'm going to get rid of the
paragraph and we're going to paste this
form in alright so if we take a look at
it we have a form with the class of
quote okay we have a div with a label
for name then a line break then an input
with the placeholder of name okay then
we doing the same thing but with email
we could probably change that type to
email and then a message which is going
to be a text area with a placeholder and
then for the button we're using that
same button one class that we used in
the SUBSCRIBE form so let's save that
and go to services
and there we go all right now we need to
style this list and the form because
that doesn't look very good so let's go
back to our style sheet we'll go down to
the bottom let's go right above the
footer and put in a comment here we'll
say services and you well I think it had
an ID of services and we don't actually
need to style that itself we just need
to do the list items so put an li in
there we're going to set the list style
to none which takes away the bullets
will set a padding of 20 pixels will set
a border around each one with a gray
border solid in one pixel and then a
margin bottom which will set to 5 pixels
and then a background which will be
another shade of light grey so II six
will do okay let's take a look at that
okay it looks pretty good now for the
quote form we're going to go up to where
we have our sidebar and we're going to
say a side sidebar and let's do dot
quote okay as a class of quote and then
the input I also want to do it for the
text err yeah the text area so let's
copy that put that there say text area
and then I just want to set the width of
these to ninety percent and a padding of
five pixels reload and then that looks
much better okay so the full version of
our site is complete now what we need to
do is make it look good when it's on a
mobile device because right now it looks
like this okay now the way that we do
this is through media queries we can set
media queries
basically say that this group of CSS
will only work if it's at a certain
width if the screen is at a certain
width so we usually put this at the
bottom let's put a comment here we'll
say media queries all right and what
we're going to do is say put the @
symbol and then media like that so it's
formatted like a function and then we
just want to say max width and standard
size for this would be 768 pixels that's
usually around where tablets tablet
screen sizes are as far as pixels let me
just move this up alright so anything we
put in here will only be affected when
the screen is at that size so to just
test it out let's say body and we're
going to set display to none which will
take everything off the screen save that
reload and now you'll see that there's
nothing there but if I go past 768 it
shows up so when it hits 768 that's when
those media queries will be in effect
all right so let's get rid of that we
definitely don't want that now a huge
part of what we're doing here is just
removing floats because you know if this
is float over here when it's a small
size we don't want that we want them
stacked on top of each other so let's
start with the header okay so we have
our header branding and what we want to
do is just remove the float by saying
float none all right we also want to
align everything to the center and then
we just want to set the width to be
pulse-width 100% all right so we want
that done with the branding we also want
it done with the list items all right so
we'll put a comma here let's say header
nav and then also the list items
themselves so header nav Li okay so
let's go ahead and save that
and let's reload and now you can see
they're on top of each other now I also
want the header to have a little space
underneath so we're going to put another
property here for header and we're just
going to add padding bottom and let's do
20 pixels all right so now that adds
some space underneath so let's look at
the next problem the showcase area
there's too much space right here so
what we'll do is say showcase h1 which
is a hundred pixels margin by default
but we're going to change it to 40
pixels
okay so there's not as much space so
that looks good now for the newsletter
again we don't want this to be float
either one so we're going to add it up
here put a comma and say newsletter h1
and also the form so newsletter form
save that okay so that looks much better
now if we go a little smaller than that
you'll see that the button drops to the
next line so what I want to do is make
that a block so that it's always on a
separate line and then make it as it
make it 100% wide so we're going to add
newsletter and we want the button okay
so we want to say display block display
block and we want the width to be 100%
save that all right and let's also set
this to 100% width I think it's 90 by
default so we'll say newsletter form
input and let's make it so it's
the email and we're just going to set
that with to 100% let's also add a
margin to the bottom push the button
away a little bit that'll be five pixels
okay so that looks pretty good now we're
going to move on to the the boxes so
each box should we'll remove the float
so we're going to add that up here as
well so boxes dot box save it there we
go okay very very simple so now we have
a responsive home page so let's look at
the about see what's going on here so
all we really need to do here is remove
these floats so we're going to again add
to this article main call and we also
want to add the sidebar so a side
sidebar save that reload there we go
services services looks good you may
want to make this button a block as well
so let's go here and we'll put a comma
and say quote button and we'll do the
same thing just make it a block and a
hundred percent okay and if you want to
do these inputs we can do that as well
let's see you'll just add to this we'll
say dot quote input and quote text area
make those 100 percent as well alright
that didn't really do anything that's
fine that looks fine alright so now we
have a responsive html5 clean coded
website alright so hopefully you guys
