framework web series in the last video
we went ahead and installed ionic in
Cordova and we just generated a very
simple blank application alright now we
have the index page open here and we
change the h1 to my two dues and we also
have the server running you can see we
have ionic serve running which gives us
our application in a browser so there's
a few things I want to do before we get
into creating our element UI elements
and stuff like that so let's open up the
app j/s file that's in our WW folder
alright so first thing i want to do is
we're going to change the name of our
base module so basically the name of our
application alright we're going to
change that to my two dues and I'm also
going to set a variable called app and
set that equal to the angular module
that way we can just run our for
instance this this run command we can
now say app dot run and if we want to
create let's say a controller we can say
app dot controller and so on alright so
let's save that and you'll notice that
when I save it the header bar disappears
over here that's because if we go back
to our index.html we have this ng app
directive and it's set to starter
alright but we change starter to my two
dues so we also have to change it here
okay once I save that it goes back to
normal
alright so what we want to do now is we
want to set up a router alright because
we're going to have a few different
pages we're going to have the home
screen which will list all the to dues
we're going to have a form to add to do
is we're going to have an edit form so
we're going to need a router so let's go
to app J S and we'll go after this app
dot run we're going to end this with a
semicolon here and then we're going to
say app dot config alright and this is
where we can actually set our router so
let's put a function in here
okay this is going to take two things
it's going to take a state provider and
also a URL router provider now state
provider is in ionic we have or actually
an angular which ionic runs on top of we
have something called States which you
can just think is as basically pages so
for instance right now our application
could be in the home state all right if
we click add to do and it takes us to a
new page with a form that could be the
add state ok and we can use our router
to navigate between states so first
thing we're going to do is set up a to
do state alright most we'll use that as
our home state as well ok so let's say
state provider dot state and then inside
here we want to name it so we'll call it
- dues all right and then we're going to
pass in a second parameter which will be
some curly braces and I'm going to say
URL the URL is going to be slash so
basically just the homescreen and then
we can assign a template so we'll say
template URL we'll say - dues dot HTML
and we can also assign a controller all
right so our controller will be - dues
ctrl so now what we want to do is create
these two things
okay the template hand the controller so
for our controllers we're going to have
one file called controllers j/s let's
create that okay you want that to go
right along with the app j/s inside the
J's folder so let's open that up and
we're going to say
app dot controller okay this is going to
be the - duze controller
alright now the controller function is
going to get something called the scope
all right and that's going to be used to
bind data from our controller to our
view and also the other way around all
right so let's um let's create a scope
variable and just test things out so
we'll say scope dot name equals Bob all
right so let's save that now you won't
see anything yet let's open up a console
here so we can see if we have any issues
failed to load - dues dot HTML all right
now we're getting this because in our
router here we have the template URL as
to do HTML and we don't have that so we
need to create a template now we're not
going to create separate files for the
templates we're actually going to put
them all in the index file alright and
before we do that I'm going to just get
rid of everything here and we're going
to use the navbar component so I'm going
to open up or is it our documentation
there it is alright so the I in navbar
is basically a header bar that updates
when the application state changes
alright so for instance if we're on one
page and then we go to let's say the add
Form page that will have it'll
automatically put a back button in the
header in the nav bar all right so it
does little things like that so let's
grab grab this and put that right in
there like that I'm going to change it
from bar positive to bar dark
and then in between here we want our
back button so we're going to say iron -
nav back button okay and that also needs
an ending tag alright so just like that
we don't need to put anything in here
it'll just automatically know what to do
alright and then under this we're going
to put in our nav you tags so iron
nav whew
okay and then we want to end that as
well okay now under here is where we're
going to put our templates okay so we
have what was it - duze template URL to
do is HTML all right so what we'll do is
put in a script tag and you want to make
sure that you put a type and that's
going to be text slash ng template okay
just like that
all right now in here we want to add an
eye in view tag so I in view and we're
going to give this a view title let's
set that to two do's and yeah that's
good
and then inside there we want to have an
iron content tag that's where all
content will go and I'm going to give us
a class of to do's content okay so now
let's just do test and let's save and
let's see what's going on oh oh I didn't
include the ID the script here actually
needs an ID of whatever the HTML page is
going to be so I'm going to say ID
equals two dues dot HTML all right now
that's not showing all we didn't include
the controller's J's file so we have to
put that right under the app J s
okay there we go
alright so now we're getting our header
to dues here as well as our content
which we just have test now let's make
sure that we connect our controller to
our element here so we want this to dues
controller and let's put that inside of
a div in here so we'll say div
ng-controller okay let's get rid of test
and the controller is going to be - dues
ctrl all right so now we should be able
to access the scope variable here so
scope name and the way we can do that is
with double curly braces and name
alright and now I save it and you can
see we get Bob so we're binding data
from our controller to our view to our
template alright so now that we know
that that's working in the next video
we're going to work on some UI we're
going to get we're going to get an input
field here so we can add it to do and
then we'll also have a list below it
with the actual - dues all right so I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
