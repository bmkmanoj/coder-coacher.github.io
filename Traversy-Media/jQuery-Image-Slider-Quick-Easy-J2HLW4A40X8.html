another short short project video in
this video we're going to create a
simple slider component with jQuery okay
now this is going to be really easy
because I want this to be a really quick
video much like the JavaScript one I did
basically we have a slider here and we
have some arrow box button and we can
just navigate through the images here we
can also go back so it's going to be
very simple and it's meant to be very
simple so let's go ahead and get started
now I have a folder called JQ slider
with an images folder and inside there
we have the arrow images as well as four
images here I'm going to put a link in
the description for you guys to download
those all right so let's go ahead and
start to create our files I'm going to
create a file here called index dot HTML
okay and then we're going to also create
a new folder called JX and inside there
we're going to create a new file and
we're going to call that main dot Jo
okay then I'm going to create a CSS
folder and let's create a file here
called
style dot CSS okay so that's all the
files and folders we need you can see I
have atom open of course you can use
whatever text editor you want and we're
going to open up index.html and let's
just put in our basic tags here so we're
using html5 so we're just going to use
the HTML doctype and then we'll open up
our HTML tags we're going to have a head
and inside the head let's put a title
and we'll just say Jake use slider okay
and then we want to link our CSS file
and let's say CSS slash style dot CSS
and we also want to bring in jQuery so
I'm going to go to code jQuery comm and
you just want to click on one of these
we're going to use three point one point
one and we'll just grab this script tag
here and paste it in right there okay
then of course we need to include our
own script so that's going to be jf /
name jf and that should be it for the
head area okay so now let's create our
body tags and this is going to be very
minimal and I want I want it that way
you guys can add on to it if you want so
we're going to have div here wrapping
around everything and we're going to
give it a class of container okay and
then inside there let's put an h1 will
say JQ slider and then we're going to
put a div with a class of slider outer
okay so this is the outer good and in
here basically we're going to have our
arrow images and then the you know the
main image is in between so let's do the
arrow left so source is going to be
images slash and what do they call it
arrow left dot PNG and we're also going
to give this a clap of fries and also an
alt tag of fries with a capital T all
right and then let's put the give here
this will be the slider inner div that
can change with four images and you can
add more if you want
and we'll do that in a second but down
here let's put the right arrow so I'm
just going to copy that paste that in
let's change this to right and let's
change this to next and change this to
next okay so now we want to put the rest
of our images so let's say image source
I'm going to put this on images slash
image one dot jpg okay now this is the
initial image that's going to show when
we enter the script so we want to give
this a class with active all right and
then let's give it actually that's it
okay and how this slide is going to work
is that each time we change it when we
click the arrow button it's going to
move the clap the active class to the
next image and also change the z-index
so let's go ahead and put in the rest of
the images here without the active class
so image two dot jpg and I'll just copy
this and if you want to add more images
that's fine scalable and that's it for
the HTML so let's open this up and see
what it looks like so far
okay so that's what it should look like
not too pretty but you know we need to
add our CSS so let's do that now so
we'll go to our style and just going to
paste each style in one by one instead
of typing it just to save some time so
the body we have Arial 14 pixels color
white and the background is going to be
a doc gray all right then we have the
links which will be white with no
decoration the one h1 we have I want to
align it to the center
okay the container which wraps around
everything is going to be 540 pixels and
it's going to have a 40 pixel top and
bottom margin and an auto left and right
and then also an auto overflow okay next
we have the slider inner class which you
want to set to the same height and width
as your images
using bigger images make sure that you
adjust this okay and that's going to be
positioned relative hidden overflow
float:left padding:0 4px play none so
basically we want them we want them all
hidden at first okay and then we're also
studying the width and the height to the
actual image size okay now what we're
doing here is taking the image that has
the active class and we're going to show
it and we're displaying it as an inline
block
okay so we're initially hiding
everything with the hell is it is it
already I've display:none
we're initially hiding everything and
then we're going to show just the active
image now for the previous and next we
want them both to float left we want to
give them a margin top we also want to
make sure that the most change tool
changes to a pointer when it hovers over
them and then we're going to take just
the previous and we're going to set the
margin right to negative 45 also the
z-index to a hundred because it should
always be on top okay if you don't know
what the index is if you have two
elements in the same spot the higher the
index the higher the priority is on
showing it if you have a lower in the
index it'll it'll go under that element
okay and then for next we're doing the
same thing we're just setting margin
left instead of margin right so let's
save that and reload and it gives us our
slider just no functionality if I click
this nothing happens so that's where
jQuery comes in so let's open up our
main j/s and this is going to be pretty
simple
so basically we're using jQuery so we
need to make sure that the document is
ready so document dot ready and then
what's when it is it'll run a function
all right now what we want to do is grab
on to the next class which is this arrow
button and we want to add a click event
okay so let's do
dot next and we're going to say you
could do dot click but I'm going to say
dot on and then put click in here okay
so on a click this function will run for
just to test that out with say
console.log and I'll just say click OK
will reload open up the browser console
with f12 and if I click that down here
we get clicked so we know that that file
is connected and working so now we're
going to create a variable for the
current image and a variable for the
next image ok so far current I am g
equals and of course that's the one that
has the active class initially and then
we'll create a variable for next image
and let's set that to the current image
current image dot next which will grab
the next element okay that's a jQuery
function then what we want to do is test
to see if there is a next so we can say
if next image dot length ok but you know
greater than zero then we want to remove
the active class from this image and put
it on to the next one so we'll say
current current IMG dot 3 means class
and we want to remove the active class
ok and then we also want to change the Z
index so that we put it on top okay so
for that we'll just use what 26.2 SS and
that allows us to change any kind of
style we want for that element and we're
going to save we're going to set the
index to negative 10 to put it
underneath and then we're going to take
the next image and we're going to call
add class and we're going to add active
and then we'll also change the z-index
now we're going to change that to
positive 10 so that's going to put the
next one on top okay so very very simple
logic we'll save that reload and now we
can switch we can go forward we can't go
backwards we haven't done that yet so to
do that it's going to be very very
similar to this so I'm just going to
copy it and we're going to change next
to priests and let's say you're going to
current image active and then Creve
image pre image we're going to set to
current image dot pre which is a jQuery
function okay and then we're going to
test for it
see if there is a previous image and
then we're going to remove the claps
from the current image just like we did
before and then add the class to the
previous image and that should do it
so let's save and reload we can go
forward we can also go backwards alright
so that's it for very very simple I I'm
going to leave it open for you guys to
add the functionality where it gets to
the end and then it cycles over again
so this will kind of give you some
homework so try and figure that out and
hopefully you enjoyed this and that's it
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
