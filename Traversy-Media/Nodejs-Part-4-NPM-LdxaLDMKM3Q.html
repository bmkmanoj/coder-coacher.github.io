over NPM which is basically the package
manager for node
it stands for node package modules or
sometimes node package manager and the
NPM JFS org that's the official website
and you can find basically all the
modules that are available you can see
we have the recently updated modules the
most dependent upon which are basically
the most popular I see Express which is
the MVC framework that we'll be using
the underscore templating system so
there's just a bunch that you can go
through so I would definitely suggest
coming to the website and looking around
if you click on API this is basically
the documentation for all the functions
and functionality that's available to us
we won't be using too many of these
there's some simple things we'll be
using like LS to show what packages we
have installed install which will
basically install all the dependencies
that we have listed in our package dot
JSON file which wiki we can create with
NPM and knit alright and it's basically
a file that holds all of the metadata
for our app it holds all the
dependencies we need you can add your
git repository for the app things like
that so that's what I want to do in this
video so if we go to I have a folder in
my C Drive called node apps which
doesn't have anything at the moment so
I'm just going to create a folder called
test app
all right in I'm just going to create a
file called a pas
now we can use NPM to create a
package.json file so let's open up our
bash let's open it up to the test app
folder because if you right click and
click get bash and of course you can use
your standard Windows command line or
terminal if you're in Linux or Mac and
what we're going to do is we're going to
say NPM in it
and by the way NPM comes bundled with
nodes so if you installed node then you
have NPM so it's going to take us
through a series of questions to compile
this file for us this package JSON file
first thing is the name of the app and
whatever's in parenthesis basically is
what it's going to be if you don't type
anything right so test app is fine
version will just say 0 0 1 description
so this is a sample app entry point all
right so this is going to be the main
javascript file in our case will be fjs
so we'll leave that test come in get
repository you don't need to worry about
keywords author you can throw your name
in there license
default this is C I'll just say GNU GPL
and then it's going to ask if this is
okay you click enter and if we go back
to our test app directory we now have a
package dot JSON file all right so this
is what it looks like it's basically all
the information that we typed in now
what's nice about this is we can include
all our dependencies in this file which
will basically be all the modules that
we want to use for our app so after this
app this main app j/s let's create a new
line and we want to say
Dependencies all right now what we want
to do here is basically add some JSON
data and we want to add the modules that
we want to use so this is just an
example this test app we're not going to
work with this after this video so I'm
just going to just just add a few
modules in here let's say we want to use
Jade which is an HTML engine help to
write HTML in your views now you could
put the version number here but what I
usually do is is just include the latest
version we can do that with an asterisk
alright so we'll include Jade and let's
say we want stylus which is a CSS
compiler type app and same thing we'll
say we want the latest version and we
want to put a comma right here alright
so we'll save this and let's say this
was a working application someone could
download it from your repository or
whatever and you don't have to include
any modules inside of the the actual
folder all they have to do or all we
have to do is go to let's see we want to
go to the test app directory
and CD test up alright so if we check
out the contents now as long as we have
that package JSON file we can say npm
install and that's it no no other flags
or anything like that and it's going to
go through and install all the modules
that this particular app needs so now if
we go to our test app folder we get this
node modules folder which includes all
the files for Jade and stylus alright so
and then these modules also have
dependencies which are in their node
modules folder they also have a
package.json and if you look at their
dependencies there's a bunch here as
well which all get installed just from
that npm install command
alright so that's that's how that works
probably somewhere later on in the
series we can actually create our own
module and upload it to the NPM registry
it's pretty easy to do but for now I
just kind of wanted to explain and PM it
and what it is you can also go to the
command line and you could say NPM
search and this is gonna this might take
a few minute or two but basically just
grabs all the it grabs the all the
modules in the registry and gives you a
name and description for them
and you can see there's a just a ton
and if you create your own module and
submit it at that will show up here as
well all right so I'm not going to go
through any of these but that's what you
can do if you want to view all the
available modules so that's NPM in a
nutshell that's really all there is to
explain for up to this point in the next
video
we'll be installing Express and we'll do
that through NPM as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
