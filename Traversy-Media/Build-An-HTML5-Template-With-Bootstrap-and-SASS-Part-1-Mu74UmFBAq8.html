a bootstrap html5 sass template alright
so we're going to use bootstrap and sass
is a CSS preprocessor and it allows us
to do a lot of different things like use
variables
mix-ins which are like functions
importing style sheets in just a whole
bunch of cool stuff so if you don't have
sass installed on your computer or you
don't even know what it is then I
suggest watching my getting started with
sass video which you can find on my
youtube page
now this template I'm kind of modeling
it after this Skype template all right
or the Skype website you see I have kind
of the same navigation the big showcase
area
not exactly copying it but just used it
kind of as a reference you can see
there's this very different down here
we're just going to have a couple blocks
here styled differently
and we're going to use sass because I
want to create basically an S CSS file
for all the objects on the site for
instance blocks okay I call these blocks
for the buttons okay we'll have our own
button s CSS file and then we'll combine
all those into one style sheet alright
so if you go down basically this
template is selling a fictional
application called sky app alright so we
have an image here and the images I'm
just going to excuse me
include in
the source files I'm not going to go
through in Photoshop and show you how I
how I created the screen here in the
wander that's just a different tutorial
all together so I'll just I'll just
include those images okay we have
another one here
simple footer a couple unordered lists
so that's the home page the about page
basically we got rid of the big showcase
area we have the search bar up top we
have the slogan here which you can
actually make the page name if you want
then we have the bootstrap carousel okay
really easy to implement we have the
bootstrap accordion over here we have a
meet the team basically some blocks with
some stock images and names here we have
a recent testimonial and I also want to
make a s CSS file called sections and we
can so that we can have just classes we
can punch in and make the background
blue green or or gray services we have
the tab want the tab bootstrap widget
over here got a quick quote form some
more accordions we have this little area
where we have icons we're going to be
using font awesome which is a just a
great source for icons
Blagh okay so the blog you can see each
post is formatted like this we have the
date the the author the category we have
another tab module over here I have a
featured video okay so these these
blocks here will be will have their own
class that you can just put in and it'll
be formatted that way comments over here
and then a contact page which has a
Google map we have a quick forum and our
location block and I also put the team
members in testimonial and these boxes
we don't have a register and login page
I might do that later and this template
that I'm showing you now is just we're
just using bootstrap we're not using
sass and I can show you the files here
basically we have our HTML files a CSS
folder with the bootstrap and font
awesome and custom style sheet fonts
images and JavaScript okay where we have
our jQuery file in bootstrap JavaScript
so we're not going to be building this
exact thing we're going to be
implementing sass so the first thing you
need to do is install that and like I
said I'm not going to go through the
installation there's a video called get
started with sass on my YouTube page
it'll show you how to install Ruby
because because sass runs on the Ruby
programming language it'll show you how
to install that the dev kit as well as
sass alright so do that and then come
back and also we install the program
called Scout which is going to help us
compile these sass files alright so the
first thing I want to do is create a new
project file or project folder and you
can create it anywhere I'm going to go
write my C Drive in my projects folder
all right I'm going to say new folder
and I'm going to call it sky out all
right so in this folder we're going to
create a few more folders okay we want
our FCSS folder which is going to hold
all of our sass files okay we want a CSS
folder we want in images folder a
JavaScript folder
and I'm going to go ahead and open up
scout
all right so what we want to do is
create a new project so you want to
click this little plus sign and go to
your project folder sky app select now
you want to choose your input folder
which is going to be your s where your s
CSS files are located or your sass files
output folder is going to be the CSS
folder Java scripts
images folder
all right and we're not going to have a
config and then down here for output
modes you can we're going to leave it at
development and the biggest difference
between development and production is
that the development version has all
kinds of comments on the production one
does not and we're going to leave it at
expanded and then go ahead and click the
play button but it's going to give us
kind of an error here and the reason
it's saying this is that we have nothing
to compile so we didn't create any files
yet so we want to go ahead and do that
all right so we'll start with our CSS
I'm sorry our s CSS folder and we want
to create a couple different things here
I'm going to create a folder called base
all right and I'm going to create a
folder called modules and a folder
called layouts
okay so basically the base folder is
going to have basically our basic our
base styles so if we want to style all
the links or all the h1 tags we'll put
that in a file actually let's go ahead
and create that underscore base dot s
CSS all right now the underscore is
important because if you don't include
that then Scout or whatever your
compiler is is going to go ahead and
create a base CSS file and we don't want
that
all right all we want is a main dot CSS
file so in this root directory of the CS
CSS folder I'm going to create a new
file and call it main dot s CSS okay no
underscore so basically it's going to
generate a main dot CSS file all right
so back in our base I also like to
create a file called normalized dot s
CSS and this is basically a reset file
if I sometimes I'll set margin and
padding classes for instance margin 10
top so that you can just throw that in
where you want to top margin of 10
pixels a lot of developers don't really
like that way of doing things but it's
just easier for me and I prefer to do to
do it that way regardless so in base
what else do we need here
variables okay so we want to file we
want to file that will store all of our
variables and these will be this will be
things like primarycolour
secondarycolour margin values whatever
you want all right and then the last one
we're going to create here is the
mix-ins fold file so mix-ins dot a CSS
mix-ins are basically functions so we
can have blocks of code and we can just
insert it very easily into our CSS
alright so that's it for the base
directory next for layouts I'm going to
create a header dot F CSS so if you have
code that is our CSS that's specific to
your header you can put it there put a
and I'm also going to put my navigation
file here so nav
all right so that's four that's the
layouts now modules is usually where you
have the most file well where I usually
have most of my files and that's because
I want to break things up too into
objects all right so I'm going to create
a file called buttons
okay you'll create one called blocks
topography
and this will be like headings
paragraphs things like that
and sections
alright oops sorry about that we need an
s CSS
and also create one called components
components will hold basically anything
that's not going to fit into any of
these for instance the accordion if we
need some CSS for our Gordian module or
the tabs we can put it in here
alert things like that all right so that
looks good
normally with a with a production
template I'll have more I'll have a lot
more than this I'll even have maybe
forms and tables dot s CSS but we're not
going to have I mean we're going to have
basically one form so we don't need to
do that the form Styles we can actually
we could put it in components or we
could put it in base alright so that
looks good to me for now alright so what
I want to do now is open up the main
file and do all of our includes alright
so basically I like to just put a
comment at the top here and we'll call
this guy app
bootstrap sass theme and then put the
author and the version
all right so now we'll do our imports
the first batch of files will be our
base say base base styles variables mix
ins etc all right now to import if
you're familiar with CSS then this
should look pretty familiar because it's
the same way that you can import using
standard CSS the difference here is when
we import it through SAS we're not we're
not making an additional HTTP request
for every CSS file okay we're making one
for the actual CSS file that gets
generated or however many that you want
generated so it's alright to have you
know to include 10s CSS files without
perfect without affecting performance so
base underscore variables dot F CSS
alright so variables
mix-ins
normalise
in base all right so that's good for the
base files
next we'll have modules individual sites
components
all right so this is going to be import
modules
navigation
okay what else do we have
okay so navigation oh no no navigation
is in layouts alright so let's do blocks
buttons
what else components actually want
sections
and then components
and actually typography should go at the
top
alright alright so now our layouts
excuse me page layout styles
okay so we have navigation header and
footer you could also do a sidebar here
if you want alright so that looks good
let's go ahead and save that and now we
want to go back to our Scout and let's
see if you'll go to our CSS directory
you can see that there's nothing there
if we go ahead and press the play button
you can see that it's now created a CSS
file alright now if we didn't have
underscores on our other s CSS files it
would have generated all those as well
all right now if we open this up take a
look at it basically we don't have
anything in it except comments all right
so that's all we see all right but as we
add CSS to our files it'll compile and
all the Styles will be added now in the
next video we're going to be
implementing bootstrap and font awesome
for icons and one thing I should mention
is a lot of times people will in their
scss folder create a folder called
vendors and put the bootstrap in the
font awesome and whatever other
third-party services that you're using
in that vendors folder and then
basically include them in your in your
main s CSS file I don't like to do that
I like to actually keep it keep it
separate just because I don't want my
main dot CSS file to be all cluttered
with bootstrap code and all that so I
just like to just download bootstrap put
it right in the CSS folder and just
leave it separate from my from my sass
generated files and bootstrap does have
sass and less functionality but I'm not
going to get into that because it's a
little more complicated this is kind of
geared towards beginners so in the next
video or in the next part we'll grab
bootstrap will grab fun awesome and
we'll create our index.html file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
