front-to-back we're going to take a look
at PHP cookies in the last video we
looked at sessions now the difference
between sessions and cookies is that
sessions the data is stored on the
server with cookies the data is actually
stored on your browser on the client so
in almost all cases I would suggest
using sessions over cookies they're much
more secure with cookies you can you can
set the expiration date even after the
browser closes but when you start
getting into that you probably want to
look into persisting the data to a
database but either way I figured it was
a good idea just to show you how to do
it just so you know so we're going to do
this this is going to be pretty quick
I'm going to create a new folder in the
PHP sandbox and we're going to call this
website so what do we add 4 5 so website
5 and let's create a file and we'll save
it as page 1 dot PHP and just like we
did with the sessions I'm just going to
put in a form here real quick alright so
it's just a form within a you surname
field alright and then what I'm going to
do is save the username to a cookie so
let's go up here and we'll put in our
PHP tags and let's check for the submit
ok so we're going to say if is set wait
a minute where's my code highlighting
why is this saved as an HTML or
displaying as HTML that's weird there we
go so if is set and we want to check for
a post and then submit because the
submit button has a name of submit and
right here what we'll do is create a
variable called username and we'll set
that to HTML entities and let's pass in
our post username ok so now we have that
in a variable so what we do to set a
cookie is we use the function set cookie
okay pretty simple and first parameter
is going to be basically the name of the
cookie I'm going to call it user name
second is going to be the value which is
going to be our username variable and
then the third is going to be the
expiration so I'm going to set it to
time using the current time function
here and then we're just going to add on
to it
3,600 and that's going to add it that's
going to set this cookie for one hour
okay so after an hour this is going to
expire and now what we're going to do is
use the header function to redirect to a
different page so it's that location to
page two dot PHP all right so we submit
the form we put the user name into a
variable and we call set cookie with
user name and then the value and then
the expiration so let's create a new
file and save it as page 2 dot PHP all
right and on page two what we're going
to do is check to see if that cookie is
set
let's when you our PHP tags okay so
we're going to just say if is set and
then we'll pass in here using the cookie
superglobal and we want to check for the
user name alright so if that's set then
let's echo out let's see we'll just echo
user and then let's just concatenate
here cookie we use your name and go back
into a string and we'll say is set and a
line break and let's put it else and for
that we'll just echo out username our
user is not set all right so let's check
that out we're going to go to localhost
/ PHP sandbox
/ what a website v / page one dot php'
unexpected set cookies what was I do
wrong here
oh I forgot my semicolon right here
alright so let's add a name in here
we'll just say it will just say John I
guess that's fine submit and what the
hell what does I do here I forgot the
semicolon again all right so let's
reload that and we get user John is set
we should probably put a space there
alright so now we have the cookie
username set - John now if we want to
check this out in the console down here
if we click f12 and we go to application
and you can see I actually have some
other stuff in here as well from doing
the testing and all that so what I'm
going to do is actually just delete
these those two and then this is the one
that we just added so it shows us the
name of the cookie the value the domain
which is localhost the path which is the
path to the folder that it's in and then
the expiration which is an hour from now
and the size okay you can also view
cookies if you go to if you're in chrome
at least you can go to settings and
there's a way to do this in all browsers
but if we go out to privacy and then
content settings and then all cookies
and site data and we're going to search
for localhost okay so you can see this
is all the stuff we have stored for
localhost and local storage and all that
we want this right here user that's
actually not the one I want just that no
username that's what we want and here it
is user name John domain path when it
was created and you can see it expires
at 10 so it was set at 9:40 it expires
at 10:40 and it's available to our
script okay so that's how you can
go your cookies from the browser all
right and I would see what I want to do
now is show you how to unset it okay so
we'll go we'll stay on page two and
actually first I'll show you how to
update it or how to change it so to
change it we can just again call set
cookie and make sure we use the same key
or the same name which is username and
we'll set that to Frank and then we can
set the expiration this time I'm going
to set it for our day so we can use time
and then plus and then in here we'll do
86400 and we want to multiply that by 30
and that will give that we'll set it for
day okay so let's save that and reload
page two and then we get user Frank is
set and if we look down the console here
and see user name is now Frank now if we
want to unset it what we can do is just
set the time to something that's already
passed all right so I'll actually just
copy this and let's say here delete
cookie paste that in and then let's just
change we're just going to change this
to let's say time and let's say - 3600
which is the amount of seconds in an
hour so this is now set to an hour ago
so we're going to set it and then we're
going to unset it and see what happens
okay so let's reload and then user is
not set okay so it's set it unset it and
then this fired off because it's not set
you can also check to see if there are
any cookies so what I'm going to do is
just delete our comment out the delete
here so it gets set again user Frank is
set and then right above this let's do
if
and will say if count and then pass in
cookie and will say if that is greater
than zero that means there's cookies
that are set
okay so let's echo out see well I go out
there are and then we'll concatenate the
count cookie alright so there are count
cookies saved and then else else then
we'll just echo there are no cookies
saved alright we'll save that and reload
and we get but let's put a line break
there alright so now we get there one
cookie saved user Frank is set okay and
if we were to delete that by
uncommenting this and reload twice and
now there are no cookie saved user is
not set alright so this is pretty simple
stuff now sometimes you may want to
store more than one piece of data in a
cookie and a good way to do that is
using an array an associative array so
I'm going to show you how to do that
real quick so let's create another page
save it as page 3 dot PHP and in here
what we'll do is create an array so
let's create a variable called user and
we'll set that to some square brackets
and we'll have a name okay we'll set
that to Brad and let's have an email and
we'll set that to let's just say test at
test comm and let's say age and we'll
set that to 35 all right so we have this
array now let's see what happens if we
do set
okey and we want to set this as the user
and then we'll pass in the user array
and then let's say time so I doing that
time plots will say h6 400 times 30 so
that'll be one day all right now let's
see what happens if we do that so let's
go to page three and we get setcookie
expects parameter two to be a string but
there's an array given okay so it's not
going to take our array it's looking for
a string now what we can do is we can
use the function called serialized which
will prepare the data to be stored so
let's say user equals and then use the
serialized function and pass in the user
array okay so now we'll save that and
reload and we don't get anything because
we're not outputting anything but you
can see there's no error and if we look
down here in cookies you'll see user and
then the value which looks really weird
but that's what it what happens when you
serialize it so what we want to do now
is we want to grab let's say we want to
get the name from that so what we'd have
to do is uncie realize it so let's say
user equals actually first let's see
what happens if we don't uncie realize
so if i say echo user that's not going
to work let's say echo cookie actually
we'll put that in user use your equals
cookie user all right and then we'll try
to echo out user which you would think
would be the array and then name so if
we do that we get a legal offset name
because it's this is an actual readable
array so what we need to do is uncie
realize it
all right and then we'll save and reload
and we get Brad okay we can get Brad we
can get the email all right we could do
a print R of this and take a look at
that and you'll see we have all of our
values all right so that's how you can
serialize data save it into a cookie and
then uncie realize it but again I would
suggest in probably 95% of the time I'd
recommend sessions over cookies unless
there's some specific reason that you
need to use cookies all right so thanks
for watching guys and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
