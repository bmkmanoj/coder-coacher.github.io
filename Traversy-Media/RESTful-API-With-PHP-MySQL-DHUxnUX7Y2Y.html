show you how to create a complete jason
restful api using PHP and mysql as our
database so this may be a long video or
I might break it up into a few different
videos I'm not sure yet but what I want
to be able to do is to make a request to
a URL for instance let's say whatever
our site is slash API slash customers
and we want to be able to get an array
of JSON objects returned which we'll be
able to use in virtually any application
and with any programming language that
can work with HTTP requests okay whether
it's a PHP application Ruby on Rails
angularjs whatever it may be
alright so our data will be stored in
MySQL and we'll be able to fetch the
data in addition to that we'll be able
to fetch a single customer we'll be able
to add a customer update and delete
customers all right now to help us with
this we're going to use the slim PHP
framework which is just that it's a very
lightweight PHP framework it's a
dispatcher that receives an HTTP request
invokes a callback routine and returns a
response okay it doesn't include any
fancy database model wrappers or
anything like that
so we're going to be creating some
custom code using PDO which is an
interface for working with MySQL and
other databases alright so this is going
to be kind of an advanced tutorial but I
will do my best to explain things as we
move along and you're going to learn a
lot from it kay we're going to work with
a lot of different technologies all
right so let's talk a little bit about
what you're going to need to get started
ok so you're going to need some kind of
PHP server
Pachi server with PHP and MySQL
I would suggest xampp or zamp gives you
a patchy Moorea DB which is a MySQL drop
in PHP Perl and some other technologies
and it's available for Windows Linux and
Mac you can also use WAMP there's MAMP
for mac if you want to just set up a
a lamp stack on a Linux box or something
like that that's fine too
okay you just have to have basically a
lamp stack running somewhere all right
so get that installed I already have it
set up I do have a video on my channel
showing you how to install it it's
really easy just download it go ahead
and run the Installer
alright we're also going to need
composer which is a dependency manager
for PHP and we're the only reason we
need this is to install the slim for a
framework so if we go to download and
there's a few different ways you can
install this you can install it through
the command line using a PHP command you
can install it through curl I'm on
Windows so if you're on Windows I would
suggest using the exe file here I
actually already have it installed but
if you go ahead and save that and
install it you should be able to access
the composer command from your command
line all right now the next thing that
you're going to need is some kind of
utility to make HTTP requests okay I
would suggest using the rest easy
extension for Chrome it's really easy to
use and it's really simple to install
just go to you know a chrome store and
go ahead and install it I already have
it installed so that's why it says
launch app alright but we'll get to that
later on and then finally I just want to
mention my learn top 10 frameworks in
PHP by building projects this is this
video comes from not directly from this
course but from a chapter that's just
like it that uses the slim framework and
we create a REST API so if you like this
video I would suggest checking that out
ok we use all the popular PHP frameworks
alright so enough talk let's go ahead
and get started first thing we're going
to do is create a folder to work in and
we're going to create that on our in our
xampp installation which is in my c
drive xampp and htdocs' alright so we're
going to go ahead and create a folder
and let's call this will just call it
slim app
alright alright I have this slim folder
this is actually my dev folder for this
project alright so we're going to go
ahead and open up a command line in
Windows let's go ahead and navigate to
that folder so I'm going to go to see
xampp and go to htdocs slash slim app
alright so what we want to do here is we
want to install slim using composer so
if we go to let's see let's go to the
user guide and if we click on
installation right here we want to run
this command this composer require so
we're going to say composer require slim
/ slim and then the version so we're
going to say 3.0 for now all right
whoops I said compose should be composer
so go ahead and fix that alright so you
can see that it says composer Jason has
been created okay so what I'm going to
do is open up my editor we're going to
be using Visual Studio code which is a
really nice open source editor and I'm
going to open that folder which is slim
app alright and you can see that it
created a composer JSON file which just
contains some jason has this require
with slim okay and then the version and
then anything we install with composer
is going to show up in this in this
object here alright now if you if you're
familiar with nodejs and NPM this is
very similar to your package JSON file
alright you can put dependencies in here
and then you can run a composer
it's pretty much like running npm
install with nodejs
alright and then your vendor folder is
similar to your node modules folder
that's where all of you are everything
you install is going to go alright so
that's where slim PHP is going to live
alright so next thing we want to do is
create our public folder ok so I'm going
to create a folder called public and
we're also going to have a folder called
source or SRC alright inside public
we're going to create a file called
index.php ok and that's going to be our
entry file so from here let's go to the
slim home page and there's actually a
really good example here and how we can
get started so we're going to copy this
and we'll go ahead and paste that in
there alright so I'm going to take a
shot at explaining what's going on here
all right so when we create a restful
api we create routes that deal with
requests and response objects all right
that's what we're doing in these first
two lines we're bringing in that request
and response object so every slim
application every route is given these
two objects as arguments to the callback
routine all right slim supports PSR 7
which is the PHP standard for HTTP
messaging and that's actually a really
great approach for writing web
applications alright next we're
including Auto load dot PHP which is
created by composer and allows us to
refer to the slim dependencies
alright this line here is creating the
main slim object so this is what we can
use to create our routes you can see
here we're creating a route for a get
request now if you are familiar with
nodejs and Express this works very very
similar okay so in Express we would
create our app using the express
function and then we'd use app get
create our route and then our callback
with the request and response ok this is
virtually the same thing just
in PHP all right now our route in this
case is going to be slash hello / name
now name is is dynamic that could be
anything and then down here we're
creating a variable called name and
setting it to whatever is passed in here
and we can use this request request get
attribute and then down here we're
taking the response we're calling get
body and we're going to just write to
the to the screen hello and then
whatever that variable is okay and then
of course we have to return the response
and we have to run app run to actually
make it work all right now one thing I
want to change here is the require to
vendor since we're in the public folder
we need to go out one so we're going to
just put dot dot slash right there
alright and then I think that should
work so let's go ahead and save that
and then we'll do is go to HTTP
localhost / slim app / public slash
index dot PHP then we're going to do
actually yeah slash index.php slash
hello
slash Brad all right and we get hello
Brad okay and whatever we pass in here
is what's going to show if we put world
we get hello world because it's taking
this right here okay putting it in the
variable and then printing it out so
that's working now before we start to
write some more code there's some things
that I want to fix okay so for one thing
I don't want to have to include index
dot PHP I don't want to have to include
the file name so there's a simple
solution using a dot htaccess file that
we can use to get rid of that also I
don't want to have to go to the public
folder okay so we're going to add a
virtual host in Apache okay to fix that
so let's start with the htaccess file
and if we go to the documentation if we
go to the user guide and
see it's an installation or maybe first
application yeah right here okay so this
is what we want to put in our dot
htaccess file so I'm going to just copy
that and then that's going to go in the
public folder so we're going to say new
file dot htaccess and let's just paste
that in and this is going to allow us to
rewrite it so that we don't have to
include the index.php so let's go ahead
and save that all right now to add a
virtual host to Apache which sounds
complicated but it's really not we're
going to open up our xampp folder and go
to apache now if you're not using xampp
you just want to go to wherever your
Pachi folder is and then conf extra and
then we want this HTTP DV host dot conte
file alright so let's go ahead and I'll
open that up with sublime alright let's
take a look at it we're going to go down
to the bottom here where you see these
virtual host tags now if you haven't
edited this file you probably have a
number sign right here it's probably
commented out this line you want to get
rid of that okay so that that's not
commented out and you probably don't
have this either but you probably want
to add it this just makes it make sure
that if we go to localhost it's going to
load the root of the web server but what
we're going to do is add I'm going to
copy that we're going to add to that and
we're going to say for this document
root we want it to be htdocs slash slim
app slash public all right so we want to
be able to access this this location
from whatever we put here I'm going to
say slim app all right so when we access
HTTP slim app it should load whatever's
in here which is our application so
let's go ahead and save that now there's
one other thing we have to do in order
for this
work this server name we have to add it
to our hosts file alright so what I'm
going to do is you need to run notepad
or have some kind of text editor as
administrator alright so you can't see
it on this screen but I'm going to my
notepad and I'm going to right click and
say run as administrator alright and
then what we'll do is open up the host
file so I'm going to go to open and then
the location of this is in the bean your
C Drive windows system32 drivers
et Cie and we're going to change this
right here from text documents to all
files and you'll see that there's a host
file so we're going to open that up and
then down at the bottom here you
probably don't have all this crap but
what you're going to want to do is just
add in your loopback address so one two
seven zero zero one and then slim app or
whatever you decided to use as the
server name so let's go ahead and save
that and close it up and if you didn't
open it as administrator you won't be
able to save it so make sure you do that
and then finally we're going to restart
apache so this is my xampp panel we're
going to go ahead and stop it ok then
we'll start it up again
and now if we go to http and we want to
go to slim app slash hello slash world
and there we go so now we can access our
application with slim app ok and then
whatever routes we create so let's go
ahead and close that up
ok so back to our programming our
regularly scheduled programming next
thing we're going to do is in our source
folder I'm going to create a folder
called routes alright and then we're
only going to have one route file which
is for customers so we're going to say
new file customers dot PHP
all right now as far as the structure of
your application that's completely up to
you you don't have to do it this way
this is just the way that I like to do
it for this type of application you
might have just a single routes PHP file
or you might call it something else it
really it's really all preference all
right now in this file we're just going
to require this in our index file and
put all of our customer routes so let's
go right above the app run I'll say
customer routes and we're just going to
require and let's do dot dot slash
source slash routes slash customers dot
PHP ok that'll include that file and
then what I'm going to do is copy I want
to copy these I want to bring the
request and response in so we'll paste
that in the customers file and also this
app variable alright and then what we'll
do is create a route to get all
customers and I realize we haven't
created the database yet that's fine I
just want to make sure that we can get
the actual route working so let's do app
get ok and then the route that we want
here is going to be slash API slash
customers okay and then that's going to
take a call back and let's say request
request response response and then in
here for now let's just do echo
customers just to make sure that the
route works so we'll save it and let's
go to slim app slash API slash customers
and we get customers good so we know
that the route is worked now we have to
deal with the database so let's open up
PHP myadmin which comes with xampp so
localhost / PHP myadmin and we're going
to create a new database called slim app
ok we're just going to have one table in
this database called customers okay I'm
not sure the exact number of columns
let's just say 8 all right so as far as
fields we're going to have an ID which
will be an integer
we'll say 11 11 lengths and we're going
to mark that as as Auto increment and
primary key so just click go and that's
our ID field
okay we're also going to have a first
name field last name what else did I do
phone email address city and state
alright and then these are all going to
be varchars which is variable character
all right and let's say 255 for all
these
and I've already done this that's why
these dropdowns are showing up for me
alright so that looks good let's go
ahead and click on save and now we have
a customers table with these fields so
what I want to do is insert some data so
I'm going to click on insert we don't
need to put an ID that's auto increment
let's just add some data here we'll say
John Doe email address address city
state ok we'll put one more say Sam
Smith phone number address I'll say 33
Burch Road City we'll say Miami Florida
alright so let's go ahead and click go
and now we have two customers in our
database alright so now we want to do is
we want to fetch these these customers
and output them as Jason okay for our
API now as I said before slim app
doesn't have any native database
wrappers or anything like that so we
have to kind of create our own so we're
going to use P do which is PHP data
objects and it's an interface to to
interact with MySQL it's an alternative
to MySQL I and you can also use it with
postgrads
and a couple other relational databases
now what I'm going to do is create a
config folder in my source folder and
we're going to create a file in there
called DB dot PHP ok and this is where
we want to
our database parameters and our
connection okay so let's go ahead and
save PHP and we're going to create a
class called DB and let's create our
properties okay so say whoops private DB
host and we'll set that to localhost
okay let's do our user so we'll say DB
user and we'll set that to whatever your
database user is mine I kept mine is
root ok then we'll do the password so DB
pass and I put my password in super
secure password and then the DB name
which is slim app alright so there's the
parameters now we need to connect to our
database so what we'll do is say public
function Connect and we're going to
create a MySQL connect string okay and
this is needed for PDO and I guess I
should pull up the PDO documentation
just so to kind of show you what I'm
doing here let's see connections alright
so if you look right here
we're creating this string here there's
MySQL which is the type of database the
hos the DB name user pass alright so
let's go ahead and add that in here
we're going to say MySQL host now host
we're going to use up here our DB host
value so let's say
this DB host okay when we're using
object-oriented programming when you're
using a class property you need to use
this alright and then we're going to do
c DB name equals this DB name and let's
see what else we doing so that's the
connection string and then we're going
to say DB connection I'm going to set
that to new PDO and then we're going to
pass in that connection string so mysql
underscore connect underscore STR okay
and this new PDO you can see we're just
putting together this okay so we have
the connection string then we need the
username and the password so let's go
ahead and say this DB user and this DB
pass look semicolon there okay so that's
the connection string now I just want to
set a couple attributes here if we go
back to the PDO documentation you'll see
we have this set attribute and let's see
is this what I want all right so I just
want to set error mode set the arrow
mode error reporting and then the arrow
mode exception right here so I want to
set those two so I'm going to say DB DB
connection and then we want to say set
attribute and we're just going to pass
in PDO double colon add our underscore
error mode
and then we just want to do para mode
underscore exception alright so that
should do it and then we just want to
return the connection and that should be
it for this file okay so our database
should we now have the properties and we
have the connect method so let's go
ahead and save that and then what we
need to do is include that in our index
file so let's go to index.php and let's
go right under the auto load and we're
going to say require and we're going to
go dot dot slash source slash config
slash DB allright DB dot PHP and let's
save that and make sure we have no
errors which we do unexpected DB
connection see what that is oh I must
have forgot the stomach yeah I forgot
the semicolon on the end here that
should be like that all right so let's
save it alright so now we're getting no
errors which is good now everything else
we do should be in this customers file
ok we're now ready to create all of our
customer routes and fetch our data and
then create our post and put and delete
so we'll start with this route here we
want this to get all the customers in
the database so first thing we'll do is
create a variable called SQL and let's
set that to the query that we want which
will be select all from customers and
then we're going to do a try-catch block
here ok so let's go ahead and we'll get
the database look at the database object
so let's create a variable called
be we're going to set that to new DB
alright and this is obviously coming
from our class our DB class then we want
to call the connect okay so we want to
say let's do DB equals DB connect and
that will connect to our database let's
save that I let's see what's this oh I
forgot to put the parentheses and then
the PDO exception
all right so PDO exception now if
there's any errors what we want to do
fix an exception what we'll want to do
is just help put the error as Jason so
we're going to echo and an air will put
error the error text and from here we're
going to take that evaluate exception
and we're going to call get message
that'll give us whatever error message
there is all right so if we save that
use of undefined constant string assumed
mask you all connect string all right
MySQL Connect string oh I've got the
money sign alright so no more errors
thank you so now we want to do is create
our statement okay when we're working
with PDO we need to create statements
now there's a few benefits to using
prepared statements one is that the
query only needs to be parsed once but
it can be executed multiple times with
the same or with different parameters
also the parameters don't need to be
quoted it's just a simple and secure way
to interact with the database all right
so what we need to do is create a
variable for our statement and it's the
norm to use this STM tea all right we're
going to set this to our DB object and
then we're going to call query and then
we just want to pass in that SQL
variable that we created up here which
create which contains our query next
thing we're going to do is create a
variable called customers and we're
going to set that to our statement and
then we're going to call fetch fetch all
and then here we want to pass in PDO
fetch underscore object for object okay
now you can fetch a raise you can fetch
objects and if you look at the
documentation it explains all this stuff
okay I don't have time to go over PDO as
a whole but the documentation is pretty
clear and easy to understand
alright then what we're going to do is
set that DB object to no okay now
remember we want this to be adjacent API
so we're going to say echo and then
we're going to wrap it in jason and code
jason underscore in code
okay and here we're going to pass in
customers so let's go ahead and save
that and reload and now you can see that
it's outputting our customers in a JSON
array and just to show you let's open up
rest easy and we'll go ahead and put in
our URL which is slim app slash
customers slob no slash API slash
customers okay we want it to be a get
request and we'll click send and you can
see we get the data we also get a
response of 200 which means everything's
ok all right so we could now make this
request in any application with any
programming language and we could fetch
our customers so next thing we want to
do is get a single customer ok so this
is going to be kind of similar so I'm
going to just copy this and paste that
in and let's say get single customer now
the route we're going to change to API
slash customer slash and then we're
going to have the ID ok make sure you
wrap that in curly braces now to get
that ID we're going to go here and we're
going to create a variable called ID and
set that to request get attribute and we
want to get the ID okay now for the SQL
we're going to edit this too so select
all from customers where ID is equal to
ID ok which is coming from the URL now
down here we're going to keep this same
thing we're going to use the object
we're going to connect and let's see
we're going to have the statement we're
going to let's change this to customer
singular and see we can still do the
fetch all that's fine that's fine
let's take this s off and then that
should give us a single customer so
let's save it we'll go back here let's
change this to slash custom a P I
customer slash one send and now you can
see that it just gets us John Doe okay
if we change that to a two that gets us
Sam Smith so we can now get individual
customers next thing we want to do is we
want to be able to add a customer which
is going to be a little more complicated
but let's go ahead and copy this okay
I'll change that to add customer now
this is going to be a post request so we
want to change get to post and we want
to go API slash customer slash ad all
right now we need to get the parameters
usually these would be through a forum
so the way that we do that is let's get
the first name so we'll say first name
equals and instead of get attribute
that's what you use for the URL if you
want to get the actual parameters and
you use get per am so get per am first
name alright and then you're going to
want to do that for all the fields I'm
going to just paste this in just to save
some time okay so first name last name
phone email address city and state all
right and then for the SQL we're going
to do an insert so let's do insert into
customers okay
and we want first name
what else phone email city and state all
right then we want to save values put
that on a new line and then in here
we're going to use this : first name
last name actually I'll just copy these
okay we just want to put a colon before
each one here and these work kind of
like placeholders all right and then
down here in the try block we want to go
let's see we're going to just get rid of
this stuff
and then we're going to do a statement
statement equals DB prepare and then
pass in that SQL and then what we want
to do is bind each parameter all right
so to do that we say statement and then
do bind per Ram okay we want to bind :
first name - first name okay which is
coming from the variable up here which
comes from the form that's submitted to
this to this row alright now we need to
do this for all the fields so again I'm
just going to paste this in
all right and then we need to execute it
so we're going to say statement execute
and then let's just let's just echo a
message okay this is it has to be in
JSON content so we're going to echo
notice say text and we'll say customer
added alright that should do it so let's
save it and now we're going to go back
to rest easy and we're going to change
this to API customer slash ad I'm going
to change it to a post request now in
the headers we need to tell it that we
want this to be JSON content so we're
going to choose content type application
slash JSON and then in the body I'm just
going to paste this in it's just a JSON
object with the first name last name and
so on make sure you have double quotes
around the key and the values and then
we'll click send we get 200 okay and we
get customer added and now if we go back
to let's see if we actually we can just
look in the database and reload and
there it is
Brad traversÃ©e okay that's what we just
added through rest easy so we can now
make post requests and we can add data
to the database again we could do this
through any type of application we want
as long as we can make post requests all
right next thing we want to do is we
want to be able to update customers so
I'm going to copy the add customer
because it's pretty similar say update
now when you do an update you want to
make a put request so we're going to
change posts to put and then we're going
to go customer slide
Update /i d okay we want to get the ID
using the get attribute so ID equals
request get attribute ID we still want
to get all this stuff and then for the
SQL that's going to change I'm actually
going to paste that in because it's kind
of long okay so we're just saying update
customers and then we're going to set
