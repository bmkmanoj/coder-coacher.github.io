hopefully final part of this series so
in the last video we've finished up the
homepage of our hosting website and we
also did the service pages which we're
pretty easy because they're all pretty
much the same now we want to do the
about contact and the login modal so
let's go and create a new file called a
boat dot HTML and we're going to copy
what we have in one of the service files
so let's go to shared HTML and copy that
okay and then we'll paste that in a boat
and just like we did with the other
pages we're going to change the title
folk all right now these pages are in
the top nav here which don't have a comm
a current class so we just want to get
rid of the current class on this menu ok
and then down here C we're going to get
rid of this oh did I put class about I
shouldn't did that right oh oh well
that's fine so we'll just leave it how
this is because it's in the right place
now but we're going to get rid of
everything within let's see this row
right here we want to get rid of this
row with the packages so let's see what
is this end ends right here so we'll
just grab this and get rid of it okay
and then for the h2 let's change that to
about or about us and then the P tag
will just say okay who are we alright
and let's see down here what we want to
do is split it into two columns so I'm
going to say div class and say column
large six medium six and copy that so
this side just going to have the image
of that person you'll say image source
and that's going to be IMG / person one
dot jpg this is a jpg and I think so and
then on this side we're just going to
have some text so let me just grab that
okay so we have an h3 a power graph H 3
power graph and then the final H 3
paragraph is going to be wrapped in a
div with the class of call out and
primary so let's go ahead and save that
alright and we'll go to the about okay
and then that's it it's done there's no
extra CSS or anything all right so now
we're going to go and do the support of
the contact page so let's create a file
here called contact dot HTML and we're
going to copy the about page and paste
it all right and then we'll go and
change the title contact and make sure
there's no current class and then here
let's see what I wanted to we want to we
are going to keep it in two columns so
we can just kind of get rid of what we
have inside of these and let's see
let's put well first of all let's change
the text say contact us get in touch and
we're going to put the form tag right
here and then we'll end it right here
okay and then here we're going to put
label say name and then we'll put the
input give it a type of text and which
also give it a placeholder and we'll
just say name and then we're going to
close the label all right let's take a
look at that so if we go to contact or
support rather all right so there's our
input now I'm just going to copy this
and underneath it we'll paste another
one and then this is going to be company
so say company name and under that under
that we're going to put the submit
button
okay now the submit button doesn't it
can go anywhere inside of a form it
doesn't have to be at the bottom as long
as it's within the form tag okay so
we'll say button type submit and then
value submit and then on this side and
this sixth column div I'm going to paste
another input and label and this is
going to be for email and then we'll
have another one for phone
and then another one for message okay
but this one's going to be in context
area so let's replace input with text
area we don't need a type and then it
also has to have a closing tag
okay we'll change this all right let's
save it okay there's a form way with a
button oh I didn't put an ending button
tag what button type equals submit call
u equals submit am I going crazy
oh oh I put value that's it's not an
input into button
all right and let's give it a class as
well we'll give it a class of secondary
our button secondary there we go okay so
I want to add a background to this as
well so let's put a call-out class on
the forum itself and we have to make
this overflow:auto or overflow:hidden
for this to go around the whole thing so
let's go to our custom CSS and down here
at the bottom go right above the flutter
and say dot call-out and we want to set
overflow to auto reload there we go
alright so the last thing we have to do
is the login ok the login is going to be
the foundation modal or reveal so that
we click on it and it kind of just pops
up so let's go to the documentation and
we'll go to reveal and this is what we
want to do so basically we would have a
link with the data open and that's going
to open up whatever we put in here and
that has to match this right here and
then whatever content we put inside will
be in the in the modal so I believe if
we go to our index and we look at the
login right here it already has the data
open login modal so what we'll do is
copy this and we're going to put this
down at the bottom now it's not going to
show until we click the actual link but
I just want to put it down under the
footer
okay and then we just want to change
this to login modal and let's test that
out okay we'll save it and let's see
what that that's the finished one so if
we click client login we get that so now
we just need to change the content
inside alright so let's see we're going
to change the h1 to client login and
then we're going to have a form so we
can get rid of this stuff here okay
we're going to have a form and let's get
actually that doesn't need any
attributes and let's do give I just want
to separate the fields with a row class
okay so in here we'll just put label and
then our input type text and let's give
it a placeholder and for the placeholder
we'll just say use your name okay and
then this one will have the password
okay it's change the typed password
alright and then under that role class
we're going to do a remember me so we're
going to put in a spin spin see it's
give it a class we want it to float left
so float left is a bootstrap class and
then I'm also going to give it a class
of remember and then in here we'll say
remember me all right so let's look at
that so far okay now for the switch
because that's what this is going to be
the switch see right here switch okay so
this is what it is let's go ahead and
copy this and I'm going to put that
right there
and let's see what are we going to
change here I'm going to change it from
example switch to remember switch ok so
you have to change that in all all
places okay
download kittens nope remember me ok and
then after the switch we're going to put
in our button so button type submit' and
login and that should do it
let's try it out can a client login
there we go let's put a space at
actually after the remember let's put a
little bit of margin there so in our CSS
we'll do remember and say margin right 4
pixels
there we go
that should wait a minute that should
have a closed
why does not have a closed button
I mean we can just click outside but I
thought that it did have an icon let me
just go back to the documentation see
reveal
yeah this one hasn't has it
oh right here grab that
and we'll put it right here all right
try that
there we go so now we have the clothes
button and for the button the login
button right here we want to put want to
give that a class of button all right so
we are done
so we've now created now the client
login isn't going to work on the other
pages unless you put the the modal code
in there as well so you have to copy
this and then put that at the bottom of
every page okay so if you had if you
were using like PHP or something like
that you could use includes so you
wouldn't have to do this if you use some
kind of template amore something like
that but this is more about just a
front-end HTML CSS type type of project
so we're not doing any of that so we do
have to include it on every page all
right but that'll do it guys I hope you
