solutions and this is a tutorial on on
how to create a blog using Joomla now
Joomla isn't isn't the first CMS I would
recommend for blogging I would recommend
WordPress if it's if it's a straight
blog site but if you have a Joomla site
and you want to add a blog to it this is
what you would do so this is a this is a
fresh install it's just a default joomla
template and all the sample content so
what we're going to do is create a blog
on this page now we're going to use
Joomla core from the blog and we're
going to use J comments for the
commenting because for some reason the
Joomla blog layout doesn't include
commenting so you need to use a
third-party component to have common
functionality so let's log in to the
backend what section expired okay so now
we're in the backend and the first thing
I want to do is to create a section and
a category for the blog so we want to go
to section manager content section
manager and now let's create a new
section let's call it blog save now we
want to go to content category manager
and create a new category and let's just
call it tech guy blog and you want to
make sure that you go down to section
and you you click select blog click Save
all right so now we have our section in
our category now what I like to do is
create a couple sample posts so I'll go
to content article manager and click new
now on the title I'm just going to put
blog post 1 and I want to choose the
section blog in the category tech guy
blog
let's just get some sample it's some
lorem sample data sample content so this
is just all lorem ipsum sample content
so I'll paste that in there and click
Save now let's create one more put a new
blog posts to look to create a select
section blog and category tech guy blog
and it'll just put some it's another
post save alright so now we have two
blog posts now we want to create a menu
item so we want to go to menus I'm gonna
go to top menu which is this menu right
here and I'm going to click new and I'm
going to click articles and now I'm
going to click category blog layout now
you want to give it a name give the the
menu item name just write blog blog and
over here you want to select category
and I'm gonna select blog slash tech guy
blog in here I like to put one column if
you leave it the way it is you'll have
one whole column at the top for the
first blog post and then you'll have two
columns you'll have the posts divided
into two columns which I don't really
like so
here and go to parameters advanced in
going to a primary order and I'm gonna
choose most recent first now I'm gonna
click Save all right so now we can go to
the front-end and refresh now we have a
blog one click on the blog and see the
first post in the second post so now
what we need to do is add comment
functionality no I mean this doesn't
look good I mean we can we can spruce up
the layout you know I'll make that make
some fancy titles maybe some background
so I mean I know as it is it's kind of
ugly but I'm just trying to show you the
basic functionality so now what we want
to do is you want to get J comments if
you use other commenting cyst components
too but I find J comments the easiest
most user friendly so you want to go
down and I'm downloading this from
Joomla toon calm save save the component
to my desktop now I'm gonna go back to
the admin interface go to extensions
install uninstall click browse choose
the J comments package we just
downloaded upload
- click Next
alright now this is the J comments
interface so what it says right here is
choose categories for J comments to work
it you could technically you could put
you could use the common functionality
throughout your whole site but usually
on on like an about Us page or FAQ page
you don't really want comments so we're
just gonna select the one section and
category we just created which is blog
section blog category tech guy blog just
highlight that and then there's some
options you can play with RSS feeds the
layout I like to disable there is it the
Smiley's this is the smiley so I usually
go to no you just play with some of the
settings the permissions you can set it
so unregistered yes can post and and you
can choose if that you want it auto
published or not and then you can choose
for each other Joomla core group so
we're just gonna click Save I'm just
going to click Save save it was saved
alright so now we're going to go to
front-end refresh our blog and then here
you'll see the add new comment likes
click on it it opens the single blog
post opens it on a single page at the
comment form there are some Jay comment
forms templates that you can use
actually we have some on our site tech
guy web solutions comm do you want a
little different but I mean that's it
really it's a basic blog there are modem
or there are other third-party
components you can use
tagging features tagging components and
they even have a wordpress component for
Joomla which turns your Joomla site into
basically turns it into WordPress but
that's how you create a simple blog on
Joomla so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
