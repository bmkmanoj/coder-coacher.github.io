to be creating an application using the
ionic framework
alright so ionic is a JavaScript
framework that's used to create hybrid
mobile applications alright so we'll be
building a to-do list mobile app using
ionic as well as Cordova which is also
known as PhoneGap alright so there's a
few things that you need to do to
prepare for this project first thing
you're going to have to have no js'
installed just go to node.js org click
on the download button and get that set
up alright that'll also give you NPM
which is what we need to actually
install ionic alright and you also need
to have the Android SDK tools now ionic
can also be used to build iOS apps but
you need to be on a Mac there's ways
around it but I'm not going to really
get into that so we're going to stick to
building an Android app alright so you
want to go to developer.android.com
slash sdk go ahead and download it
install it I already actually already
have it installed but really the only
thing you want to do is just go through
the installation the Windows installer
alright and then once you install it
you'll be able to open up Android studio
let me just show you real quick
now we're not going to be using the
android studio ide because that's more
geared towards java and native
applicative apps and we're going to be
working with just JavaScript CSS HTML
all right so once you get in I go ahead
and click on this little icon up here
this is going to open the settings and
then if you click on Android SDK you
should have one of these installed we
have Android 6.0 and then I would
suggest going to the SDK tools tab here
and then checking this right here the
Intel emulator accelerator as well as
this right here API simulators alright
so if you check those and click apply
those will get installed all right
because we want to be able to use the
emulator alright and that's pretty much
it I'm going to go ahead and close that
alright so get those things installed
and then what we're going to do is I'm
going to open up a Windows command
prompt and you want to go to wherever
you're going to setup your project
mine's going to be in a folder called
projects now you want to install ionic
first so say npm install and you want to
have this g flag here this is going to
make sure that it's global and you can
access it from anywhere alright so we
want to run that now ionic runs on top
of angularjs so if you know angular
that's your that's going to help you a
lot alright because we deal with things
like directives and services and other
fundamental parts of angular if you
don't know angular I'd suggest watching
one of my videos on angularjs just to
you know get familiar with the
fundamentals of it and what we're going
to be using for storage for our data
we're going to be using firebase alright
which gives you a free no askew l
database and it's really easy to use it
has a really nice and easy API so we'll
build a really simple service for fire
all right we'll use something called
angularfire which makes it even easier
all right so now what we're going to
want to do is install Cordova which is
also known as PhoneGap and that will
allow us to do a few things we'll be
able to use the Android SDK if you want
to create functionality that actually
interacts with the device with things
like its camera that you can you can use
Cordova plugins for that as well alright
so we'll say npm install g cordova at
latest okay we want the latest version
all right so that should be all set now
let's go into the my to do's up we
didn't create it did we so to create it
we're going to say ionic start and then
the name which we'll call my to do's and
you can choose from a couple different
boiler plates or starters whatever you
want to call them I'm going to choose
blank ok we want to start from scratch
that's going to go ahead and create that
and I'm going to open up sublime text
and just add that folder to the project
here so my - duze alright sometimes that
takes a minute to actually show the
files I'm not sure why but all this here
it's just asking if you want to create
an account at ionic oh we don't so we're
going to say no ok now we can go into my
- duze alright and if we do if we want
to look at what we have here actually
let's look at it through windows
explorer projects my to do alright so
this is the structure of the files and
folders the only folder that we're
really going to focus on is the WW
folder that's where we're going to have
our index file here we're also going to
have our java scripts right now
we only have AB js' but we're going to
create a couple others as we go now to
be able to see our application we can
use the serve command okay so we can say
ionic serve and that's going to open up
a browser window and bring us to our
localhost port 80 100 by default and you
can see this is what we have okay I'm
going to just shrink this down to the
size of a mobile app and if we open up
index.html you can see that we have this
h1 here that says ionic blank starter
all right so I'm just going to change
that to my two do's and save and you'll
see that this automatically updates all
right so that's that's really nice we
don't have to manually refresh it every
time all right so now that we have this
up and running I think it's a good place
to stop and then in the next video we'll
start to work on our UI as well as get
firebase setup and all that good stuff
alright so thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
