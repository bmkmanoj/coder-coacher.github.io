service and we're able to search for
something and have it pop up down here
in the console we want to take this and
put it into the application so let's go
to our search component and we have the
console log we're actually just going to
change this we'll say this dot and we'll
call this search Reds for search results
and we'll set that to the res artist
items and we if we're going to use this
as a property we need to set it so let's
go right up here I'm gonna say search
res and I'm gonna give this a certain
type of artist okay now we get this
error because it doesn't know what an
artist is so what I'm gonna do is create
a file in the root not in the app folder
but in the root so create a file and
we'll save it as artist dot
TS and all we're gonna do here is pretty
much just create a simple model of what
what an artist hit so we're gonna say
export class artist and it's gonna have
an ID which will be a number it's gonna
have actually want us I am semicolon
there it's going to have a name which
will be a string will have genres which
will be an array but I'm just gonna put
any for that and then albums is actually
going to be another type called album
okay so we need to import that as well
which will create in a second so let's
say import album from
dot slash album
okay so we'll save that and then we're
going to create one more file here and
we're gonna call this album dot TS all
right now for the album all that's gonna
have is an ID so let's say export class
album ID number okay save that and now
if we go to artists you can see that
there's no law there's no error because
we created the album and then if we go
to if we go to the search component we
need to import artists up here okay and
let's see we're gonna say dot dot slash
artist and now you can see that that
error is gone alright so we'll save that
now what we did isn't required but it is
it does make it cleaner when we have
kind of a model to go on so now we want
to do is we have that we should capture
the response or the data in this
variable so we should now be able to go
in the view and loop through this so
let's go to search component HTML we're
going to go right under the form and we
want to create a div and we're going to
check to see if there's any results to
do that we can use the asterisk and then
say ng if
okay so we'll say ng-if search res and
then we need to loop through those
results so right here we're gonna put
another div and this time I'm going to
use ng 4 and we should be able to say
let res of and then let's do search res
alright so we should now have access to
res down here for each individual result
so let's create a div give it a class of
row which is a bootstrap class and then
we want a 12 column div so calling d12
and then inside there we'll have another
div and I'm gonna give this a class of
search res and also well which is a
bootstrap class that'll give it a
background and a border and then let's
put an h4 and we'll have the results
name or the artist name so let's do
double curly brace res dot name okay so
now we can check it out and see if this
actually works so let's start to type
and you can see as I type it fetches the
band or the the musician
alright so that's working now what we
want is we want the genres to be next to
the name okay so for instance our Smith
would probably have genres rock
alternative whatever it might be all
right so let's go underneath and put a
div
and let's say put a strong tag will say
genres and then they'll do a span now
that the genres is actually going to be
an array so we can do another ng4 here
inside the span and we'll say what genre
of res dot genres and then we'll just
simply put genre
okay so we'll save that start to type
and you can see that we get these genres
alright so now that we have that we we
want to have a link here that's gonna go
to go to the actual artist page so for
that we're gonna need to use the router
and we're gonna do that in the next
video so for now I'm just gonna put a
link to nothing alright so now that
that's working good so in the next video
what we'll do is we'll start to create
the artist component which is going to
show up when we click on one of these
it'll take us to that page and then
ultimately we want to list all the
albums from that artist
okay so we'll get to that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
