to be a different type type of video
we're going to take a look at my home
office setup a lot of you guys ask me
different questions about where I work
and what I use as far as keyboards and
computers and all that cameras so I'm
going to just take you through we're
going to look at some stuff and I just
want to say before we start that I'm in
no way showing off or or saying look
what I have or you know you don't have
this and I can't stand those types of
people myself I just make this because I
have a true passion for technology and I
know that a lot of my subscribers a lot
of you guys do too and you may enjoy it
alright I've never been handed anything
I work for every single thing in this
room in this basement never been handed
anything as a kid we grew up dirt poor I
couldn't even play hockey because we
didn't have enough money so I know what
it's like to struggle at one time all I
had was one of those crappy little
laptops over there and that was about
ten years ago since then I've busted my
ass I've done a few different things and
I'm able to buy this stuff now I'm still
not even close to rich but I can afford
some of the things that I like alright
so with that said let's go ahead and
take a look alright guys so we have a
lot of stuff to go through and I don't
want to make this too long so I'm going
to try to be kind of quick so this is
the tech guy Computer Services sign that
I had when I when I were in that company
it was a computer repair company but I
also did like web design services and
network services and so on I don't have
it anymore but I do keep the sign up for
I guess for sentimental reasons and then
down here we have some laptop bags that
was my work bag when I worked for doing
computer repair and then some totes with
just some wires and cable and so on
alright so we're going to go over to the
main area and we'll start over here is
some acoustic foam that helps with the
echo what I'm making when I'm doing my
recordings there's a bunch of it behind
the main setup as well all black and red
that's kind of the main theme of this
setup and then over here we have some
shelves with some of the boxes for some
of the hardware that's in the pcs we
have the dual GTX 970 s
at this point these aren't the best
cards you can get now with the 1080s and
the Titan X's but I do have two of them
so they do they do pretty much play
anything I throw at them and I don't
really gain that much anymore anyways I
don't have time and then we have a
Motorola security camera so we have one
here and one upstairs so that we can
monitor it when we're out there's a
motion detection and all that stuff then
we have some products here just Maximus
motherboard another motherboard that I
took out of one of the other pcs and it
has a chip in it as well I think that's
an i7 4400 or something like that so
down here I just have my printer and I
think special comcast modem and then we
have the little sound system here it's
an RCA and it has a little subwoofer you
can see down there and then we have some
surround sound speakers behind the setup
then we just have some screws and
basically just computer parts to some so
RAM in there some Vengeance Ram red dell
inspiron laptop and then there's a
broken laptop underneath that as well
alright so now for the good stuff let's
just back up here for a second you may
think it's over the top and no one needs
six monitors but I'm telling you I use
every single one I'll have Photoshop on
one my recording software on one what
else so have my code editor my browser
so I do use all six now for the desk
itself it's an uplift desk and if I knew
that there were ones that were just as
and almost just as nice for much cheaper
I probably wouldn't have got this one
this one was eight hundred bucks from
uplift I know they have them for now for
like three hundred something and then
and they look just as nice they do the
same thing but I don't know I mean I do
love this desk you'll see if I go down
here and I click okay we have a bunch of
presets here if I click too
stand back you can see it just rises up
let me go back more and now it's a stand
desk okay so now I can stand up and do
my recording and programming and all
that all right so I'm going to put that
back down go back to one you can have
presets or you could just you know hold
down and hold up all right while that's
going on if you take a look at the chair
here I'm not exactly sure what model
this is I do really like it though I
like how it looks and it's really
comfortable back in the the other setup
video I did I said I wanted to get a
dxracer but it was too much money and
then so on in the comments mentioned
that you know you're in this chair for
you know eight nine ten hours a day
what's an extra couple hundred dollars
and he's absolutely right so I would go
get one of those but this this has done
me just fine for now okay if this starts
to wear out or starts to hurt my ass
I'll go ahead and get a dxracer or
something else all right so now on the
desk we have let's see we have a couple
of remotes one for the audio system ones
for the lighting strip under the desk I
just got some coasters because I was
spilling everywhere
and these this is nice and you know
sleek looking a nice little cactus plant
that I just got that I'm still not sure
if I'm supposed to water or not but I
don't know looks alright and then we
have the my microphone that I use this
is the blue Yeti not a real expensive
mic about 200 bucks and it's on a pile
microphone armed with a pop filter well
I don't really think the pop filter does
anything it sounds the same to me but I
do like how it looks alright now if we
move over we have this little pop guy
who's red and black of course nothing
comes on this desk unless it has red or
black in it and then we have the
keyboard which is a Corsair strafe now
what I don't like about this is you
can't change the color although it's red
and the matches
shut up I do I did kind of want to set
up that I could switch the color if I
wanted to all right but yeah so this is
mechanical so it's very loud I don't use
this when I record what I use is this
one down here okay so when you guys
watch my videos this is probably the one
that you hear and it's quiet it's very
cheap I think I got it for like I don't
know 18 bucks but it is the most the
quietest keyboard that I could find
all right so under the keyboard we have
this red dragon slip pad I like how it
looks matches the rest of the setup we
have a SteelSeries rival mouse that also
has the red LEDs and then from
headphones we have the corsair void
Corsair void and those are RGB we can
control the colors of those as well as
the mouse or software installed that
allows us to control the colors and the
effects alright so down here we have the
beast and this has different lighting
modes actually right now it's on the one
that changes but I usually have it see
if I can change this is that red there
we go I usually have it on the red to
match the rest of the setup and you can
see I get a little pop figurine in there
and this has the two GTX 970 s the ones
you saw the box for 32 gigabytes of
g.skill RAM on i7 a corsair water-cooler
550 gigabyte SSD - terrible - 2 terabyte
regular hard drives and then an eight
hundred and sixty watt corsair power
supply and a Maximus motherboard Asus
our isus however you say it alright and
cable management it's very very tough
when you have six monitors to have an e
cable management but I tried wrapping
them in those black sleeves there and
this this this uplift desk stops right
where it needs to if it went down
literally a centimeter would just bring
that power ship that on
that surge protector right off the wall
so everything works perfectly all right
so that's the main set of guys when
you're watching my videos this is
usually where I am all right so if we
move over here we have another rig this
is a rig that I built I don't know four
years ago or so I love the case it's at
Corsair 600 T case it has two gtx 770 s
it has an asus motherboard and what else
sixteen gigabytes of Vengeance Ram I
believe all right and then we just have
a one Acer monitor and there's my old
keyboard I used to use this now this is
a Logitech G 19 usually has a little
display there unless you're one it's not
working though all right now if we go
over here we have a couple HP monitors
and one is hooked up to my server which
is running plex so I can stream movies
all around my house and the other is
hooked to that machine right there which
is the cases in NZXT I think it's an H
440 which is really nice but the
hardware isn't really anything special
under there we have a little new mark DJ
mixer nothing special it's just to play
around on it's nothing you know it's not
professional DJ equipment and then we
just have a cheap bum red LED keyboard
alright so over here is the server okay
so this server is running Linux Ubuntu
and it has I'm pretty sure it has six I
did this in the last video - it can't
get this damn thing open
I think it has six - terabyte drives all
right so about 12 terabytes but it's in
raid 1 so
the data is protected alright that's
that and then we have the little
Synology disk station
this has two drives in it each one is 2
terabytes and they're in raid one so
there's actually only 2 terabytes of
storage but that's that's plenty for
what I need it for I use this for all my
edgy onyx courses for my YouTube videos
all the videos you see online are
actually store on that little machine
right there alright and if one drive
fails the other one will will save the
data will save the day
alright and then over here we just have
a 4 to 2 inch Philips TV
that's quite old that's about I don't
know eight years old or so we get a ps4
Xbox 360 we have an old Nintendo 64 and
then it will and then a machine that
actually plays regular Nintendo and
Super Nintendo games and get some games
over here mostly Call of Duty that's
mostly when I play when I do play and we
get a fireplace here period some
pictures of my family my two kids which
are much older now my daughter is now 10
and my son is now seven my son has
severe autism he can't speak he's
nonverbal but he's a happy little kid
and then there's a set in Philadelphia I
think on vacation I should update those
those photos over quite old and let's
see over here we have basically the
kiddie area for my son we have his
little workbench and some trucks I tried
to make it look neat alright but he
 it all up and here we have some
more toys and so on alright and then
over here we have a little futon and
coffee table I want to replace that with
a nice couch someday my wife lets me and
we get some lighting here you can see I
have one of them on this lime Studio
lighting and I have the whole green
screen there I haven't really used it
for anything
like I said in my last video I wanted to
uh I wanted to do like like reviews tech
reviews and so on so I have all the
stuff to do it I just haven't gotten
around to it I'm too busy with my other
stuff you can see we get the little Sony
HD handy cam on there all right so
that's that another tripod and then over
here we have a shelf big bookshelf that
has a whole bunch of stuff on it this is
all basically harddrive stuff external
hard drive internal enclosures things
like that this is you see boxes for our
iPhones and so on the cam camera quarter
box some corsair cables routers down
here we have boxes for the yeti for the
ipad the headphones i7 core we have a
pair of fake beats headphones there we
have a VR hemo do homido or whatever we
snap you strap it on your cell phone and
becomes a VR machine and then down here
we just have some boxes and at the
bottom of the monitors and so on and
then back here we just have some old
computers I don't know if you can see
that a couple old like Best Buy type
computers alright so I think that's it
guys oh I didn't show you the shelf over
here so like I said I started collecting
these little pop characters whenever my
wife goes to Target I'll have her buy me
one they thought it was funny and I got
me a friggin Sesame Street Bert one but
whatever I put it up there and then we
just have the keyboard mouse box little
VR set and that's that's about it so I
will be doing a giveaway soon because I
do have a bunch of stuff that that I
don't use it's not the best stuff that's
probably why I don't use it but you know
it'll be a nice little package for you
guys so I might do that for my hundred
subscriber
subscriber you know put a little package
together and you know let you guys apply
to win or whatever
however that works all right so
hopefully you enjoyed this little tour
and hopefully don't think I'm a dickhead
that's just showing off that's not the
case guys I love you guys and I
appreciate all of you so god bless and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
