on just updating your Drupal 7 site to a
newer version it's if a security update
so it's not a major update like Drupal 6
- Drupal 7 I think I have 7.19 installed
and I'm gonna update to 7.20 so I'm
logged in as admin and this is just a
it's a drug rehabilitation directory
it's one of my websites so to update
obviously you login as admin and then if
you no matter where you go if we go to
configuration if you if your site is not
up-to-date you'll have this red warning
telling you to update so we can see the
available updates and here we have the
droop diese the modules that aren't
up-to-date and these are the core
updates so you'll see I have one 7.19
installed and they recommend 7.20 and
what you want to do is just download the
latest version you can do that just by
clicking on this Drupal core link and
it'll automatically take you to the
newest version and you want to download
you can do either the time or the zip
file and download the zip file alright
so now you have the new you have the new
files for the new package and you need
to upload it to your server so I'm gonna
open FileZilla you can use another FTP
client or your file manager for your
host or whatever and I'm going to
connect to my
websites
now this is the root of my Drupal
install so I'm gonna go and get the
update the updated zip file that I just
downloaded which is right here Drupal 7
and I'm gonna extract it
so now you should have this folder
called Drupal 7.20 and then you'll see
these files includes misc modules
they're all here includes mists modules
and so you just got to overwrite
everything I don't know if I mentioned
this but you should definitely
definitely do a backup before you do
this do a backup of all your site files
and then backup your database you can do
that through either PHP myadmin or you
can do it an easier way and download the
backup and migrate plug-in module sorry
for Drupal and it's pretty much just a
one click data database update so
definitely back up and I'm just going to
check these files because sometimes
things can happen you see we have site
all sites all and then if you go in your
themes folder
I'm using the responsive theme so just
make sure that you don't have any
anything in the update you downloaded
any themes custom themes because you
don't want to write overwrite anything
so yeah I know we can just gonna drag it
over select everything drag it over
and it's gonna prompt you to ask if you
want to overwrite I'm just gonna always
allow this so this is gonna take a while
so I'm gonna pause the video and I'll be
back after everything uploads all right
so I'm back guys and everything's
uploaded and I'm going to my site and
I'll go to configuration and you'll see
that red bar is gone and we can also
click on reports up here and go to
available updates and you'll see our
Drupal core is updated to 7.20
so very easy to update just make sure I
can you have to back up back up all your
files and databases before you do any
kind of update like this because it can
mess up some stuff depending on what
modules you're using or what code you've
customized or anything like that
and then just go through and make sure
the pages are all accessible do a search
just to make sure everything's working
views this websites using views so make
sure it's all working yeah
alright so that's how you update you do
a simple security update on Drupal 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
