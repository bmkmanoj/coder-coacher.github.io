framework 2 miniseries in the last video
we went ahead and installed Zend and got
our folder and file structure set up now
we're gonna do is we're gonna create a
module
okay so Zend works on what's called a
module and it's basically encapsulate a
certain aspect of your application
alright so in our case we're gonna have
an album module alright now if we look
in the file structure here and you have
a folder called module and inside there
we have a folder called application this
is basically the core module ok so this
holds things like bootstrapping and
configs and for the for the entire
application alright so we don't want to
go in there we want to create our own
module and if we look at the
documentation you can see here we're
going to create a folder called album
inside of the module folder and we're
gonna create all of these inside alright
so the entire model-view-controller for
the album will be in this folder alright
so let's go ahead and open up our my
albums here and go into module and we're
gonna create a new folder called album
ok and then in there we're gonna create
a config folder we want a source folder
alright and then inside source we want
another album folder and this is where
the controller goes so I'll create a
folder called controller and then create
a folder called form and then we also
want a model folder alright and in
addition to config and source we also
want a view folder okay that'll
obviously hold our views okay inside
view we're going to create
album and then once again inside there
we're gonna create another album folder
all right so that's that's the structure
for the album module so the next thing
we want to do is we want to create a
file called module dot PHP and we want
to create that inside of the album
folder so inside module and we have
album and we're going to create a new
file and we're going to call this module
dot PHP alright and then over here you
can see we have the code that we need to
put in there it's gonna be a class
called module and we're gonna have two
methods we're gonna have get auto loader
config and then get config alright so
let's go ahead and copy this whole thing
okay and we'll paste that inside module
dot PHP and then we need to add a PHP
tag up here now see this is what I was
talking about when I said that Zend is
configuration over convention okay so we
just have to we have to do a lot of
different things to get our application
configured and up and running and all
this is doing is getting the autoloader
so you can autoload classes and also
getting our config file so let's save
that and then the next thing we have to
do is we have to set up the autoload
okay so there's two options we could
create a file called Auto load class map
dot PHP or we could just add this auto
load object to our composer dot JSON
file alright so we're gonna do this one
let's copy that and then over in our
folder structure we have this composer
dot Jason we're gonna go to that and
we're just gonna throw a comma in there
and then paste that in just like that
so let's save this and then what we need
to do now is we need to run composer
update okay so let's go back into or
let's open up a command line I'm just
going to navigate to the project okay so
we want to run since we install composer
in Windows it Sacketts we can access it
globally so we'll say composer update
all right so that's all set now what
that did let me just refresh our folders
here if we go into vendor and then
composer and then this autoload
namespaces you should now have this
album object or album array okay so
that's what that did so what we need to
do now is we need to create our module
dot config file alright so this is gonna
go inside of module album config alright
so we'll create a new file and let's
save it as module dot config dot PHP
alright and then if we go back over here
what we want is this array copy
ok so we're setting up our array with
the controller's array and we have this
in vocables array alright and that's
just pointing to our controller file and
then we have the view manager so make
sure that that's saved and then the next
thing we need to do is we need to inform
the application of our new module so to
do that we need to open the application
dot config file and that's going to be
that's gonna be in the route config so
right here alright and then what we'll
do is in addition to application we want
album
so let's save that and let's see what we
have
alright so I guess we're gonna have to
create that class map file let's see
I've had this issue before I don't know
why I didn't remember that we need to
create this file right here
auto load class map okay that's gonna go
in module album yeah just in module and
an album so we'll create a new file and
let's see we're gonna save it as this
okay and then all we want to do is put
an empty array here that we need PHP
tags though at least the top one save
and let's see there we go okay so that's
all set so now we have our album module
setup so we're ready to start on our MVC
structures so we'll do that in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
