to make a quick video announcing my
newest udemy course which is
materialized CSS from scratch with five
projects 119 is just the younameit price
I'm gonna put a limited promo link in
the description for just ten bucks now I
know many of you have taken my bootstrap
4 course and this is the same type of
thing only you'll be learning
materialise which is a great framework
that's based on Google's material design
scheme ok so this course is for anyone
that knows basic HTML and CSS we're
gonna start from scratch with a custom
sandbox to learn all the CSS and
JavaScript components and then we'll
move on to create some really
good-looking real-world projects which
I'll show you in a second now I know
that a lot of you guys are JavaScript
programmers PHP Python programmers etc
and this is a great course to give you
some front-end UI creation skills not
just materialized but html5 semantics we
do some css3 custom css3 like image
overlays things like that we do some
custom JavaScript and jQuery for more
interactive themes and overall I think
you guys will really enjoy it and you're
free to use and customize the themes and
your own projects and portfolio alright
so let's take a look at what we'll be
building in the course so like I said
we're gonna start off with a sandbox so
the first four sections are learning
sections and it's basically a custom UI
that I built built of just a bunch of
HTML pages so you can see this is for
the buttons and icons lecture for text
and background colors we have the nav
bar collections and badges so we're just
going to go through all the different
classes all the different CSS components
we have all the forms all the different
form input stuff like that and then we
have the JavaScript components so like
the slider or the carousel feature
discovery which is really cool we have
the material box which is like a
lightbox the slider so this is a image
slider with some captions the
modal's of course so if we want to a
modal or a fixed footer modal bottom
sheet modal okay we also have like
parallax parallax effects side nav okay
so all the components that are included
with the framework and then once we get
through that we're gonna start on our
project so the first one is called
travel ville which is kind of like a
theme for I guess travel agencies and
it's a it's a one-page theme and we're
using a slider as you can see with some
captions that come in from all different
sides and for the navigation if I click
on like search it'll it'll scroll down
nicely to that area we're using the
scroll spy component that materialise
uses okay for these search destinations
we're using autocomplete so like if I
put an A in here you can see all this
stuff will come up and we can search for
a rubra obviously this is just a
front-end course so it's it doesn't have
any kind of database or anything like
that then we have some boxes with some
material icons some cards with some
images and some icons here these are
actually fun awesome five icons then we
have a photo gallery using material box
and a contact form
alright so pretty simple project but
looks really nice and all of these are
completely responsive you can see if I
go down to here it's very very
responsive and everything is just
stacked in one row okay we still have
all of our images and they still open up
in a nice materialized box or lightbox
and we have our side nav alright so
that's the first project then we're
doing a project called kazoo which is
like a cloud hosting theme I got the
idea from Heroku kind of took some ideas
from there so their style their color
scheme and so on and some of the content
so we just have like a basic showcase
area some icons the about us we did some
CSS overlays here so that we have the
purple overlay over some high quality
images some
programming language images here and
then we have the testimonial which is a
slider as well we can go through
testimonials we have a couple pages this
is the solutions page we're using the
tab component here and then we just have
some other icons and then we have the
signup page which is basically just
we're using the grid here we're using a
signup form with a select list and then
we have a login modal alright and we
have some font awesome social icons up
here so pretty simple project but I
think it looks really nice and of course
it's responsive so if I make it smaller
you can see everything stacks nicely we
have our sidebar get the login link here
as well so that's the second project the
third one is going to be probably the
most interactive one this is madman it's
an admin dashboard and notice that if I
reload we have some cool effects going
on here so one we have a preloader it's
gonna wait one second and just show that
little preloader we also have a jQuery
script that's gonna make these count
upwards from zero you see it'll take one
second for them to count up we're also
inputting a canvas j/s chart here it's
just dummy data but it's basically for
display you could obviously change it to
real data coming from a database if you
wanted to get into that but this is just
a front-end thing also we can approve
and deny comments and it'll show the
little toast module and down here we
created a little quick to do thing and
this actually works so if I type
something in here we can actually add it
says to do added we can also delete them
so very interactive and down here we can
add posts we can add categories or users
okay we even implemented CK editor which
is a WYSIWYG editor here now you can't
actually add post because this is just
the front-end there's no database but
it's a pretty clean UI with some nice
interactivity then we have our post
categories these are just tables and
these all go to the post details page
which looks like this
okay we have our comments so we have
some comments with some user images
users which also have the images and
then the side nav which looks pretty
nice and then we also created a logout
page so if I click on logout I'm sorry a
log in page it'll take us to log in dot
html' which looks like this so it's a
full theme and obviously if you wanted
to build some kind of backend with PHP
or something you could connect that to
it alright so the next one we're gonna
build is bisland which is a business
consultation landing page and it's
basically a full full image here we're
using viewport Heights so no matter how
I scale the browser it's always gonna be
a hundred percent it's this image here
and if you notice if I reload this
nicely this fades in nicely using scroll
fire another thing we did is notice the
transparent nav bar if I start to scroll
down when I hit a certain point it's
gonna turn solid so that we can't see
through it anymore and you can actually
read the text okay it's a fixed nav bar
alright we also have scroll spy's so if
I click on any of these links it'll take
us down to the correct spot we have an
About section some boxes with some icons
some testimonials and then we even
implemented a Google map behind the
contact form so we'll be doing a little
bit of JavaScript with the Google map
API all right so that's that and then
the last theme is pretty simple it's
we're actually gonna use sass in this
one we're gonna use materialize s CSS
files and look at variables and things
like that so we can easily change the
colors the background color and so on
we're also using scroll fires so that if
I scroll down a little you'll see that
the next project or the next image here
will pop in and same thing with the last
one alright so we get a little nice
little fade in effect and then if I
click on the button here it'll open up a
modal with the image and the content the
star ratings and so on ok and then we
just have a couple other pages that are
identical but they have different
content so this is for the logos and you
can see it uses the scroll fire same
thing with gaming alright so it works
pretty nicely and
just have our sidebar here with the the
links to the different pages but the
main focus of this is sass we're gonna
be using koala which is a GUI program to
compile our sass I didn't want to get
into any command line stuff npm or gulp
or anything like we did in the bootstrap
course the reason for that is because if
you go into the Q&amp;amp;A in the bootstrap
course it's all stuff to do with gulp
people having issues with the gulp file
and NPM and stuff and it's nothing to do
with bootstrap so I'm actually planning
on redoing that course as well and we're
gonna just take that that whole part out
of it because it's been nothing but
nothing but a pain it does show you a
couple more things how to how to have a
like a dev workflow compiling sass and
moving files around and stuff but it's
just it was just a headache so we're
gonna take that out when we do redo that
course alright so everything is pretty
simple and like I said you're free to
use these themes in your portfolio or if
you want to edit them and create your
own sites from them you can do that as
well ok so hopefully you guys will check
this course out right now it's not
published yet you can see it's still I'm
still adding stuff to it but by the time
this video is released it will be
available and like I said I'll put a
link for 10 bucks for 9.99 alright so
thanks for watching guys and hopefully
you check it out and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
