posts we can go to a details page we can
add them now we want to try to add the
edit functionality or not try to but we
will add the edit and update
functionality so let's go to the details
page because that's where we want the
button we want an edit button here so
we'll go to resources views posts
details edge and we're gonna go let's
see we'll go under the paragraph let's
put an HR here and then we're gonna put
an a tag I'll give it a class of BTN BTN
dark href is gonna be slash posts slash
edit and then slash the ID which will be
post on ID all right and then let's see
inside here let's just say edit now I
want this to float to the left as well
so I'm going to add an extra class or a
couple extra classes one is going to be
D - block and then one's going to be
float left and save okay now I have an
edit button now if I click it we'll get
an error because we didn't create that
route so let's go to our routes and this
is going to be a get request make sure
it goes above this right here
okay so it's gonna be /po / edit / : ID
and it's gonna go to post controller
dots it okay and all this is gonna take
care of is loading the form the update
is what's gonna do the update so let's
go to our controller and let's add the
edit okay I'm actually gonna copy the
add method here and go down to the
bottom under store and change this to
edit now the difference between add and
edit is we need params with edit so
we're gonna go like that and then we're
going to fetch that post just like we
did with details so if we go up here we
can actually just copy this and then we
just want to pass in post post okay but
we want to render post dot edit so we'll
save that and then let's go and create
that edit view so we'll say add honest
make view edit or post edit keep doing
that okay so now the Edit is gonna be
almost identical to the add page so I'm
gonna copy add dot edge and then put
that in edit dot edge and then just
change this to edit post and change the
action now this is this is actually kind
of cool how they do it now we want to
make a put request okay an HTTP put
request is what you use when you want to
update something that's already on the
server now you can't make a put request
through a form by default we can't say
method put it's either get or post so
what a dantas does is it gives us the
option to add inside of the action
some double curly braces alright and
then we can do slash posts slash and
then we want to add on the ID so we can
say slash posts let's concatenate post
actually I should be able to just do
this no I can't do that I can't do the
curly braces again so we're gonna have
to just concatenate post dot ID
concatenate again and then what we can
do to make this a put request is we can
put a question mark underscore method
equals and then put so instead of making
a post request this will actually make a
put request this works very similar to
the method override module that we use
with express to do this kind of stuff
but this is included by default with
Adonis okay the other thing we want to
do here is we want for the value we want
to just change this to actually I don't
think maybe we can just use the old
let's see what this does so we'll save
this and let's go back and go to the
Edit in Val expression let's see what
did I do wrong here I think I need my
it's my quote right there alright so
it's not showing the field so we're
gonna have to just change the value here
to post dot title like that and then
this one let's see this is going to be
post-doc body there we go alright so now
we have our edit page now this is going
to get it's going to be a put request to
post slash and then the ID so we're
gonna have to go back to our routes and
we're gonna add a foot request
so we'll say route dot put it's gonna
beat a slash post / : ID and then it's
gonna map to post controller dot update
so we'll save that let's go to our post
controller and create an update now this
is gonna take in a bunch of stuff first
of all we need params because we're
dealing with a specific post we need
request response in session alright so
first thing we're going to do let's see
we can do the validation so we'll just
copy this I mean there's already stuff
in there you don't have to do this but I
guess we'll just include it okay and
then we're gonna create a Const equals a
wait a wait post dot find and we want to
find it by params dot ID okay and then
we want to just set the post dot title
equal to whatever is in the form so we
get that with request dot input title
post-op' body equals request dot input
body and then we can do a weight post
dot save okay and then we just want to
set our flash message so session dot
flash pass in here notification and
we'll say post updated alright then we
just want to redirect so return response
dot redirect and we want to go to slash
posts alright so hopefully that works
let's save that let's reload this page
and let's change it to post and the
number one and submit post updated and
there we go it's updated post one if I
reload still there awesome
so now we want to delete okay so let's
go back to the details now in the
details we have our edit button right
but we can't just put in a link for a
delete we have to make a delete request
so we're gonna have to use a form so
we're gonna say form action and we're
going to use that same technique that we
did with the put request so we're gonna
say slash posts slash and then
concatenate the ID
and then we want to say question mark
underscore method equals delete like
that all right but we do want to put
method post here pretty sure we need
that okay and then all we want is a
button actually let's put in our CSR F
field and then we want a button this
button is gonna be submit
let's give it a couple classes so BTN
BTN danger make it red and then we also
want to display as a block and we want
to float to the right
okay let's save that reload and now we
have a delete button so this is gonna
make a delete request to post slash and
then the ID so let's go to our routes
just like we did with the put I'm
actually just gonna copy that and we're
gonna say route dot delete same URL you
can notice that you can make you can use
the same URL you just have to have
different methods all right and then
this is gonna go to post controller
destroy okay we'll save that let's go to
our controller let's create a sync
destroy
okay so let's see destroy is gonna take
in params session and response alright
and then we're gonna just say con sposed
Eccles and we need to find it so we need
to use a wait post dot find pass in the
ID which comes from params and then we
want to just say a wait post dot delete
okay we'll set our flash message and
redirect I'm just gonna copy these two
lines I should have commented this
better maybe I'll do that before I
upload it to github but let's say post
deleted and we're gonna redirect to
posts all right so let's save let's go
to post four and click delete and there
we go post deleted and post four is now
gone alright guys so that's gonna do it
for now at least like I said I my
initial plan was to do a crash course

crash course I do plan on adding
authentication later on and then
