we looked at post formats and I showed
you how we could create an aside post
and a photo gallery post with our theme
now what I want to do is work on the
front page the custom front page now the
way it is now we have our blog posts as
our front page but we want to change
that alright so we're going to go to the
back end and go to pages and we're going
to create two new pages this one is
going to be called home and it's going
to be completely blank we'll publish it
and then we're going to create another
page called blog leave it leave it with
no content publish it now we're going to
go to settings and go to reading and
we're going to choose this static page
option for the front page for front page
we'll choose home for post page will
choose blog save and then we're going to
go to appearance menus and we're just
going to add that blog page to our menu
save it go back reload and now we have
just a static page for our home page if
we click on blog that takes us to the
blog post page okay so now we want to
work on our home page now in order to do
to have a separate layout we need to go
to our theme folder and create a file
called front - page PHP and now if we go
and reload it's completely blank because
it's looking at this page now what I
want to do is open up our front HTML
page that we created way back in our
HTML template now we don't want to copy
the whole thing because we want to
include our header so first thing we'll
do here is say PHP
I'm sorry get header okay now for the
footer I was thinking about this a
little earlier because now the footer we
have the sidebar in okay we don't want
that so we're just going to have to add
a conditional here in a second all right
so let's go and put in PHP get footer
all right now if we go back to our front
page and reload this is what we get okay
we have the header we have our sidebar
and footer now let's go into footer.php
and let's see we don't want any of this
stuff here all right so what I'm going
to do is go to the top and say PHP if
let's say if is front page okay but we
want we want this if it's not the front
page so let's put an exclamation mark
here and then we want this to end here
alright so let's take a look at that
okay so now our sidebar is gone Oh
actually you know what we need the
container div so let's let's actually
put this right here
alright so in our front page we're going
to want
they div with the class actually you
know what I don't think we even need
that
now we don't so now we can go to our
front HTML and let's grab this section
in the boxes section okay we'll take
that and let's go to front page and
paste that and see what we get
okay so there's no image that's why we
can't see the text and we also we didn't
include the font awesome so we can't see
the icon now another issue is we have
this whole thing in a container so it's
cutting it off right here and we don't
want that and the reason that it's doing
it is because in the header file we have
the div the container so we have to
figure this out I think what I'm going
to do is not use the get header and get
footer and then just kind of have our
own header for the front page so this
ends this is the this contains the
navigation so let's grab from here up
and we'll copy that go to the front and
not dot that page front page dot PHP and
then we'll just replace get header with
that alright same thing with footer
we're not going to use get footer but we
will take what we need from it which is
this up to here alright we'll copy that
and let's paste that in and then save
there we go so now it goes across the
whole page now for the image and for the
text here what I want to do is I want to
implement the theme customizer so in the
backend we want a place where we can go
and we can edit this text and we can
also change the image as we as we see
fit all right but we're not going to get
to that just yet so what I'm going to do
is just give it a background color so
that we can actually see the text all
right so let's go to style.css and go to
where we have our showcase okay and
let's just put right here go like that
and then at least we can see the the
text and stuff alright now for the icons
to show up we need the font awesome CDN
so in front HTML we have that right here
so let's just copy that and we'll go and
put that in our front-page PHP up in the
header okay and we should probably put
it in our header dot PHP file as well in
case we want to use it later on okay so
now if we go back and reload now we have
our icons alright and these are going to
be widgets by the way these three boxes
so I guess we could probably do that now
those widgets so let's go to
functions.php and go down to where we
have our init widgets and I'm going to
copy this whole register sidebar and
paste it in again and we'll change this
to let's say box one change this to box
one and let's see we'll go back to front
page to where we have our boxes alright
and what we want to do is we want the
class of box we want that embedded in
the widget so back in functions we're
going to replace this with box
okay and then for the heading let's see
what do we have for that h3 so we'll
change h4 to h3 all right and then we're
going to copy this again and we need two
more okay this one's going to be box two
and this one will be box three okay save
it and if we go back to the backend and
go to widgets you should now see box one
through three
so in our front page let me just let me
close these up okay so we want to grab
everything that's inside of the box div
so the icon the h3 and the paragraph and
I'm going to cut that out and then go
and add a text widget to box one okay
we'll paste that in and actually you
know what we're not going to have the
title we're not going to have this as
the actual title because we want to keep
it here under the icon so we're just
going to leave the title blank and click
Save and then back in here we just want
to do PHP if is active sidebar
okay remember just because it's just it
it says active sidebar doesn't mean
that's the sidebar position okay we want
to pass in the ID of the widget which is
box one and then in here we just want to
say PHP dynamic sidebar and then pass in
box one okay and then let's do the same
for the other one so we're going to grab
this cut it out
bring text over to box to paste that in
save it and then this is going to have
the same thing except it's going to be
box two and same thing with the last one
okay that'll be box three so let's save
that make sure all your widgets are
saved if we go back and reload now we
have the the Box class in the widget so
we want to get rid of it here and there
we go so these are now coming from the
widgets so in the next video which will
probably be the last video I'm going to
show you how we can implement the theme
customizer so that we can edit this
stuff from the back end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
