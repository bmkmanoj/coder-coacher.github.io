getting a lot of requests for a CSS grid
tutorial so in this video we're going to
cover all the basics of the new CSS grid
layout feature which allows us to create
two-dimensional layouts on a web page
and align items in both columns and rows
all browsers now support the grid layout
as of March of 2017 so let's go ahead
and dive in and take a look at CSS grids

alright so a lot of people are asking
what the difference is between flexbox
and grid and I'm not going to go through
the specifics of this I don't even have
enough information to do a full
comparison I will do some research and
create a video on it but basically
flexbox is for one-dimensional layouts
in columns or rows and the grid is for
two-dimensional layouts for columns and
rows so I think that this is a really
nice visual representation of the
difference so one dimension verse two
dimensions so with Flex blocks we
basically have some columns and they're
aligned in a row okay with CSS grid we
have some columns and rows and you can
see that this column here actually has
some rows on the side of it okay so it's
aligned with multiple rows and it just
gives you a tube two-dimensional effect
now you can achieve this kind of layout
with Flex box but it's done in a much
different way you'll have multiple flex
items with all kinds of alignments and
so on but with CSS grids this is all one
grid okay you're a lot you can do this
just by having one grid and I'm not
going to go too much further into it
than that but just know that flex box is
one dimensional layout CSS grid is a two
dimensional layout all right so let's
jump in here now I'm using the atom text
editor and I'm using a plug-in called
atom live server which just allows me to
run the file on my local
host over here and what I have is a
folder called CSS grid with an
index.html file with just some very
basic markup in it to get us started
okay I'm also using an atom plug-in
called Emmet which allows me to do
shortcuts to quickly create you know div
tags and other HTML elements so you may
see me use that along the way now the
first thing we're going to do we're
going to start up very simple and we're
going to create a layout with a main
column and a sidebar so that's something
that's very simple also very common that
you see on websites and applications so
what I'll do is in the body here we're
going to create a wrapper class okay now
you don't have to call it wrapper you
can call it whatever you want in fact a
lot of people will call it a grid
because it is a grid container or
container or whatever you want to call
it so inside this wrapper we're going to
have two divs one for the main layout
one for the sidebar so let's go ahead
and create a div and I'm going to put
some text in here now atom allows me to
do larum let's say LARM ad tab and that
will give us 80 words of Teck of dummy
text okay so I'm going to create the
second div and in here I'm going to say
lorem let's do LARM 30 tab okay so this
is our main main column and our sidebar
so let's save that and obviously it's
just going to look you know it's not
going to have any alignments or anything
to begin with now before we get into the
grid I'm just going to add a couple
Styles up here so that you can better
see the outline of each column so let's
take that wrapper class and we're going
to say all the divs all the directives
in that wrapper I'm just going to give a
background of light gray and I'm just
going to give it a padding of 1m okay so
that better defines the columns now I'm
also going to make it so that every
other element or every other div in the
wrapper has a different shade of gray
okay so to do that we're going to use
we're going to say wrapper
okay the divs in the wrapper and we want
to grab the end child odd so it's going
to say every other one every
odd element and then I'm going to just
give the background will say DDD alright
so now every other element is going to
have a different shade of gray so again
this has nothing to do with grids it's
just so you can better see things so now
we're going to start to work with the
grid so let's take our rapper class and
we're going to add a display grid okay
just like with flexbox you would do
display flex we're going to do display
grid and save now notice that we don't
have any changes yet it's not going to
do anything different because we need to
define the width of our columns okay of
the developments so to do that we use
grid - template - columns all right
let's say we want a 70% column and a 30%
column and save and that's it that's
going to give us a you know our main div
and then our sidebar div now since this
is a grid no matter how many divs we
have in our wrapper it's going to
continue to follow this this this map
that's 70% 30% so just to give you an
example let's copy both of these divs
and let's go ahead and paste another set
in okay so now we have the four Devi's
let's save and it's going to follow that
70% 30% no matter what okay we don't
have to define rows okay like in flexbox
or bootstrap or whatever where we define
well I guess not with flexbox but in a
grid system like bootstrap we define our
rows now we can change this to let's say
let's do 40% 30% 30% and save and that's
going to split it into three columns so
40% 30% 30% and it's going to follow
that even though we have 4 divs and we
only set 3 values here it's going to
continue to follow that that's why this
one here is 40 if I go and I add another
div down at the bottom here and we'll
just say hello and save it's going to
follow that formula okay so it's going
to be 30 the next one will be there
the next one will be 40 down here and
it's going to follow that system alright
let me just get rid of that one
and let's just change this back to 70/30
good all right
so we have our 70/30 grid now if we want
to have let's say some spacing in
between here we don't have to manually
set margin we can add something called
gap okay so what we'll do is we'll say
grid
- column - gap and let's set that to 1m
you can use whatever unit you want it
can use pixels and save it and you'll
see that now we have a space here now
this is the column gap so it's
separating the columns if you want to
separate it this way then that's a row
so we would say grid - ro - gap and set
that to 1m okay so now we have that
spacing now if you're going to use the
same spacing here which you probably
often will you can actually cancel this
out and you can just do grid gap okay
we'll do grid gap 1m and then what I'll
do is just comment these out I'm going
to keep them there so that you guys have
them and save and you'll see it gives us
the same effect all right so this is
this is very very basic now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create
another file I'm just going to call it
index - dot HTML okay because we're
going to create a couple files I want
you to guys I want you guys to have this
as a reference and I don't want to
change it up too much so I'm going to
just create another file okay so let's
go ahead and put some structure in here
just get rid of this stuff we don't need
that I will say CSS grid and put our
style tags in here alright so what I'm
going to do now is let's again create
let's create a wrapper so we'll say
wrapper and these are going to be we're
not going to put as much content so
let's put a div and let's just say lorem
4 okay so just a couple words and then
I'm just going to
copy that and we'll paste a bunch in
okay and then I'm going to grab from
index index.html this stuff just so you
can see you know again so we can add the
background and stuff okay and then let's
go to slash index - dot HTML
- save that there we go all right so we
haven't done anything with the grid yet
so let's go up here and let's say
wrapper and let's do display grid and
then again we're going to do our
template columns so we want to do grid
template columns and now instead of
doing percents there's actually a
different unit we can use and that's
fractions so let's say we want to do one
fr one fr 1fr okay and then we'll save
that and that's going to split it into
fractions so since we have three of
these it's going to be three columns now
if we wanted for instance this middle
one to be bigger than these other two
what we could do is we could say - fr
save it and now you can see that one's
bigger
now it's it's recommended to use the fr
over percentages or pixels again you can
use I don't want to know if I said this
but you can also use pixels here or any
unit but the fraction fractional I think
it's called is the recommended because
when you start to use percentages you're
going to run into issues with margin and
padding especially when you get into
nesting and so on so you want to stick
to these fractional x' now if we were to
have all you know 3:1 FRS we can
actually create a shorter syntax for
this especially imagine if we had you
know twelve of these so what we could do
is let's take our grid template columns
and instead of putting three separate
ones we can actually say repeat and then
here we can say let's repeat three times
one fr
save that and there we go if we wanted
to do for fr so for columns we could do
that as well now we don't have to just
do one fr here let's say we wanted a
combination of 1 &amp;amp; 2 so 1 2 1 2 then we
could do one at 5 2 fr and we'll say
repeat that and now it's 1 2 1 2 1 2 and
it will keep going like that four times
alright but let's just keep it at one f5
we'll do three columns like that now we
can add our gap if we want so let's say
grid gap let's say 1 M and it's going to
separate them out so now let's talk
about height so by default if we were to
actually you know important first let's
let's just deal with fixed Heights so to
do that let's do grid - Otto - rows and
we're going to set this to let's say 100
pixels save and now they're all going to
be a hundred pixels high okay which is
really helpful you know when you're
dealing with regular CSS and you want to
deal with alignments and Heights and it
can get a little messy ok so this really
makes it simple now if I were to add
more content to one of these let's take
this second one here and let's say lorem
40 tab and save you'll see that it's
going to go outside of it this is going
to stick it at 100 pixels no matter what
now if we want to make this flexible
what we can do is let me just see I'm
going to comment this out because I want
you guys to have you know if I don't
want to be changing everything I want
you guys to have you know the
incremental changes in these files so
let's say grid Auto rows and what we can
do is we can set min max alright and
we're going to say we want these to be
100 pixels and auto so this is going to
if I save it it's actually going to
stretch out to fill the content it's
going to be a hundred pixels by default
but if we go if our content goes beyond
hundred pixels then it's going to follow
it okay it's going to stretch basically
and it's only going to be for this for
this particular row these ones you can
see are going to stay at a hundred now
if this if this one here happened to
fall up here like if I said or p4 and
say that one is now going to stretch
because it's on the same row as that
okay I'm going to put that back two
three
okay so just remember if you want your
height to be flexible then and you want
it to have an initial you know hundred
pixels or whatever it may be then you
want to use this min max function all
right so now let's talk about nesting
grids or sub grids so we're going to go
to let's see we'll go to the third one
here and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give this this particular give
a class of nested okay and then we'll
put a div in here and let's just we'll
just say la Ramona get really short okay
and then let's just copy that and we'll
do three of these so let's save that by
default it's just going to look like
this obviously but what we need to do is
set this nested to be a grid so let's go
up here and let's see we'll go right
here I guess and say nested and we're
going to display as a grid okay if I
save it you'll see that it spreads out
now I want these to go I want three in a
row so what we'll do is do our grid
template columns and I'm actually going
to copy that because we want three so
save that there we go let's make it so
that we can see these a little better so
what I'm going to do is let's see go
down here and I'll stay nested all the
directives and nested I just want to add
a border
let's do border three three three one
pixel solid okay and then we can also
set a height for these nested divs so if
we want to do that we're going to use
grid auto rows
so let's go to nested and do grid Auto
rows and let's set that to let's say 70
pixels and save and there we go
we can also add a gap so it's a grid gap
and we'll do one M Save there we go
let's see let's also add some padding to
the the inner divs of the nested so
we'll say padding:1em there we go so
it's going to see that everything is
going to is going to adjust to
accommodate that style all right and no
matter how many divs I put in this
nested let's go ahead and just paste in
some more there we go so you'll see that
they'll just automatically look correct
they're going to generate as an actual
grid all right so I hope that I'm being
clear in this in this tutorial I'm
actually pretty new to CSS grid as are
most people all right so I'm going to
keep this for you guys as a reference
and I'm going to create one more file
we're going to look at a couple more
things so let's say index 3 dot HTML and
let's see we're going to just you know
what I'll do is just copy everything we
did we'll just copy index 2 and then I'm
just going to get rid of let's see get
rid of the nested stuff
and let's see we'll just um let's just
get rid of all this and we'll get rid of
everything that's in the wrapper okay so
we just have a div with the class of
wrapper we have our background crap here
and the wrapper is displayed as a grid
so let's save that and go to index 3 dot
HTML okay so we don't have any any
content in here yet now what I'm going
to do is just create a couple divs in
here we're going to create some divs I'm
going to give them a class of box not
blocks box alright so go ahead and
exhale in here I'll say box one let's
copy that two three four so we'll do
four boxes four four four and I'm also
going to give them individual classes
that will be box one box two box three
and box 4 okay so there we go
and let's go up to our wrapper to our
grid and let's say grid template columns
and we'll set that to let's do one we'll
do one fr to Fr 1fr so it's going to be
three columns save it so it's going to
be you know one two fraction one
fraction and for the height for the auto
rows let's set that to min Max also to
min max 100 pixels by default what we
want it to stretch to fit any content
inside of it we'll also add our gap so
great grid gap one m and save so now
we're going to look at just a 5-minute
justifying and aligning items okay so in
this wrapper let's
they justify items and we're going to
set that to start and we're going to
save so this is going to align it this
way and it's going to put it's going to
put the element at the start of its
column okay and if you know flexbox this
is pretty similar we have our flex
justify and alignments there as well and
we use start and end in Center but this
is going to align the items to the start
all of them
let's try Center okay that's going to
put them in the center
let's do end and it'll put them at the
end and then the default is stretch
okay so stretch is just going to you
know stretch it across the whole thing
so we also have align items which is
going to go the other way so if we set
this to start you'll see they're going
to start at the top here we can do
Center put them in the center and we can
do and okay and then the default again
is stretch so we can use justify items
and align items now we can also do align
self so if we go down here let's create
some classes for a box one through four
we'll go right here let's say box one
yeah we'll just do box one box two three
and four okay so let's take box one and
let's give it a self of start okay save
that and you'll see it's going to align
it to the top to the to the start so
let's take box two and we'll say a line
let's say a line self end and that'll
put it to the end okay we can also do
justify self so let's take box three and
say justify self and we'll say end
save that and puts it to the end okay so
you can align it align things however
you want you can either do all items
with justify items align items or you
can do just individual elements here
with align self and justify self alright
so the last concept that I want to talk
about is one that's a little confusing
it was a little confusing to me at first
it still kind of is but it is using
lines so I'm going to bring down an
image here which if I can get this
 thing in here with the hell
there we go alright so think of this is
a grid here okay so we have you know
three call three rows three rows and
think of these lines is one two three
four okay same thing going down one two
three now what we want to do is we can
take for instance box one and we can say
we wanted to go from one two three this
way or from one two three this way okay
so what I'm going to do is just comment
out the align cells because I don't want
that to confuse you guys I probably
should have did that after but let's
just go ahead and comment these out okay
and then let's take box one and the
properties for this is going to be grid
column in grid row so let's say grid
column and let's say we want from one to
three we want to span from one to three
actually before I do that let's just
save it back to what it looks like
naturally and then yeah alright and then
we'll put back the grid column one two
three and let's save so just like if we
look at this diagram we're saying take
it from here to here so one two three
and it's going to knock these ones over
and then at the same time we can go this
way we can go vertical let's say we want
it to go from one to three that way as
well so for that we would use grid - row
and we'll say one three and save okay
and that pushes it down and notice that
now we have these over here this is what
what is meant by two-dimensional this is
what is what is
much much different than flexbox and it
can get a little complicated
understanding the placement at least in
my opinion but it is really powerful and
once you're done with this you may want
to if you're really interested in CSS
grids I suggest you know looking at some
more advanced concepts so let's now take
box - oh yeah looking what they all say
box for let's say one two three four all
right so now we have box two right here
and what we'll do is we'll say grid
let's do grid column set that to three
it doesn't have to be a span we'll just
set it to three so it stays where it is
and then let's set the row from one to
three K remember Row is this way so
we're goin to three so as you can
probably guess it's going to just go you
know this is going to take up that whole
area so let's say grid call a grid row
one two three and there we go so now
it's going to take up one two three this
way now we can order these in different
ways - by using this method so let's
take box three and let's say we want
grid column and let's say we want two to
four and then we'll say grid row and
grid row we'll keep it three so let's
save that and now you'll see that box
three has moved over because we're
saying start at two and go to four so
it's starting at two going to four and
it's pushing box for over to this side
so we can rearrange the grid however we
want all right now another awesome thing
about grids that you don't really get
with Flex boxes you can overlap things
you can overlap elements so let's take
this box for here and let's say we want
grid column 1 ok grid column 1 and then
for the row we'll say grid row we're
going to say 2 to 4 let's save that and
now you'll see that for the grid column
of course it's starting at 1 over here
but for the row we're starting at 2 so
going this way starting at 2 going down
to 4
all right and this makes it overlap box
one and if you wanted to more clearly
see this we could simply add a border
we'll say one pixel solid and save and
you'll see that it's overlapping box one
so we can do things like this without
you know traditionally have having to
add margin negatives and things like
that which is crap all right and even
using all of these these lines these
span these line spans we can still use
our alignments so let me just uncomment
this stuff oops and we'll go ahead and
save and you'll see it's still going to
align things so there's a lot you can do
there's a lot more than this like I said
I'm fairly new to CSS grids but I can
already see how powerful they can be
when building interfaces especially the
you know the grid type interface is like
like Microsoft uses a lot with the with
the the hell's it called the metro or
whatever like the Windows screen this
stuff here so if you want stuff like
this in your UI like this is really
powerful for that okay I'm just going to
comment that stuff that the alignments
back out before I save this file for you
guys okay all the all this code would be
in the description so I think that's
going to be it guys like I said if you
want to look more into this look at look
at some of the advanced stuff this is
this is the basics of CSS grids so
