PHP front-to-back I believe this is
episode 22 in the last video we went
ahead and started working with MySQL I
or MySQL MySQL improved which is an
extension to start working with our
database okay with minus QL what we did
was we went into PHP myadmin we created
some posts in a post table and we
connected to the database we look in
config ok we have all of our database
parameters or connecting to the database
and we're pulling out some posts okay so
this is index.php that's what we're
looking at and then we also made it so
if we go to the individual page we pass
the ID to post dot PHP which is this
file we grab the ID from the get the get
array then we do another query to get
that single post so what I want to do
now is I want to add a new page to add a
posts which will obviously have a form
but before I do that I want to fix this
the responsive navigation here isn't
working
notice that if I make this bigger we
have a home link but if we go smaller
it's not being displayed and the reason
for that is we didn't add the JavaScript
the bootstrap j/s file so let's go over
to includes and go to footer PHP and
we're just going to grab the bootstrap
CDN ok we're already including the CSS
but we just need the JavaScript so let's
copy that put that in the source
attribute
oops and that and then we also need
jQuery because it's a dependency of
bootstrap gif so let's just say jQuery
CDN and let's just grab jQuery 1x
uncompressed I'm going to just copy this
script tag here and we're going to put
that right above the bootstrap j/s save
it let's go back reload and now we have
the menu all right so let's create a new
file in website mine's in a folder
called website 8 it's basically the root
of this of whatever you you called your
website and then we're going to say new
file and let's save it as add post dot
PHP alright and then what I'll do is
copy everything from index.php into add
post alright and then we're going to get
rid of all this stuff because we're not
fetching any posts for this page okay we
want to keep the header in the footer
all that container let's change this h1
to add post and then we don't want this
for each loop we can get rid of
everything in there and we just want to
create a form all right so let's give
this form a method attribute of post
because that's the type of request it's
going to make and then action is going
to be this page so let's just do a PHP
and we'll use the server superglobal and
we can say PHP underscore self and that
will submit to this actual page all
right and then inside the form let's put
a div and give this a class of form
group and let's put a label and we'll
just say title and then an input tag
let's give it a type of text let's give
it a name of title and then a class
form control okay so that's the title
let's go ahead and copy that form group
I'm actually going to make this bigger
all right and then this is going to be
the author so change the name to author
and then we're going to have a body
change that actually we going to change
this to a text area and give it a name
of body and then just a ending tag and
then we'll give it a submit button so
we'll say input
let's do type submit name submit' value
submit and let's give it a class of BTN
whoops BTN and then BTN primary it
should be a - alright so there's our
form let's save it and then let's add it
to the navbar so if we go to Inc and
then go to navbar dot php' let's copy
this and here we'll just say add post
and this is going to go to the root URL
and then it's going to go add post dot
PHP all right so let's check that out
we'll reload and we have an add post
link click that brings us to the form so
let's go back to our add post PHP file
and up here we're going to do we're
going to check for a submit all right so
let's a check for submit and we'll do if
is set remember we gave the button a
name of submit so we can actually check
for that in the post array submit and
then let's just do echo
submitted all right just to test it out
so reload submit and you can see we get
submitted now I'm not gonna I'm not
going to create this as if it was a
production application we've already
gone over a form validation so if you
guys want to add that he be my guess but
I'm not gonna I don't want to keep
repeating things I know that some people
may comment say oh you know you didn't
do this in that validation the goal of
this isn't to create the perfect
application of the most secure
application the goal is to teach you
guys the syntax and to do that you know
fairly quickly so I'm not going to do
any validation here I'm just going to
show you how to insert it into the
database alright if you want to learn
validation if you haven't watched that
episode already I mean you can watch the
the ones about filters you can watch I
don't know I'm not going to go through
all of them but we've already done that
a few times I believe so once we check
this let's look to get the form data so
we'll say title and this is going to
come from the post array okay all right
now I mean as I said I'm not going to
make it the most secure app but there
are some things that you just need to do
and I'm not going to leave those out so
we're going to wrap this in my sqli real
escape string alright which is going to
protect us from harmful harmful
that people can do so let's say MySQL
real escape string and we'll just wrap
that alright and then we'll copy that
and we want to get the body in the
author
all right and let's see we're going to
create our query now so let's create a
variable called query and we'll set it
to insert into by the way guys if you
haven't watched my SQL video I think
it's what I call it SQL for beginners
and intermediates or something like that
in that video we go over all the base
you know the core syntax of SQL so I
would suggest watching that if you have
no idea what you know insert into is and
stuff like that so say insert into posts
and we're going to insert the title the
author and the body and then we'll
define our values which will be and
these have to be in quotes it's a title
author and body okay so that's our query
now what we're going to do is we need to
actually know what we have to add in the
connection up here when we use this real
escape string you also want to add the
connection as the first parameter
alright and that con I'm getting from if
you don't remember it is right here
alright so we have the query now we're
going to do an if statement and we're
going to run it through the MySQL I
query so we'll say if MySQL i underscore
query and this also takes the connection
as the first parameter and then the
query okay so if that is successful then
we just want to redirect so we'll say
header and let's specify location and
that will go to the root URL so we can
concatenate in here root underscore URL
now if you don't know what that is
that's also in the
one fig right here config.php we define
the constant root URL which goes to this
this website eight directory
alright so that's if it's successful if
it's not for some reason then we just
want to echo out let's say error and
then let's just concatenate my sqli on
the score error and wrap the connection
alright so that will tell us the
specific error if something goes wrong
all right so I think that should do it
let's save it and then let's go over
here and let's just refresh this page
and we'll add a post let me see on the
home page we have post one and post two
so let's add post three so this is post
number three submit and there it is
those three reload it's still there it's
in the database now if you want you
probably would want to order this to
have the most recent first so we can
just add on two I don't know why we
didn't do this before but let's go to
the index and where we said select all
from post we'll say order by and let's
see where we want to order it by forget
the fields see
posts so we have created at so we'll
order by created at and we want to order
it descending so the EFC alright and now
if we go back and reload now post three
is first okay of the most recent first
alright so now let's do the edit let's
make it so that we can edit a post and I
have to do is kind of quick because I
have to pick my daughter up at the bus
and I don't want to be late so in the
individual page here we're going to put
an edit button so remember that's in
post dot PHP so we'll go down here and
let's go see will go under the body here
and we'll put let's put an HR tag and
then we'll put a link and that's going
to go to let's first of all echo out the
root URL okay so it's going to be root
URL and then it's going to be edit edit
post dot PHP which we still have to
create now we need to send along the ID
as a parameter so we'll say ID equals
and then PHP echo and remember we can
get post and that's an associative array
so we can get the ID alright and then
let's just give it a class of BTN and
BTN it will say default alright and then
it'll just say edit okay let's go back
and reload okay so now we have an edit
button we click it it's going to give us
an error because we didn't create the
page yet so let's create that so in the
root of our website here let's say new
file and save it as edit post dot PHP
now this is going to be very similar to
add post so I'm going to just copy from
add post PHP and paste it in here and
let's see we're going to add - we need
to make it we need a query to get the
current post okay just like we did on
the individual post page so we can
actually grab
it from that--from post.php where we did
this here I can grab all this copy it go
to edit post and let's go under the
submit paste that in and then what we'll
do is put the value okay remember we're
getting it's going to get put in this
post variable so what we can do is go
down and add values to these inputs
okay so we'll say value PHP echo post
what is it post title and then C I'll
just copy that value and we'll go down
here and this will be post author and
then this will be in the text area okay
we don't need value here just just that
and we'll change this to body all right
so let's go and reload and now we have
the values inside the form so now we
need to take care of the submission so
once we submit it's going to go you know
it's going to check for the submit and
it's going to run this now we don't want
to we don't want to do an insert this is
going to be an update now we also want
the ID because we need to know which one
to update so what I'll do is go back
down to the form and we're going to put
a hidden input here so we'll say type
hidden' and let's give it a name of
update underscore ID and then we'll give
it a value and remember we can get the
value by saying PHP echo post ID and
then we can grab that up here go right
here and we'll say update on the score
ID equals and then let's just copy one
of these and then this is going to be
post update ID
all right so now we have actually to get
rid of that D it's just update so for
the query we're going to change this
around to actually just get rid of this
and we're going to stay update the table
which is posts and then set and then
whoops not the setcookie that's want
that let's see we're going to then
describe the fields we want so title is
going to equal title that's passed in
from the form author same thing what
else we doing here body ok and then we
need to specify where this is going so
we're going to say where the ID is equal
to the update ID all right so you can
organize it however you want but that's
going to update the whatever is passed
in is the ID so right here we can also
we can actually just leave this how it
is so let's save this and then let's
reload the edit page and let's change
the the spelt out word 3 to just the
number 3 will change the author to John
Doe and we'll say this is post 3 submit
okay so we have an error
I'll see we read to be at line 5 so
looks like we have an error in the query
update posts set title so let's uh let's
print out this query just to see
so we'll say let's let's do a die
function here and we'll pass in query
just to make sure that everything is
actually being submitted correctly so
set title post 3 author body ok so the
ID is not coming through
so why is that so we have a hidden field
with the name of update ID and we're
passing post ID you know what I think we
just need to reload the form or refresh
it no that's not it why is it not
showing let me look at the source code
here if we look down here ah value is
spelt wrong you guys probably saw that a
while ago huh idiot
alright so let's change that to value
and then we'll go back up here and get
rid of the die and it should work let's
see let's go back post 3 edit change
that to post 3 I know there's a lot of
banging upstairs guys this isn't the
most professional episode but I have to
hurry up John Doe and submit and there
we go you can see it's been changed
authors John Doe so now we want to do is
we want to be able to delete posts now
when we create a delete button here we
can't just put it in a in a regular link
or a button it has to be a post request
okay I mean we could do a get request
but that's very very unsecure to just
have a get request to make a delete so
we're going to create a form that just
has one it's going to have an button a
submit button and two it's going to have
a hidden field with the with the ID so
let's go to post dot PHP and go down to
where we have the edit link and we're
going to go let's see we'll go right
above it and let's create a form tag and
we're going to give this a class of
let's do pull write because we want it
to align to the right and let's see
let's give it a method of post
and give it an action and the action is
going to be the current page so we'll
just say PHP echo server and this is
going to be PHP underscore self and then
inside here we're going to first put a
hidden field and this is going to have
the name of delete underscore ID and
then the value and for that we'll do PHP
echo when we do in post ID okay so
that's the hidden field now we need to
submit so say input type submit and
let's give it a we'll give it a name of
delete and let's give it a value of
delete and then give it a class of VPN
BTN danger which will make it read so
let's save that and take a look I'll
reload and now we have a delete button
now we want to catch the submission of
the delete button so what we can do is
copy from let's see let's go to edit
post and just grab this right here and
then copy that and then we'll go back to
post dot PHP and we want to check for
the delete submit so let's paste this in
and remember we called it delete not
submit so we're going to check for that
and all we need is the ID so say delete
ID and remember we submitted that hidden
input with the name of delete ID and
then we can get rid of this stuff
because we're not adding anything we're
just deleting it and then for the query
this is actually going to be easier than
that we're going to say delete from
posts we're ID is equal to the delete on
the score ID and then we're just going
to do the same thing here we're going to
run it through my sqli query and then
redirect so let's save this and let's
reload and click delete
remember this is post three and now you
can see that post three is gone alright
so we now have an application that has
full crud functionality we can create
read update and delete posts now this
isn't the best way to do things using
the procedural mysqli extension we can
also use it in an object-oriented way
which I'll get to and even better
there's an extension called PDO which is
PHP data objects which is a in my
opinion a much better and a much safer
way to work with the database but this
MySQL is definitely something that you
need to know if you're learning PHP
alright so thanks for watching guys and
I will see you in the next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
