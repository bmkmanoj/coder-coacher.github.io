build I feel like I've been neglecting
my front-end developer audience a little
bit lately so I wanted to do a simple
project for you guys we're going to be
building a bootstrap website or theme
whatever you want to call it that
implements a little bit of animation and
scrolling effect so we're going to do
this with a package called scroll reveal
and what this does is it allows us to
add a little bit of JavaScript to make
any element that we want on the page
animate when it's loaded or when we
scroll down to it okay there's also a
lot of different options and treats that
you can use to customize the effects so
this is what we'll be building I just
called it text scroll and basically we
just have this we have a nav bar up here
with no background it's just plain white
and we have this showcase area with a
big given image of the Google home
device some text over here then we have
a testimonial underneath and we have
another image here some text and then
two more info text blocks and then a
little contact form with a background
image now if I go and I reload this
you'll see that there's quite a bit of
animation going on here everything kind
of slides in nice and smooth and then if
I start to scroll you'll see that and
then the next one okay so it doesn't
actually fire off until york you'll
scroll down to it and you've probably
seen this effect before I personally
like it I think it's really nice I mean
you don't want too much going on but I
think that that looks pretty nice so I
modeled this website or this theme after
this y-direction dot-com slash Advent if
we reload this you'll see has seemed not
the exact same but but similar effects
and then as we scroll down you can see
that things kind of popped in I mean
this is a production site so obviously
this is a little better than my little
site that I created in about 45 minutes
but same idea okay and for this site if
we click on a link kind of brings us
down and it keeps the navbar shown just
like if we go over here we click about
brings us down
okay now this functionality is not from
scroll reveal this is from just a block
of Jake
a code that we're going to use and you
can use that in your future projects as
well so that's what we building this is
the github page for scroll reveal this
has all the documentation you can see we
can install it with NPM or Bower if we
want but I'm going to go the easy way
and just use the script tag alright and
then what you do is take an element for
instance this div with the class of foo
and just stick it in this SR dot reveal
and then you can apply all these
different options or configurations to
it such as where it comes in from where
the animation comes from the distance it
travels the duration the delay all kinds
of stuff so you can really customize it
alright so that's what we will be
building I'm just going to go over to my
desktop and create a new folder and I'm
just going to call this text scroll okay
and then we're going to open that from
within my editor I'm using atom but you
can use whatever you'd like so I'm going
to say add project folder desktop test
tech scroll and then we're going to
create some files so we're going to need
an index.html file and then we're going
to want a folder for CSS folder for
images which I'll call a IMG and then in
the CSS folder we want a file called
style dot CSS okay and that should be
all the files that we need now I'm going
to use the live server package for atom
which will open up the current directory
on on my localhost you can install that
if you want if you if you're using atom
you can go to settings and go to install
and we want to search for
I think it's live server I believe let's
see
or maybe it's live reload
or is it right here this is what I'm
using Adam live server so if you go
ahead and install that you'll be able to
go up to packages live server and I'm
going to start this on port 4000 okay so
there's there's our website which is
blank at the moment okay now you don't
have to do that you can simply open the
index.html file if you want or you could
use a different kind of server whatever
you want to do so first thing we'll do
is just put in some HTML tags head and
body and all that so in the title I'm
just going to say text scroll and then
what we'll do is grab the script tag for
scroll reveal which is right here okay
so all we have to do is paste that in
and we can use it so we're also going to
need bootstrap I'm going to use the CDN
so you can get that at bootstrap cbn.com
and I'll just grab this CSS right here
copy that our CSS blink I should say and
we'll put that in a link tag give it a
rel of style sheet and then href and
then we'll paste that in there okay I'm
also going to link the stylesheet that
we created so stylesheet' href and
that's going to be in the CSS folder and
then style dot CSS okay we're also going
to want the bootstrap JavaScript link so
I'm going to copy that
and I'm going to put that down right
above the ending body tag so we'll put
script source equals paste that in now
this bootstrap J's file actually needs
jQuery as well so let's grab the jQuery
CDN and just grab this uncompressed
version three copy that make sure that's
above your bootstrap script tag and then
that should do it as far as things that
we need to include oh one more thing we
need the fonts so I'm going to just
paste this in let me just
rather real quick all right I'm going to
put this right below the title and I'm
going to paste it in so this is just a
link to use some google fonts so for
google api's calm slash CSS question
mark family equals Poppins so you just
want to copy this exact we're also using
the Roboto our Roboto font and this
click Jose Finn this is just the font
that that website that I showed you uses
alright so just get that in there
and if you don't want to type it all
I'll just get it from the project files
alright so we should be all set now so
we're going to start at the top and work
our way down we're going to build out
the interface and then we'll add the the
animation and stuff alright so we're
going to start with the navbar so when I
when I do a bootstrap navbar I usually
just go to get bootstrap and then go to
getting started and examples and then
the starter template and then we'll do a
control you and I'll just grab this nav
tag here okay this has all the markup we
need for it to be responsive and all
that so we'll put that right under the
body the opening body tag and we're
going to keep the navbar fixed top
because we always want it at the top I'm
going to change this to navbar default
and then we're going to change the
project name to text row and for the the
navigation here well first of all we'll
get look rid of this active class and
then home is actually going to go to the
ID of showcase about is going to go to
the ID of info 1 and contact will go to
contact and that's all we need to do for
the navbar as far as the markup so let's
save that and if we go back and I see we
have our navbar now I want to get rid of
the gray background and this border I
also want to move these links over to
the right so this ul right here we're
just going to add navbar right and that
will float those over okay and then
we're going to go to our style.css and
we want to get rid of the background of
that navbar so let's do dot now bard
fall
and we're going to change backgrounds to
white and let's change the border to
zero and we're going to change the font
family to pop it is okay we'll save that
oops and let's go back and there we go
now this branding right here I want to
make that a little more prominent so
that has a class of nav bar - brand and
we're going to change the font size to
20 pixels we're going to change the
color to black and what else did I want
to do well I want to make it bold so
font-weight:bold so we'll save that okay
now I want it completely black it looks
like this isn't working what we need to
do is just add on important and then
that will overwrite any other styles it
has good so that's it for the navbar now
what I want to do is the showcase area
so let's go back to our HTML and we're
going to go right under the nav and put
in a section tag alright so section is
an html5 tag and we're going to give us
an ID of showcase okay and then in the
showcase we're going to put a container
ok container we'll just basically move
it away from the sides put it in the
middle and then we want a row because
we're using the klom the grid system
bootstrap grid system and we're going to
have two six column rows so if we look
at the finished one this splits in half
and we have a six column div here and a
six column div here so that's what we
want to do so let's put another div and
we'll give this a class of call MD six
for when this the window is at the
medium size we also won't call sm64 when
it's at this
sighs okay both situations should be
should only have six column divs all
right and then I'm just going to go copy
this and go right under it and paste it
in and then this is where the image is
going to go now I'm going to wrap the
image in a class called showcase left
and I'm doing that because this is the
the element that we're going to add the
animation to okay it's going to have the
image come down from the top and see if
I reload this it comes down from the top
and then we'll put the image in here so
IMG source that's going to be in the IMG
folder and it's called image one dot jpg
okay and you should have these in your
project files okay I'm just going to go
ahead and add it to see where my text
scroll IMG and I'm just going to grab
all three images and paste them in okay
so this is the one we're working with
right now
the other two are actually PNG files
just to point out all right so we have
that set now on this div we're going to
have another div with the class of
showcase right okay and in here we're
going to have an h1 and I'm just going
to grab the text real quick a seven and
then we're going to have a paragraph I'm
just going to grab that text as well
which is just dummy text if you are
using atom you can actually just type in
lorem and then tab and it will give you
a bunch of sample content all right so
the button that is on that side we don't
want in the showcase right because we
want that animation separate okay
remember it has a little delay so we're
going to go under that div and then put
in an a tag with the class of BTN BTN
default BTN - LG that'll make it a
little bigger and also
showcase - BTN which is our own class
and that's just going to say read more
so let's go ahead and save it and take a
look all right now notice everything is
under the nav bar that's because we have
the fixed top class so a solution for
that is to add to the body a margin top
pushing everything down so let's go back
to our CSS and we're going to put in
body and let's say margin top 70 pixels
okay so that should push everything down
good so now we just have some styles for
the showcase that we need to add so
let's go back to our style sheet and the
heading right here I want this to be
bigger when I stepped up to 50 pixels
and also add some margin underneath so
let's say the idea of showcase we want
the h1 and we're going to set the font
size to 50 pixels and then set a margin
bottom to 20 pixels now all of the
headings on the site I want to have the
poppins font so I'm going to go right
into the body here h5 I mean each one
through h6 and let's say font family
we're going to set that to poppins and
then for the paragraphs we're going to
set that font family to Roboto I think
it is okay save that okay so you can see
the font type is changed now so back to
the showcase I want this image to only
be 90% of its container okay so make it
a little smaller so let's go down here
and say showcase image we're going to
set the width of it to 90% of its
contained and then we just want to move
it over a little so we're going to say
margin
what is it margin-left we're going to
set that to sixty pixels save that okay
so now you see it's a little smaller now
I want to move this down more so it's
kind of in the middle of the image and
remember that has the class of showcase
right so we'll say I D showcase and then
class showcase right and we're going to
just going to set margin top to 90
pixels and now that's pushed down
alright I also want to just put a line
break right before that button so right
here we'll just put in a br tag there we
go
alright so the showcase should be all
set aside from the animation which we'll
do in a little bit so now we're going to
move on to the next part which is this
testimonial right here so let's go back
and go under the showcase section and
then we'll create another section and
let's see we're going to give this an ID
of testimonial and then let's put a
container and in here we're going to
just have a paragraph now if you're
using atom or sublime text you can just
do larum tab and it'll give you a bunch
of sample content I'm just going to wrap
this in a paragraph is also going to
wrap it in quotes since it's a quote
okay and then under that we're going to
have another paragraph and that's going
to have a class of customer and then
here we're just going to put a hyphen
and then John Doe so let's save that
okay there it is so now we're going to
go back to our style sheet
and see we're going to work with the ID
of testimonial we're going to set the
background of that to a really light
gray so f1 three times
and we're going to set the padding to 50
top:0 30 on the bottom and then zero and
I want to align everything to the center
so we can say text-align:center and
let's add a margin to the top of 40
pixels so let's see what that looks like
alright now we need to do the text so
I'm going to just do testimonial P for
the power graphs and let's set the font
size to much larger I'm going to say 32
pixels and then the font family font
family is going to be this I don't know
how that's pronounced Jos e f ing OSA
Finn sands let's actually wrap that into
quotes alright and then the color of it
I want to be black so we're going to say
color black alright take a look okay
that's way too long I just want to take
some characters off that see what that
looks like that's too short
let's try that
yeah I guess that's fine but the
customer right here I want that to be
smaller so let's go back to the style
and go say testimonial TDOT customer and
then I'm going to set the font size and
we're going to set that to 20 pixels and
then they get a little lighter so color
will be triple six there we go alright
so now the next thing we want to do is
the this right here this is info 1 and
then this is info 2 so let's go back to
our HTML throw in our section okay and
this section is going to have an ID of
info 1 and we're going to have 2 6
column divs here just like the showcase
so let's first put in a container all
right and then in the container we're
going to have a row and then we're going
to have our call md6
call fm6 and i'm just going to copy that
because we need two of these so on this
side we're going to have an image I'm
going to wrap this in a div with the
class of info right I'm sorry info left
for this one and then the image which
will have a source attribute of IMG /
image - dot PNG okay and then on this
side we'll have a div with the class of
info right and in here we'll have an h2
that will say get to know Google home
and then a paragraph and I'm just going
to grab that text real quick throw that
in there we go okay and then we're going
to have the button right under right
under the power graph actually we going
to put a line break and then the button
which is a link with the class of BTN
and then BTN default and BTN LG that
will make it larger and this will just
say read more as well all right let's
save it and it's going back to our
version and reload and that's what it
looks like okay so we want to do a
little bit of styling over here so let's
go back to style.css and I want to
basically just move this down okay so we
know that we have the idea of info 1 and
then we have a class of info right and
we're just going to add a margin margin
top and we're going to make that 90
pixels okay actually I think that's all
we need to do there oh you know one
thing I did want to do is set the body
text the default to 16 pixels because
it's a little small now so let's say
font size 16 pixels and save there we go
so now this text is a little bigger so
that looks pretty good let's go on to
info 2 now so we'll go back to
index.html and what I'll do is just copy
info 1 this whole section and then we'll
paste that in and change this to 2 and
let's see I'm going to keep the info
left and right I just want to remove
this image and then for down here I'm
going to keep the h2 I'm just going to
change it to info block the heading and
we'll keep the same text and then I'm
going to take away the line break and
then the button or the link okay and
then we'll just copy this h2 in this
paragraph copy that
and paste that in here as well okay so
info left and right are the same okay
we'll just do will say block one here
and then block two here all right and
then let's see what else we need the
footer actually let's see what that
looks like first okay that's fine
since both in this info 1 and info 2 are
both white on the background I'm just
going to put an H R in the middle of
them so right here there we go and now
we'll move on to what the contact area
so let's go under this section and put a
new one alright in this section is going
to have an ID of contact and it'll have
a container and a row so this will be
call well this is actually going to be a
five column so call md5 and then call SM
- five so we'll have a five column and a
seven column
okay the form will go in the five column
nothing is going to go in the seven
column you'll see if we look at the
final version there's nothing over here
in the seven okay the five the form will
go in the five column so let's do that
now for the form I'm going to just paste
this in because I don't want to waste
too much time here with stupid stuff so
I'm going to paste it in see we have a
form tag we have form group divs one
with a name the input email label email
input and then a message okay and then a
submit button so let's go ahead and save
that and go to our version and it looks
like this so I want the info to which is
this right here to have a margin to kind
of push this down a little so let's go
back to style
and we'll say info too we're going to
add margin so top 20 pixels sides will
have zero bottom will have 60 pixels
okay and then for contact we want to set
that image for the background so let's
say background
this will set URL that's going to be dot
dot slash okay because we're in the
style style CSS folder so we need to go
up one and then into the IMG folder so
that's what the dot dot slash does this
brings us up one okay and then that
image is called image three dot PNG
alright and then I'm going to add 40
pixels padding and let's see we're going
to make the color white because the
image is dark and then I just want to
border on the top and bottom so say
bought our top which will be a dark grey
that'll be seven pixels and solid and
then we'll do the same on the bottom
okay save that and there we go so now
for the footer which is extremely simple
basically we want to go under this last
section and save footer and I'm just
going to put in a paragraph and I will
say copyright and then we'll put
ampersand coffee semicolon which will
give us a copyright symbol 2017 and
we'll just say I guess text scroll
alright and then for this paragraph I'm
going to give it a class of text center
which is a bootstrap class and let's
take a look okay I just want to add a
little bit of padding to that so let's
go to our style sheet say footer
and we'll add padding of 40 pixels there
we go actually let's do 30 okay so the
basically the the mark-up is complete
now we need to enable the animation all
right so we're going to go back to
index.html and figure out what we want
to do here so we want well I want a lot
of different things to have an animation
the navbar this side this the
testimonial and then these two so let's
go to the bottom here we're going to go
under everything so under the bootstrap
j/s way down here okay and then we'll
put in our script tag let's see I don't
need that so to use the plug-in we need
to say window dot SR equal to scroll
reveal and then we should be able to say
s r dot reveal dot reveal and then the
element that we want so we're going to
start with let's start with the navbar
so it has a class of nav bar and let's
see it's going to have a second
parameter with the options
okay so let's set C let's set the
duration to two seconds which is going
to be 2,000 because it goes by
milliseconds and let's set the origin
basically where we want it to come from
and I'm going to say bottom all right so
let's save that and see if it works so
if we go yep if we reload you'll see it
comes up from the bottom and it has a
duration of two seconds all right next
we're going to do the showcase left
which is the big Google home image all
we have to do is put a semicolon here
and then
copy this and then let's put in the
class showcase left and let's see
duration is going to be the same origin
I want to be top and then I also want to
add a distance because I want it to look
like it's kind of coming from the very
top so the distance I'm going to set
that to 300 pixels save that and there
we go comes in from the top
now this over here showcase right I want
that to come in from the right so I'm
going to just copy this again and
that'll be showcase right and that's
going to have an origin of right and I'm
also going to say set that to 300 pixels
distance save it there we go now the
button I actually want that to have a
little delay I want that to come in last
so let's paste that in and then I'll
change this
I think it's showcase BTN for the button
and then I'm just going to add a delay
of two seconds so this should start when
the other stuff stops because that has a
duration of two seconds all right and
then the origin I'm going to set that to
bottom okay we'll get rid of the
distance save that comes in two seconds
later the button comes in good so let's
see what else the testimonial if we look
at the HTML I don't want the actual
testimonial section I want the div
underneath it okay so we're going to use
testimonial and then the div which will
come in which will animate so let's say
ID testimonial and then the div
underneath it and we're going to set
that duration that's fine I want to set
the origin to bottom and then get rid of
the distance okay now we want info left
and info right pace that it again change
this to info left
and duration that's good origin I'm
going to set to left and let's see
distance their inner pixels now one
thing I want to do is set the view
factor because we only want that to fire
off when we scroll down to it so we can
set a view factor to a certain
percentage and I'm going to set it to 2%
so when when we see 2% of that element
it's going to do the the animation so
view factor and we're going to set it to
0.2 all right and then I'm just going to
copy this and do the same for info right
okay except that's going to have an
origin of right and that should do it
let's save I'm just going to reload
everything comes in and then we go and
start to scroll down and then we see
that I'll actually you know what this
one info one isn't down far enough so
what I'm going to do is add another line
to the testimonial or is it testimonial
and let's see that's not it
see now if I reload it hasn't loaded
down here yet because it's not in view
but if we start to scroll there it is
and the next one all right cool
so the very last thing we want to do is
the links I want to be able to click and
you can see it does go down to where
it's supposed to same with contact but
it doesn't it's not a smooth transition
so I'm just going to paste in a block of
code down here that I did I use for this
we're going to go below this script
all right so we'll paste this in okay so
this is just a block of jQuery that is
going to implement that smooth scrolling
effect let me actually set this to wrap
so you guys can see the whole thing soft
rap there we go if you don't want to
type all this out you can go ahead and
just look at the project files I didn't
I actually didn't write this I got this
off I think of Stack Overflow post it's
not the neatest thing in the world but
what I want to focus on is the scroll
reveal in this project not the the
vertical scrolling so let's save this
and make sure it works
so if I click about Scrolls down contact
and home great so that's it we've built
a bootstrap template that has a little
bit of animation so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this I know it's been a while
since I did a front end video I've been
doing lots of PHP and some Python and
all that so that's it if you aren't
