creating a fake REST API using something
called JSON server so why would you want
to fake REST API well when you're
building let's say angular applications
or react applications anything on the
front end where you need to you need to
connect to something on the back end you
need some kind of server with some data
you may not want to at that time or you
may not even know how to create a
back-end using you know setting up a
server with express and routes and
connecting to a database and all that
stuff this gives you a really easy
option to kind of mimic that entire
functionality that entire back-end so
you can see no strictly focus on your
react app or whatever it is you're
working on all right now there is a
remote version of this at Jason
placeholder dot type a code comm where
you don't have to do anything you can
just make requests to these routes here
you can so you can make post requests
and all that but there are some
disadvantages of this one is that you
have to work with strictly with their
data okay so you may want to use your
own data you probably will want to use
your own data also you can make post
requests and put requests but it's not
going to update the actual data okay
it's not going to let you actually add
to their database obviously that
wouldn't be that wouldn't be a very good
idea doing this locally installing it
locally allows you to actually persist
it to a JSON file where it can update
and it works more like a real back-end
alright so this is something I use all
the time and I have used this in the
past in some videos but I haven't really
gone over how to actually create it
locally so let's all be doing this video
hopefully you guys can take something
from it and let's get started this video
is sponsored by dev Mountain if you're
interested in learning web development
iOS or UX design dev Mountain is a
12-week design and development boot camp
intended to get you a full-time job in
the industry to learn more visit dev
mountain comm or click the link in the
description below alright guys so I
think it going to be kind of surprised
of how easy this is to set up we're
basically not even going to have to
really
right any code at all so this is the
github page it's type size typing code
slash JSON server and there's some good
documentation here actually as far as
the different URL and route options
pagination sorting sorting the data
things like that and I'm actually going
to create a text file and put it in the
description so you guys can download
that you can have the you know the the
the URLs with the correct parameters to
sort data and all that so to install
this very very easy we're just going to
do NPM install JSON server you can
install it globally if you want but I'm
not I'm just going to install it locally
so what I'm going to do is open up
visual studio code that's what I'm using
and I have an empty folder called JSON
server
okay so just create a folder somewhere
and I'm going to use the integrated
terminal from Visual Studio code you can
either do view integrated terminal or
you can just hit control and then the
tilde character which is to the left of
the number one and you'll notice that
I'm actually using git bash with this
instead of PowerShell which is the
default if you want to do that just
install git bash and then you can go to
preferences settings and you can add
this setting right here terminal dot
integrated shell dot windows and set it
to the location of git bash okay so
that's if you want to do that that's how
you do it now we're going to install
this the first thing we need to do is we
need to create a package.json file which
is basically like a manifest file for
nodejs applications it has the the
application name the version the
dependencies all that stuff alright and
if I didn't say it already you do have
to have no js' installed so just
download that install it alright so
let's run NPM in it and it's just going
to ask us some questions it's going to
ask us what we want to call it JSON
servers is fine that's the name of the
folder so we'll click enter version
that's good description we'll just say
test or I don't know we'll just say fake
REST API for testing entry point doesn't
matter we actually we're not even going
to have an entry file so just click
enter and we'll just enter through the
rest
all right so now we have a package.json
file and it should look something like
this so now we need to install Jason
server so we'll say npm install - - save
which will actually add it to this file
to package jason and then we're going to
say jason - server alright and once
that's installed it should pop up in
this file and the dependencies alright
so there it is the current version is 0
11 - alright so now that we have that we
need a way to start our server and if we
go to back to the documentation you'll
see right here we can run JSON server
watch and then the link to a file ok not
the link but the name of adjacent file
that's going to act as our data store so
let's go back to visual studio code and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add
this as an NPM script so that we don't
have to type all that out so inside of
scripts here we can actually replace the
test we don't need this but you can call
this whatever you want I'm going to do
Jason : server that's usually what I do
and then let's replace this with Jason -
server - - watch and then the name of
the jason file which you can call
anything but we'll stick to DB dot jason
alright so let's go ahead and save that
now we need to actually create our data
our data files so let's create a new
file over here in our folder and we're
going to call this DB dot
jason okay and this is going to be just
a simple JSON file so we're going to put
in our curly braces and if you don't
know anything about Jason I'd suggest my
jason crash course so I'll link that in
the description as well but basically
we're going to have a set of users which
since this is Jason you need to have
your keys and your values wrapped in
double quotes so let's say users and
this is actually going to be an array of
users okay so it'll be an array of user
objects so each user is going to have an
ID so let's say we want ID of 1 let's do
first name I'm not going to type
everything out but just this first one
so first name let's say John Doe to do
actually that's the whole name full name
let's do just first and then we'll do
last so last name will be go let's do
email so we'll just say John at gmail
and let's see what else did I do age
will say 34 and what else and we're also
going to have in addition to users we're
going to have companies so each user I
want to have a company ID we're going to
actually set up some relationships here
so it's going to have a company ID and
we're going to set that to so that to
one okay so that's what a user is going
to look like now I'm just actually going
to copy a couple other users and paste
them in so I'm going to put a comma
right here and paste these in just tap
this over a little bit alright so we
have see it's just format this a little
better so we have four users we have
John Doe Mark Williams Sarah Thompson
and Karen Jackson okay they all have the
same fields
you know first name last name email age
and company ID so that gives us our
users now for companies all we have to
do is go under this users array put a
comma there and let's say companies and
that's going to also be an array of
objects so each company will have an ID
so say ID one and they'll have a name so
say Apple and they'll have a description
okay and I actually have a the Apple
description you just grab it real quick
and paste that in I'm going to turn on
rap word rap so you guys can see
everything let's see the hell is it
toggle word rap alright so we just have
the description of the Apple company now
I have two more companies I want to
paste in here so let's go ahead and put
a comma here and paste these in we have
Microsoft and Google let's just tab this
over there we go alright so we have our
users and company this is essentially
our database this is what's going to act
as our back-end data store so let's go
ahead and save this and now we should be
able to run our server it should be as
easy as that so let's go down here and
we remember we added a an NPM script of
Jason : server so we should be able to
do NPM run Jason :
server and that should start it on
localhost 3000 port 3000 and it shows
you the resources you have users and
companies so let's go to our browser and
let's go - let's just go to HTTP
localhost port 3000 see what that gives
us so it actually gives us this really
nice landing page that shows us the
different resources we have also shows
with the different types of requests we
can make to our server or to our API so
right here users you'll see 4x it's
telling us we have 4 users in our data
store okay there's the users we created
and notice the URL is slash users we can
also go to localhost 3000 slash
companies and then we can see our whole
database by going to slash DB alright
and I'm actually going to make this
bigger so you guys can see ok so I want
to show you some of the different routes
that we can go to to kind of do things
like format our data we can limit the
data that's returned things like that so
I'm going to include a link in the
description to this file right here just
make this a little smaller and this is
this shows you how to do things like
filter companies by name
add some limits and pagination if you
want to use pagination in your front-end
sorting so let's go ahead and try some
of these so if we want to get a single
user okay we know we can get all of them
if we go to slash users but we can also
get a single user by just putting in
slash and then the ID and that's going
to give us that to that user if we go to
user slash - we get mark Williams which
has an idea - okay and we can do the
same thing with companies if we go to
companies slash one we're going to get
the company with the ID of one all right
now the way we set up our data in the
backend or in our DB JSON file we have
relationships remember each user has a
company ID field and that allows us to
do things like this we can go to company
/ 1 / users and it'll give us all the
users that work at that company ok so I
believe one was Apple let's go to -
slash users we have Sarah and if we go
to company slash 3 we have Karen ok so
this is really helpful you know that
we're able to use these relationships
like this so we can also filter by
fields in this case we're going to
filter the company by the name but of
course you could use any field you want
so if we say slash companies and then
let's put a question mark which is
saying that we want to add a parameter
and we want to say where name equals
Microsoft obviously it's going to pull
up the Microsoft entry
so if we say Apple it's going to pull up
Apple but we could do this by any field
not just the name alright so another
thing we can do is we can limit the data
so in this case we're saying company /
or not slash question mark underscore
page and we're going to say we want page
1 and each page should have a limit of
two okay of two entries so let's go
ahead and grab that and that's going to
give us the first two okay because we're
limiting each page to two if we want to
go to page two that should have ID the
third one okay and if we had a fourth
one that would show here as well and so
on okay so we can limit the data really
easily we can also sort so if we
at question mark and then underscore
sort equals and then the field we want
to sort by in this case name and then
the order which could be ascending or
descending so let's grab that
okay so we're saying companies we want
to sort by name and we want it to be
ascending so you see we have Apple
Google Microsoft if we wanted it the
other way we could do descending or de
SC and that will reverse it alright so
some really cool stuff you can do here
and for you to build a back-end to give
you these routes and this functionality
would be a lot of work so it's really
good for for testing prototyping things
like that
so we can also search numeric ranges so
in this case we're going to say age
underscore GTE for greater than or equal
to 30 so let's go ahead and do that so
this is going to give us all the users
that are either 30 or older all right
and then we could add another parameter
by putting an ampersand and then we'll
do age underscore LTE equals 40 so
that's less than or equal to 40 so it's
going to give us everybody that's in
between 30 and 40 all right and then the
last thing I'm going to show you is the
full-text search we can add a parameter
of Q and what that's going to do is it's
going to search for whatever we have
here it's going to search all the fields
I don't think we have a Paul in this in
our users so let's just change that to
John
so we'll say users and then we want to
add a parameter of Q and we'll say
equals John and then that's going to
find anything that has the word John
okay and we could just put J and it's
going to find anything that has the
letter J inside of it all right so you
can see that we can do some really
powerful things for the amount of work
that we put into this which is basically
nothing all right now let's see what I
want to do next
let's go ahead and let's make some some
other types of requests because up to
this point we're just making get
requests so if we look at our where are
we
localhost 3,000 I'm just going to make
this a little smaller we can make all
these these types of requests so now to
make a post requests you can
do this through a webform through your
application but we're not going to you
know build an application right now so
what I'm going to do is use something
called postman actually I already have
it installed all right now postman is a
utility for making HTTP requests alright
and this is actually a Chrome extension
just search for postman Chrome and you
should find it I'm just going to delete
this stuff here let's get rid of that
all right so we're going to make a post
request now and we're going to make it
to HTTP localhost port 3000 slash users
all right what I want to do is add a
user through this post request so we're
going to go to headers and we want to
specify that the content type content
type is going to be application slash
Jason alright and then for the body I'm
going to choose to enter raw Jason and
let's put in set of curly braces and put
in a user's first name and just going to
set that to Brad and then we'll do last
name set that to traversÃ©e du age which
is a number so just do 35 what else do
we have email I'll just say test at test
calm and let's add a company so remember
we have company ID and let's say I want
to work at I would say Google so I think
that was ID of 3 alright so let's go
ahead and try this we'll send the
request we get a response back which is
the user and you'll see that it
automatically adds this ID for us okay
which is a string now if we go back and
we go to slash users you'll see that I
was actually added as a user so this is
something that you can't do with the
remote version of this you can't you
know it's not going to get saved so
that's a that's definitely a plus and
you'll see that if we go back to our
JSON file
actually added to that file okay
now what I'm going to do is go back to
postman and let's try to delete a user
all right so I'm going to open up a new
tab and we're going to make a delete
request now to HTTP localhost port 3000
and let's say slash users and let's get
rid of ID 4 which is Karen Jackson okay
so if we go ahead and click send we get
back a response of nothing because
there's nothing to return but if we go
and reload you'll see that Karen is now
gone okay so we can make delete requests
we could we can make a patch request to
do an update let's do that we'll say
users slash let's do 3 which is Sarah
and we're going to say headers change
the content type to application slash
Jason we'll go to body I'll say rock and
say we just want to update let's say she
got married so we want to change our
last name
alright so we'll say last name and we'll
change it to Smith alright so I think
that should work let's end and now we
get Sarah Smith back and if we go and
reload this you see that her last name
was updated so we have a full a full
restful api with some nice features and
we did it in I know this video is kind
of long but if you just look at what we
did to set this up it's very very simple
all right so let's see I think that's
all I want to do guys is just get you
set up with that seed let's go back to
the documentation because I feel like
I'm missing something
Oh a remote schema so if you don't want
to create your own data if you want to
actually use the data from Jason
placeholder you can just add it right
here you can say Jason server and then
add this URL so I'm going to copy that
and then what we'll do is go to our
package JSON file and I'm going to add
another script here let's put a comma
and let's say Jason
server : remote alright and then we're
going to set that to Jason - server and
then we're going to just paste that in
so now if we save and let's stop our
server down here with control C and
instead let's do NPM run jason's server
remote and now it's going to start at
the server but you'll see we have all of
these resources okay so it gives us all
this data to work with and if we go back
over to our browser and let's just go to
localhost 3000 you'll see all the
different resources we have all these
posts we have comments you know 500
comments albums photos users to do's and
the whole database okay which is a lot
of data to work with alright so I think
that's going to do it guys we're going
to stop this here hopefully this gave
you you know some insight into how to do
this and maybe you'll use it in future
projects I actually use it all the time
either the local or the the remote the
remote depending on what I'm doing so
