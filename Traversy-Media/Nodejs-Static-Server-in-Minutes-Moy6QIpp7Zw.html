you how to set up a static web server
using nodejs in just a couple minutes
alright and I'm gonna give you two
different options first is gonna be this
node static module which is really nice
we can set a certain folder to serve
static files and we can also have error
handlers okay if we get a 404 error we
can load a certain HTML file which is
really nice so we'll do that and then
there's also one called live server
which you can install globally and then
just run it from whatever directory
you're in and you can run any HTML file
alright so I'm gonna do the both of
those so first we'll start with node
static now you do need nodejs installed
if you don't have that just go to
node.js org and download it and install
it once you do that I'm gonna create a
folder here and we'll call this we'll
just call it a node server and I'm gonna
open up a command line now I'm using
this get bash utility but of course you
can use your standard Windows command
prompt or your Mac or Linux terminal
alright and first thing we need to do
like with any node app we need to create
a package.json file and we can run npm
init to do that ok it's gonna ask us
some questions the name just gonna click
enter description we'll just say simple
server entry point let's call it server
dot J s and then we'll just enter
through the rest all right so now if we
go in that folder we have a package dot
JSON file ok if we open that up it
should look something like this so now
we're gonna install node static so let's
go ahead and go back to the command line
and we'll say npm install node static -
- save alright and that should add it
right here as a dependency so now we
need to do is create our server JS file
okay we'll open that up and then if we
look at the documentation here at NPM J
Escom we can just grab this really copy
it paste it in here okay I'm gonna get
rid of these comments all right and
let's go ahead I'm gonna change the port
from 8080 to 8000 actually you know what
I usually like to do is have a port
variable so we'll say port equals 8,000
and then down here we'll say port and
this also takes in a callback function
so you can have something happen after
it runs I just want to do a console log
will say server started on port and then
we'll just concatenate that port
variable alright and that that should do
it so let's go ahead and save it and
we'll go back to our command line here
and let's run node server okay we get
server started on port 8000 now we don't
have a public folder so we're probably
gonna get some kind of error localhost
8080 colder and we'll add in
index.html let's open that up I'll just
put some say hello world save that and
now let's try running it again and we go
back and reload and we get our index
file now if we try to go to a page
that's not there like about HTML you'll
see that we just get this blank white
page which I would think we throw an
error but I guess it doesn't so we want
to create a custom error page okay when
this happens so what we can do is we can
go right in here
and add in a function okay I'm going to
pass in an event parameter here and then
rez and then we can check for the status
will say if e and e dot status is equal
to 404 which we know is an error then
we're gonna say file dot serve file okay
because we can serve individual files
and I'll say let's do slash error dot
HTML all right and then we're also gonna
pass in 404 an empty object and then I
request and response all right and that
should do it so let's save it and then
we get to create inside the public
folder will create error dot HTML
okay let's open that up and we're just
going to put in an h1 that says not
found okay and you can obviously put
whatever you want here so let's save
that and then we'll restart the server
okay let's make sure we can go to our
home page or our index page then if we
go to about HTML which isn't there it's
going to load that error page so not
found no matter what we put here it's
going to go to the not found all right
obviously if we do create the about page
it'll go to it all right so try about
dot HTML now and it loads it alright so
you now have a static web server all
right so that's node static now live
server is a little different it's
basically we're going to install it
globally so that we can load it from
anywhere which is really helpful so
let's close all this out and we're going
to create another folder here and I'll
just call it node and say node server -
and I'm gonna open up my command line
there I'll just navigate to it alright
and then we're going to install live
server so NPM install live server and
you want to make sure you add the dash G
that will install it globally
all right and I'm going to create an
index.html page and I'll open that up
okay let's see how that's doing that's
installed and now I'm gonna run what am
I gonna run I think we just friend live
server and I think I'm gonna get an
error because I believe it uses port
8080 which is used on my machine alright
so see how I'm getting an error yours
probably won't unless you are you that
port is being used now in my case I'm
going to use a different port and that's
really easy to do we just say live
server and - - port equals and I'm gonna
say 8000 and that's gonna open it up you
can see it's at my local host port 8000
and it's loading that index page okay so
it's as easy as that
now if I create here about dot HTML
and save that and then let's try to go
to slash a boat and there we go and
what's nice about this is it's all it's
just as it says it's a live server
meaning that if I go ahead and edit this
and save I don't even have to reload it
you'll see that it reloads on its own so
it's really helpful really easy to use
and I've actually been using it lately
for for a lot of my node projects
alright so I just wanted to give you
guys some information on these two
modules I'm gonna start making some more
short videos recently I've been making a
lot of courses and long tutorials but I
do want to make some more short videos
just showcasing one or two different
modules or technologies
alright so hopefully you found this
helpful and I'd appreciate it if you
could subscribe if you're not already
subscribed and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
