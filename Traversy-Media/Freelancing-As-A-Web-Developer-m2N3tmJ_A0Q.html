brad 20 to get 25% off hey guys in this
video we're gonna talk about freelancing
as a web developer and I just want to
say that everything in this video is
from my own personal experience in what
I've learned I'm not someone that has
worked for big corporations so my
personal advice isn't the best in that
area but being an entrepreneur
freelancing running my own businesses is
something that I've done for about a
decade now okay even to this day my
business is now focused on education but
I work for myself and it has a lot of
parallels with freelancing so what we're
gonna do is talk about the pros and cons
of freelancing as a web developer or
programmer and also talk about things
like what to do before you start how to
find work how to deal with clients and
so on and I will say that freelancing
isn't for everyone it's one of many
avenues that you can take as a developer
but hopefully this sheds a little light
on it and helps you decide if that's
what you want to do or not and then
maybe you can take something away from
this presentation that'll help you in
the future
okay I'm not promoting or discouraging
freelancing I'm just sharing my
experience and my thoughts on it alright
so when it comes to pros and cons I'd
say that there's an equal amount of pros
and cons it just depends on the person
and which one's matter to them the most
so for the pros the the main overall
advantage is freedom and flexibility not
all of us were made for nine-to-five
jobs in punch clocks freelancing really
gives you a lot of flexibility in many
areas such as where you work so you
could work from home and your pajamas
you could have your own office space you
could work from a Starbucks or a
bookstore anywhere you want also anytime
you want you can create your own hours
if you want to sleep all day and work
second or third shift you can do that
but you have to be someone that will
actually be motivated to work and not
say you know I'm tired forget it I'll
work twice as much tomorrow because
chances are you won't so you have to be
very disciplined in order to be a
freelancer and I'm gonna talk about who
freelancing is not for in the neck in
another slide so another advantage is
being able to pick and choose which
projects you take on and you want to
work on which is really something you
can't do if you're working for a company
now I would suggest really thinking
about it before denying work unless the
client is being very unreasonable I've
actually had someone ask me for a social
network that was quote similar to
LinkedIn to be built by myself within
three months for a thousand dollars I
think it was something ridiculous like
that now when you're just starting out
with little to no experience you
probably will won't be making a killing
but you also don't want to be taking
advantage of so you really need to know
how to say no to people some people are
just very out of touch with what goes
into building a social network or an
e-commerce site or something like that
and then the other reason that I would
reject an offer is if it's something
that just is impossible for me to do if
it's something that is - the technology
is just way beyond what I know or if the
timeline is too short if I know that I
just can't I can't do it no matter what
then I would reject it other than that I
think I would have taken on just about
anything as long as I knew it was
possible for me to do unless of course
my plate was absolutely full and I
couldn't I couldn't do any other work
which is a good thing so the next one
can be a pro or a con depending on who
you are I'm an extreme introvert so I've
always enjoyed working alone so it's a
pro to me they may not be the healthiest
thing as you know as healthy is working
with people but I find it much less
stressful and much more peaceful if
you're an extrovert and you always have
to be around people all day then this is
definitely a negative for instance my
wife is a hairdresser and she's very
going and she would go nuts doing what I
do and she tells me that all the time
all right so what are some of the cons
or disadvantages of being a freelancer
and working for yourself I would say
unpredictability is a huge one when I
was freelancing I would have weeks or
months where I was rolling in dough
because I maybe I got two big deposits
on a couple jobs but then the next month
I made significantly less so what I
would suggest is to really manage your
money well and maybe even take
everything you make and put it into the
bank and then give yourself a salary so
that you create your own steadiness of
income because it's not going to come
naturally when you're freelancing so
another disadvantage is you have no
benefits being a freelancer you have to
buy and manage your own health insurance
which is actually something I'm going
through right now which just sucks you
also get no retirement no 401k or
anything like that okay
lack of community again this depends on
the person but even speaking as an
introvert it would be nice to have
someone to bounce ideas off of and stuff
in the flesh I mean I do have a lot of
communication through email and stuff
like that with people but having that
community of developers and coworkers
can be nice motivation can also be an
issue for some people it's up to you to
create your schedule and stick to it in
the next slide I'm gonna talk a little
bit about some qualities that people may
have that may prevent them from being a
successful freelancer all right
separation from work and home is another
big one many people that work from home
have a hard time not checking emails not
doing work throughout the day often it's
very sporadic and you shouldn't do that
you should really try and set a solid
schedule and follow it as much as you
can so that you can have your family
time or your time with your friends or
whatever it is you like to do instead of
you know working all around the clock
alright so by no means am i making this
video to either glamorize freelancing or
discourage it but it is not for
everybody in
there are a lot of people that it's it's
not for and one of the the purposes of
this video is to help you guys realize
if it is for you or not now I'm not
saying if you have any of these issues
or traits you shouldn't be a freelancer
in fact I have some of these maybe if
you know you have every single one you
shouldn't you definitely shouldn't but a
couple can be overlooked or even better
they can be fixed so some traits of
people that that at least should think
twice before being a freelancer are if
you have trouble with motivation you
know motivating yourself to to write
code or to do anything to to do with
managing your business if you lack that
passion and that energy then things are
going to be difficult and you're
probably better just working a
nine-to-five job if you have trouble
managing your time or if you're easily
distracted you may have issues setting a
schedule and sticking to it don't pause
your work for two hours to go play a
video game and it's hard because
technically you can do that you know you
don't have a boss over your shoulder
that's watching you but you won't be
successful okay if you're doing that all
the time things like that so the next
one trouble dealing with clients this is
one that I definitely had issues with
and I still have so this is a good
example of something that you can have
but still be successful and I just had
to work on my communication skills and
just just tolerating pushy clients and
things like that I actually have a video
on how to deal with difficult clients if
you want to check that out so if you
hate being alone a freelancing web
developer or programmer may not be the
best path because most freelancers do
work alone and if you don't like to
learn i would say programming and
technology in general may not be the
best path because things are always
changing and you're always always having
to learn more that's one of the things
about development I wouldn't say one of
the bad things because I enjoy it most
developers do I'm guessing if you watch
this channel you probably don't have
this problem because my videos are
that's the sole purpose is to learn so
most you guys probably don't have to
worry about this but
if you know if someone doesn't like to
learn they're probably not going to want
to be a web developer or a programmer in
general all right so I hope that that
didn't put freelancing in too much of a
negative light I just want to be a
hundred percent honest and I don't want
to steer people down the wrong path
freelancing was actually really great
for me it led me to have a great
successful life being an entrepreneur so
it was a great thing for me but it's
just a fact that it's not for every
single person every every developer all
right so let's say freelancing is for
you where do you start so first of all
you want to learn as much as you can so
that you can provide the services that
people need and you can actually get the
jobs done you need to decide the scope
of what you're gonna offer as far as
services and technology are you gonna do
front-end UI web design WordPress Drupal
full-stack JavaScript you know nodejs
Python what is it that you want to
specialize in and I'm not saying that
you should never take a project that
isn't in your specialty but you should
have some kind of foundation of what you
do if you're the WordPress guy people
are gonna come to you for WordPress and
you're gonna be very popular for that
specific thing if you're the UI guy
people will come to you for front-end
stuff and you probably specialize in
things like react or angular things that
will that allow you to build really cool
dynamic interfaces if you specialize in
large web applications you'll need to
know you know a back-end language and
database something like MySQL or MongoDB
you probably already have some kind of
skill set and you want to build on that
if you're looking for something to
specialize in then go on sites like
upwork and look at the projects that are
being offered and what are they what
what are they asking for now once you
have some skills and you're able to
build things and create projects you
want to build up your business plan what
do you expect to accomplish and be
realistic also come up with your pricing
create your contracts and invoices in
fact the sponsor for this video the
freelancing bundle includes
sample invoices and everything you need
to get set up to be a freelancer so if
you're interested I would definitely
suggest checking that out I'd also
suggest meeting with an accountant to
discuss taxes and stuff like that once I
got in the countin things were so much
easier because I didn't really have a
clue what I was doing in that aspect and
it was just a real pain in the ass to do
on my own so he helped me out with a lot
you also want to build your website in
your brand you need a place where people
can see our services and what you offer
and I realize when you're just starting
out it's hard to create a portfolio but
it doesn't matter or it doesn't really
matter if the items in your portfolio
are actually from paying clients they
could be your own projects or they could
be something you did for a family member
or a friend or maybe a website you even
built for free for like a local business
a local pizza shop something like that
anything that shows that you can
actually put something together ok these
are the things that I would suggest
doing before you actually start looking
for work so once you're ready where do
you find work these are all the things
that helped me out so of course you have
your websites that were created to
connect freelancers with clients and I'm
gonna give you a list of those resources
for those sites in the next slide now a
lot of people do criticize these sites
because there's there's a lot of
freelancers usually from more poor
countries that will apply for a job for
just a ridiculous amount and that's what
you're competing with and this used to
piss me off and it still does because I
feel like they're lowering the value of
of web development in general of
programming on a global scale and I
realize they're struggling and they just
want whatever they can get but
ultimately they're hurting themselves if
they plan on staying in this field so
just be aware that you you will be
dealing with that alright but not
everyone wants the cheapest third world
programmer and I don't mean to offend
anybody when I say that I'm not talking
about any specific country or anything
I'm just being very honest and I say how
I feel but anyway many people realize
that
if they hire a guy to build a large
website for a hundred bucks ten times
out of ten they're not going to get a
good product and they're gonna they're
gonna have to start from square one
anyways now if you get some feedback on
your profile on these sites you're gonna
be looked at some good feedback I should
say you're gonna be looked at as someone
that can do the job and I'm not pulling
this out of my ass I actually had this
exact experience when they see that
other people are leaving these really
good reviews and you gave them what they
want they're gonna they're gonna want to
have you do their work even if you're
charging more than the other guys all
right so just remember that at first
it's gonna be tough because you're not
gonna have any reputation but once you
you build that up you might have to do a
couple jobs for a really you know small
amount of money but just get those
reviews so next you have online or
social networking so Facebook Linkedin
other professional based networks you
want to join groups get yourself out
there and let everyone know what you do
even for your personal accounts let it
let all the people that you went to high
school with on Facebook know that you
build web sites or web apps and if they
if either they or someone they know has
been looking to put a website together
maybe they'll they'll contact you
alright in addition to online networking
you can do some real-life networking so
go to conferences meetups conventions
anything to do with technology and just
network with people you might find a
bigger company looking to outsource to a
freelancer and I've had quite a few of
those jobs in the past I enjoyed those
because I got to deal with people that
actually knew what went into a project
and they also pay very well and that's
something I haven't really mentioned yet
is that you can get regular clients that
you know want a website for their
restaurant or something like that or you
can get other developers that have
projects that they just don't have time
for or maybe they're they don't know
enough and they need someone with that
with a with more skill I've had quite a
few of those and those pay off very well
also advertising maybe something that
you want to do
I did a a a an ad in my local paper for
web design and computer repair when I
started out and I got quite a few calls
on that it was the only one in the paper
it was a smaller paper so it wasn't it
wasn't expensive this was quite a while
ago I'm not sure how effective this
would be now but then you also have
online advertising with like Adwords or
Facebook or even other websites that
have ad spots available and you could
also publish quality content on your own
website so create a blog specialize in
you know development topics this will
drive traffic to your site and expose
your services to people when I had my
tech guy web solution site I did a blog
post maybe every other day and at one
point I was getting a ton of traffic
from Google and I know that these days
SEO is tougher being found on the
Internet is tougher but it can still be
done alright so these are just a few of
the things that have worked for me in
the past one way or another some are
better than others but if anyone else
has any other tips you can go ahead and
leave those in the comments I'm sure a
lot of you guys have experience with
with some of this stuff as well so this
is a list of sites that I compiled where
you may want to start looking for
projects we have a bunch of freelance
based sites also sites like Craigslist
even github and Stack Overflow I believe
have a job section and you also have
more traditional job sites like indeed
and and monster sites like that and I
know a lot of these postings are for
actual company positions but it doesn't
hurt to look and see if there's anyone
willing to outsource projects to you and
I'm not going to go through and read all
these but just check some of them out
even if you're not ready at least you
can get an idea of what's out there and
what's being asked for alright so the
last thing that I want to say is to just
be confident when you're working for
yourself it's very overwhelming you're
not going to be an expert when you first
start it may seem a little awkward
dealing with your first couple
especially if you're like me and you're
more of an introvert but trust me it
gets easier as you as you go on you're
gonna build your skills with people and
with your development knowledge as each
project completes okay or as you
complete each project and as far as
being scared to take on projects don't
be unless like I said before you know
you can't do it or if it's too much for
one person or maybe it's a technology
you've never even heard of things like
that other than that you'll be able to
figure it out I can tell you from my
experience that I had very very few
projects where the client explained what
they wanted and it just popped right in
my head what I was gonna do it just
doesn't work like that I would have to
do a lot of research and figure out what
technologies what plugins I'm gonna use
things like that and I just figured it
out as I went along so as long as you
try your hardest and you have patience
and ambition you'll get it done and
you'll do a great job so don't let any
low self-esteem stop you from thriving
and then just make sure you give the
client a realistic timeline and I've
said this to guys before in other videos
never give a shorter timeline just to
sound good make sure you give them a
longer timeline and then if you're done
sooner than that it's a nice surprise to
them okay so that's gonna be it guys
hopefully you enjoyed this and it helped
you both figure out if freelancing is
right for you as well as how to get
started if you liked it please hit that
