creating a simple website a responsive
website using the w3 CSS framework this
framework is similar to bootstrap
foundation I guess they're all pretty
similar and gives you things like
buttons alerts texts classes it has its
own grid system so it has quite a bit if
you look over on the sidebar here this
is the documentation w3schools con / w3
CSS
alright so what will be building is this
site here this is basically a one-page
website if I click about it brings us
down services contact so let's start at
the top here we have this you have the
navbar which is pretty simple I think
it's easier to implement than the
bootstrap navbar but it doesn't give you
as much features and then we have the
showcase area here we're not using too
much of the framework here it's
basically just a background image with a
heading and then a paragraph and a
button alright now notice when I reload
the heading and paragraph kind of fade
in which is kind of nice and that's
that's just from adding a certain class
to it same thing here with the opacity
you can see through the button here all
right then we just have this area and
notice when I hover over these they get
a little lighter they're not links or
anything I just wanted to add that
effect all right we're using font
awesome for icons just by including the
font awesome CDN so this is the about
area okay we get these little tabs or
accordions whatever you want to call
them then just a simple image another
heading here our services and we're
using some more font awesome icons and
we added some background color to them
using the framework and then down here
we just have a simple contact form and a
footer alright so very very simple oh
and if we click on start here or it
opens up a modal with form a
registration form this doesn't work it's
just the UI okay and if we go ahead and
make this smaller this is the mobile
view which is actually I think
better-looking than
the website view alright so we have our
menu which turns into a responses menu
and we have our little areas here you
have our accordion services you can see
the icons are now all in one row and we
have our form at the bottom okay so
pretty simple and very responsive you
can see this is around the size of a
tablet it still looks good alright so
I'm not saying that this is better than
bootstrap in fact it's definitely not
but it is an alternative that you can
use if you want to just expand so you
can expand your front-end development
skills alright so let's go ahead and get
started all we have to do to use this is
include the CDN which is this link right
here we just need to add that to our
header and we should be good so let's go
ahead and let me just create a file on
my desktop or a folder rather and I'm
going to call this acne underscore w3
CSS okay and we're just going to create
an index.html file and that's going to
be our only HTML file okay we also want
folder CSS and let's create a folder
called IMG for our images all right now
I'm just going to open up actually let's
create our stylesheet first so this will
be styled dot CSS we're going to open up
our index.html and let's open that with
Adam of course you can use whatever
you'd like alright so I'm going to put
some basic HTML tags in camp and go to
the title and we'll say acne do all Cass
acne
web services and now if we go over here
we want to grab the viewport right here
because it's going to be responsive and
then the CDN link
I'll put that right there all right now
on let me just extend this I like to do
it so we can see both on the set you
know split screens but you guys won't be
able to see all the code it gets all
jumbled all right let's see so we're
also going to want to link our style
sheet so I'm just going to copy this and
change this to CSS slash style.css now
we're also using font awesome so I'm
just going to grab that CDN as well okay
so let's do right here and we'll grab it
we'll grab this so we'll put it right
here Keeks rep and then let's just paste
that in alright so that should be it for
our header our head tag okay let's
actually open this up okay
so now what we want to do is let's go to
the documentation and just close that
and let's go to the navigation because
that's the first thing on our list all
right so the navigation you have
different colors if gray dark gray gray
blueish grey black we're going to use
the black version so all we have to do
is include this w3 black class all right
and the nav bar itself takes a w3 bar
class notice that all the all the
classes are prefixed with w3 - ok so
let's actually let's go down here first
we do want the responsive version so
let's grab this ok so we have our w3
bars or b3 black and then our links now
I want the menu are the links to float
to the right and then we're going to
have the I guess logo if you want to
call it that it's basically just the
title here we want that on the left and
one of the links on the right so what
I'll do is if we go to our documentation
should show us what to do we just want
text right here navigation bar text so
if we want to actually just use a span
like that all right so we'll put that
right there and then to align these
links let's do a nut a span and class
and then this framework has alignment
classes so we can say w3 right I'll just
wrap these links here
okay have that over all right so let's
save that let's see what we get okay so
we have our links over here and our logo
over here let's go like that now notice
that this isn't this doesn't look very
responsive I mean this part does but
this is you know we're floating this to
the right we don't want that so if you
want to take away all the floats and
basically make it mobile-friendly all
you have to do is add the w3 mobile
class so we're going to add that to the
branding right here the logo actually
make this acne web services okay we'll
add the class w3 mobile and also going
to give us a class of branding so that
we can you know style it if we want and
then we also want to put the w3 mobile
on to this span okay so let's go ahead
and try that and there we go now it's
responsive all right
so and that's pretty much it for the
navbar oh I do want to excuse me I do
want to make these hover I want to make
these red not gray so what we can do is
add w3 hover thread I believe let's try
it out yeah okay and you can have
different colors too if you want I'm
just going to make all of these red so
let's just add those okay we'll save
that and now we have the red hover all
right so let's just change these links
up so we have home that's going to go to
the number sign which will bring it to
the top and then this one will be what
this one will be about
I'm going to make this hrf go to the
number sign and then about and services
contact all right and I'm just going to
put a comment here things with the
navigation and that should be good let's
save it now we have our links all right
so next we're going to do the showcase
okay now that has a background image
which you can find in your in the code
in the description we just - there so
you should have showcase JPEG and then
we also be about image alright so we're
going to create a section here we're
gonna use the html5 section tag and give
it a clap of Shokan okay and in here
let's see we're going to put a container
because we want everything inside the
text to be pushed into the middle and
have margin auto on the sides so with
this framework that the container class
is a w3 - container alright and then I
also want everything to be centered so
we're going to use the class w3 center
okay and then in here we're going to
have the h1 and that's going to say go
anywhere and we're going to make that
all uppercase through CSS and then we
have an HR horizontal rule which we need
to we need to change the style of that
and then a paragraph and just has some
sample content I'm just
I grabbed this you guys can put whatever
you like here alright and then we have
the button so under the paragraph let's
put in button and that's going to have a
class of w3 - button we want to be red
so w3 red I want it to be large w3 large
there's also w3 small extra large extra
extra large
and then I also want it to be
see-through so wink say w3 opacity okay
and that's just going to say start here
all right so let's see what it looks
like okay so let's go to the CSS to our
style dot CSS file and let's start with
the branding here I want that to be a
little bigger so we're going to say dark
branding and I'm just going to set the
font size to 17 pixels okay and then
we'll do a showcase so it's going to
have a background background which will
be a URL and that's going to be dot dot
slash and the image folder slash
showcase dot jpg all right and we're
going to set it to no-repeat then we're
going to set the height okay height is
going to be 600 pixels and let's that
all this at the background position of
the image to Center okay actually going
to put that above the height
all right so height 600 and let's set
padding so padding I want to do 140 on
the top and bottom and then 100 on the
left and right all right I want all the
color to be white so let's go ahead and
save to that reload okay so we need to
do a couple things here so we'll do with
the h1 showcase h1 and I want to set the
font size to be 40 pixels and let's set
the font weight to 700 make it a little
more bold and then I want to do text
transform because I want it to be all
uppercase all right let's take a look at
that now we also have a we can use a
text shadow class if we look in the
documentation here let's see right here
so if we add this class w3 text shadow
let's add that to our h1
okay so if we look at that it you can't
really see it too good but it just added
a little bit of shadow let's see what
else we want to do I want it to fade in
and all we have to do for that to happen
is just add a simple class so w3 animate
- opacity so now when we reload you'll
see that it just it fades in okay so
that's really simple to implement let's
also do it to the paragraphs so we'll
give this a class of w3 animate capacity
so now both of the heading and the
paragraph fade in okay let's go back to
our style sheet and now we're going to
do the HR right here I want to make it
red and I want to make it really small
so say showcase HR and let's set this to
a width of 100 pixels and we're going to
set the margin Auto which will bring it
to the middle and set the border width
to 3 pixels and set the border color to
that red color which is hexadecimal
value F 4 4 2 Z 3 3 6
okay let's reload there we go now for
the paragraph I want the font to be a
little bigger so let's do show case P
I'll set the font size set the font size
to 16 all right and let's set the
padding bottom of the paragraph we're
going to set that to 20 pixels okay so
just a little bit of change and that's
it for the showcase area so now we're
going to do this section right here this
welcome home section so let's go back to
our HTML
let's go here and I'm just going to call
this section one and I'm going to give
this a class of section and also the
background color I want to be red so we
can simply give w3 red and then let's do
w3 hover opacity which will make it fade
a little bit when I hover over it okay
so in here we want the container because
we want to bring that the content in
from the side so w3 container and also
w3 Center and let's see we're going to
use font awesome here so we want to put
in an eye tag with the class of FA and
then the icon we want which is FA - home
ok then we're going to put in h2 and
we're just going to say welcome home and
then a paragraph which I'm going just
going to grab this paste that in and
take a look at it okay now look how
small the icon is by default we need to
make that bigger and then I also want to
add some padding so let's go to our
style sheet and let's add in dot section
okay there's going to be a few elements
that have that have this clap and we're
going to add the pattern say padding 40
pixels on the top and bottom zero on the
sides and then for the h2 section h2 I
want to remove the padding and margin
alright and then for the icon has a
class of FA and I set the font size of
that icon to 50 pixels
okay and that should do it like save and
reload and there we go that's that so
now we're going to do the next section
which is similar so I'm going to just
copy this changes to section two and
then we're going to do w3 light gray
will keep the hover hover claps and
we're going to keep that the icon we're
going to change to cog which is just a
gear icon and then let's change this to
let's begin okay save that reload and
there's that so the next area is going
to be this about right here so let's go
ahead and add that
let's do actually I'll just I'll just
copy this okay so we're going to take
away these two classes will keep the
section class and then we're not going
to Center this but we do want the
container and let's take away this stuff
here okay now this is where we're going
to use the grid system so just like with
bootstrap we do a roll class and then we
have our column classes so it's a div
class
w3 - now you can do w3 row but we want
padding for the columns so we're going
to add w3 row padding all right and then
we'll do give let's give this a class of
w3 call and then the size of it which
will be five five column gives so we
want to do m5 okay so that's for the
medium size screen you can also do l5 s5
for small screens and then I'm just
going to copy that
and then this one's going to be seven
all right so the five column is just
going to have that image so image source
and it's going to be IMG / of felt dot
jpg all right so let's reload we have
our image now this goes outside of its
container so what we need to do is set
the image to 100% width so I'm just
going to add it to the section section
image set that to a width of 100% and
reload and now it's contained within its
div okay so next we have the the
accordion
now with this we actually have to add a
little bit of JavaScript so if we go to
let's see accordions and we need to
basically whatever element we want to
click we need to add an on click and
then we need to add a function which is
this function here so let's actually
just grab this script tag and everything
in it go down to above the body and
paste that in okay they called it my
function but you can call it whatever
you want I'm just going to call it a cc
accordion function and basically it just
adds and removes the w3 show class when
we click it so let's go back up here
where we want to put the accordion and
let's grab grab this
all right so it's not called my function
28cc function and then this is going to
be basically the ID needs to match
whatever content you want open when you
click this so this is going to call you
what and then we're going to change this
ID to what okay and then for this text
right here let's say what we do okay and
then for the text I'm just going to copy
this and then we also have an h3 so
let's put that in as well and we'll say
we do everything or we do it all
something like that
okay then we'll just put a paragraph and
I'm just going to paste that text in
alright so let's go over here and reload
and now we have a little drop-down
accordion now I want this to show by
default so what we can do is just add
change the w3 hide to w3 show okay and
then we just want to copy button this
ends here so we want this and copy it
and it'll paste it right below and again
so this one will be who and this will be
who and this is going to be w3 hide see
ya and then for this let's say what is I
say for who we are actually
okay we'll just leave that text so
actually we'll just make it a little
shorter okay and then down here this is
going to be where we're and then this is
also going to be where and we'll say we
are everywhere
sounds a little creepy but slide okay so
let's go this needs to be hide so let's
try that okay so this is open by default
and then we can open this one and this
one closed them as well all right so
that's our About section and if we go up
here and we click on a boat it should
all we didn't give it an ID of about two
yeah this section needs an ID of a bunk
alright so reload and click about now
notice that when we go down here the
menus gone so what we need to do is make
this fixed to the top so to do that all
we have to do is wrap it in a certain
class so let's go back up here and we're
going to wrap the whole navigation in a
class called w3 top
all right so it's leaves that and now if
we reload it stays at the top if we
click about we still have the menu we
can go back up okay let's see now if we
make this smaller you'll see that the
nav bar is now covering this part we
can't go up anymore what we have to do
is add to the body we have to move this
down but we only want it move down when
it's in a mobile view so for that we
need to use a media query so down at the
bottom in our CSS file we are going to
say at media only screen and we want to
put a max width here because all the
styles in this block should only pertain
to when the window has a max width of
600 pixels okay if it's over that then
this will won't be in effect so we just
want to say body and let's add a margin
top of 190 pixels so now if we go over
here and reload now we can see the whole
thing now I also I don't like how this
looks there's too much space here and
it's just too big so we're also going to
put our showcase and say height will
change it to 400 pixels make it a little
smaller and then padding we're going to
set to 60 pixels top and bottom so now
if we reload now it looks good all right
and if we make it bigger you can see
that it's unchanged from before all
right so let's continue on we're going
to now do the services heading which is
this part right here so let's copy so
this a welcome home area because it's
pretty similar which is this
and then we'll go down here and paste
that in okay so this is going to be the
services heading and we want to keep
actually need to add an ID of services
so that the menu goes to it and we're
going to keep all that we're going to
keep these we're going to get rid of the
icon and then we're going to have an h1
and we'll say our services I'm just
going to add a text shadow class as well
cut shadow all right and we'll keep this
text as well so let's take a look at
that and so there's our services heading
now we need to put in the actual
services so let's put I'm just going to
copy this it's that and we're going to
get rid of the ID and then change get
rid of those and then this is going to
be light gray so we want w3 light gray
and we're going to keep these classes
and then we want to use the grid system
again so it's cut this out and with a
class w3 row and then we want our
columns
so this will be w3 call and these are
going to be three column tips because we
want four of them a lot for three column
did so in here will have an icon we're
going to give us the class of FA and
then F a comment and we want to give it
a background as well red background and
then we want to add some padding which
w3 has a class called padding and then
the sides will stay small I think it's
eight pics or four pixels or something
like that and then we also want it to be
rounded so we're going to take w3 round
X Lodge all right
so that'll be the icon and then we want
our h3 say internet marketing and then
for the paragraph we'll just put this
LARM Epsom that's right here okay and
then let's take a look at that okay
looks good and we're going to copy this
column div right here and paste it in
three more times
okay in second one is going to be SEO
and we're going to change the icon to
search okay then this one here will be
software development and let's change
the icon to what is it cubes and then
the last one here is going to be cloud
hosting and we're going to change the
comment to fa cloud
now let's take a look at that okay that
looks good let's check it out in the
responses mobile view looks good all
right so we're getting there let's now
do the contact heading which is this so
I'm going to just copy see what I want
to copy let's copy the are services
heading because it's pretty much the
same thing where is it right here okay
this is going to be contact heading
change the ID to contact and we're going
to change it to w3 light no dark grey
now change this to get in touch all
right and then we're going to have the
main contact section so let's see we'll
just copy this
and we're going to get rid of the ID and
then we just need the section class and
then we don't want to center this so
we'll get rid of that and let's get rid
of the h1 and the paragraph so let's go
over to the documentation and take a
look at inputs or is it right here
okay so these forms actually look pretty
cool pretty nice and clean checkboxes
and so on we're going to make this
really simple and we're going to grab
this okay let's go and paste that right
here
all right
so for the header let's get rid of that
let's say contact us and then let's do
name email what message as well to be
free input this will be message and then
let's do a text area with a class of w3
input I think see what that looks like
no what's uh
don't give us an example with a textarea
apparently this is a textarea let's look
at the source code here text the area
class alright let's just copy that see
if that works yeah there we go so let's
add a submit button as well ok button
type equals submit in a class of w3
button or BTN actually I don't know if
that's right is it button or BTN button
all right and then I'm just going to put
a couple line breaks oh we've got the
text and here so I submit and let's put
a line break under the text area and
let's change the color of this to red
no not red let's do dark gray
there we go good enough so if it's a
contact it brings us down to the floor
all right so now we just have the footer
which is very simple I'm going to use an
html5 Twitter tag and let's see let's
give the footer a class of w3 black and
also I want some padding so we'll do W 3
- padding - X large and then W 3 Center
and then I'm just going to put a power
graph in here it'll just say acne web
services copyright 2017 ok let's take a
look at that and there's up for very
very simple let's see actually want to
add a little bit of padding to the form
so right here we have this form tag
let's add W 3 padding X Lodge ok so that
looks a little better so that's that's
it really for the homepage now what we
need to do is the the modal when we
click start here so if we go to the
documentation and we go to ski where is
it
moto moto right here okay so this is a
simple modal right here what I'm going
to do actually I'm just going to type it
out okay so we'll start off with the
button start here button we have to add
some stuff to that which is right here
we need to add an on-click attribute so
let's do on click equals then we want to
do document dot get element by ID and
we'll call this start - modal and then
we're going to just do dot style dot
style and then dot display because we
want to change the display to a block so
equals block okay because it's going to
start off hidden and then when we click
that it's going to change it from hidden
to display block so now we're going to
go down here we're going to add the
modal so down at the bottom below the
footer so let's click our comment we're
going to put in a div and give it an ID
of start modal just like we set up a
bump okay and we also need to give it a
class of w3 - modal okay then we want to
do another div with the class of modal
content
and inside here we'll have the header
and header is actually going to have a
class or two classes we're going to give
it a container so w3 container and then
also w3 red okay now in the header we're
going to put a span and we're going to
do the we're going to do the close
button so this is going to have an on
click all right stand on click all right
and then for the text we want to display
a close and X icon which we can use and
% x semicolon so the on click we're
going to set that to just like above
document dot get element by B and that's
going to be starting a little and then
we want to add on to the end here dot
style dot display and set that equal to
none okay so it's going to close it up
again or hide it so let's see below the
header actually still in the header we
need to just put our h2 and we'll just
say get started
all right so now below the header we're
going to put in a div with a container
class
and inside here we're going to put a
form okay let's put a div here with the
class I'm going to give this a class of
w3 section and then here we're going to
put our label of name and input inputs
going to have a class of w3 input also
let's do w3 porter and let's add some
margin with w3 margin bottom and which
will give it a little bit of bottom
margin and then let's give this input a
type of text and a placeholder I'll just
say enter name okay so there's our name
label and input now under it we're going
to do the user name so I'm just going to
copy this and then I'll just change this
to user name change the place holder as
well and under that we're going to do
the password
so let's change the type from text to
password and we'll say enter password 1
let's copy the password label and input
and we're going to do a confirmed
password ok and then we'll do our button
this is going to have a class of w3 lot
read notes do black love you 3 black and
I want it to be a block button meaning I
want it to go all the way all the way
across so for that we can do w3 - BTN -
block
ok let's also give it w3 section and w3
paddock and that will just say submit ok
let's save it and let's hope it works
so to reload and start here well it
doesn't look right ok so something is
wrong here
well it's not modal Oh this this needs
w3 in front of it that should be it
hopefully
yep no is it this close button should be
over there I believe you see see our
stand right here that has the oh yeah
that needs a class as well so right here
ok class that's going to be w3 - close
BTN
okay so now it's over here and it's a
little bigger good so that's it guys
hopefully you enjoyed this little
project or maybe I'll use this framework
in the future as an alternative to
bootstrap or foundation if you want to
just kind of give it a new look because
often bootstrap sites can all look the
same so this gives you just another
option all right so thanks for watching

dislike if you didn't like it alright so
