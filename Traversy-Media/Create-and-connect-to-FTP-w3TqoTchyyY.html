showing you how to create an FTP account
for your website and also how to connect
to that FTP account via an FTP client
such as FileZilla or smart FTP yeah so
the first thing the first thing you want
to do is log in to your cPanel and
scroll down to where it says files FTP
accounts and I don't know if you've
watched my other tutorials on creating
an email account and creating a database
and see piano but it's pretty much the
same thing it's pretty easy to create
you just wanna this website I'm using is
actually one of my websites cheap PLR
articles dotnet so the FTP account is
going to be let's just say test FTP at
cheap PLR articles dotnet and create a
password two one two one two one two and
here this is very important this is the
directory where your in on your website
that your FTP account is going to link
to
by default it gives you it makes a new
directory that's named after your
username so this is test FTP but there's
nothing in that directory so we don't we
want to get rid of that we want to
connect to the root of the site so just
erase that delete that and just leave
public HTML and that will go to the root
public each HTML always goes to the root
of your site so it's the very very top
of your site the quota you can set a
quota we'll leave it at unlimited and
create FTP account so now we've added an
FTP account to the site and this this
gives us the information we need to
connect to it through through an FTP
software client
let's do that now the the client that I
recommend that you use is FileZilla you
can download it let's go
FileZilla alright
and it's free FileZilla is free there's
other ones smite FTP there's a few of
them but this is the one I recommend
that I like the best so just download it
I already have it on my computer so I'm
not going to download it but you just
download and install it like any other
software I'm sure you know how to do
that so after you download it run it you
just fit this in here
and this is what it looks like this is
what FileZilla looks like all FTP
clients look similar so let's go and
let's take this info where is it this
info that we got from from cPanel FTP
username is going to be test MTP at
cheap PLR articles dotnet so let's copy
that
that's the FTP username so now go to
FileZilla and put that in the username
the host is going is always going to be
it's the same as the website so the host
is just cheap PLR articles dotnet so
just take that pot paste it in the host
the password right here one two one two
one two and the port you can leave that
blank but just so you know what 21 is
always used to FTP 22 I think is is
secure FTP but we can just leave this
blank
just click quick connect
I'll do a bunch of crap up here you
don't need to worry about that and there
we go we're connected just move this
down so you can see and this is these
are all the files on our web host on
this particular website and this is how
this is how you connect to your website
these are all the files this is a Joomla
site so it has all the Joomla
directories you know the images
directories where all you in most your
images on the site is stored you know
and that's how you how you add stuff to
your site just in case you were
wondering that's how you connect to FTP
if you have any questions you can email
support a tech guy web solutions and
that's it that's how you do create an
FTP account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
