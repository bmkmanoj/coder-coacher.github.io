description below it would score on guys
in this video we're gonna take a look at
two of the most popular programming
languages in the world of web
development and that's PHP and Python so
we're gonna look in a few different
categories and compare things like
learning curve popularity and so on now
before we begin there's a couple really
important points that I want to make and
I want you to keep in mind throughout
this video so one is there's there's no
general and clear answer for everyone
and to say that PHP is better or Python
is better with no context behind it it's
just it's foolish and it's something
that you'll never see me do in my videos
the purpose of these comparison videos
is to really just take a look at both
technologies in an unbiased way and it
is unbiased because I use both I like
both just to help people decide which
path they may want to take all right
it's also to just to learn more about
the languages and what they're generally
used for and I base these videos on
facts research general opinion as well
as my own opinion because like I said I
have worked with both throughout the
years now with that said don't ever get
all of your information from one place
such as this video when you research
anything make sure you have multiple
credible resources because there's a lot
of fanboys out there that they'll just
they'll just trash whatever they don't
use if there are PHP developer they'll
just trash Python any chance they get
maybe they had a bad experience and they
didn't understand it and they just want
to discredit it and you can't listen to
trash like that because it's just it's
based on pure emotion it's not based on
any kind of scientific data or facts or
anything of any intelligence so that's
the reason I make these video
is to kind of combat that kind of stuff
alright so the first thing that I want
to address is the fact that Python and
PHP although they are often compared
that it's almost like comparing apples
to oranges because of the the language
use PHP is strictly for building web
applications it's extremely popular for
web development on its own or through
frameworks or through content management
systems like WordPress that's its job
that's what PHP does Python however is
you it's used for web development but
it's also used for many other things so
it's a general-purpose language and
Python is getting more popular every day
but not necessarily for web development
machine learning and AI it's huge right
now and Python plays a big role in that
genre okay same with data science
automation stuff like that so there is a
very clear difference in the two
languages and their purposes so before
you can even ask which language is
better for you you really need to do
some thinking about what you want to do
if you're interested in machine learning
and AI or data science or anything else
that Python is excellent at then that's
probably your clear choice but if you're
interested in building full stack web
applications web API is anything that
PHP and Python do in a similar way then
you have some more digging to do and
since this channel is almost purely web
development I'm guessing that's what
most of you guys are interested in all
right so let's talk a little bit about
popularity so the results of the 2018
Stack Overflow survey came in which is a
pretty pretty respected survey
it gave PHP a popularity score of thirty
point seven and python a score of thirty
eight point eight okay it also said and
I quote Python has a solid claim for
being the fastest growing major
programming language so that along with
a lot of other resources all point to
Python surpassing PHP and popularity but
again Python is used for many more
things than PHP is PHP has its little
small world of web applications if we're
talking about popularity of just that of
web
sites of web apps then PHP blows Python
away if you look at the numbers of
websites that use PHP / Python then PHP
is a clear winner
okay WordPress is a huge component of
that among other frameworks like laravel
so both languages are used by large
companies most big companies and
websites use multiple technologies but
PHP is used for instance by Facebook
Wikipedia Yahoo and many others and then
you have Instagram parts of Google
Spotify that use Python so neither
language has a shortage of credentials
in that area
alright and you can do a quick search to
see what companies use what and they're
both pretty popular
all right so syntax and elegance now one
thing that I've noticed is we're talking
about popularity in the industry and
popularity among developers is really
two different things PHP is very
practical as far as deployment hosting
you know WordPress content management
things like that which makes it great
for developers but on the other hand
there's also so much poorly written PHP
out there and the fact is that it it
lets you write poor code and it still
works it's really left kind of a bad
taste in the mouths of many web
developers as far as syntax and elegance
it's not that far up on the scale and
too much freedom can definitely be a bad
thing and we'll talk about this you know
throughout throughout this video but PHP
was actually the first language that I
learned before JavaScript and I've
written some pretty bad PHP just like
most of us and the reason for that is
one there was a lot of bad tutorials and
courses out there and two what I wrote
still worked okay and when you're a new
developer if it works it works you don't
realize that yes it works but it's
extremely insecure and prone to SQL
injection or it's not scalable at all
and nobody can read your code
the term spaghetti code usually refers
to PHP code now with that said just
because there's a lot of bad PHP out
there doesn't mean that you
right good PHP code so you just need to
take the time to learn the best
practices focus on object-oriented clean
code with classes rather than just a
procedural mess that no one can read
okay if you do that PHP can be
incredible okay if as long as you learn
to write it correctly it's a great
language Python on the other hand is
much more strict in its syntax and how
it lets you put things together which
makes it cleaner and in turn I think it
gets more respect from from programmers
I know that you know like I said PHP
kind of rules the the web the web area
but not everybody that writes PHP
actually likes it I've actually known a
lot of developers that worked with PHP
almost exclusively and hated it so like
I said the popularity the popularity in
the industry doesn't really reflect the
popularity with developers themselves
now many people such as myself like the
C style syntax that PHP uses Python
doesn't have that it uses indentation
over curly braces and it is I guess more
readable but I don't know maybe it's
just me being a JavaScript developer I
just like the C style from curly braces
and semicolons things like that just
preference I guess so this brings us to
learning curve now a lot of what I'm
gonna say here comes from my own
experience when you talk about what's
easy or hard everyone's different so
take all of this along with this whole
presentation with a grain of salt okay
also keep in mind I'm much more fluent
in PHP than I am with Python now I think
Python has a much cleaner and clearer
way of doing things there is a right way
in a wrong way and if you do the wrong
way it's not gonna work which helps with
the learning curve but at the same time
I think that even though the syntax is
more readable without all the curly
braces and arrows and all of that the
scope of what's happening
is a bit harder to understand than in
PHP I think that aside from the actual
code just the scope of what Python is
capable of is also much more vague than
PHP before I learned anything about
Python I didn't know what the hell it
was used for and I think that the fact
that it's so diverse and it's used for
so many things is what kind of confused
me a lot of things that you know a lot
of things like machine learning it's
just complicated in general
so since Python is used for those
complicated topics it might be looked at
as a complicated language now PHP on the
other hand its purpose is clear as day
you build database driven web apps and
that's it so in that aspect I think PHP
is easier now as far as the the ease of
syntax goes for me PHP was a little
easier because I like the C syntax style
and if you're coming from JavaScript or
you're coming from let's say C sharp or
something like that you'll probably have
an easier time learning a CSUN another C
syntax language rather than something
like Ruby or Python or something that
uses indentations and doesn't use curly
braces and stuff like that
now what is hard about PHP and what
really sucks is that the right way in
the wrong way is not always clear okay
and the wrong way often works but it
causes more problems down the line
another thing it's not very secure by
default so you really have to look into
securing your application if you're
using vanilla PHP and not some kind of
framework that takes care of that stuff
for you okay I will say that it's gotten
a lot better for some of you older
developers that used to use PHP for back
in the day and procedural style the
procedural style MySQL library you look
up like preventing SQL injection for
let's say a post request or a get
request or something like that and you
find 30 different answers and every
answer would have
saying no that's wrong so after 30
answers and after 2 hours of searching
you're back where you started and you
still don't know what the hell to do
which way is the right way luckily now
with with PHP 5 and then PHP 7 we have P
do with prepared statements we have
filters stuff like that it's much easier
than it used to be all right so to sum
it up Mike in my experience of learning
both languages if I were to compare the
compare learning them to let's say
building a piece of furniture learning
Python was like following a single
booklet of a particular set of
instructions to build something that was
fairly complicated and learning PHP was
like having 20 sets of instructions to
build something fairly easy not knowing
exactly which one to follow or having to
kind of Mickey Mouse it together using
multiple instructions but again some of
that stuff is isn't relevant today
because PHP has greatly improved in that
aspect but it still does have that I
mean it still has these problems they're
just not as bad as they used to be all
right so let's talk about frameworks and
content management so in my opinion both
languages have two incredible frameworks
PHP has laravel and symphony and python
has django and flask and you'll see some
others here as well I've used all of the
PHP ones I personally do like all of the
PHP ones but you're not really gonna see
jobs using like code ignitor or a cake
PHP anymore at least not not a lot of
them the ones that I mentioned mentioned
are really the top dogs
so laravel is just incredible I've said
it before even people that despise PHP
they they have a respect for laravel
because of the work that's been put into
it the elegance the ease of use symphony
is also great a great framework laravel
actually uses symphony components and
symphony 4 is now a micro framework to
start with so you can use it for like
micro services and back-end api's you
can also build it into a full-fledged
large scale application which is really
cool
and I've used slim slim is another micro
framework for building API restful api
x' now as far as python goes it has
django and flask which are two very
different frameworks which is good
because it depends on which type of
developer you are as to which is better
for you now django is very high level
there's a certain way to do things the
django way it reminds me a lot of Ruby
on Rails some some people agree with
that some think it's crazy it's just my
personal opinion similar to Python
itself it Maps things out for you which
is good for the learning curve because
it allows you to not make too many
mistakes not to mention it's extremely
powerful when it comes to web
applications there's not much you can't
do with Django setting up an admin area
and in a couple commands there's you
know migrations there's there's a lot to
the framework it's really elegant and
it's really easy to use and then flask
on the other hand is also a great
framework but it gives you much more
freedom it's much more low-level and it
doesn't give you enough to actually hang
yourself with but you can you can you
have the freedom to structure your files
how you want you can put everything into
one single file if you want and it's
also really powerful so I would I would
suggest either one they're both great I
do have a series on flask if you're
interested as well
now both languages have great package
managers python has pip and PHP has
composer setting those up on different
platforms has become pretty easy there
was a time when setting up Python with
pip on Windows was really difficult but
now with Python 3 pip just comes
installed with it and there's no need to
install it separately also setting up
the virtual environment that Python
recommends is pretty easy as well on all
platforms alright so when it comes to
content management there's really no
comparison PHP just wins hands down
against any language WordPress is still
very popular and it allows you to
quickly build sites and
applications where clients can log-in
and they can update and create content
this is very valuable for freelancers
and it's actually where I got my start
from WordPress Joomla Drupal
although Joomla and Drupal have really
fell off quite a bit but WordPress
actually has a huge percentage of the
websites on the web now I don't know the
exact number but it is significant
alright so when it comes to deployment
PHP is simple and cheap you can use a $5
per month shared hosting account if you
want now with that being said that
doesn't mean that that's what you should
do
shared hosting isn't the best choice
unless it's a small application and you
don't expect a ton of traffic from it if
it's a large-scale app that you put your
all into and you want it to succeed and
perform really well then no matter what
language you use you're gonna put some
work and some research into deployment
and hosting so for Python you have a few
options I would suggest using cloud
hosting like digitalocean they actually
have pre pre-built droplets where you
can already have Python in the virtual
environment installed you can choose to
have Jango all set up if you want
there's also you know services like
Heroku or AWS you know you don't have as
much freedom with those services but
it's a bit easier to deploy especially
Heroku and deployment can be tricky for
any technology but the fact is with PHP
you can pretty much throw throw it up
anywhere whether it's vanilla PHP or
WordPress or something like that you can
pretty much host it anywhere which is a
nice nice advantage all right so let's
wrap this up my bottom line and advice
is to one find what you want to do look
look at job stats figure out what you're
passionate about do you want to build
web apps or are you interested in data
science AI etc anything but web apps
Python is probably the clear choice over
PHP but if it is web development that
you're interested in run through some
tutorials documentation take a period of
time to see
what you like and don't like about each
language that's one thing that I didn't
really talk about is enjoyment
maybe PHP has a few more jobs but if you
hate writing it then you should probably
look into Python or something else of
course I mean these aren't the only two
languages the only two choices
I prefer nodejs over both but that's not
part of this video
I'd suggest reading and watching other
videos like this so that you can have
more than one perspective I'm just one
dude and I can only give you so much
information I only have so much
experience so you know don't take all of
your advice from one source even if that
source is as awesome as I am I'd also
suggest with building something of your
own in both technologies it doesn't have
to be vanilla maybe build a small django
app or a small laravel app all of this
stuff you know may take a month or so
but that month is really worth deciding
your fate and deciding what technology
what language you want to focus on for
the majority of your career and you know
finally pick one and run with it until
you're making six figures a year all
right so that's gonna be it guys
hopefully you found this useful and I
didn't piss too many PHP and Python
developers off remember this is just one
point of view take everything with a
grain of salt and that goes for any
comparison type video that I do
