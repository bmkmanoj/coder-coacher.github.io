we took care of our main blog role here
with all of our posts we also added the
ability to have featured images now what
I want to do is show you how to format
the single page okay if we visit a
single page it's still using that
index.php file so in order to change
that we're going to go to our theme
folder and create a new file and call it
single dot PHP now if we go back to our
single page and reload it goes
completely blank because it's now using
this over the index file so let's copy
what we have in our index file and paste
it in single and if we reload we get the
same exact thing all right now first
thing that I want to do starting from
the top is we don't want this link
anymore because this is the final
destination this is the single post so
let's go to where we have that link
which is right here and just remove it
okay so now we'll just have the title
okay save it reload and there's no more
link if we go to the home page or the
blog post page those who still have
links but the single page doesn't all
right now the metadata that's good the
image is good this however isn't because
it's not showing us all the content so
what we can do is change the excerpt to
the content save that and reload and now
we have the entire content another thing
we're going to want is comment
functionality so to add that let's go
right under the content and we'll put a
line break so let's put a HR and what we
can do here is a PHP comments underscore
template okay if we go back and reload
now we have a comment form okay we'll
say great post
post comment and there we go the
functionality is perfect now it doesn't
look that great but we can actually
change that alright so I want to go to
the documentation real quick I would say
WordPress custom comments think is this
it yeah ok so what we can do is we can
have a custom comments page so in our
theme folder our yeah in our theme
folder we'll create a file and we'll
call it comments dot PHP I'm just going
to write the word test and then save and
if we go back to our page here and
reload you can see that it's been
replaced with test because it's now
looking at this file so let's go back to
that documentation page and I'm going to
grab first of all let's create a div
give it a class of comments all right
and then we'll put an H to say comment
and then I'm going to grab this this is
just an array of arguments and paste
that in and you can change some of these
two to customize your comment section
but I'm just going to keep yeah I'm just
going to keep them except I'm going to
change the avatar sighs to look I'm
going to change the avatar size to 80
all right and then what we need to do is
use this WP list comments so let's paste
that in and then we're just passing in
we don't want that we want to pass in
the args that we have above all right
and then we also want a second parameter
of comments okay so that takes care of
the comments now for the forum we need
to do something different so
if we go over here and I think if we go
down to the bottom we have this comment
form ok we'll click that and then this
is going to be the same idea let's see
yeah I'm going to grab this copy that
and let's paste that in ok so again we
just have some arguments for the form
and then we're calling the comment form
so those two main functions we're
calling WP list comments and comment
form and then you just have a bunch of
arguments that you can use we can change
the label of a button the text for the
reply things like that all right so
let's save that and go back to our post
and reload what's this oh I didn't end
the PHP okay so now this pretty much is
the same thing it's just formatted a
little differently so now what I want to
do is style this so we're going to open
up our style dot CSS and let's go down
to the bottom
and we'll take our comments class and
let's say border 1 pixel gray solid
padding 10 pixels margin bottom 20
margin top 10 okay now for the heading
let's do that we get comments h3 and
let's also do h2 okay give it a
background of light gray color will be
dark gray and padding 5 pixels alright
so let's do the body we'll give it a
border
let's give it margin bottom padding
we'll do 20 on the top and bottom 10 on
the sides alright and then they'll do
the metadata background let's see
let's do like gray actually not let's do
this blue color which is this put that
there and let's also do it here which I
had a dollar sign there anyway that's
wrong okay also comment meta we want the
color to be white padding will say ten
and say overflow:auto okay and then we
need the avatar which we can stay
comment meta image and let's float that
to the left and give it a margin right
of 10 pixels okay now for the reply link
I'll give it a background of that blue
color let's say display will display it
as an inline block and add padding of 10
and 15 okay last thing is going to be
the form comment form input and also the
text area
we're going to set the width to a
hundred percent
we'll set padding to four pixels we'll
set the border and we'll set margin
bottom to 15 all right so a lot of
styling let's go ahead and reload and
now down here this is what our comment
form looks like this should actually be
white though so that is comment meta
where we have color white but we need to
link to be white there we go okay so
we'll say hello world send and there we
go let's change the color of the heading
to white though okay so now we have our
single post page with comments now let's
take a look at one of these pages in the
menu sample page and you can see that we
have this metadata for our page we also
just have an excerpt reason for that is
now the pages are also looking at
index.php and we don't want that so what
we can do is create another file in our
theme and we're going to call it page
PHP if we go back to the sample page and
reload it's going to be blank ok so what
we're going to do is we're going to take
let's see
we'll take index.php
we'll grab everything and paste that in
page PHP and then that's going to give
us the same thing we just had but we
want to change some things up ok so one
we don't want the title I'm sorry we
want the title we don't want the link in
the title okay we don't want the meta at
all so we're going to get rid of that
whole paragraph we're going to get rid
of the featured image and then the
excerpt will change to the content all
right and it'll change this to no page
found all right so if we go and look at
that now we just have a simple page with
a title and some content okay if we go
to one of our boat pages same thing so
that's what we want there so in the next
video we're going to start to work on
this sidebar we want to be able to have
a sidebar widget or widgets so I'll show
you how to do that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
