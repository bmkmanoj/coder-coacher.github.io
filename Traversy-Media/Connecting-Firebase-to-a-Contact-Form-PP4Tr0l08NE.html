ago or I don't know maybe was yesterday
I created a video called creating a
mobile first responsive contact form
featuring grid CSS and we created the UI
we created a pretty nice responsive form
and I told you that we'd be implementing
a back end in another video so most of
the feedback that I got from you guys
were was to use firebase which is a
cloud a cloud service for for a database
for authentication it's very very
powerful
it's by Google and I think it's a good
solution for our forms so what we're
going to do is we're going to hook up
that project to firebase using nothing
but vanilla JavaScript we're not going
to use any frameworks we're not going to
use jQuery I want to do everything and
just strictly JavaScript and the
firebase library of course so first
thing you'll need to do is actually
create a firebase account it's
absolutely free just go to firebase
google.com once you do that you can go
to your console and you'll have a list
of your projects ok so obviously if you
just signed up you won't have any you
can see I have my client panel projects
this is part of the angular 4 front to
back series but we're going to go ahead
and create a new project here and I'm
just going to call this contact form
alright so we'll go ahead and create
that
like I said firebase is very powerful
it's not just a database it also has
authentication it has file storage you
can upload files you can see all the
different options over here you have
testing you have all kinds of stuff
notifications now that we have this
project loaded if we click on add
firebase to your web app it'll give us
all the initialization data and give us
the script to include all right but
we're not going to need this just yet so
let's go ahead and close this and then
what I have here is the project that we
left off with so if I open this up real
quick
this is what we built okay so it's like
I said it's a mobile first responsive
form you know looks like this on the
suave Isis and then as it grows it
changes a little bit so we're going to
take this and we're going to link
firebase to it all right now the link is
in the description it's traversing
media.com slash download slash
responsive form that's going to be the
default that's what we left off with all
right so that's what I have here now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
just copy those two files the HTML the
CSS and I'm going to create a new folder
here and I'm going to call this firebase
contact all right and we're just going
to paste those files in alright and then
we're just going to open this up in
Visual Studio code so to my projects
firebase contact
okay now I'm also using I'm using a
plug-in called dev server so if you want
that just go down to your extension icon
here and just search for I'm sorry live
server just for its search for live
server and install that if you want it
alright and we're going to go ahead and
just right click and say open with live
server and that should open up on port
5500 or not why isn't that open and
usually it alright so here's here's the
form we built let's let's actually put
it into mobile view you can make this
bigger as well alright so what I'm going
to do is a we implemented animate CSS so
that when it reloads this table you know
it slides in I'm going to remove that
just because every time it reloads I
don't want it to do that so I'm just
going to get rid of these two classes
animated and bouncing left off the
wrapper all right that way that doesn't
happen every time this reloads so let's
let's think about what we're going to do
here so we have to we have to catch our
submit ok now we're not actually
submitting to a page like we would with
like PHP or something like that we are
going to be using JavaScript so we're
going to need an event listener that
listens for our submission or
going to have to add some IDs to our
field so that we can grab the the data
that's put into the fields of the values
of those inputs and then we need to
connect the firebase and we need to push
on to a collection in firebase okay
that's the gist of what we're doing and
for validation we're just going to use
standard html5 validation will just add
required to my guess to the name and the
email is really all that I want to be
required all right so let's start off
here by adding a couple IDs so we're
going to we're going to need an ID on
our form so let's give that the ID of
just contact form and then each input is
also going to need an ID so this will be
name this will be look this will be
company this will be email phone and
message all right so now we have our IDs
we also want to add a type to this
button right here just to make sure that
it's a submit button so we're going to
say type equals submit
okay now I'm not going to implement the
the validation just yet in fact for now
I'm going to change the email address to
a text just because I don't want errors
flying up I just want to be able to
submit you know just junk at first just
to test things out so what I'll do just
so I don't forget is just put it to do
right here and we'll say validation all
right so let's go ahead and save that
now that we have our IDs let's go ahead
and create a javascript file to work
with so we're going to create a new file
I'm going to call it main dot J s and
then we want to link it so we're going
we're going to go down right above the
ending body tag and put in a script and
a source to main dot J s all right now
we're going to need to link our firebase
but I'm going to just hold off on that I
just want to take care of being able to
submit the form and get the value
okay then we'll get to firebase so let's
go to our main J s and in here we're
going to want to create an event
listener
okay so we'll say listen for forum
submit okay now to do that we're going
to need to grab the forum remember we
gave it an ID of contact form so we'll
say document dot get element by D and
add an ID of contact form right and then
we want to add an event listener so
we're going to say add event listener we
want to listen for a submit event and
then we want a function okay and I'm
going to call it the function submit
will just say submit form alright so now
we're going to have to create that
function let me just just toggle
wordwrap here I'll make this a little
bigger alright so now we need to do is
create a function called submit form all
right and that's going to take in an
event and what we want to do is we want
to prevent the default behavior because
when we submit it's going to
automatically try to submit to that HTML
page so we're just going to take that
event parameter we're going to call
prevent default okay and then let's just
do a console log and we'll just say one
two three all right so let's go over
here and let's hit f12 and let's just
submit and you can see we get one two
three all right so we know the form is
submitting now we want to get all of the
input values so that we can use them and
we can ultimately send them to firebase
so to do that we're going to use
document dot get element by D but I'm
going to create just a function to make
it a little shorter so that we don't
have to keep typing out document dot get
element ID so we're going to put a
comment here we'll say function two to
get
form values and we'll say function so
function get input valve we'll call it
all right and then this is going to take
in an ID all right and then all we're
going to do here is return document dot
get element by D and then whatever that
ID is that's passed in okay that
actually you know what we want to add on
dot value because that's how you can get
the form the input value if we just do
get element by ID it will give us the
actual you know the whole input tag and
everything we just want the value that's
put in so now let's go up here
and let's say we want to get all the
values so get values and we should now
be able to create variables we'll say
name equals and then we'll use that get
input valve function and in here we'll
pass in name okay because that input
we're looking for has an ID of name so
basically we want to do this with all of
our fields so we'll copy that we have
name company email phone and message all
right we just need to change this stuff
up so it's a company email phone and
message we also need to change these
company own and message all right so
let's make sure that we can actually
that this actually works so let's just
do a console log and we'll go ahead and
we'll get the name save that and if we
go over here and we type in Brad for the
name and we submit you can see down here
we're getting Brad so we're now able to
get all of our for all of our input
values all right now this is where we
want to start to implement firebase now
that we get we can get the actual values
we need to send them to firebase so
let's open up let's go back to
- I guess I closed it I want to go back
to my firebase and we'll go to our
project which is contact form and we're
going to want to get all the
initialization data so let's click here
and this script tag I'm going to grab
just that and we're going to go and
we're going to put that in our
index.html right above the main j/s okay
make sure it's above the main jets the
order really matters it's not going to
work if you put it below okay so now we
did that we want to just grab this right
here okay everything that's in the
script tags so the initialize firebase
yours you're going to have different
stuff here okay all your all your API
keys and everything is all going to be
different and we're going to put this
right at the top of this file okay a
very top so this will initialize
firebase for us now what we need to do
is we need to reference a collection so
in a no SQL database like firebase we
have collections which are kind of like
tables if you're familiar with you know
relational databases and we're going to
have a collection called messages we
don't actually have to go and create it
we connect with that it'll be created on
the fly so what we're going to do is
we're going to let's say reference the
messages collection so we're going to
create a variable here called messages
ref and we're going to set that to
firebase dot database okay and this is
how you initialize any firebase database
but if you want a specific reference or
a specific collection you just do dot
ref and then pass in whatever the
collection so messages all right so now
that we have that what we're going to do
is we're going to create a function so
let's go to the very bottom we're going
to create a function to save the message
to firebase to messages so let's say
function we'll call it save message
and then it's going to take in all the
different fields so it's going to take a
name company email phone and message
alright and then to do this what we want
to do is create a variable here called
new message rep okay we're going to set
that to messages ref okay now this
message is ref is coming from here so
what we just created the reference to
our collection and we're just going to
push on to it so we're going to say dot
push okay so I'm going to say dot push
will end that with a semicolon and then
we want to take our new messages ref or
new message ref and we just want to call
dot set okay and then inside here we can
put in an object with all of our data so
let's say name we want that to go to
name and we're talking about these
values here which are coming from the
input form we want company we want email
phone and message all right so what
we're doing is just sending an object of
data to our messages collection or our
messages reference in firebase so now
that we created that function we
actually want to call it when our form
gets submitted okay let me just put a
comment here we'll say submit form okay
so after we get all of our data here we
want to call save message and we want to
pass in all that data so company email
phone and message so just put a comment
here say save message
all right and then what do we want to do
after that so we're probably going to
want some way to tell the user that it's
been sent that their message has been
stored or sent but let's go ahead and
just test this out first before we get
to that so let's save this and let's go
back to our project I'm going to keep
this firebase open as well this browser
but let's go to our project here and
let's go ahead and just try to send
something so I'm just going to put just
a bunch of crap in here it doesn't
matter and then we'll click Submit now
we're going to get an error if we look
at what this says it says permission
denied okay now by default with firebase
you can't you can't enter data into a
database unless you're authenticated by
default so we're not using any
authentication to send this contact form
we want anybody to be able to do it so
we need to just do one simple step in
our firebase console so we need to go to
database right and we need to go to
rules and you see how we have this rules
object we have read and write set to OFF
is not equal to null we just want to
change both of these to true okay are at
least at least the right because that's
really all we're doing if you wanted to
create a script or you know an
application where they could actually
read the messages in fact maybe we'll do
that in another video you would need to
be authenticated or you need to set read
to true but let's just set right to true
okay and then we're going to go ahead
and publish all right and then let's go
back over here and let's just reload
this or refresh this and we'll go ahead
and just put some crap in here and
submit and notice we didn't get that
error nothing else happened because we
didn't create we didn't write any code
for anything else to happen but now
let's go over to database and you'll see
we have a messages collection inside
there we have an ID this is an
auto-generated
prints ID that firebase creates and
there's all of our info alright so we've
we've successfully made a submission to
firebase so from here you can manage
your your messages we can delete that if
we want and what's really cool is that
you can you you can just have this open
and let's actually submit a real name
we'll just we'll put in my info usually
this auto so this auto fills oh well
I'll just type in so we'll just say
traversing media and email just a test
at test comm phone number I'll just put
that message helloworld all right so
let's submit and you'll see right here
it automatically shows this is in real
time you don't even have to refresh so
you can see that we have all of our data
so it's as easy as that to hook up
firebase to a contact form now let's
finish it up by adding we want to add an
alert or a message showing the user that
that their data was sent so let's go
ahead and do that so after the save
message we'll continue on here and let's
say show alert now what I'm going to do
is go to our index.html and we're going
to go let's see let's go right below the
h3 the email us h3 and let's see we're
going to add a div with the class of
alert all right and then in here we're
going to say your message has been sent
save that and now it's going to always
display and I'm going to fix that in a
minute but let's style it up a little
bit so we'll open up our style dot CSS
let's go down to down to the bottom
right above the media query and we're
going to add a class for alerts didn't
mean to do that and let's do a
text-align:center and let's add some
padding we'll say 10 pixels we're going
to add a
background of a green hexadecimal so
that's going to be 7 9 C so 7 9 c8 7 9
and look we're also going to add color
white and let's add margin bottom 10
pixels and let's actually first of all
let's check it out okay so it looks like
that now I don't want it to be like
should I guess that's okay yeah that's
fine I wasn't going to Center it on
large devices but that looks fine now we
wanted to set this display to none
because obviously we don't want this to
be displayed when the user comes to the
forum we're going to do that through
JavaScript so let's go back to our main
J s and where we have our show alert
what we want to do is we want to grab it
so we're going to say document dot we're
going to use the query selector function
and what that's going to do is it's
going to it works just like jQuery
basically we can select by class or
element we're going to say we want by
the class of alert and then what we want
to do is we want to say dot style dot
display because that's the display
property we want to edit and we want to
set it to block okay because it's
initially set to to none as we just did
in the CSS now this will do just fine
but if you want it to go away then we
need to add some more code here so let's
say hide alert after three seconds okay
so what we want to do for that is use
set timeout saying so we'll say set
timeout and that's going to take in a
function and then here is what we want
to happen and then this parameter down
here we're going to put a comma I'm
going to say 3000 and that's going to be
3,000 milliseconds which is three
seconds so what we want to happen in
three seconds is we want to let's grab
this get this in here and we want to set
it back to none we want to
the display property back to none so
it'll go away
all right so let's save and then the
last thing I want to do is I want to go
back to our HTML and let's let's take
care of our validation so we'll get rid
of that and what we'll do is to the name
input we're just going to say required
to the email we're going to say required
and we're also going to set the type
back to email so now if we go over and
we let's make sure this is refreshed and
we'll enter some stuff so let's say John
Doe company will say 1 2 3 design email
we'll say test at test com phone number
just put all fours I don't off doesn't
matter message we'll say hello and
submit we get your message has been sent
three seconds it's there it goes
disappears and let's check firebase and
there it is one two three design John
Doe hello there's phone number and email
so one last thing you may want to do is
clear out these form inputs ok this data
after the submission so we'll just go
right here will say document dot get
element by ID and let's grab a contact
form and we're just going to say dot
reset what's like that and I'll put a
comment here we'll just say clear form
all right so let's try it one more time
name will say Steve Smith company to say
some company email address
let's do test phone number hi and submit
your message has been sent everything
it's been cleared and let's just check
on firebase one second
and check firebase and there is Steve
Smith now one last thing we'll do is
we'll actually deploy this so it should
we should be able to just upload it to a
server so I'm going to upload it to my
Traverse see Mediacom which is just just
host it's a cpanel hosting by in motion
so what I'll do is open up my FTP I
actually have it right here and I'm
going to go to the root of my traverse
see mediacom and we'll create a folder
here or create a directory I'll just
call it I'll just call it test I'm going
to delete it right after and then let's
take see let's see so projects firebase
contact I'm just going to grab the three
files bring them over here and let's go
and visit traversing media.com slash
test there's our forum let's try it out
we'll just say Harry company test email
phone number doesn't really matter and
submit okay message has been sent
let's go ahead and check firebase and
there it is Harry so we now have a
deployed contact form with a firebase
back-end it's as easy as that alright
