be building a complete login and
registration system for nodejs alright
so we'll use node and we're going to use
some other technologies as well first
thing you want to do is obviously get
node installed go to node.js or can just
download and go through the installer
it's really easy I do have a video on
how to install node in both Windows and
Linux if you want to check that out you
also want to get MongoDB installed
alright so MongoDB org slash downloads
and you can see it's available for
Windows Linux and Mac I'm on a Windows
system but I already have it installed
so I'm not going to go through this but
like I said I do have videos on
installing MongoDB for authentication
we're going to be using passport which
is a node.js module and it's very very
flexible you can use it with all
different types of ORM s will be using
mongoose and it's pretty easy to
integrate so we'll be using that so
first thing we're going to do here is
create a project folder alright so i'm
going to go into my projects folder and
then create a new folder called login
app alright and then from there we're
going to open up a command line now i'm
using a tool called git bash if you want
to use this you can go to I think it's
get - SCM comm all right you can just
download install that or you can just
use a standard Windows command line or
your Mac or Linux terminal ok so to make
this a little bigger first thing we need
to do is generate a package.json folder
so to do that we can say npm in it it's
just going to ask us some questions for
a description will just say simple
authentication system entry point I'm
going to say app dot J s and feel free
to put your own name
alright so that's good now I'm going to
bring that folder into sublime of course
you can use whatever text editor you'd
like okay let's open up that package
JSON file and what we're going to have
to include a bunch of different
dependencies so I'm going to grab that
and just paste it in okay so this is
what we'll be working with bcrypt
J s we're going to be using four
password hashing now you could use just
the standard bcrypt but I always have an
issue with that because there's so many
dependencies for instance you need a
certain version of Visual Studio and
then a bunch of other node modules so
bcrypt J ass gives us pretty much the
same functionality except it's all in
JavaScript and if there's no strange
dependencies or anything all right
body parsers so we can power stuff Jason
and stuff like that
connect flash is going to be used for
flash messages cookie parser Express
okay we're using Express and then we're
also using express handlebars for our
view engine all right you can use Jade
if you'd like but I don't I don't really
like Jade I'd rather work with just
regular HTML Express messages in Express
session these are both going to be used
for flash messaging Express validator to
validate forms MongoDB Mongoose is going
to be used as our ORM to interact with
the database and then we have a couple
passport modules
okay we've passport passport HTTP and
then passport local alright we're just
going to use a local database but there
are passport modules for things like
Facebook and Twitter login things like
that alright so these are our
dependencies let's go ahead and save
this and then we'll go back to
the command line and we're going to run
npm install okay and that should get
everything set up for us all right so
that's all set now what we're going to
do is create our App KS file okay and we
have a bunch of stuff that we need to
include or require so I'm going to paste
that in now from the top we're including
Express okay then we have the path
module cookie posture and body posture
like the express handlebars template
engine Express validator flash session
then we're including passport here and
then since we're using passport local
we're going to create a local strategy
and I'll give you more on that later
this should actually be a period not a
comma and then Mongo and Mongoose and
then right here we're going to connect
to our database so Mongoose doc connect
and I'm just going to call it login app
all right and we can create that you
don't need to the application will do it
but I will show you how to create that
using the Mongo shell alright and then
we're just creating a DB variable that
we're setting to the Mongoose connection
alright so let's open up the Mongo shell
and go to my command line windows
command line as administrator all right
now my MongoDB installs right in my C
Drive yours might be somewhere else but
what you want to do is go into that and
then into the bin folder all right from
there we can run Mongo
so if we say show DBS that'll show us
all the DBS and you'll notice I do have
a log in app database there but I'm
going to delete that now all right so to
delete that I'm going to just going to
say use log in app and then DB dot drop
database alright and then if we go back
and do show DB's you can see it's gone
so I'm going to create a fresh one we're
going to say use
login app okay and then what we can do
is create our collections
so we'll say DB dot create collection
now like I said you don't have to do
this the application will do it for you
but I figured I'll just show you how to
do it alright so we're going to have one
collection for users okay and then if we
say show collections we have users all
right so that's all I need to do so next
thing I'm going to do in our app j/s
file we need to include the routes all
right are the files we're going to use
for our routes so we're going to do that
we're going to create a folder called
routes with index and users alright next
thing let's initialize the app will save
our app equals Express alright and then
we'll set up our view engine okay I'm
just going to paste this in this first
line here we're just telling the system
we want it we want a folder called views
to handle our views this one here we're
going to set handlebars as the app
engine and we're also saying the default
layout file we want to be called layout
so it'll be called layout handlebars
alright and then this one here was
saying app dot set the view engine to
handlebars
alright so that's that next thing will
be the body posture and cookie posture
middleware alright middleware is kind of
just just set up code really kind of
like configurations we don't really have
to worry about it too much just know
that there's certain models models
modules have certain middleware all
right now this next line here we're
going to set our public folder all right
so the folder is going to be called
public and that's where we'll put things
like style sheets and images jQuery and
stuff like that all right stuff that's
publicly accessible to the to the
browser
okay next line is the middleware for
express session okay so you just want to
throw that in the secret can be whatever
you'd like I'm just going to keep it as
secret all right
next thing is the middleware for the
validator
and this is taken right from the github
page alright so if you want to see
Express validator okay so I got this
code from right here
okay middleware options it's the same
exact thing I didn't change anything all
right now we need the connect flash
middleware okay which is just one line
all we're going to do is say app dot use
flash okay just like that and then we
want to set some global variables for
our flash messages all right so I'm
going to paste this in and you'll see
that when we you want to so you want to
create a global variable or a global
function you want to use res dot locals
okay and then whatever you want for in
this case it's success message and we're
setting that to request dot flash
success message all right this one here
is for any error of error messages we
have and then this here the reason we
have this is because passport sets its
own flash messages and it sets it to
error so that's why we have this in
addition to this one all right so that's
pretty much it now we do have to just
add submit away for our route files okay
so we just have the slash is going to be
mapped to routes which up here you can
see goes to the index file alright and
then we have the the users as well and
then the last thing we want to do here
is just set the port and then start the
server alright so we're going to set the
port here with app dot set we're setting
it to process in the port or 3,000 which
is what we'll be using and then down
here we're just going to call app dot
listen and pass in the port number and
then we'll just console
log telling telling the user that the
server has been started all right so
that is our entire app J s file we
shouldn't have to touch it after this
actually one more thing that I did
forget is the passport initialization
all right so I'm going to put this right
below the session all right so that's
important to be able to use passport you
want to call initialize and also session
so let's save that and what we can do
now is create the rest of our folders
and files so we're going to create a
folder called routes all right and then
that's going to hold whoops that's going
to hold two files one is going to be
called index dot JSP is okay and then
inside there for now I'm just going to
paste in something really pretty much
just the bare-bones to be able to run
the application all right so we're
including Express we're setting up our
Express router and here we're setting a
get request route for slash which is
just the home page and all we're doing
is rendering a view called index all
right so let's save that and I'm going
to put the same thing in users except
we're not going to have the slash we're
going to have a register route and that
will render a view called register okay
and then we'll also have a login route
and that will render a template or view
called login save that alright so next
folder we need to create is our view
folder and that's going to be called
views and inside there we're going to
have a folder called layouts and that's
going to hold our main layout file which
is going to be called layout dot
handlebars oops I didn't want to do that
all right and for now we'll just say
main layout alright so we'll have
another view another file and we're
going to call it index dot handlebars
and that'll basically just be like the
dashboard alright then we'll have
another one called register handlebars
and we'll have one called login dot
handlebars alright and we'll just for
now just say login this will be index
and this would be register all right and
then we want to create a folder in the
root called public all right and then
inside there we're going to create a
folder called CSS and also a folder
called j/s and in CSS we're going to
have a file called style dot CSS all
right I just want to get all this stuff
created before we before we move on all
right and then let's create a folder
called models and we're just going to
have one model that's going to be saved
as user dot J s okay so I think we're
ready to test it out and see if it'll
run so let's go to our command line and
we're going to say node app ok and you
can see server started on port 3000 so
now
let's go to localhost 3000 and you can
see we have our main layout loading
which is exactly what we want so let's
go to that main layout that's going to
be in views layouts and then lay out dot
handlebars and I'm going to set this to
be an HTML file and we're just going to
put in our base tags here okay HTML tags
head and body in the title we'll just
say log in app and then in the body
wherever you want to load your views you
want to include with express handlebars
you want these three curly braces on
each side and then just say body all
right so now if we save that and reload
it's showing us the index view okay if
we go to slash users slash login it
shows us the login view and then we can
also go to register okay so we know that
that's working now what I want to do is
start to work on the layout a little bit
and we're going to be using bootstrap so
let's go to get bootstrap calm and
download it alright we're going to open
that zip file up and we want the CSS
file so I'm also going to open up our
projects folder
okay so I want to go to C Drive projects
login app alright and we're going to go
to public CSS and then bring over
bootstrap CSS
alright I'm also going to bring over the
bootstrap j/s file alright and then we
can also bring over the fonts folder
into our public folder okay so now we
have that setup now what we'll do is go
to our layout file and we're going to
include our CSS okay so this will be rel
stylesheet and href this is going to go
to /stylesheet /name
put this this one to style.css
alright so now if we go back and reload
what in that work style sheets bootstrap
CSS let's restart the application
okay so it's not getting the Oh oh I
called it CSS not stylesheets yeah this
should be CSS all right so now if we go
back the text should change the font
there we go so now we know bootstraps
included so what I want to do is go back
to get bootstrap and we're going to look
at the examples and we're going to grab
this narrow Jumbotron theme okay if we
do a control u we can see the source
code and first thing we're going to do
is click on this jumbo draw a narrow CSS
file and then we're going to grab all of
that and bring that over to our style
dot CSS paste that in okay so that's
that now what we'll do is we're going to
copy the div the container div all the
way down to the ending container div and
copy and I'm just going to overwrite
this just for now paste that in save and
now let's go back and reload and now we
have all the sample content all right
now when you edit a handlebars file you
don't have to restart the server but if
you're going to edit any of the
JavaScript the route files anything like
that then you're going to have to
restart it all right so let's fix this
up so let's start with renaming this to
login app okay now for the menu let's
get rid of this class okay home is going
to go to your slash and I'm actually
going to change this to dashboard all
right this one here will go to slash
users slash login and we'll change the
text to login this one will go to slash
users slash register and we'll change
that and then we want to log out link as
well so let's copy that
and this will go to users slash logout
all right so that's the menu now down
here we don't need the jumbotron and get
rid of that and then for this let's get
rid of the marketing class here and have
it be just ro and then we're going to
change this to a twelve column div and
let's get rid of this whole six column
div alright and then what we'll do here
let's get rid of everything in that div
and then this is where we want to put
our body all right down here we'll just
change company to login app and save
okay so now you can see we're on the
index if I click login takes us to the
login view and register alright so let's
go to the dashboard index first so we
want to go to views and then index dot
handlebars so this is going to be very
simple it's just going to be a heading
and the paragraph okay that's our
dashboard now I want to get rid of this
spacing right here
so what we'll do is go to style and go
down to the bottom and we're going to
say dot page header set margin top to
zero all right so that moves that up
let's also move the footer down alright
so we have a tag a footer tag so we'll
just say footer and margin top we'll say
40 pixels alright good so now let's
create the login form so we'll go to
views and then login dot handlebars and
I'm going to paste this in okay so it's
very simple we have a heading we have
form that's going to go to slash user
slash login we have a form group that
has a user name label and then an input
for the username and then same thing
with the password and then we have a
submit button all right so let's save
that okay there's our login form now
let's create the register form okay
we're going to paste this in okay same
idea is the login form except it's going
to users register it has a name field a
username an email a password and then a
confirm password alright make sure you
have the name attributes in here as well
so we'll save that and there's our
register form alright guys so what we're
going to do we're going to stop the
video here and then we'll continue on in
the next part where we will work on the
registration and submitting a user all
right so I'll see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
