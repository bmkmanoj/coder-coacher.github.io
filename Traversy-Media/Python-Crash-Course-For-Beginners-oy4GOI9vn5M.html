course for absolute beginners if you've
never learned Python or you know a
little bit but you want to learn more
then you're definitely in the right
place ok this isn't a video where we're
going to use something like Django or
any other framework to create to create
a web application this is strictly on
the Python programming language at its
core I do plan on making project based
videos in Django and flash later on but
I would suggest that you learn all the
basics of the language first before
attempting that ok now if you're still
learning JavaScript or PHP or another
language that's absolutely fine you can
still benefit from this crash course
because we're only working with the
basics which include things like
variables datatypes conditionals loops
functions and so on and you can kind of
compare it to the other languages that
you're learning ok well we're going to
leave most of the advanced stuff for
another video later on now as far as our
environment we're going to be using
Eclipse which is a very powerful IDE
we're also going to be we're going to
need the pydev extension which will give
us a Python interpreter and we can run
the Python code right there in the IDE
we don't need a browser we don't need a
terminal or anything like that so I'm
going to show you exactly how to get
that set up I'm on Windows but it's
pretty much the same on Mac just
download eclipse download Python or if
you're on Linux of course you can use
your package managers or however you
want to get its setup but this crash
course is completely cross-platform all
right so before we download we click get
into Eclipse let's go ahead and grab
Python so this is Python org slash
downloads and I'm going to download
Python 3 6 1 which is the latest version
at this time ok I actually already have
it downloaded so I'm not going to save
it here
same thing with Eclipse I've already
downloaded it but what you want to do is
go to eclipse.org slash downloads and
just go ahead and download it here we're
going to get Eclipse neon alright and
then just click that and it should save
to your disk ok so I'm going to first
open up the Python install
so downloads and let's open that up so
notice the the location that it's
installing app data or user Brad or
whatever your user name is app data
local programs Python and then python
36:32 okay just take note of that
because you're going to need that when
we set up pydev all right and then down
here I'm also going to click to add
python 3.6 to the path and then we'll
just go ahead and click go i'll set up
and yeah while you're at it just go
ahead and download eclipse if you didn't
do that already okay and that should be
it we now have Python installed so now
I'm going to open up the Eclipse
installer ok so I'm going to just close
that out now Eclipse has a lot of
different environments that you can
create for instance for Java developers
Java EE developers C and C++ developers
PHP what we want is this right here
JavaScript and web developers we're
going to use that and then we'll add
pydev to it so the installation folder
that's fine click install we have to
accept these agreements accept okay so
now let's go ahead and click launch and
now it's going to ask where we want our
workspace I'm going to keep it in that
location I'm just going to change it to
Python workspace and we'll click OK
alright so now we're going to get a
screen like this which is basically just
a welcome screen now we don't have pydev
setup yet and we need to so to do that
we'll go to help and then go to install
new software and let's see in here we're
going to type HTTP and this is going to
be from pydev dot org slash updates
and then we'll click add and in here
let's just say Python three are
exercising it doesn't really matter what
we put there but I'm going to click on
pydev I'm going to check that box and
then we'll click Next and we want to
pydev for eclipse click Next we want to
accept this agreement click finish and
that's fine we'll click OK and then we
want to just trust these certificates
the pydev and click OK alright so now
it's going to ask to restart we'll say
yes
restart eclipse not the system alright
and now what we want to do is go to
window and then let's see yeah window
preferences and then go down to where
you see pydev and just click the little
triangle here and then we want the
interpreters and we want the python
interpreter so over here we're going to
say new and the interpreter name I'm
just going to call this Python 3 and
then we need to find the exe file that
we instead up when we installed Python
ok remember I told you to take note of
where it is in my case it's in users
Brad app data local programs Python and
then python 3632 and we just want to
grab this exe right here and just click
OK and then that should be all set so we
can just click OK and now what I'm going
to do is go to window and then
perspective and open perspective go to
other and then we're going to choose
pydev ok so now we have a Python based
environment now what I'm going to do is
create a new project so we'll go to file
new pydev project and I'm just going to
call this Python app and then for the
grammar version I'm going to choose
three-point-six interpreter Python 3 and
that's ok and then we'll click finish
okay so now we should have a new project
created let's go ahead and click over
here on that and then we have our Python
app folder that's where our project will
be so I'm just going to maximize this I
want you guys to be able to see let's
create a new file and we're going to
call this basic dot pi and then just
click OK for that and what I'm going to
do just the test things out is put in a
print and then we'll say hello world ok
now I'm going to just make this font
bigger so let's say I want to go to
preferences appearance colors and fonts
basic and text font then I'll click Edit
and I'm going to change this to let's
say 22 all right so that's better now in
order to run this all we have to do is
click this little play button up here
and we can run it okay now the first
time we run a file we're going to get
this we just want to choose Python run
click OK and now you can see it ran and
that's what we get down here so we now
have a nice little little environment
where we can write some Python code and
we can teach you some things so that's
the print function and I'll get back to
that in a second but I just want to
discuss comments real quick so I'm just
going to sit up here comments now for a
single line comment you can see I just
did one and we use the number sign okay
so say this is a single line comment and
if you want multiple lines then you can
use triple quotes so three quotes at the
beginning and three quotes at the end
and then here we'll say this is a
multi-line comment so if we go ahead and
run this you'll see we get no errors or
anything because it's looking at this as
all as comment it's not going to parse
it now you can also use triple double
quotes if you want
you can also do that okay doesn't matter
like play we still just get hello world
so it's all to you same thing when
you're using when you're setting
variables when you're working with
strings you can use single quotes like I
did here or you can use double quotes
okay and we'll just play that we just
get hello world twice so it's completely
up to you so we have single quotes and
we have double quotes and really the
only thing you have to worry about is
staying consistent stay consistent with
your quotes alright now if you have
something where you have like a you know
apostrophe s or something like that it's
not going to work if you surround that
in single quotes in that case you would
use double quotes and that's really the
only time that I currently use double
quotes but it's completely preference if
you want to follow along and and use
double quotes that's fine now there is a
situation where you may want to use
triple quotes and include them in in for
instance of print so if I want to save
print and get a big long paragraph just
put some single quotes in and paste this
in bunch of text you'll see already you
can see that this isn't right we're
getting errors in the IDE and if I run
it we're going to get an error even if I
were to put double quotes around this
and go ahead and run it we're going to
get the error but what we could do is
put triple quotes and again it could be
single or double but if we put triple
and we press play now you'll see that
it'll actually parse that text for us
all right so this is triple quotes all
right so now what I want to do is mess a
little bit and keep going with print a
little bit we can also print substrings
of a string so for instance let's say
that lets do print
hello and let's say we want to get just
the first character so for that we could
put follow this up with square brackets
and put a zero and we'll go ahead and
play that and you see we get the H okay
because it's zero base zero one two
three four if we wanted to get this L we
could do what is it zero one two and
press play and we get the L now if you
want to get more than one character you
can do a range so you can do like zero
and then colon and then two three and if
we run that it's going to give us H al
it will give us everything before three
so 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 okay so that is print
substrings let's see what else if you
want to print a number you can do that
and you don't need quotes because it's a
number okay if we were to run that we
just print out two let's see now if you
do want to print out multiple things on
one line you could do that and all you
have to do is separate them with a comma
so let's say 1 2 3 and they can be any
data type we could put a string in here
as well we'll say hello and press play
and now you see that all of those are
now on the same line it's not PHP so
let's say print on same line now if you
want to go the other way and you want
everything on a separate line what we
could do is actually that's a line 1 and
then we can put in a new line character
which is backslash n line - I don't know
why I'm using all caps but that's fine
and we'll say line 3 all right so let's
go ahead and play that and we get line 1
2 and 3 all on separate lines so see
what else if you want to print out the
raw text and not have these actually
work these special characters for
instance if we wanted to print out our
hard drive location
OC : double backslash and that will go
somewhere if we try and play you'll see
that it'll only include one backslash
because that's getting escaped with the
other one if you want this to actually
spit out the way you see it here you
could just put an R right here press
play and now you can see it has two two
backslashes and if we were to put for
instance a newline character and press
play it'll actually print that out as
it's a regular character or not not a
special one all right so that's that
I think that's pretty pretty thorough
with just printing out text and numbers
and all that so let's go ahead and just
save this file and now what I want to
talk about is variables and data types
so I'm going to create a new file here
and we're going to call this variables
dot pi okay it's for comment up here
variables and data types all right
so creating a variable is very easy
let's say we want to create a variable
called greeting and set that to hello
world and like I said I think I said it
before you might see me mess up and put
a semicolon just by habit but you don't
you don't need those in Python so please
don't give me if you if I mess up
and put a semicolon so that's how we can
create a variable very easy we don't
have to do bar or anything like that
like in JavaScript we don't need a money
sign like we do in PHP it's just simply
a word all right
so if we were to again say greeting and
set that to hello everyone and we go and
print greeting you'll see we get hello
everyone so basically if this here is
reassigning this variable okay it's not
going to append to it or anything like
that it's going to reassign all right so
let's take a look at datatypes
I'm not going to go over every single
data type because there's a lot of
subtypes and so on
wrong number all kinds of stuff so we're
going to just talk about the basic ones
the more important ones so the first
type we have is a string so let's create
a variable called my STR and we're going
to set that to string of hello
okay the data type is actually STR in
Python
same thing with integer it's int so
we'll say my int set that to 25 and an
integer can be any hole positive or
negative number if you want to use a
decimal then you're using floats that
lower case all right so if we want to
float we'll set that to let's say 1.3
what's going on sometimes those errors
hang around for a second before they go
away so that's a float now you also have
more structured types such as lists
dictionaries so let's talk about a list
so a list is basically like like a
one-dimensional array so let's set that
to a set of brackets and we can say 1 2
3 we can even put a string in here and
that's a list all right we'll get more
into that later we also have
dictionaries which are similar to hashes
in rails or associative arrays in PHP or
objects in JavaScript and that's what
you'll notice when you start to learn a
lot of languages is that they're there's
a lot of the same type of things they're
just called something different and they
might have a few things that are
different but once you understand one
you can pretty much get them also so
this would be in curly braces and
they're basically key value pairs so
we'll have a as the key one is the value
B is the key to and then C oops
C
three okay so that's a dictionary so
what I'll do now is I want to print
these out and I want to wrap them in a
function called type because that will
give us the type of the type of data
that it is so let's say my STR and then
we're also going to print the actual
value my STR so if we were to run that
you'll see that it gives us class is
string or STR that's the type and then
it just printed out so let's do that
with these as well so we'll say type my
int I'll just copy this then we'll do my
float and see my list and I dict
which sounds a little dirty all right so
let's play that and you can see we have
our int we have flow list and dictionary
now if you wanted to for instance grab
one of these out of the list we could do
that say print and we'll say my list and
let's say we want the third one we'll
play that and we get hello okay which is
this right here so it's 0 1 2 3 and then
for the dictionary let's go ahead and
print that out we'll say my dict and a
and that gives us 1 ok which is this
value right here there's a lot of other
functions we can use with lists and
dictionaries and so on but I'm not going
to go over those just now all right so
let's see if we wanted to take one of
these variables let's say the string and
then add on to it we could simply print
my strength my STR and then say world
and if we press play we get hello world
what else we could also create a
variable called greeting and we can set
it to my string and that we can still
we can concatenate space world press
play and that should always include in
print it just print out greeting and
that gives us hello world alright so
that's it for variables and data types
for now let's go ahead and save this and
we're now going to talk about
conditionals so if statements if else
also have we also have Elif which is
basically an else--if so I'm going to
create a new file here and we're going
to call this conditionals dot pi and
let's see I'm just going to put a title
up here is that right conditionals okay
so I'm going to create a variable called
X and we're going to set that to four so
first thing we'll do is a basic if so
we'll say if now what's a little tricky
here if you're used to PHP or JavaScript
or something like that then you're used
to doing this okay that's not the Python
syntax with Python we don't need the
curly braces so we can just say if X is
less than 6 and we also don't use curly
braces we use a colon and then the way
that we tell what's in the function is
by the indent so in here let's say print
and we'll just say this is true okay so
this is inside the if now if I go down
another line and say something here
that's also going to be in the function
but once I go back that's not going to
be in the I'm sorry not the function the
if statement
okay so just remember that the indent is
very important now you can do for
instance two indents if you want that'll
still work actually let's go ahead and
run it okay that works but if you were
to then on the next line go over for say
print
hi and then press play and we're going
to get an error okay you want to have
all of them on the same line okay and
then if you put it back that's just
going to be on its own it still works
but this is no longer part of this if
statement okay so hopefully that makes
sense so that's a basic if let's do
let's do in if-else let me just fix this
is that good there we go
okay so if else is also very easy we're
just going to say if X is less than 6 :
and then let's do print this is true and
then we want to do an else which should
be on the same level as the if and then
we'll say print this is false okay so if
we go ahead and run that we get this is
true twice and if we change this to
let's say 7 which is no longer less than
6 this one is saying this is false ok
this one doesn't do anything because it
doesn't have an else alright so now what
we'll talk about is Elif okay I have no
idea why it's called Elif and not else
if I really don't know but it basically
it's basically an else--if so to put a
comment here and we'll say Elif so what
I'm going to do is create a color
variable and set that to the string of
red and then we're going to do an if
will say if color is equal to red then
we're going to just print out color is
red and then we'll do an out on Elif
so al IIF color is equal to blue then
we'll print
color is blue and then finally we'll do
an else and we'll print color is not red
or blue okay very very simple logic
let's go ahead and play and we get color
is red if we change this to blue we get
color is blue if we change this to
yellow we get color is not red or blue
so very simple we can also nest if
statements so let's say if color is
equal to red and then we'll do another
TIF and we'll say if X is less than 10
so that needs a colon there too so if X
is less than 10 then we're going to just
print it'll say color is red and X is
less than 10 all right so now if we go
ahead and play that that's not going to
work because these aren't both true but
let's set this back to red and X is less
than 10 so let's go ahead and press play
and we get that printed out now this is
not a good thing to do for this
particular statement because we can fix
we can make this much shorter by using
logical operators okay so we can use and
or or so we'll say if the color is equal
to red and X is less than 10 then we'll
go ahead and print this out okay run
that and that's a much better way to do
this now if you wanted an else for just
this for instance then the nested-if
would be the way to go but if you're
doing something like this there's no
sense in doing that when you can just do
this alright so that is conditionals and
if statements and I apologize if I'm
moving kind of fast
I just want to get as much as I can in
as short amount as I can so let's go
ahead and close those and now we're
going to look at our loops so it's a new
file looped I just put a comment up here
so we're first going to look at a for
loop to iterate through a list so let's
create a list called people just going
to be a bunch of strings will say John
Sarah Tim and Bob okay so we have this
this list of people and let's do a for
loop so we'll say for person in people
okay so basically this is going to be
the singular version of this so in this
loop we just want to do a print and
we'll just say current person and then
just put in here person all right so
let's run that and we get current person
John sour Tim and Bob it's going to just
look through these people and output
that string okay we can also iterate by
sequence index okay actually let me just
put a comment here that this is for
loops so what we can do here is again
take that people array but we're going
to do for I in range and then in here
we'll pass in the length
okay Len is a function that's going to
give us the length of the array I'm
sorry the list and then we can just do
print that's what I do okay so we'll do
print current person
and then here we're just going to save
people and then the current iteration or
I so let's play that and it gives us the
same exact thing okay so you could do it
either way so we could also just do for
books I mean for I in range and we can
put a start we'll say zero and an end of
ten and then let's just print I okay if
we go ahead and play that we're going to
get zero through nine okay so it's going
to start at zero it's going to go up
until it reaches less than that yeah
less than ten which would be obviously
nine all right so that's a for loop we
can also do a while loop okay so what
I'll do here is set a variable to zero
which will be the count and then we're
going to do a quick while loop here
we'll say wild count is say less than
ten then let's go ahead and print out go
ahead and print count and then whatever
that count value is now if we were to
run it just like this it would be a
never-ending loop because it count is
always going to be zero so what we have
to do is just increment by one so we'll
say count equals count plus one all
right and then we'll run that and you
can see we get count 0 up to count 9 if
we want to tend to be included we can do
less than or equal to 10 and then
that'll actually include 10 all right so
we can also break out of the loop if we
want so let's say right here we'll go if
see what do we want to do if count is
equal to 5 then let's break out so if we
press play now you'll see it only gets
to 5 because once it hits 5 it's going
to break out of the
so that's a while loop so the next thing
I want to talk about is functions so I'm
going to make sure I save this and close
and then we'll say new file functions
dot pi and let me just put up a title
here so with functions just like with
conditionals whitespace indentation is
important so let's do create a function
just a very simple function now we're
going to use the DEF keyword and this
basically is just saying define so let's
define a function called say hello and
down here we'll do what we want the
function to do which will just be print
hello okay now if we were to run this
the way it is now nothing's going to
happen because we only defined it we
didn't call it so let's call it right
here we'll say say hello and press play
and we get hello now we can also add you
can add parameters or arguments to a
function so let's say we want name here
and then we'll just go ahead and add
that here so it'll say hello and then
the name and then down here we'll add in
st. John so if we press play we get
hello John very easy now what if I don't
add an argument here even though it's
supposed to take in a name we're going
to get an error
okay missing one required positional
argument what we can do though is we can
set a default so if we say name equals
John and we run this now we'll get hello
John and of course if we put something
in here that's going to that's going to
override the default and we get hello
Brad one thing you might see with
functions is some quotes here and then
maybe a description will say print hello
to name and that's going to parse just
fine because this is looked at as a doc
string as a comment and it's not
actually going to get parsed now usually
you
to return some kind of value from a
function in this case we're just
printing something out but that's not
usually what you would do so let's go
ahead and return a value so we'll create
a function let's say def and we'll call
it get some and that's going to take in
two parameters num1 and num2 and you
probably guessed it we're going to add
those together so it's a total and
create a variable called total equals
num1 plus num2 and then we simply want
to return the total okay so now down
here what we do is create a variable
let's call it I guess num sum and we'll
set that equal to get some and pass in
let's say one and two and then we could
simply print num sum and let's play that
and we get three alright so what
happened here was we have this variable
here that we set to whatever the return
value of this function is which in this
case is going to be the total of the two
numbers all right so it's pretty easy to
to understand now what I want to do is
just give you an example of how
immutable data is different from mutable
data immutable basically means that it
can't be changed it has to have to be
overwritten not changed with mutable
data that can actually be changed so for
instance a string or an integer these
are immutable you have you can't just
change them in a function okay but
something like a list or a dictionary
those are mutable so those can actually
be changed when ran through a function
now it's a little difficult to to
explain so let me just show you so we're
going to create a function here called
add one to num and that's going to take
in a number and we're going to take that
number and we're just going to set it
equal to num plus one okay and then
we're just going to print right here
and we're going to say value inside
function and then just add on the num
and then we're just going to return and
I can return a value but we're just
going to return from the function and
then down here what we'll do is set a
value called num equal to five and then
we're going to call that add what does
it add one to num and pass in that num
which is a five and then right after it
we're going to print out value outside
function num so let's see what happens
if we run this so value inside function
is six we took the five we put it in
this function we added one to it and
inside here at six because we added the
one however outside it's still five so
basically this did not change this value
here okay it changed it inside here but
not outside of it because this is an
integer is immutable alright and this is
a different scope in the function than
outside now let's do the same thing with
a list and see what happens so if we say
define a function called add one to list
and that's going to take in a variable
called my list I apologize if you can
hear my son yelling upstairs and some
banging and stuff so well but what we're
going to do here is we're going to take
my list and we're going to call the
append function which will just add to
it and we're going to add a four all
right
and then under that we're going to print
same thing we're going to do value
inside function and I'll say my list and
just return and then outside of the
function we're going to create my list
and set that to a list with one two
three
and then we're going to run it through
that function by saying add one to list
my list and then we want to just print
and will save value value outside
Godspell outside function to my list
okay so let's go ahead and run that now
notice that these are the same now my
list before the function was just one
two three it went in we added a four to
it we returned and then when we printed
it outside of the function it was one
two three four okay because that is
mutable we're able to basically change
it inside the function scope and it
reflects out here as well all right so I
have no cool if I actually explain that
correctly but I figured that I would put
that in there just to show you guys that
the difference so hopefully it was
somewhat understandable alright so now
we're going to move on from functions
and make sure this is saved and close
that up and now we're going to talk
about string functions functions that
are used to to do things with strings so
I'm going to create a new file here and
just going to call this string functions
PI all right we're going to put a
comment here okay so first one actually
let's create a variable first we'll just
say my string and we'll set that to
hello world and first one we're going to
look at is capitalized and I bet you
know what that's going to do so let's go
ahead and print my string and then we'll
add dot capitalized go ahead and run
that and what it does is it capitalizes
the first the first words letter okay so
even if this was a lowercase H if we run
this it's going to be uppercase okay so
that's what that does next thing we'll
do is swap case
so let's say print my string dot swap
case and if we press play here we get
hello world which looks a little funny
because the first letters are now
lowercase the other ones are uppercase
so it just switches them okay next one
is to get the length so let's do print
by STR dot actually you know what we're
going to actually wrap this in the Len
function and then we'll say my STR and
that will give us the length which is 11
if I were to add an exclamation at the
end we get 12 all right so next one will
be replaced I really wish it wouldn't
mess with my comments like that
so replaced let's do krint and say my
STR dot replace and then it's going to
take two parameters the thing we want to
replace which will be the word world
to what we want to replace it with which
will be every one so let's go ahead and
play that and we get hello everyone
okay let's also do let's see let's do
count we'll do count so print and
actually right above this I'm going to
create a variable called sum and set it
to one like that and then we're going to
print my STR and another one it
shouldn't be a one it's an L L so my STR
dot count and then we're going to pass
in sub okay so this is the substring we
want to count so let's save that and run
it and we get three because if we look
at the word the string here there's
three L's okay if we were to put in here
h and press play we only get one because
there's only one h okay so that is
so the next thing we're going to look at
is starts with and ends with so we're
going to print let's say my STR STR dot
starts with and let's pass in here the
word hello and see what that gives us
that gives us true because it does it
starts with hello even if we were to put
just an H in here and play that's still
true because it starts with the H if we
put let's say e L play we get false all
right and then we also have ends with so
say my string ends with whoops and if we
run that we get false because it doesn't
end with hello it ends with world and an
exclamation mark and we get true even if
we just use the exclamation we also get
true okay because it goes from the other
end we can also split a string of words
into a list
all right so for that we'll do print my
STR dot split which is a function and
we'll run that and you can see now we
have a list with the two words hello
world if I were to say hello there world
and run now there is also in there has a
value
all right so sometimes you may want to
find the position of a substring for
that we can use the find function so
let's do print
- TR dot find and let's say we want to
find the word world and we'll press play
and we get twelve because if we look up
here it's in the 12th position and we
can search for anything even if it was
the letter e press play and it's going
to give you the first occurrence of the
letter e which is obviously right here
which is the one position because it's
zero based right now we also have index
and index is basically the same as find
except it throws an error if it doesn't
find anything so let's say my STR dot
index and let's say we want to look for
the letter X we can go here - and say X
so if we press play the fine just gives
us back negative one meaning it's not
there the index gives us back this error
so that's the main difference between
those all right we also have functions
to check to see if a string is all
alphanumeric or alphabetic or anything
like that so let's say is all
alphanumeric and we can print and say my
STR dot is al num okay save that you
know what I'm going to do is on I don't
want to keep getting that error so I'm
just going to put in th it alright so
now you can see that we get false
because if we look at it it's not all
alphanumeric okay we have to get rid of
that we have to get rid of the spaces
and then if we press play we get true
okay in addition to that we can do
alphabetic so let's say alphabetics and
the function for that is going to be is
alpha so if we go ahead and press play
we get true because it is all alphabetic
if we put a 1 in there and then we play
we get false
okay there's also is numeric
okay so we'll say print my string dot is
numeric and press play and we get false
okay because obviously it's not all
numeric so that's all I want to do for
now for string functions these are just
some handy things that you might use in
the future
the next thing I want to talk about is
modules okay so in Python we can
basically include certain files in other
files using import okay using the import
keywords so what I'm going to do here is
create a new file and I'm going to call
this modules dot pi okay and then I'm
going to create another file and I'm
going to call this greet dot PI ok so
inside greet we're just going to define
a function here called say hello and
that's going to take in a name and then
we just want it to print out hello and
then the name and then return actually
let's do hello name and then let's do
from the Greek module and we'll save
that then we're going to go to modules
dot PI and from there we want to import
wait a minute yeah from here we want to
say import greet and then we can simply
do greet dot say hello passing a name
we'll say Tim and clay and we get hello
Tim from the greet module actually don't
need this space alright so you can see
that we're now taking we're taking that
greet object here which represents that
module and we're calling a function from
it now we can also actually before we do
that let's create one more function here
and we'll call this one say goodbye
all right so let's go back to modules
now let's say we only want the say
goodbye function we don't want to import
the whole thing so we could do from
greet import say goodbye and then here
we could just do say goodbye
and you'll say Tom C why is this from
greet import say goodbye unresolved in
poor Oh forgot to eat see it even knows
that so now if I run this we get goodbye
tom from the greet module so you can
either import the whole thing and use it
like this or you can import a certain
element and then just use that element
let me just put a comment here so this
will import entire module or import a
specific element and that's it
okay so that's all we're going to do
with modules for now so let's close
those up so now what I want to do is
take a look at working with the file
system okay so we're going to look at
some file functions so let's create a
new file and we're going to call this
file dot PI and what we can do here
first thing I'm going to show you is how
to open a file and I'm going to create a
new file and we're going to call it test
dot txt it's going to be a txt file so
what I want to do is create a variable
whoops in make sure you're in the files
Python file not the test txt and then
we're going to create a variable called
fo set that to open and from here we can
open a file let's say test dot txt and
then the second parameter is going to be
the mode that we want to open it okay so
I'm going to use W which is two right
the file alright now before we actually
write to the file we can actually get
some info how many times am I going to
say actually let's do print let's get it
late guys
print the name of the file and we can
get that with FO dot name so let's go
ahead and run that Python run and it
says name test dot txt another thing we
can do is is see if the file has been
closed or not so print it will say is
closed and we can get that with FL dot
closed okay we run that we get false
because it's not still open and what I
mean by open is in in our script okay we
opened it but we never closed it yet
another thing you can do is tell the
mode that it's in so let's say opening
mode and then we'll do fo dot mode and
we press play and tells you that it's in
writing mode so to write to a file we
can simply do fo after we open it for
writing we can do fo dot write and let's
say I love Python and then we finally
want to close it so fo close all right
so let's save that and let's go ahead
and run it
and we're going to open up go back to
test dot txt and you can see it says I
love Python we wrote to that file from
Python and we could continue to write if
we wanted to say fo dot write and we can
say let's say and JavaScript okay we'll
save that and run it and now if we look
at test we get I love Python and
JavaScript now if we were to open this
again down here so fo dot y fo fo equals
open
test dot txt - right and then we do fo
dot right and we'll say I also like PHP
and then we'll close it fo close okay so
you may think that it's just going to
add this on to the end let's go ahead
and save it and take a look we need to
run it though and then take a look and I
also like PHP replaced everything the
reason for that is we opened it in right
mode and if you want to add on to it you
want to open it in append mode so let's
say a and then it's going to do this
it's going to write these two lines and
then it will append this one so it's
save and we and run it go back and now
you'll see at the end I also like PHP
okay so that's how you can append to a
file
let me just add some comments here okay
this is going to close the file and
let's say open to append okay now we can
also read files in to our script so for
instance let's say fo equals open same
file test text Jesus is freaking banging
up there ask them to be quiet and then
we're going to say our plus and this
will allow us to read from it so I'm
going to create a variable called text
and set that equal to F o dot read and
then let's do a print and actually let's
just print out text press play and we
get what's in the file written out and
we could also limit this we want the
10th the first 10 characters you'll see
it only give us the first 10 characters
now we can also let me just call like
this read from file we can also create a
file from our script
so let me just close it right here so fo
close and then right here we're going to
do fo equals open we'll say test two dot
txt this time and we're going to use the
W plus which is going to create it for
us okay if it's not already created and
then we can write two it will say fo dot
right o semicolon and we'll say this is
my new file then we'll do fo close
alright so let's go ahead and run that
and now if we go over here and refresh
you'll see we have test two dot txt and
it has this is my new file
alright so that's still some ways that
we can manipulate files from Python so
the last thing that I want to look at in
this crash course is classes and
object-oriented programming because
python is a really nice object-oriented
programming language so let's create a
new file and we're going to call this
classes dot PI and we're basically going
to create closing classes and objects
basically going to create a person class
okay so the class person now if you have
experience with PHP or Java or rails or
JavaScript es6 or typescript and you've
probably use classes before and this is
very similar to those languages so if
you know that if you know classes in any
language and use this should look at
least a little bit familiar if not then
what we basically doing here is creating
a class of person so that we can create
person objects in our script now classes
can hold different properties for
instance our person is going to have a
name and an email and then they can also
hold methods which are basically just
functions that belong to that class so
first thing that we're going to define
is going to be the properties which is
going to be name and email so I'm going
to say double underscore name
and that will initially be set to
nothing same thing with email we'll set
that to nothing now the double
underscore here represents private so
we're saying that these two properties
these are private you can't access or
change these from outside of the class
you'll have to go through a function
that we that we describe which will be
called a getter and a setter to actually
get or set these values so let's go
ahead and do that will create a setter
for the name so we'll say def we define
a function just as if we would normally
and we'll say set underscore name okay
so that's going to take in self as well
as the name that's passed into it and
then what we want to do is set self dot
double underscore name equal to the name
that's passed in now self just means
this this object okay or this class and
a lot of languages you'll see the actual
keyword this with Python we're using
self okay so it's saying this property
I'm sorry this this object's name is
going to be equal to whatever name is
passed in when they run set name all
right hopefully that makes sense we're
also going to do a getter so let's say
define get name and that's just going to
take in self and then we all we have to
do here is return self dot double
underscore name okay so that's a getter
and setter for name we're going to do
the same thing for the email so I'm
going to copy this paste that in and
just change this to set email okay
wherever we have name we just want to
replace it with email so that's the set
now for the get
okay so with what we have here we have
enough - what's this arrow right here
okay we have enough to actually create
an object so let's get out of the class
by going back to you know not indenting
here because if we stay in the indent
we're still in the class but what we're
going to do is create a variable called
Brad and we're going to set it to a
person
okay so we're setting this variable Brad
to an object of person now we haven't
added the name and email for Brad yet
because we haven't set it through our
setters so let's do that so we'll say
Brad dot set name and we'll just pass in
a name okay then we'll set the email
brad dot set on the score email and
let's set it to brad at gmail.com okay
so now if we want to print brad brad dot
get email or let's go get name actually
and run that you can see it gets the
name if we want to do get email we can
get the email so you see because these
are private we can't access them
directly we can't say brad dot double
underscore email like that
because it's private okay so this isn't
really ideal to have to set the name and
the email after we instantiate the
object we want to actually pass values
into here when we create it so for that
we're going to need a constructor so up
here we're going to create or we're
going to say def double underscore and
knit double underscore and then pass in
self as well as the properties that we
want to enter so name and email all
right and this this is a constructor
this runs whenever we instantiate the
object like we did here so what we need
to do in here is just say self
dot double underscore name equals name
self dot double underscore email equals
whatever is passed in for the email so
now I'm going to just comment these two
lines out and then we can actually
insert the name here just like that so
now we can say Brad dot get name and we
press play see what I do wrong Brad
equals person passing that in here oh we
need to we need to print it that's right
okay so that gives us the name and we
can get the email we didn't have to set
it like this we set it through the
instantiation all right so that's
basically it as far as classes go a
single class I do want to talk about
inheritance actually one more thing I
want to do is create another function
called two string and for this I just
want to say return and we're going to
use some string formatting here I don't
think I've gone over this yet but
basically we're going to use these curly
braces of the placeholder so we'll say
blank can be contacted at blank and then
we can just do a dot format and then we
can put in here whatever we want to be
filled in here and here so we want this
to be the name so we'll say self dot
double underscore name and then the next
one is going to be the email
so we'll say self dot double underscore
email alright and then down here we're
going to do brad dot two string and we
get Brad Travis e can be contacted at
Brad at gmail.com okay so you can create
as many functions as you want here to do
whatever you'd like
so now we're going to create a new class
called customers and we're going to
actually inherit the person class so let
me just comment this stuff out and we'll
say class customer now to inherit we
just want to put the class we want to
inherit in here so it's going to be
person all right and we want to add an
extra property called balance so double
underscore balance which we'll set to
zero by default all right and then we're
going to create a constructor so def in
it or I'm sorry double underscore in it
double underscore takes in self now this
is going to take in the property here as
well as these two properties so we want
to put name email and balance and then
we need to just set self dot double
underscore name equal to the name that's
passed in we're going to do the same
thing with email and balance so this
will be email this will be balance okay
now we also if we want to use the
constructor from the inherited class we
need to call a function called super and
you may have seen this in other
languages as well but then we need to
put the name of this class which is
customer and self and then we just need
to say dot double underscore knit and
pass in the name and email so we're
basically calling the constructor up
here passing in the name and email now
we also want to add a balance setter and
getter as well so let's say def set
balance and that's going to take himself
and then we're just going to say self
dot double underscore balance is equal
to the balance that's passed in
okay and then for the get balance take
self and then we just need to return
self dot double underscore balance hope
this should actually take in balance as
well okay so there's our setter and
getter for balance now I'm going to
rewrite this to string so I'm going to
copy that paste that in and we're going
to add to this we're going to say blank
add a balance of blank and can be
contacted at blank so balance we want to
put in this middle one here so we're
going to go right after the name and
before the email and say self dot double
underscore balance okay so then that
should display here so let's go down
here now we should be able to
instantiate a new customer so actually
this one will call John and we'll set
equal to customer and then we can pass
in Cara's name we can pass in the email
and we can pass in as balance let's say
a hundred and then let's do a print and
we'll say John dot to string and play
and we get John Doe has a balance of one
hundred and can be contacted at jeido at
gmail.com now if we wanted to change his
balance we could do that with John dot
set balance and let's change it to 400
so now if we were to run that you can
see the balance here has been changed to
400 and you can add as many objects as
you want using this class we could for
instance we could say I don't know kate
equals customer so Kate Smith
email and balance will say five grand
shows a lot and then we'll just do a
print a Kate dot two string and let's
play that and you can see Kate Smith has
a balance of five grand all right so
that's going to be it guys this has gone
about seven or eight minutes over what I
wanted it to I only want it to be an
hour but that's fine you know if we have
to go a little longer to fully explain
things plus my family is pissing me off
upstairs they won't stop yelling so
thanks for watching guys if you're not
subscribed and you like this please do

will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
